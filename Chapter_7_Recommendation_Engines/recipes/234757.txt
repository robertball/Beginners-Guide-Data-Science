Ingredients:
5 fresh bratwurst sausages
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 onions, chopped
4 carrots, sliced
4 ribs celery, chopped
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
2 (32 ounce) cartons chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 teaspoons ground thyme
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 potatoes, cut into cubes
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
12 ounces spinach, coarsely chopped, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill bratwursts until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Cool. Slice each bratwurst into 1/4-inch pieces.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, carrots, and celery in hot oil until onions are tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir garlic into onion mixture and cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 minute.
Stir chicken broth, tomatoes, sliced bratwurst, basil, parsley, thyme, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Mix potatoes into bratwurst mixture, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are almost cooked through, 15 minutes.
Stir beans and spinach into pot; simmer until heated through and potatoes are done, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a hearty, filling, cold-weather soup that makes a meal served with a crusty bread and light salad. The soup is just not the same if the brats are not grilled.
