Ingredients:
1 medium head of cabbage
2 large onions
1 pkg of meatloaf mix ( Beef, veal & pork)
1&1/2 c cooked rice,
salt & pepper, to taste
All spice, about 1 tsp
Garlic powder about 1/2 tsp
Accent (optional) about 1 tsp
2-3 cans tomato soup
Ketchup
2 eggs ( beaten)
2-3 TBSP butter or margarine

Directions:
In a large Saute pain, saute chopped onion, while onion is sauteeing, chop cabbage into about 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 pices, when onions are translucent, add cabbage and saute cabbage with onions.
In a large mixing bowl, combine meat, eggs, cooked rice, and above spices, at this time I check the taste, by taking a small amt of themeat mixture and microwaving it &amp; tasting the meat, if needed I add a little more spice. Saute meat in pan until it is no longer pink.  In a 13 x 9 inch baking dish, cover the bottom w/tomato soup (enough to cover the bottom) then begin layering, cabbage, topped w/ meat mixture, then  more tomato soup, cabbage, then meat then tomato soup, etc until all ingredients are used up  top w/ tomato soup,  add about 1/8 cup of ketchup to top this and a few pieces of butter, add about 1-1/2 cans water.  Bake @ 350 degrees for about 30 minutes
