salt & pepper to taste
1/4 cup flour
enough canola oil to coat bottom of fry pan

To tenderize eye of round steaks: cover meat with plastic wrap and pound using a meat tenderizing hammer (do both sides of meat).
Add oil to large fry pan and heat to medium high.
Salt and pepper the meat. Coat meat with flour. Cook steaks on one side until it weeps (approx 2 minutes). Turn meat over and cook additional 2 minutes or until meat has browned. Remove meat from pan and keep on a warm platter.
To make the gravy, mix 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup of the milk in a small bowl. Stir until all lumps are gone. Add the beef broth to the fry pan and scrape the bottom to loosen bits of meat. Add the milk/flour mixture and the remaining 1/2 cup of milk to the pan. Heat to medium, stirring constantly until mixture comes to a boil. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, gravy should be thickened. Add more milk (1 Tbsp at a time) if gravy is too thick. Pour gravy over each individual steak.
