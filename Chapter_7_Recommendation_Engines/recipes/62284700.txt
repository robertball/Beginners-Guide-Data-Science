Ingredients:
•1 box Birds Eye® Cooked Winter Squash (12 oz), thawed
•3 cups dry pancake and baking mix
•1 Tbsp sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F. In mixing bowl, stir squash and baking mix until a soft dough forms. Place on cutting board or sheet of parchment sprinkled with flour and gently knead three or four times. For biscuits, flatten dough by patting or rolling until dough is about ½-inch thick. Sprinkle with seeds and press gently to help seeds adhere. Cut with 2 or 3-inch biscuit cutter and place on baking sheet, preferably lined with parchment. Combine dough scraps and re-roll for additional biscuits. Bake for 9 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
For breadsticks, roll dough into a 10-inch long rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick. Use a sharp knife to cut dough into 1/8-inch wide strips. Sprinkle with seeds and gently roll into skinny ropes. Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake for 9 minutes or until golden brown. 20 small; 15 large biscuits or 24 breadsticks
