Ingredients:
4 lbs ground beef
1 deep large disposable aluminum roasting pan
4 packages flour tortillas
2 cans fat free refried beans
2 packages of queso fresco
2 large packages of 2% Mexican cheese
1 jar napolitos
2 packages of taco seasoning
1 large cans enchilada sauce
Baking spray like Baker's Magic or Pam Baking

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
Brown the ground beef. Add the taco seasoning. Drain and return to heat. Add in 1/2 a  can of the red enchilada sauce. Reserve the other half for later. Simmer for 5 min. Set aside.
Spray the roasting pan with the baking spray. It has a bit of flour to coat the pan for easy release.
Pull out a stack of tortillas. Cut in half.
Lay in the tortillas to the bottom so you cover the pan. Use the straight side of the half against the length of the roasting pan.  Cut another half to conform to the bottom.
Using a rubber spatula, lay in the refried beans, smoothing them out around the bottom.
Repeat tortilla layer. Slice the Queso Blanco and put it on the layer. Add in shredded cheese.  Criss-cross (see photo) strips of the napolitos across the cheese.
Repeat tortilla layer. Add in the ground beef.
Repeat until you top the pan or you have your last layer of tortilla.  Cover the top with the remaining red enchilada sauce, making sure it covers all of the tortillas,then top with the rest of the shredded cheese.  Criss-cross with napolitos.
Bake for 25-30 min.
Cut out squares of it and serve just as you would lasagna.
