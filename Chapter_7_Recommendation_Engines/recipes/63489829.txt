Ingredients:
2 lbs (36oz) salted dry roasted peanuts
4oz (4 squares) German Sweet Chocolate
12oz package semi sweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups)
2 1/2 lbs white almond bark

Directions:
Place peanuts in the bottom of a 4quart slow cooker. Layer chocolate over peanuts as follows:
1 Germans chocolate
2 chocolate chips
3 almond bark
Set temp om low and cook for 3 hours without stirring.
After 3 hours , stir with wooden spoon until all is mixed together.
Drop candy into cupcake liners and allow to cool completely before removing the liner from the chocolate. If you use the small cupcake liners you get 60-80 pieces of candy.
( I put mine in the freezer for about 5 minutes for them to set faster)
