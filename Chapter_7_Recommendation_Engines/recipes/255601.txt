Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/4 cups shredded zucchini
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup drained and rinsed black beans
6 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
2 eggs
2 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

Directions:
Combine water, quinoa, and olive oil in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir rosemary into the quinoa mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 6 muffin cups.
Mix quinoa mixture, zucchini, mozzarella cheese, black beans, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs, egg whites, and white pepper together in a large bowl. Spoon mixture into each muffin cup and top with remaining Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle and edges are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in the muffin cups.
