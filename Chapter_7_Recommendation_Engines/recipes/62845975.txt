Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (4 ounces each)
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 slices Swiss cheese (I used full fat Borden Hickory Smoked Swiss Cheese)
1 can reduced fat cream of chicken soup, undiluted (I discovered after making the recipe that half a can would be much better)
1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt (original recipe said to use sour cream)
1/2 cup fat free milk
4 Club crackers, crushed
1 teaspoon butter, melted

Directions:
Place chicken in a rectangular baking dish coated with cooking spray.
Sprinkle with the minced onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Top each breast with half of a slice of cheese.
In a small bowl, combine soup, yogurt, and milk; pour over chicken.
Toss cracker crumbs and butter; sprinkle over chicken.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and crumbs are golden
