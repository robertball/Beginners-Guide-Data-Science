Ingredients:
1/4 c. Unsalted butter
1 Tbs. finely minced garlic
2 Tbs. white cooking wine
1/2 c. Heavy whipping cream
2 Tbs. freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 Tbs. fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt the butter in small saucepan on medium heat. Add the garlic and simmer until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add white wine and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until wine just starts to cook off.  Add cream and cook until sauce starts to thicken. Turn off heat. Add lemon juice and parsley and stir to combine well.

Description: 
A creamy, lemony sauce with a hint of garlic; for salmon, rice & vegetables. I serve mine with sautéed asparagus. I say this recipe makes enough for two salmon fillets, as well as the accompanying rice and vegetables, because we like sauce. May be stretched to 4 servings if you don’t go as heavy on the sauce, or are using it only for your fish.
