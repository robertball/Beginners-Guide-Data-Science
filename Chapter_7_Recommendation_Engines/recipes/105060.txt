Ingredients:
1 large yellow bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 large red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 small head cabbage, chopped
1 small head purple cauliflower, chopped
1 small onion, diced
1 cup water
1/2 pound boneless chuck, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 large orange - peeled, sectioned, and cut into large pieces
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 large green onion, chopped
1/3 cup teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce

Directions:
Place the water, bell peppers, cabbage, cauliflower, and onion in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Cover and steam until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  Pound each piece of the chuck to 1/2 inch thick, cut into quarters.  Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in beef, and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides; remove from pan.
Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil into the pan and stir in the orange sections, zest, and green onion.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.  Toss meat and vegetables together with the orange in the pan.  Stir in teriyaki and oyster sauce.  Continue cooking for an additional minute, stirring constantly.

This recipe comes from my food blog, Cucina Bella.  I had an abundance of oranges and wanted to try them out in an exotic stir-fry. It turned out great!
