Ingredients:
Crust:
3 cups Unbleached Flour
1 1/2 Brown Sugar
2 sticks unsalted butter
1 tsp. salt
Topping:
4 cups Salted Mixed Nuts (1 pound 5 oz)
3/4 cup Corn Syrup
3 Tbsp Unsalted Butter
1 1/2 cup Butterscotch chips

Directions:
For Crust-
In mixer, combine all crust ingredients.
Pat into 13x18 ungreased pan.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. (while baking prepare caramel topping)
Top with nuts while warm.
Topping-
In small saucepan, combine all topping ingredients and cook over medium heat.
Cook stirring until the mixture boils. Then boil 2 minutes.
Pour mixture evenly over crust/nuts, as it is thick and will not spread on its own.
Return to oven and bake 10-12 minutes more, until top is golden brown and bubbly.
Remove from oven.
Cool on wire rack for about 1 hour.  Loosen edges and turn pan upside down on waxed
parchment paper.
