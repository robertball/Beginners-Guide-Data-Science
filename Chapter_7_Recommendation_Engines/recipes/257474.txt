Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Spaghetti
1 (24 ounce) jar Barilla® Traditional Sauce
Cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) package mild Italian sausage, casings removed
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of 8 (4- or 5-inch) ramekins with cooking spray.
Heat sauce in a saucepan over medium-low heat.
Place sausage in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir, breaking up sausage into small pieces as it browns and loses its pink color, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Line the bottom of prepared ramekins with a "nest" of cooked spaghetti, making sure the bottom is covered. Divide cooked sausage among the ramekins on top of pasta. Top with about 1/3 cup sauce, ensuring sausage is covered. Sprinkle enough mozzarella on top to cover.
Bake "nests" in preheated oven until cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Allow to sit for five minutes before serving.
