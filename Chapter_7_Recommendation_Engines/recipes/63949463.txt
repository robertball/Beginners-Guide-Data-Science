Description: 
I absolutly LOVE roasted cauliflower, so i came up with this soup one cold day. You dont even need to add any cream to this soup, and you are completely satisfied with the thick creamy texture that the cauliflower adds. Roasting the cauliflower and garlic brings the flavour of it to a whole other level. I serve this soup for lunch or dinner, with a good cheesy bread.
ENJOY :)
