Ingredients:
1 cup fat-free plain yogurt
1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 (2 inch) pieces fresh ginger root, minced
2 tablespoons cilantro, finely chopped
1 tablespoon ground coriander seed
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless salmon fillets

Directions:
Combine the yogurt, cayenne pepper, garlic, ginger, cilantro, ground coriander, cumin, salt and turmeric in a resealable plastic bag.  Close bag and mix everything together until evenly combined. Add the salmon and toss until well coated with the marinade; marinate overnight.
Preheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking pan.
Remove salmon from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade. Place onto prepared baking pan and broil in preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, five to seven minutes per side.
