Ingredients:
1 pound catfish fillets
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Cajun Seasoning
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Thyme Leaves
1/3 cup finely chopped pecans
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon dry breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon McCormick® Gourmet Collection® Parsley Flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Coat a shallow baking pan with nonstick cooking spray; place fish in pan.
Combine oil, Cajun seasoning, lemon juice and thyme in a small bowl. Spoon or brush half the mixture over fish.
Add pecans, Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs and parsley to remaining oil mixture; mix well. Spoon onto fish and spread evenly. Bake 10 to 15 minutes (depending on thickness of fish), or until fish flakes easily with a fork. If desired, garnish with lemon.
