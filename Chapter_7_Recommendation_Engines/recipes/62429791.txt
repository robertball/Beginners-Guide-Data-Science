Ingredients:
8 ounces thick-slice hickory-smoked bacon
1 (8-ounce) strip steak
Famous Dave's Steak seasoning to taste
1 (8ounce) twice-smoked sausage link
2 TB bacon drippings
1 C chopped onion
1/3 C chopped green bell pepper
1 TB diced jalapeno
2 (28-ounce) cans Bush's Baked Beans (original)
1 (20-ounce) bottle Famous Dave's BBQ sauce

Directions:
Fry bacon in a skillet until crisp. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of the drippings. Crumble the bacon.
Sprinkle steak with steak seasoning. Grill over hot coals until medium. Cut into 1/2 inch cubes.
Grill sausage until nice and charred. Slice the sausage lengthwise into halves; slice into quarters. Cut the quarters into 1/2 inch cubes.
Saute onion, green pepper and jalapeno in reserved bacon dripping in a skillet just until onion is tender-crisp.
Stir in bacon, steak, sausage, beans and sauce.
Simmer over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
The flavor is enhanced if stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 8 to 10 hours and reheated just before serving. To resmoke sausage, smoke over hickory chips at 175 degrees for 2 hours. Grill over hot coals for additional flavor.
