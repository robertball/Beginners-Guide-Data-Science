Description: 
This easy shrimp salad contains no lettuce. It's perfect for barbeques or as a 'change of pace' dinner side dish. Customize this recipe with your favorite salad dressing in place of the lime juice. The lime gives it a tiny tangy kick.Modified from: Avocado-Lime Shrimp Salad (Ensalada de Camarones con Aguacate y Limon)
