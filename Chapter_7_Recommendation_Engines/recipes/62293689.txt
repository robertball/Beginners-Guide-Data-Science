Ingredients:
2 Tbs. vegetable oil
2 medium yellow onions, chopped
3 medium cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
1-1/2 tsp. chipoltle powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
Freshly ground black pepper
1 quart lower-salt chicken broth or homemade vegetable broth
Four 15.5-oz. or two 29-oz. cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into medium dice
Kosher salt
14 oz can diced tomatoes with mex seasoning
1/2 cup plain yogurt
8 paper-thin lime slices

Directions:
Heat the oil over medium heat in a 6-quart (or larger) Dutch oven. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften and brown slightly, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander, cumin, aniseed, and 1/4 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the broth, beans, sweet potatoes, and 3/4 tsp. salt and bring to a boil over high heat; skim any foam as necessary. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, set aside 3 cups of the beans and potatoes. Puree the remaining soup in batches in a blender. Return the solids to the soup and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve topped with a dollop of the yogurt and a lime slice.
You can store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
