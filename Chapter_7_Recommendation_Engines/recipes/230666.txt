Description: 
My boys always begged for this chicken. It literally falls off the bones and the sauce gives a rich flavor to the rice.  Made with pantry staples, it's easy to throw together, too! Use low-sodium soy sauce if you're sensitive to salt. My family prefers chicken thighs but any pieces will work. Skin the chicken pieces if preferred. A zesty Italian dressing works best.
