Ingredients:
1 cup oil for frying
1 (4 ounce) whole tilapia, cleaned and scaled
salt to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, thinly sliced crosswise, or to taste
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup distilled white vinegar
5 tablespoons white sugar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pat tilapia dry with a paper towel. Cut 2 to 3 slits on either side of the fish. Sprinkle salt on top. Fry in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes per side.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and ginger; saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Mix water, vinegar, and sugar together in a bowl. Pour into the onion mixture in the skillet. Cover and bring to a boil. Cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add cornstarch. Boil, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over the fish.
