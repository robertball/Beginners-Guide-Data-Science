1 stick (1/2 cup) butter, softened
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt

Topping: 1/4 cup granulated sugar

Directions:
Heat oven to 350Â°F. Have ungreased cookie sheet(s) ready.
Beat together all ingredients except flour and topping in a large bowl until well blended.
On low speed, beat in flour just until blended (dough will be firm).
Form into 1-inch balls; roll in topping sugar. Place 1 inch apart on cookie sheet.
Bake 8-9 minutes until puffy and cracked on top. Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store airtight at room temperature for up to a week.
