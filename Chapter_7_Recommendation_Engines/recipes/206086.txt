1 cup milk
1 1/4 cups rice flour
1/4 cup white sugar

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine the rice, milk, rice flour, sugar, applesauce, baking powder, and oil together in a bowl; blend with an electric hand mixer for 2 minutes.

Description: 
This pancake recipe was created for my family members with multiple food allergies. This tasty breakfast item uses applesauce instead of egg and rice instead of wheat. A moist and yummy option for those with limited food choices. Serve with your favorite topping.
