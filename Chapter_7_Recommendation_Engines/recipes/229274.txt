Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Arrange apple slices evenly in prepared baking dish. Sift flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal; sprinkle over apples.
Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
I adapted this from a 50-year-old peach crisp recipe. Although it works well with peaches, it works even better with fresh, crisp cooking apples.
