Ingredients:
1 (12 oz.) bag fresh cranberries, rinsed and drained
3 cups water
2 cups sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
1 Tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and add cranberries and sugar.  Gently boil for 10 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.
Place a course sieve over a 13x9 inch pan that is freezer-safe.  Pour cranberry mixture into coarse sieve, letting the juice drain into the pan.  Press down on cranberries to get all of the juice out.  Discard the cranberries.
Stir the orange and lemon juices into the cranberry juice in the pan and freeze overnight.
Cut into squares and serve.
