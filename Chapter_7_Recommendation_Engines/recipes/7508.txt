Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package angel food cake mix
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 pints fresh strawberries, halved

Directions:
Bake cake for filling according to package directions.  Let cool.
Slice angel food cake in half horizontally. Creat a tunnel for the filling by removing a small amount of the interior of the bottom half of the cake.
In a bowl combine cream, confectioners' sugar and cocoa; whip until soft peaks form.  Fold half the strawberries into half the whipped cream; spoon into cake tunnel, pressing down firmly.
Replace top of cake; pressing gently.  Frost cake with remaining cream mixture.  Cover top of cake with remaining strawberries.  Chill about 15 minutes before slicing.  Serves 10-12 people.
