Ingredients:
graham cracker crust (9 inch) 1 1
2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1
3 cup melted butter 1
4 cup sugar 6 ozs chocolate chip  1 whole eggs 2 eggs (separated) 2 cups cool whip

Directions:
1 For Crust: Mix together, graham cracker crumbs, butter, and sugar press in to 9" pan and bake at 350 for 8 minutes.
2 Prepare crust and cool. In double boiler, over hot (not boiling) water, melt chocolate chips. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Or, use microwave on medium heat at 1 minute intervals. Stir often - remember, the chips will continue to melt when removed so don't over cook! Don't forget to cool this mixture or you will cook your eggs in the next step!
3 Using a beater, beat in egg and egg yolks one at a time.
4 In a small bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Fold this into the chocolate mixture.
5 With a wire whisk, gently fold in 2 cups of Cool Whip into above mixture.
6 Pour into cooled crust and chill until set, about an hour.
