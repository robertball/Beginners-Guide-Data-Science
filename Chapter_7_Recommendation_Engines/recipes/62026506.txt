2 egg whites

3 cups sifted confectionerâ€™s sugar

Directions:
Beat egg whites slightly in a medium-size bowl. Beat in cream of tartar, then slowly beat in sugar and flavoring until frosting is stiff enough to hold firm peaks.
Color with food coloring. Use a pastry bag to pipe onto cookies or thin out by adding a little water until frosting is thin enough to pour from a spoon and spread on cookies. Leave cookies uncovered several hours to dry.
