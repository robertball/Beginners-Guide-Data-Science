Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the margarine, flour, and cream cheese until well blended. Cover and chill for about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Flatten each ball in the palms of your hands to 1/4 inch thickness. Place a small amount of apricot preserves into the center, then fold the circle in half, and pinch the edges to seal. If the edges are not sealed, the preserves will leak out. Place filled cookies onto a greased baking sheet.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove from oven. While cookies are still warm, toss them with confectioners' sugar to coat. Toss them with sugar again when cool, just before serving.
