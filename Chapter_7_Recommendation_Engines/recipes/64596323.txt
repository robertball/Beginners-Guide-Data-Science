Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS
Makes 8
16 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoons garlic powder
¼ cup chives, chopped
1 cup provolone cheese, shredded
4 strips cooked bacon, crumbled
8 boneless pork chops
Salt
Pepper
2 cups flour
3 eggs, beaten
2 cups Panko breadcrumbs
4 tablespoons canola oil
PREPARATION
Preheat oven to 350°F.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, pepper, garlic powder, chives, provolone, and bacon, stirring until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.
Season all sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper. Carefully cut a pocket through the side of the pork chop in order to create a cavity. Stuff the cavity with a generous spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and press around the edges of the pork to seal it in. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.
Dip the stuffed pork chops in the flour, shaking off excess, then the egg, then the breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.
Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the pork chops for about one to two minutes, then flip. Remove from heat and bake for 15-20 minutes, until cheese is bubbly starting to brown. Serve!
