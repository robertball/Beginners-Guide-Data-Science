Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon canola oil, or as needed, divided
1 pound ground beef (85% lean)
1 onion, chopped
1 (30 ounce) package frozen hash browns
1/2 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 tablespoons minced garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat 1/4 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and onions; saute until beef is mostly browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain 90% of the fat.
Cut open the bag of hash browns; microwave until mostly defrosted, about 4 minutes.
Heat butter and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add hash browns to the beef-onion mixture. Cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until hash browns are crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread Cheddar cheese evenly over the hash browns and let melt.
