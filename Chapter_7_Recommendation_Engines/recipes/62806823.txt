Ingredients:
- 1 pound lean beef (98% fat free)
-Low Sodium Taco Seasoning
- 4 tbsp green chiles (1-2 cans depending on size)
-1.5 cup onion cupped
-2 cup chopped tomatoes
-1 package of Mi Mama Low-Carb Wheat Tortillas (8 per pack)
-2 egg whites
-1 Can Enchilada sauce
-1 & 1/3 cups 2% shredded mexican cheese

Directions:
Brown beef and drain excess grease and return to pan.
Add chopped onions until onions tender. Add packet of taco seasoning. Can add additional spices if you like it hotter. Mix in spices and add diced tomatoes and green chiles. Stir and let simmer for a few minutes.
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray large baking dish. Beat 2 egg whites in a small dish. With a pastry brush or spoon coat the inside of the tortillas lightly (this will help the roll stay tigher when they cook). In the tortillas place a small pinch of cheese then put roughly 2-3 tablespoons of the beef mixture. Add an additional pinch of cheese and close the enchiladas in a roll. Repeat the process until all 8 tortillas are filled. If you have any left over egg you can coat the top of the tortillas to keep things together.
Lightly spoon enchilada sauce on top of the tortillas until covered sufficently. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of rolls.
Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.
