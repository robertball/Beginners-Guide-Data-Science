Description: 
What's called jelly in America is called jam in England, and the English call the American's gelatin, jelly!  But, any way you slice it -- spread some fruit preserves over cake, top with a gelled fruity confection, sweetened, stovetop-thickened milk, and whipped cream -- and you've got trifle!
