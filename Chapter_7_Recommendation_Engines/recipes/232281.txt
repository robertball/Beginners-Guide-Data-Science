Description: 
An excellent winter dish with seasonal squash. The savory sage and the sweetness of the squash, mixed with a bite of pepper, is perfect on a chilly night. Using fresh ingredients that are in season is the best way to cook and eat. The skin of the chicken is important for cooking the rice. The sage is only natural to go with the squash.
