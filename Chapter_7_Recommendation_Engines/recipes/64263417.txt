Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package of Fresh Strawberries
1 (5 ounce) package of Fresh Blueberries
2 Gala Apples
2 Granny Smith Apples
1 Small Water Melon
2 Tablespoon of Honey
1 Cup of Water
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme

Directions:
Using an electric mixer, blend cream cheese and marshmallow creme until mixed thoroughly. Set aside.
Rinse all fruit. Cut apples into thin crescent shape slices and immediately place into honey bath (see below). Cut off green tops of strawberries, cut strawberries in half forming two triangle shapes from each strawberry. Combined strawberries and whole rinse blueberries together in their own honey bath and set aside. Cut watermelon in half and create dozens of small balls using melon baller, place in honey bath and set aside.
In separate bowl, mix 1 Tablespoon of Honey with 1/2 Cup of Water. One type of fruit at a time, mix fruit around for a minute or two and then drain off the honey/water solution and serving or storing in a airtight container until ready to serve. You can re-use the water for a few fruits, but discard the water when finished.
When ready to serve, arrange fruit separately around cupped fruit dip on platter and serve.
