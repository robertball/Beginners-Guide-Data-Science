Ingredients:
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup water
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
6 small tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place whole unpeeled head of garlic in an oven-safe dish with 1/4 cup water and drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil on garlic. Roast in preheated oven for about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, put tomatoes in a blender and blend until pureed. Add bell peppers and blend until pureed.
Break roasted cloves of garlic and squeeze 5 cloves into blender; blend in garlic. Add 4 tablespoons olive oil and blend briefly. Add salt and pepper to taste, dried red pepper flakes and basil; blend.
The sauce is ready, but can either be refrigerated for a couple of days to blend the flavors or can be frozen.  Sauce can be served cold or heated up until just warm.

Description: 
This was a recipe that I created one summer afternoon when I had a big crop of tomatoes from my garden. It is wonderful on pasta with a sprinkle of Romano cheese.
