Greek Rice Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked long grain brown rice
2 1/2 cups water
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 vine-ripened tomatoes, diced
1 1/2 cups diced English cucumbers
1/3 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup sliced Kalamata olives
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes; remove from heat and allow to cool, fluffing occasionally with a fork.
Toss the avocado and lemon juice together in a large bowl. Add the tomatoes, cucumber, onion, feta, olives, mint, olive oil, lemon zest, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl; lightly toss the mixture until evenly combined. Fold the cooled rice gently into the mixture. Serve immediately or chill up to 1 hour; the salad does not last well for more than a day as the tomato and cucumber begin to release their juices and the salad becomes watery.

Description: 
Delicious. The avocado makes the dressing a little creamy, though feel free to leave it out if you wish. Best made the same day you are going to serve it.
