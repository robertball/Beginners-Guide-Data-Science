Ingredients:
3 pounds of ground beef (80/20)
2 large eggs
2 cups of Progresso dried bread crumbs
1 yellow sweet onion, chopped fine
1 green pepper, chopped fine
dash of salt & pepper
1 tablespoon oregano
1 tablespoon of powdered garlic
2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 1/2 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce (or A1)
1 cup ketchup
3/4 package of premium bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, using your hands, thoroughly mix all ingredients except bacon and 1/4 cup of ketchup.
Continue to use your hands to form the loaf into a large ball.
Press the large ball mixture into a large meatloaf pan (or baking pan) and push down from the center, kneading outward, to form a rectangular loaf.  Be sure to leave about 1 to 2 inches on all sides of the meatloaf for draining grease.
Add the 1/4 cup of ketchup to the top of the meatloaf and spread evenly.
Add bacon to top of meatloaf weaving and/or placing the bacon to cover the top.
Salt and pepper generously to cover the top of meatloaf.
Cover entire top with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.  Remove foil and drain grease from the pan.
Put back in oven for another 45 minutes.
Change your oven to broil to sear/crisp the bacon on top for 3 to 5 minutes.
Take meatloaf out of oven and immediately drain remaining grease.
Cover with foil and let sit for 25 minutes before eating to give the meatloaf time to sit.
