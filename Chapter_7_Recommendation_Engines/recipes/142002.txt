Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 slices smoked bacon, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
ground black pepper to taste
3 cups tomato puree
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
5 ounces fresh Buffalo mozzarella

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain, and cool.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Cook the bacon, onion, and garlic until bacon starts to crisp and onion and garlic have softened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and drain.
Mix the bread crumbs, cream cheese, parsley, and the bacon mixture in a large bowl; season with pepper to taste.
Pour the tomato puree into a large, shallow casserole dish; stir in the rosemary.
Spoon the bacon and breadcrumb mixture equally into the pasta shells. Arrange the stuffed shells in the casserole dish. Coarsely chop the mozzarella and scatter over the pasta shells. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce bubbles, about 30 minutes.
