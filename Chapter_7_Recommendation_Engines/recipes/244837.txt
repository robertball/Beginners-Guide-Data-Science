Ingredients:
2 tablespoons slivered almonds
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups broccoli florets
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/4 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup Swanson® Chicken Broth
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon lemon zest

Directions:
Toast the almonds in a 4-quart saucepot over medium-high heat until lightly browned. Remove the almonds from the pot and set aside.
In the same saucepot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, broccoli and crushed red pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the wine and broth to the saucepot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring to scrape up any brown bits from the pot. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 3 minutes or until the broccoli is tender-crisp.
Stir in the Parmesan cheese and cook for 2 minutes or until the broccoli is tender. Stir in the lemon zest and sprinkle with the toasted almonds.
