Ingredients:
1.25 cups short grain rice
1 cup provolone cheese, in one inch cubes
3 tbsp olive oil
1 yellow onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup fresh basil
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tbsp dried thyme
22 ounces tomato passata
1 tsp course ground black pepper
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
1 cup low sodium vegetable broth
1 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano
1/2 bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Mix the Parmigiano Reggiano and the bread crumbs together in a bowl. Set aside.
In a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil. Sauté the onion until tender and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic, tomato passata, peas, broth, basil, oregano, and thyme. Stir and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the rice, mix well. Cover and Simmer for 18 minutes, stirring occasionally, add a bit of water if necessary to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom.
Turn off the heat. Gently stir in the provolone cheese cubes. Sprinkle the bread crumbs mixture on top. Cook in the oven, uncovering, for about 15 minutes or until bubbly and browned on top.
Allow to rest, uncovered, for 5 minutes before serving.
