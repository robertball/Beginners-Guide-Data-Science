Ingredients:
1#  Tri Colored Rotini pasta
3/4 cup sliced green stuffed olives
1 small red onion, diced
1/2 jar roasted red peppers, diced (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup sliced pepperocini rings (optional)
1 jar (small) marinated artichoke hearts, drained and  chopped
1/4#  ( or less) salami, diced into small pieces (can use pepperoni if you prefer)
1 cup mozzarella cheese, cubed into small cubes (or Monterey Jack)
1 small can sliced black olives
1/3 cup Italian dressing (I use Newmanâ€™s Own)
4 Tbsp. Mayo (Best Foods) not miracle whip
1/2  cup shredded Parmesan or Romano cheese (not grated).
Seasoned salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste.
1 tsp. Italian Seasoning

Directions:
Cook pasta in salted boiling water about 10 min until al dente. Drain and run cold water over to cool.  Drain and put into large bowl.  Add olives, pepperocini,  onions, peppers, artichoke hearts, salami and mozzarella cheese, and seasonings.  Combine Italian dressing and mayo, mix well and pour over pasta mixture.  Add shredded parmesan or Romano cheese.  Mix entire salad well.  Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.  At serving time if pasta seems a little dry, drizzle with some olive oil and mix again.  Serves 6 to 8.

This is my takeoff on several different pasta salads I have tried.  It's my daughter's favorite and I have taken it to several picnics and BBQ;S and it's always a bit hit.
