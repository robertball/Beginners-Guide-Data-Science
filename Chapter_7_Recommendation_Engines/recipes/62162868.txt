Dressing:
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 Tbsp. seasoned rice vinegar
1 Tbsp. reserved lychee juice
1 Tbsp. honey
1 Tbsp. toasted sesame seeds
2 tsp. soy sauce
1 tsp. finely grated ginger root
1/2 tsp. finely minced garlic
1/4 tsp. sesame oil

Directions:
Slice each lychee fruit in half.  In a large bowl toss the spinach, lychee, pine nuts and bacon bits.
Combine all dressing ingredients in a tightly lidded container and shake vigorously.  Toss with salad and serve immediately.  Or alternatively, arrange salad ingredients on individual salad plates and pass the dressing at the table.

I was inspired to create this recipe as an accompaniment to Asian inspired meals.  Exotic lychee fruit is combined with healthy spinach and a toasted sesame vinaigrette dressing.  Be sure to save a few lychees and juice for a lychee martini to enjoy with your meal!
