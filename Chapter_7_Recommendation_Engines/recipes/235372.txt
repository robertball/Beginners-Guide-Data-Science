Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in melted butter until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork and continue to cook for 2 minutes more.

Description: 
A great way to use up leftovers, hash is a fast and simple meal. This recipe uses pulled pork from pork shoulders I cooked on my WeberÂ® Smokey Mountain last weekend. It's great for a quick dinner or relaxed breakfast. The secret to crispy hash is using precooked potatoes. Goes great with biscuits, too.
