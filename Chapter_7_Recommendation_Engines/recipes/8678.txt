Ingredients:
¼ cup pine nuts
¼ cup butter
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
1  onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 (14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
1 ½ teaspoons paprika
¼ teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 teaspoons cornstarch
¼ cup cold water

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add pine nuts, and cook stirring frequently, until evenly toasted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, and cook 5 to 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
Stir onion and garlic into the skillet, and cook until tender. Stir in the pine nuts, soy sauce, and coconut milk. Season with paprika, cumin, and curry powder.
In a small bowl, blend the cornstarch and water. Mix into the skillet. Stir constantly until a thick gravy has formed.
