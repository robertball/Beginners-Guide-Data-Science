Ingredients:
11/2 cups (5 oz) sweetened flaked coconut
11/2 cups (6 oz) chopped pecans
1/2 cup firmly packed light-brown sugar
1/2 stick (4 Tbsp) butter, melted
1 box (21 oz) Family-Style Chewy Fudge Brownies mix
2 cups heavy (whipping) cream
1/3 cup confectioners’ sugar

Directions:
Heat oven to 350ºF. Line a 15 x 10-in. rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty foil, letting foil extend above pan on both ends. Coat foil with nonstick spray.
Mix coconut, pecans, brown sugar and butter in a bowl until well blended; set aside.
Prepare brownie mix as package directs for cake-like brownies. Pour batter into prepared pan, spreading evenly. Top with coconut mixture.
Bake 25 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
Lift foil by ends onto a cutting board. Cut brownie crosswise in thirds. Beat cream and confectioners’ sugar in a large bowl with mixer on medium-high speed until moist, stiff peaks form when beaters are lifted.
To assemble: Place 1 brownie layer, nut side up, on a serving platter. Spread top with 1 cup whipped cream. Repeat with remaining layers and cream, ending with cake. Frost sides with remaining cream. Refrigerate at least 2 hours.
To serve: Cut with a serrated knife in 1-in. slices; cut each slice in half.
Planning Tip: Can be made through Step 6 up to 1 day ahead.
