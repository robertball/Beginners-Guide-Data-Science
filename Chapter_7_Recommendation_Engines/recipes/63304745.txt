Multi grain Pizza Dough Bread Machine Recipe Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 c water (hot tap) (80-100Â°F)
1/2 tsp sea salt
1 Tbsp. honey
1 1/2 Tbsp. olive oil
1/2 c flax seed (may use 1/4 flax seed, 1/4 crushed walnuts)
2 c all-purpose flour
2 c wheat flour
1 3/4 tsp active dry yeast

Directions:
It's best to follow manufacturers instructions for making pizza dough.
What I do is mix my dry ingredients in a bowl first, EXCEPT for the yeast.  Then I put my wet ingredients into the bread pan, add the dry ingredients, then make a small indention in the flour for the yeast.  Make sure yeast does not touch the water.
Select DOUGH ONLY cycle.  I like to check my dough after the first 10 minutes of mixing, just to make sure all the dry ingredients are getting incorporated.  If necessary you can use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides of the pan to release any flour that is hanging to the sides.
Once your bread machine signals that the dough cycle is complete (which is typically 90 minutes), roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to the size and thickness you desire.
