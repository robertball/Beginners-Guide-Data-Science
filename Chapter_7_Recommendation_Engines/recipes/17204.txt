Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package Cheddar cheese
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 cup bread crumbs
2 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Cut the block of cheese lengthwise in half (to make thinner pieces) and then into squares or triangles.
Mix eggs and milk in small bowl. Dip the cheese pieces into this mixture. Coat moistened cheese thoroughly with bread crumbs. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes to firm up the breaded cheese.
Heat oil in shallow pan to a medium-high temperature. Make sure the oil is only 1/2 way up the cheese squares. Pan fry the squares until they are lightly browned. Flip them only once. Drain on paper towels.
