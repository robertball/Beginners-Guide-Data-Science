Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 large apple - peeled, cored, and chopped into 20 chunks
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 stick butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Mix white sugar and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Add apple chunks and stir to coat thoroughly. Set aside.
Divide dough into 20 pieces. Wrap 1 piece of dough around a coated apple chunk and pinch to seal shut. Dip in melted butter, then roll in brown sugar. Arrange balls of dough in even circles in the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Carefully invert pan onto a large plate so caramel mixture runs over each piece. Cool briefly before serving.
