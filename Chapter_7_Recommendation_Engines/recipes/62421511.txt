Ingredients:
6 eggs, hardboiled
1/2 pound cooked bacon
1 bag spinach, rinsed
1/4 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced
2.5 oz croutons
1 onion, chopped
2/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard

Directions:
Hard boil the eggs. When cool, slice or chop them and set aside.
Cook the bacon according to package instructions. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Prepare the dressing in a blender or food processor by combining the onion, sugar, salt, oil, vinegar, pepper, celery seed and Dijon mustard. Blend until smooth.
In a large salad bowl, combine the eggs, bacon, spinach, mushrooms and croutons.
Toss to mix. Pour enough dressing over salad to lightly coat. Toss and serve.
Notes: If preparing the night before, I prefer holding out the eggs and croutons until just before serving.  (So the eggs don't get rubbery and the croutons don't get mushy) I slice or chop the eggs just before adding them. Add the salad dressing just before serving as well.  Rarely do I need all of the salad dressing.  Experiment with differently seasoned Croutons!
