Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) bottles Holland HouseÂ® Red Cooking Wine
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons table salt*
1 teaspoon fresh-ground pepper
4 (8 ounce) center cut pork chops, 3/4 inch thick
ancho chile powder** (optional)

Directions:
To make our brine flavor infusion, pour about 2/3 cup cooking wine into a glass. Stir in rosemary and garlic. Microwave on high 1 minute. Cool to room temperature--at least 30 minutes, stirring once or twice. (Or place glass in an ice water bath to chill faster; stir occasionally.)
Meanwhile, pour remaining Holland House cooking wine into a non-metallic container or bowl that is wide and deep enough to hold the 4 chops. Add sugar, salt and pepper; stir until sugar and salt are dissolved. Stir in the cooled flavor infusion.
Place pork chops in brine so they are completely submerged. Cover and refrigerate 18 to 24 hours, turning chops at least once.
Preheat grill to medium-low heat, 325-350 degrees F. Arrange coals to grill chops over indirect heat. Drain chops and discard brine. If desired, rub both sides of chops with ancho chile powder. Grill 10 minutes; turn and grill 4-6 minutes more or until internal temperature is 140 degrees F. Remove, cover with foil and let rest 5 minutes before serving.

Holland House
Description: 
Center-cut pork chops are so lean that grilling can make them dry. Brining with Holland House cooking wine changes that, infusing the pork with moisture and a rich, red wine flavor.
