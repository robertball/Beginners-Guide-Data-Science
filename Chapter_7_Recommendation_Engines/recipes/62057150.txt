Ingredients:
6 good-sized potatoes, scrubbed clean and cut into just larger than bite-sized pieces
1 10-oz. can cream of celery soup
2/3 of that can of milk
1 onion, chopped fine
3/4 lb. of White American Cheese
salt and pepper to taste
paprika (mostly for color)
OPTIONAL ADD INs:
Add any one of the following, or combine some, to make the dish an all in one meal!  :o)
- cooked ham, cubed (I buy them at the salad bar already cooked and cubed -- it's a real time saver and inexpensive)
- left-over cooked sausage, cut into bite size pieces
- crumbled, cooked bacon
- broccoli florets

Directions:
Combine soup, milk, onion, cheese, salt and pepper.  Put potatoes in  crock pot and pour soup mixture over potatoes.  Stir to coat all potatoe pieces.  Sprinkle top with paprika (optional).  Cover and cook on HIGH 4-5 hours; or LOW for 6-8 hours.

Description: 
Similar to scalloped potatoes, but ... well, different.  I searched your sight and didn't find anything with my ingredients, although there were slow-cooker dishes with potatoes in it.  Hope you like it.  I got this recipe from an elderly neighbor when my husband and I lived in Baltimore, MD.  It's entirely her creation.  Hence the name Helen's Crock Pot Potatoes.  I've taken this dish to family affairs, church pot-lucks, and picnics.  I always have an empty crock pot to bring home.
