Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) fillets red snapper
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon dried thyme
4 large mushrooms, cleaned and diced
1 tablespoon butter
1 lemon, juiced
4 medium tomatoes
2 cloves crushed garlic
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
4 sprigs fresh thyme
4 tablespoons white wine
1 egg white, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Clean the filets, brush with oil and sprinkle with thyme. Refrigerate.
In a saucepan, cook and stir the mushrooms in butter. Cook until all the moisture has evaporated.  Sprinkle the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Remove the mushrooms from the saucepan into a small bowl.
Peel and seed the tomato. In a small saucepan, cook and stir the tomatoes with garlic. Cook and stir until soft and season with salt and pepper.
Place the red snapper filets in a large frying pan, over medium-low heat. Fry the filets until they are opaque.
Place each filet onto a piece of parchment paper. Spoon the vegetables on top of the fish, and place one sprig of thyme into each fish filet packet. Drizzle wine over the vegetables and close the parchment paper, seal the package by painting the edges with beaten egg white.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the package of parchment paper puffs up. Serve hot.
