1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

ORANGE SPREAD:

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients.  In another bowl, beat egg, sour cream, butter, orange juice and peel.  Stir in dry ingredients just until moistened.  Fill  paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.  Combine spread ingredients in a small mixing bowl; beat until smooth.  Serve with muffins.
