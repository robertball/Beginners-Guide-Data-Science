Image:

Ingredients:
6 medium tomatoes
Olive oil
1 fresh red or green jalapeno pepper
1/2 Cup diced Spanish onion
2 cloves garlic
2 Tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 Tablespoons fresh lime juice (or vinegar)
2 teaspoons salt
1-1/2 teaspoons mesquite-flavored liquid smoke (optional)

Directions:
Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Remove stems from the tomatoes, then rub oil over each tomato. Put the tomatoes in the skillet, turning them every now and then. After about 5 minutes, add all the jalapeno to the skillet. Continue to turn the tomatoes and pepper periodically. When almost the entire surface of the pepper has charred black, (about 10-12 minutes) remove them from the heat. The tomatoes will turn partially black. When the skin begins to come off they are done. Put the pepper and tomatoes on a platter and let them cool. When the tomatoes and pepper are cool enough to handle, remove most of the skin from the tomatoes and place them into a food processor. Place jalapeno into the food processor, including the stem ends. Discard the liquid remaining on the platter. Add remaining ingredients to the food processor and puree on high speed for 5 to 10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency. Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or overnight so that the flavors develop.

Description: 
Here's a salsa with a little kicked up flavor. The fire roasting of the tomatoes and peppers gives a smoked, outdoors taste. Give it a try, I think you'll like it. Please note the total time includes chilling. This salsa is also very good at room temp.
