Ingredients:
1 small mild onion, finely diced
1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced
1 small carrot, shredded
1 small summer squash, shredded
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1 egg, beaten
1 T. Allegro Marinade (or Soy Sauce)
2 packages of ground turkey (20 ounces each)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute first 5 ingredients over medium heat (I used Pam cooking spray but you could use oil) until soft (5-10 minutes depending on heat).
Place all of the ground turkey in a large mixing bowl. Add the sauted vegetables, the egg, the Allegro and a little salt and pepper if desired and mix well.
Divide mixture and shape into 8-10 large patties. They will be very soft.
Pan fry over medium heat for approximately 10 minutes per side. DON'T try to turn them too early or they may fall apart and avoid squashing them with the spatula so they remain moist. Internal temp. should be 170 degrees.
Serve on buns or enjoy with a salad!

Description: 
I found a Rachel Ray recipe called Harvest Turkey Burgers that sounded good but I didn't have all of the ingredients. I substituted and changed things and the resulting burgers were better than I could have imagined. Juicy and delicious. The prep is a little longer than for most turkey burgers but so worth it.
