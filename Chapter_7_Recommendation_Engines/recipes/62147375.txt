Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1 small onion, chopped
1 (15oz) can kidney beans, drained
1 (15oz) can black beans, drained
1 (15oz) can chili beans, drained
1 (14.5oz) can chopped fire-roasted tomatoes
1 (4oz) can mild green chilis, drained
1 (10.75oz) can condensed tomato soup
6 pieces bacon, cooked and crumbled (optional)
2 cups IPA (I used Stone IPA, but any good, hoppy beer will work)
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tbsp crushed red pepper
1 tbsp chili powder
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp black pepper
salt to taste
1 tbsp vegetable oil (or bacon fat if adding bacon)

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil (or bacon fat) in frying pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and turkey. Cook until turkey is browned and onion is slightly soft (breaking up the turkey into small pieces while stirring)
Add all canned ingredients, turkey mixture, bacon, beer, cilantro and spices to a 3.5 quart slow cooker and stir well.
Cover and cook on low setting for 8 hours, removing the lid for the last hour to allow chili to thicken.
Top with your favorite chili toppings (sour cream, cheese, green onions, cilantro, etc.) and serve with a glass of your favorite IPA.

Description: 
I am a huge beer fan and like finding new ways to cook with it. I created this recipe that combines the comfort of chili with the hoppiness if a good IPA. If you like craft beer and you like chili, this recipe is for you.
