Ingredients:
¼ cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic
½ tsp hot red pepper flakes
Sea salt
1-28 oz can diced tomatoes
1 lb dry penne pasta
2 tbsp vodka
1 cup cream
¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
4 grilled, seasoned chicken breast

Directions:
In a skillet, large enough to hold the pasta later on, combine oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and a pinch of salt.  Stirring to coat with the oil, cook over moderate heat just until the garlic starts to turn golden brown (this happens quickly).  Add tomatoes and simmer about 15 minutes.  Meanwhile cook pasta until tender, but firm (dente).  Drain.  Add pasta to the tomato sauce.  Add vodka, toss again, add cream.  Cover and reduce to low to let the pasta absorb the sauce.  Stir in parsley.
