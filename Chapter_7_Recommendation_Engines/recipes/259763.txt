Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 (12 ounce) bottle tequila-lime marinade, divided
1 onion, cut into large chunks
1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, cut into large chunks
1 green bell pepper, cut into large chunks

Directions:
Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag; douse with 3/4 cups marinade. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Combine the remaining 3/4 cups marinade, onion, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper in another resealable plastic bag. Marinate for 1 to 2 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread the onions, mushrooms, red bell peppers, and green bell peppers onto skewers. Place on the grill; cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Place chicken breasts onto the grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Slice cooked chicken; serve alongside skewers.

Description: 
This is one of our favorite summertime meals. Marinated chicken and veggies are cooked on the grill and served in a gordita-size tortilla with some sour cream, Cheddar cheese, and some wild rice on the side. We usually use the bottle marinade from the store.
