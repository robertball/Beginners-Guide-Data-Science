Ingredients:
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup tomato juice
1/4 - 1/2 cup water, depending how much of a paste texture you want the sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
1 - 2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 cup chopped green onions
2 - 3 tablespoons chopped peanuts

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, blend together peanut butter, tomato juice, water if using, brown sugar, tomato paste, lime juice, ginger and garlic until smooth. Bring to a boil, cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.
Stir together cinnamon, oregano, salt and pepper. Place chicken in a large ziplock bag, and toss with spice mixture a la "shake n bake", until well coated. In a nonstick skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Brown chicken for about 5 minutes per side or until golden. Transfer to a baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken, and turn it a few times to make sure it is well coated.
Bake chicken in 425 degree oven, turning once, for 30 minutes or until no longer pink inside. Sprinkle with green onions and chopped peanuts before serving.

Description: 
We love many of the exotic Moroccan flavors, but are not huge fans of stews or extremely thick sauces.  We experimented with different recipes to recreate the Moroccan tastes within a dish that appeals more to us!
