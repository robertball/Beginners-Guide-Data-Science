Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 fluid ounce warm water
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
1 cup sourdough starter
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
To Make Starter: Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add 1 tablespoon white sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 cup of the flour, and 1 cup of the milk in a non-metal bowl and stir with a non-metal spoon until creamy.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for two days to ferment.  It will become bubbly and have a sour odor.  Do not place in refrigerator.  On second day, third day, and fourth day: stir.  On fifth day, add 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, and stir.  On sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth day: stir.  On tenth day add 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup milk.  Reserve 1 cup starter; pour remaining starter, 1 cup each, into 3 containers to give away to friends if desired. Starter is enough for 8 loaves.
To Make Cakes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8 or 9 inch loaf pans.
Mix 1 cup of the starter, oil, baking powder, eggs, 1 cup of the sugar, 2 cups of the flour, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, vanilla, and chopped nuts. Stir in the baking soda just before pouring the batter into the prepared pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bananas, dates, or raisins can be added for variety.

Description: 
Always save 1 cup of starter for your next cakes, then start with day 2 of the starter instructions instead of having to start a new starter each time.  You can also give some starter to friends, or sourdough starter can be used in place of the Friendship Starter.
