Ingredients:
20 grams butter, melted
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 Tbsp mayonnaise
1 egg yolk
4 slices bread
4 slices bacon
1/4 pc yellow onion, slices
1/2 tsp curry powder
20 grams shredded cheese
2 pcs onsen tamago

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, lemon juice, mayonnaise and egg yolk from one egg. Mix well then keep in the fridge for use after toasting the sandwich.
Cut out the bread crusts of the bread if you prefer.
Place the bacon slices on top of the bread then add the sliced onion.
Sprinkle about a quarter teaspoon of curry powder on each bread.
Add the cheese on top of each bread then sandwich it with another slice of bread.
Preheat the sandwich maker then place the sandwich once done. Toast it for about 5 minutes or until the sandwich has browned or crispy.
Take the sandwich from the sandwich maker then slice and put on a serving plate.
Put the onsen tamago on top then pour the sauce made earlier.

Description: 
This is a recipe for egg Benedict cooked in a sandwich maker. This is a Japanese-style, instead of using poached egg, I've used hot spring eggs (onsen tamago) which can be bought at any grocery stores in Japan. It's filling and a great breakfast choice on weekends.
