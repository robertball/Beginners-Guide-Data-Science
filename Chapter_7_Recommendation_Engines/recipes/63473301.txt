Ingredients:
1 	 pound 	 dried white beans (such as cannellini or great Northern)
1/2 	 pound 	 andouille sausage links, halved lengthwise and sliced crosswise
1 	 large onion, chopped
2 	 stalks 	 celery, chopped
4 	 sprigs 	 fresh thyme
8 	 cups 	 low-sodium chicken broth
1 	 bunch 	 collard greens, stems discarded and leaves cut into bite-size pieces (about 8 cups)
1 	 tablespoon 	 red wine vinegar
kosher salt and black pepper
olive oil and bread sticks or cornbread, for serving

Directions:
In a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker, combine the beans, sausage, onion, celery, and thyme. Add the broth and stir to combine.
Cover and cook until the beans are tender, on low for 7 to 8 hours or on high for 4 to 5 hours (this will shorten total cooking time).
Twenty minutes before serving, discard the thyme stems, add the collard greens, cover, and cook until the greens are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the vinegar and Â½ teaspoon each salt and pepper.
Drizzle with the olive oil and serve with the bread of choice.
