Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1 (4.5 pound) pork shoulder roast
2 tablespoons honey, or to taste
1/2 cup brown sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk orange juice, soy sauce, 1/2 cup honey, balsamic vinegar, mustard, paprika, hot sauce, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger together in the bottom of a slow cooker; add garlic. Lay the pork shoulder roast into the orange juice mixture.
Cook on Low for 10 to 12 hours.
Turn roast over in the slow cooker, drizzle more honey over the roast, and pack brown sugar atop the pork.
Continue cooking another 10 to 12 hours. Shred the pork with a pair of forks in the slow cooker and mix with the liquid until even in texture.
