Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
6 apples
2 tablespoons red currant jelly
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons apple juice
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large shallow baking dish.
Roll dough into a 18x12 inch rectangle that's 1/8 inch thick. Cut dough into 6 squares.
Combine butter, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves and brown sugar.  Peel and core apples.  Place one apple on each square of pastry.  In center of each apple place 1 teaspoon red currant jelly. Spread spice mixture over each apple; bring points of pastry together and seal.  Place apples in the prepared baking dish with the seams either on top or underneath the apples.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes.  In a saucepan combine boiling water, granulated sugar, and apple juice.  Cook until sugar is dissolved.  Pour over baked apples and bake for an additional 20 minutes.  Baste frequently. Serve warm.  Makes 6 servings.

Description: 
This is another one of my apple dumpling recipes and both are terrific. When apples are so plentiful I cannot resist making such wonderful pies, dumplings, cobblers, crisps, etc. with them.
