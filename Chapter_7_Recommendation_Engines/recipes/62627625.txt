Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice (preferably fresh)
2 (6 ounce) fillets red snapper
4 cloves (or to your liking) of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon basil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 green bell pepper (sliced in thin strips)
1 red bell pepper (sliced in thin strips)
1 small white onion (sliced in thin strips and quartered)
4 to 6 ounces shredded Pepper Jack cheese

Directions:
Rinse fillets well under cold running water. Spoon lemon juice over both sides of fillets. Set aside.
Sautee peppers, onions, garlic and basil in olive oil in a sauté pan until tender. Add can of diced tomatoes w/liquid and continue to sautee for approx. 10 minutes to allow some water to absorb.
Drain mixture. Set aside and keep warm. At this point you can either grill the snapper 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or pan fry with a bit of olive oil in the same sauté pan. Be very careful not to overcook. The fish should flake easily with a fork.
When the snapper is done, put the vegetable mixture on top of snapper in the pan, for approx. 3 minutes on low, then top with cheese, cover and allow cheese to melt. Remove from heat and serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a recipe I adapted from a scallops recipe at a restaurant. It's a little cross over from Veracruz style to Mexican style. Be sure not to over cook the fish. It should flake with a fork and depending on the thickness could take less or more time.Modified from: Garlic-Herb Red Snapper
