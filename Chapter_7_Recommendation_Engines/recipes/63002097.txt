Ingredients:
1 (16 oz.) can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
6 eggs hardboiled
1/4 cup mayonaise
2 tablespoons Kraft Sandwich Spread
1 clove garlic minced
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
optional 2 tablespoons mustard

Directions:
Mix the garbanzo beans and minced garlic in food processor or stand mixer with cover as the chick peas will hop out. After they are pretty blended and mashed add the mayo, salt, pepper, optional mustard and sandwich spread. Mix to blend again.
Chop the eggs as you prefer for egg salad and blend those into the chickpea mixture.

Description: 
Egg salad with mashed chickpeas make a powerful protein packed snack! My children love it and it stands well in a sandwich even after being in the fridge overnight. Because the chickpeas form a hummus like mixture it cuts down the mayo content
