Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Butter
1/2 Cup Sugar
1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Egg
1 Tsp Vanilla
1 Dollup Molasses
1/2 Cup Grated Coconut
1/2 Cup Nuts (Pecans are great)
Chocolate chips - you figure it out.
1 cup flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 Cup Oats
1 Cup Cereal (I use Vector)

Directions:
Acquire Coconut.  Drill two small holes in it and drain it.  Put it in a towel and smash it with a hammer.  Break up the pieces and use a chisel to pry off the skin.  Then grate it and freeze it in ziplock's.
Ok you skipped step one and found where you can buy fresh grated coconut.  It just makes you a little less cool.  Moving on.  Cream yo' butter, sugar, Brown sugar, an egg, a dollup of molasses and vanilla in a large bowl.
Just like every other cookie recipe you combine your dry stuff in a separate bowl.  Do this now.  .  Coconut, nuts, flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, oats and cereal.
Combine all the things and mix.
Add chocolate chips until desired chocolatyness
Bake at 350 degrees on a greased cookie sheet for 7-10 min depending on your oven.
Try not to eat all the dough you glutton.
