Ingredients:
1 Bag frozen Chicken Breast
1 Large can and 1 Small can cream of chicken soup
16 oz of the Mexican Velveeta Cheese
16 oz of Sour Cream
1 Large bag of corn chips

Directions:
Boil chicken till tender. Make sure you season your water well; it can be used for chicken stock later. Remove chicken from broth and peel apart. While your chicken is boiling cut your cheese into small cubes.
In a separate bowl pour in cream of chicken soup, sour cream and cheese. DO NOT add chicken yet! Put it in the microwave heating every 3 min and stirring. When the mixture has come to a nice smooth consistency add chicken and heat for another 2 minutes. Pour over your chips. (If the mixture seems a little thick you can add some of chicken broth from earlier when you boiled the chicken)
