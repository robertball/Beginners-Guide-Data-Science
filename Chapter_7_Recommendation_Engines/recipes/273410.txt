Ingredients:
8 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes
1 (8 ounce) fillet cod fillet
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon minced parsley
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and add salted water to cover by 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Add cod fillet to water and continue to simmer until fish starts to flake, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes and fish to a mixing bowl.
Add bread crumbs, egg, parsley, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and pepper to the fish and potatoes. Mash until thoroughly mixed. Form mixture into 6 discs.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry 2 cod cakes at a time in the hot oil until golden brown on each side, 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat with remaining cod cakes, adding more oil as necessary for each batch.

Description: 
Cod and potatoes combine for a higher-potassium alternative to crab cakes. This is delicious with a nice remoulade dipping sauce.
