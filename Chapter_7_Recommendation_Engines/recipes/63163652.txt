Ingredients:
3-4 lb chicken, cut into 8 pieces
olive oil
salt
ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400° F.
2. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Drizzle olive oil on bottom of a roasting pan or baking dish. Thoroughly rub chicken pieces with olive oil to coat, then sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt and pepper. Arrange chicken pieces in the pan, skin side up.
4. Bake 30 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350° F and cook an additional 10-25 minutes, or until juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 170° F.
5. Optional: To brown the chicken, place under broiler for 7-10 minutes of cooking. When chicken is done, remove from oven and tent with aluminum foil. Let rest 5-10 minutes before serving.
