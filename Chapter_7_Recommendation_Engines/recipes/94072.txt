Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 pints cherry or grape tomatoes
Salt and pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil

Directions:
Heat 1 Tb. olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high flame until it just starts to smoke. Add tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Saute, shaking pan frequently, until tomatoes soften and skins just begin to wrinkle, about 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and continue to shake the pan until garlic is fragrant. Off heat, stir in the basil and remaining 1 Tb. olive oil, then serve.
