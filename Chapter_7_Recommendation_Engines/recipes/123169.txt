Ingredients:
4 carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces
4 cups red potato chunks
2 (14 ounce) cans sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
2 1/2 pounds fresh Polish sausage, cut into 3 inch pieces
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups dry white wine or chicken broth
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon caraway seed

Directions:
In a 5-qt. slow cooker, layer carrots, potatoes and sauerkraut. In a skillet, brown the sausage; transfer to the slow cooker (slow cooker will be full). Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in a skillet; saute onion and garlic until tender.
Gradually add wine or broth. Bring to a boil; stir to loosen browned bits. Stir in pepper and caraway. Pour over sausage. Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours or until vegetables are tender and sausage is no longer pink.

Description: 
With big, tender chunks of sausage, potatoes and carrots, this meal-in-one has old-world flavor that will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. 'A co-worker often made a big pot of this for our office staff, and it always disappeared in a hurry,' notes Joalyce Graham of St. Petersburg, Florida.
