Ingredients:
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger whiskey
1 (20 ounce) bottle lemon-lime sports drink
2 aspirin pills

Directions:
Take a big drink out of the sports drink, and pour in the whiskey. The faster you do it, the nearer your next cigarette consumption will take place. Take the aspirin pills with the sports drink. Aspirin adds an edge that will keep you barkin' commands at the low-level workforce instead of frettin' over a massive headache due to excessive amounts of sun.
