Ingredients:
1 leek, sliced fine
6 tsp extra virgin olive oil (you might need more)
2 zucchini, diced
2 artichokes, sliced
10 black olives, sliced
6 cherry tomatoes, diced
1 bunch of fresh basil
salt and pepper to taste
Parmigiano Reggiano™, to taste

Directions:
Sauté the leek in the oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini and the rest of the vegetables (including the basil).  Add salt and pepper to taste and cook, covered, for 10 minutes to maintain a moist environment.
Boil the spaghetti in salted water. (It's not specified in the original recipe. I used 70g per person for four people)
Uncover the vegetable "sauce". Add the drained spaghetti to the vegetables. Mix together for about one minute and add cheese to taste.
Just a note from me: I added julienned carrot, diced celery, and a fresh cayenne pepper as well as a splash of white wine to the sauté. I also added olives that had been sitting in oil, parsley, hot peppers, and garlic. I think this helped in making a more savoury sauce.
