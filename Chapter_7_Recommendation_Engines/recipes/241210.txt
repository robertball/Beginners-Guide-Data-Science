Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 small pumpkin - peeled, seeded, and chopped
2 onions, peeled and quartered
1 red chile pepper, quartered
1 clove garlic, unpeeled

Directions:
Mix olive oil, balsamic vinegar, thyme, rosemary, minced garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set aside for flavors to blend, about 40 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
Combine potatoes, pumpkin, onions, red chile pepper, and whole garlic clove in a large bowl; pour olive oil mixture over vegetables and toss to coat. Spread vegetables in a roasting pan in 1 even layer.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring 1 or 2 times, until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour 10 minutes.
