Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
10 sweet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine cream, milk, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add sweet potatoes and simmer until sauce is thickened and sweet potatoes are almost tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Combine panko bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, and butter in a bowl; sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and cheese topping is browned and bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is similar to regular scalloped potatoes but uses sweet potatoes instead. Went over great with Christmas dinner as an unusual substitute.
