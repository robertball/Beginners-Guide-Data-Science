Description: 
I first served this pasta salad at the Brewer's Opening Day tailgater.  It was a big hit at Miller Park.  This cool and fresh salad will be a big hit at any of your outdoor picnics.  So easy to make. Try it with your favorite vinagrette or italian dressing.  Also, try trading the black olives for Kalamata olives or the shredded mozzarella for cubed mozzarella.
