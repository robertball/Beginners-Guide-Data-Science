The cake will be VERY moist and floating on a layer of molten choc when it's done.
You'll know it's done cooking when nearly all the cake is set and the sides begin to pull away from the sides of the pot.  Turn off slow cooker and remove lid. Try not to let the condensed steam from the lid drip into the cake. let cool for 25 min before cutting and spooning onto individual plates.(Trust me you will want to let it cool it thickens into a fudgy heavenly sauce)"
