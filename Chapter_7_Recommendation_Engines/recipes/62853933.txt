Ingredients:
1/2 pound left over pork roast, shredded
4 slices of cheddar (or your favorite) cheese
1/4 cup bar-b-que sauce
1/2 small onion, thinly sliced
2 10-inch flour tortilla wraps
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Layer half of the shredded pork on each tortilla and top each with half of the bar-b-que sauce.
Cut cheese slices in half and use 4 halves on top of the pork and sauce on each tortilla.
Top with onions separated into rings.
Season with salt and pepper, if needed.
Roll up each tortilla, tucking the ends in as you roll.
Wrap each sandwich tightly in aluminum foil and bake in the oven about 15-20 minutes until heated through and cheese is melted and gooey.  Cut in half and serve!
