Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
LEMON FILLING:
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons butter, cubed
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoons sugar
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring water and butter to a boil. Add flour all at once, stirring until a smooth ball forms. Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue beating until mixture is smooth.
Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 3 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks. Immediately split puffs and remove tops; discard soft dough from inside. Set puffs and tops aside to cool.
For filling, in a small heavy saucepan, combine the egg, sugar, lemon juice and butter. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 5-7 minutes or until mixture is thick enough to coat a metal spoon.
Remove from the heat. Cool quickly by placing pan in a bowl of ice water; stir for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; press plastic wrap onto surface of filling. Chill for 1 hour or until partially set.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream and sugar until stiff peaks form; fold into lemon mixture. Fill cream puffs; replace tops. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
