Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup flax seed meal
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan, or line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.
In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the bananas.
Mix in the self-rising flour and flax seed meal until just incorporated; fold in the walnuts.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes for muffins, or 1 hour for a loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
My dad made this bread for years to the delight to our family. Pair it with a dish of fruit and a cup of coffee for breakfast. Yum! The flax seed meal gives a great texture without altering the flavor.
