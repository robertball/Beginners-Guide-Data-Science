Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
2 cups oil for frying, or as needed
1 pound ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl; stir in water just until a fairly sticky dough forms. Set aside to rest while oil preheats.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a round disc the size of your palm.
Fry dough discs, one at a time, in hot oil until browned on one side, about 2 minutes; turn over with tongs and cook until browned on both sides, about 1 minute more. Drain fry bread on paper towels; repeat with remaining dough.
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; stir in chili seasoning and kidney beans and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Place fry bread on a plate; top each fry bread with a portion of chili mixture, shredded Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.
