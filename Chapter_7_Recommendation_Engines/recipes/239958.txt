Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, finely grated
2 large turnips, finely grated
1 yellow onion, finely grated
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
2 cups sunflower oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix grated potatoes, turnips, and onion together in a bowl, draining off any excess liquid. Mix egg, parsley, basil, dill, salt, and pepper into potato mixture. Stir flour into potato mixture, adding enough flour to make a thick batter.
Heat enough oil to fill the bottom of a heavy skillet to 1/4-inch depth over medium-high heat.
Working in batches of 3 or 4 pancakes, spoon batter, 1/4 cup per pancake, into hot oil and flatten to make 1/2-inch thick pancakes. Fry pancakes in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer pancakes to a paper towel-lined plate.
