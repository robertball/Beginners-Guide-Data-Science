Ingredients:
2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
2 tablespoons warm water
3/4 cup oat flour
3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 ripe banana, mashed
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup sunflower seed oil

Directions:
Mix flaxseed meal and warm water in a bowl; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oat flour and stir until well combined. Whisk in almond milk slowly to prevent lumps. Stir mashed banana, peanut butter, and salt into the batter.
Heat sunflower oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the saucepan and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
