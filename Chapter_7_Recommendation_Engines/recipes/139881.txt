Ingredients:
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup cake flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon carob powder (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons molasses
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 orange, juiced and zested
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
1/2 cup raisins
5 dried figs, chopped
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
2 cups grated carrots
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch Bundt pan.
In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, cake flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, carob, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the molasses, oil, eggs and orange juice. Mix until the dry ingredients are moistened, then stir in the orange zest, lemon zest, raisins, figs, poppy seeds, carrots and pecans until evenly distributed. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before removing from the pan.

Description: 
This carrot cake uses very little sugar and is very fragrant and sweet from molasses and dried figs that I use as a substitute for sugar. Citrus fruit and spices give it very fresh taste. It is a very moist and tasty cake.
