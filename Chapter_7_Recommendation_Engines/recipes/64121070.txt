Ingredients:
1 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon arrowroot powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
4 tablespoon coconut oil, melted and cooled
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon raw honey
Â¼ cup unsweetened chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, mix the almond flour, arrowroot powder and baking soda with a fork.
In a separate bowl whisk coconut oil, eggs, vanilla and honey together.
Fold wet and dry ingredients and mix gently with rubber spatula until combined, then stir in the chocolate chips.
Scoop out tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart and place on the prepared baking sheet  then gently flatten cookie dough with your fingers.
Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, about 8 to 10 minutes
Remove from oven and let cookies cool on baking sheet a minute then transfer to a wire rack and let cool.
Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
