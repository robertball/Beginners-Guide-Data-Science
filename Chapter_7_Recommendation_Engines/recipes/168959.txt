Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 red onion, chopped
1 zucchini, coarsely chopped
1 yellow squash, coarsely chopped
1 carrot, coarsely chopped
1 red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup sliced baby portabella mushrooms
4 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon smoked sweet paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
2 Roma tomatoes, sliced
2 cups dry couscous
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)
1 tablespoon finely chopped toasted almonds (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in large pot over medium-low heat. Place onion, zucchini, yellow squash, and carrot in pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions begin to soften and turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the red and yellow peppers and mushrooms; cook another 3 minutes. Vegetables should still be firm.
Pour in the vegetable stock and season with paprika, cardamom, salt, and cilantro. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low. Stir in chickpeas and tomatoes. Slowly pour in the couscous; stir. Cover pot immediately and remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork. The couscous should have absorbed about half the cooking liquid.
Serve at slightly warmer than room temperature. Garnish with orange zest and the grated cheese, paprika, and almonds.

Description: 
A perfect summer meal. What I love about this recipe is the practicality: it is both quick to make and can wait for you; there's no hurry to serve. It's also a satisfying vegetarian meal that even carnivores love, or if a member of your household prefers meat, a chicken breast poached in water, wine, and paprika and then sliced very thin can be added. I do highly recommend the garnish I devised; it can be made very quickly while the couscous is cooking. Or even if you just zest a navel orange over this dish, the aroma is heavenly and it brings the flavors together. Enjoy!
