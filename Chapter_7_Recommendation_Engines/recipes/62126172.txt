Description: 
You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the the traditionally boiled beef.  This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding house owner, and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef, this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful & has a carmelized surface when it's done.  I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots & parsnips.  It is our favorite St. Patricks/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year around.
