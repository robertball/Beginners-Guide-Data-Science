Description: 
Goda masala is a coconut-based Indian spice mix that can be used in dishes for a twist from the usual. It's a bit labor intensive, but worth it. My version of this mix leaves out a few ingredients from the traditional mix because due to my aversion to certain flavors and inability to find some spices where I live. This mix gives a nice flavor to khichdi and other vegetable, rice, and dal dishes.
