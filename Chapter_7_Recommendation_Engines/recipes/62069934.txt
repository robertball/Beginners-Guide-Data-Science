Herbed Salmon Recipe

Ingredients:
2 lbs salmon (1/2 pound each person seems to work well if you're cooking for lots of boys)
4-5 dried sage leaves
1 tbs dried thyme
pinch ground paprika
pinch ground cayanne pepper

Directions:
Place salmon on a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to fold over the top of the salmon steak or fillet.  Grind the sage and thyme and sprinkle over salmon with the pepper and paprika (sparing amounts of paprika and pepper, they're only there for a hint of a spicey taste).  Fold the aluminum foil over, roll the edges to avoid drips, and stick on the oven (350 degrees C for 20 or so minutes) or on the grill until it's cooked.
I tend to cook the salmon in the oven during the winter, but grilling works nicely as well, especially charcoal grills.  I'm not entirely sure of oven heat or time(since my oven was older than I was and the dials were of quesstionable accuracy), but the salmon is obviously done when it flakes.
This is an extremely simple, but very enjoyable main course.  I generally stick it in the oven, then make potato wedges or my squash (sauteed yellow squash and zucchini) while it's baking.

Description: 
I began using sage on salmon during my college years, when I grew entirely too much of the herb, and put it in pretty much everything.  It became my favorite herb, and lends a delicate and unexpected taste and scent to this dish.
