Ingredients:
1 cup couscous
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
1 green bell pepper, cut into large chunks
1 red bell pepper, cut into large chunks
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into large chunks

Directions:
Prepare couscous pasta according to package directions, using chicken broth for liquid. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet combine the wine, oil, 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 teaspoon cumin and garlic; mix all together and add chicken. Simmer over low heat until all liquid has evaporated and chicken juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove chicken from skillet and mix in a large bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice, remaining 1/2 teaspoon cumin, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, green onion and couscous. Garnish with a few black olives per serving.
