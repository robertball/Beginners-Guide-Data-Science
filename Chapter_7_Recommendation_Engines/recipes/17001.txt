Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) pork roast
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon mustard seed
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Prepare grill for indirect heat.
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the Worcestershire sauce, honey, vinegar, mustard seed, mustard powder, lemon pepper, celery salt, and garlic; seal, and mix ingredients.  Place the roast in the plastic bag, press air out of bag, and seal. Marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator, turning the roast occasionally to help coat while marinating.
Lightly oil grill grate. Place roast on grill, and discard marinade. Cover, and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until internal temperature is 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a great marinade for any meat. I especially like it on pork roasts, but it can easily be used on chicken or ribs.
