Ingredients:
2½ cups powdered sugar
? cup powdered milk
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup white granulated sugar
? cup light corn syrup
? cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
Orange and Yellow Food Coloring

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, combine powdered sugar, salt, and powdered milk. Mix dry ingredients well.
2. On medium/high heat add sugar, butter and corn syrup and bring to a boil. (Make sure to use a medium/large sauce pan to leave boil room.)
3. Boil for 3-4 minutes or until a candy thermometer reads 230 degrees. Make sure to stir constantly while the mixture is boiling. If need be to control the boiling candy, turn down the heat.
4. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
5. Add hot sugar mixture to the dry ingredients in step 1. Using a heavy duty spatula or spoon, stir all ingredients together.
6. Place candy on a silicone mat ( the wax paper did not work for me). Allow mixture to cool enough to be handled.
7. Divide into 3 equal parts and add orange and yellow food colorings to their own parts. Using your hands, fold the food coloring into the candy mixture until completely mixed.
