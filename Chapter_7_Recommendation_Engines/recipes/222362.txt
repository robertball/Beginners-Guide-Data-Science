Ingredients:
1/2 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon bourbon (such as Four Roses®)
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons steak seasoning (such as Montreal Steak Seasoning®)
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
2 slices cooked bacon, cut into halves
2 slices Cheddar cheese
2 hamburger buns, split
2 tomato slices
2 leaves lettuce

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground beef, bourbon, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, steak seasoning, and garlic salt in a bowl; divide and shape into 2 patties.
Cook on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes; turn, top each burger with bacon and Cheddar cheese, and continue cooking until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes more for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on split buns topped with tomato and lettuce.

Description: 
In 2011 I attended the 'Chefs of the Coast' cook-off where 4 chefs battled it out cooking their own personal recipe using Four Roses Bourbon®. I thought that I could absolutely make a burger worthy of the Four Roses name and this is it. It's a savory burger that is seasoned to perfection and topped with bacon and other assorted toppings.
