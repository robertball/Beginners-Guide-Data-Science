Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 slices bacon, cut into small pieces
1 large sweet onion (such as Vidalia®), diced
4 celery ribs, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups diced new potatoes
1 quart seafood stock
2 bay leaves
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans evaporated milk
2 pounds cod fillets, cut into chunks
1 pound bay scallops
1 pound chopped fresh clam meat
1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in melted butter until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel, reserving drippings in the pot. Add onion and celery to the reserved drippings; cook and stir until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir garlic, thyme, pepper, seafood seasoning, and paprika into the onion mixture. Sprinkle flour over the mixture and stir; cook for 2 minutes. Fold potatoes into the mixture. Pour seafood stock over the mixture. Add bay leaves. Bring the stock to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender and the liquid thickens to your liking, 20 to 30 minutes.
Stir evaporated milk into the simmering stock; add cod, bay scallops, clam meat, and shrimp. Continue cooking the mixture at a simmer until the seafood is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley to serve.

Description: 
What is better than a great New England chowder on a cold rainy day or at a family summer BBQ? There are many chowders out there that are either too time-consuming or too expensive for the average family to make. This version is one I have developed for my family and friends that is easy to make, does not break the bank, and also has the best interests of your waistline at heart. In New England you can buy chopped chowder clams at many of our local markets. If you do not have them readily available where you live, you can use canned clams. Serve with oyster crackers or some great garlic bread.
