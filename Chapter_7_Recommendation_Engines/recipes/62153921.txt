Ingredients:
5 lb. beef brisket, well-trimmed (NOT corned beef)
1 1/2 cups catsup
1 pkg. dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup chile sauce
1/3 cup grape jelly
1/4 cup raspberry chipotle sauce

Directions:
Trim excess fat from brisket and cut the meat into large chunks.
Combine sauce ingredients, mixing well.
Put a dipper of sauce in the bottom of the crockpot.
Place the meat in layers with sauce between each layer.
Cover and cook on high for 8-10 hours, depending on how hot your slow cooker cooks.
After about 5 hours, move meat around so top layer is submerged.
Slice or shred when cooled and serve on hard rolls.
