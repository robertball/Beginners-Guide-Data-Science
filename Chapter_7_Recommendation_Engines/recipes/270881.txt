Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) fresh lobster
4 tablespoons butter
1 small onion, finely diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 fluid ounces Irish whiskey

Directions:
Cut lobster in half. Remove organs and discard; remove meat. Cut into large chunks and set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; drop in lobster shells to clean, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat until just beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add lobster meat, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until onions and garlic are softened, and meat is cooked through but not colored, about 5 minutes.
Stir in whiskey and set on fire carefully with a lighter. Add cream once alcohol has burned off, or when flames are out. Cook until cream is heated through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Return meat and cream sauce to cleaned shell halves to serve.

Description: 
No, I am not making this up! This is a very old Irish recipe for lobster. Somehow the idea of boiling your lawyer (lobster), then flambeeing him before dousing him in cream, is somehow a justice to the world! Not only is the name fun, but it is an excellent recipe which is great when you have a few quid to spare! If I don't want to go to the hassle of cleaning and boiling the shells, I will sometimes just serve this over toast points, or a pasta of some kind. But the shells make a great presentation!
