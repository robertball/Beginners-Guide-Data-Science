Ingredients:
5lbs meat (brisket or top round)
8 TBS. your favorite BBQ Spice Rub
6 cups marinade (2 cups soy sauce, 2 cups Worcestershire sauce, 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1 cup molasses, 2 TBS. spice rub)
3 Tbs. ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Freeze the meat (makes slicing easier)
2. Slice into 3 inch long 1/2 inch thick strips
3. Marinate overnight- 24 hrs is optimal
4. Stick the meat into the smokers or oven at 180F for 4-6hrs (Remove when meat is dried but a bit flexible. You don't want it to be brittle b/c the meat will keep drying after you take it out)
5. Sprinkle the jerky with black pepper and the remaining BBQ spice rub.
Enjoy!
