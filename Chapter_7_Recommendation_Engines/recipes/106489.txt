Ingredients:
4 large portobello mushrooms, wiped clean (stems removed and diced)
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 medium onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
2/3 cup crushed buttery round crackers
1 1/2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained
1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler.
Brush both sides of the mushrooms with 3 tablespoons of oil.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, and arrange on a lipped cookie sheet. Broil on highest rack, turning once, until golden and almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms and reset oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil and butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in mushrooms stems and onions and lightly seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook until tender, about 4 minutes.  Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Transfer mushroom mixture to a medium bowl and stir in crackers and crabmeat.
Spoon a portion of filling into each mushroom cap and top with cheese. Bake on middle oven rack until filling is heated though and cheese melts, about 15 minutes.
