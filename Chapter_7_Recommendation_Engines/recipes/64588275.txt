Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups whole milk
1 2/3 cups heavy cream
3/4 cup organic cane sugar
1/2 cup powdered skim milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 small bunch mint, leaves torn and bruised
4 oz dark chocolate
2 tsp canola oil (or other neutral flavored oil)

Directions:
Place cream, milk, sugar, and powdered milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Heat to 140 degrees, stirring occasionally.
Whisk half the cream mixture one ladle full at a time into egg yolks.  Return cream and egg mixture to saucepan.
Heat cream mixture to 165 degrees and hold for one minute.  Do not boil.  Remove from heat.
Steep mint in hot cream mixture for two hours.
Strain cream through a fine mesh strainer into a medium bowl.  Chill in an ice bath or in the refrigerator until just above freezing.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.
Melt chocolate in a double boiler over low heat.  Add oil when fully melted and combine.
In the last minute of churning, slowly drizzle chocolate into ice cream, breaking up large chunks with a spoon if necessary.
Transfer ice cream to a storage container and freeze until hard, approximately 4 hours.

Description: 
Nothing beats fresh mint when it comes to mint ice cream, and the chocolate swirl is thin and melts in your mouth, not waxy like chips.
