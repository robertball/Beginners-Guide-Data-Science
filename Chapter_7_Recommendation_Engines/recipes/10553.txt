Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup molasses
1/3 cup water
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
5 3/4 ounces sourball hard candies

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and molasses until smooth. Add water. Stir together flour, baking soda, salt, and spices. Gradually add flour mixture to creamed mixture; blend well.
Wrap dough in plastic and chill for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cut out paper stars, bells, hearts, or other holiday motifs. Trace shapes onto a sheet of aluminum foil. Place foil on a baking sheet and spray lightly with cooking spray.
Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/4-inch wide. Outline the foil designs with ropes of dough. Press ends lightly together.
Separate candies by color. In a blender or food processor, coarsely crush candies. Fill in dough outlines with the desired color candies.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 4 to 5 minutes or until cookie is set and candy melts. Transfer cookies and foil to a cooling rack and cool completely before removing foil.
