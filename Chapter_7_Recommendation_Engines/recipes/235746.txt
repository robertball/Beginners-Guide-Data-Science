Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup water
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup peanut butter
Icing:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Whisk flour, white sugar, and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat 1/2 cup milk, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into flour mixture using an electric mixer on low until smooth.
Cook and stir water, 1/2 cup butter, vegetable oil, and 1/2 cup peanut butter together in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth, about 5 minutes. Stir peanut butter mixture into flour mixture until batter is well mixed; pour onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Melt 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter together in a saucepan over medium heat until smooth; add 1/3 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Whisk confectioners' sugar into mixture until icing is smooth, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour icing over warm cake.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite cake recipes given to me from a co-worker. It is the best peanut butter cake you will ever eat. The icing is like fudge.
