Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1 tablespoon castor sugar or superfine sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1/2 cup milk, or as needed

Directions:
Sift the flour into a medium bowl, and stir in the sugar. Make a well in the center, and add the egg. Stir with a wooden spoon while gradually pouring in the milk until you reach the consistency that you prefer. Thicker pikelets will need a thick batter, while thin pikelets will need a thin batter. Stir in melted butter last, beating until smooth.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Drop by large spoonfuls onto the hot skillet. Pikelets should be about 2 inches across. Flip when bubbles appear on the surface, and cook until browned on the other side.
