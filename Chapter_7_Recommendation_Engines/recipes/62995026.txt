Ingredients:
1 pkg little wieners
1 pkg bacon or flavored bacon
1 C brown sugar

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with tin foil. Cut bacon strips in half length wise and put brown sugar in a medium bowl.
Dip bacon strips in brown sugar to coat both sides. Wrap bacon around little wieners and place wieners with the bacon seam down on cookie sheet. Don't need to secure with a tooth pick or anything. Bacon will shrink nicely around the little wieners.
Sprinkle any remaining brown sugar over the wieners.
Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 45 minutes or until the bacon is crispy. Transfer to a crock pot to serve keep them warm.
