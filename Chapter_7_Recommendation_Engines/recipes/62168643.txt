Ingredients:
4 tbsp olive oil
1 cup of diced ham
1 small white onion diced
1 15 oz can dried pigeon peas
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
4 oz green olives w/pimento and juice
1/2 cup sofrito
1/2 tsp adobo seasoning
2 packets sazon (con cilantro y achiote) seasoning
2 cups rice
2½ cups water

Directions:
In a large pot sauté onion and ham in olive oil until onion just starts to soften.  Add pigeon peas and continue cooking for 3 mins.  Add tomato sauce, sofrito, adobo, sazon and olives; bring to a simmer for approx 5 mins.  Add rice and water and bring back to simmer.    Cover, reduce heat to low and continue cooking until rice is tender, approx 20-30 mins.
**Although it’s important to keep covered while cooking, you want to stir at least once halfway through to be sure there is enough liquid (you may need to add a little water) and keep the rice from sticking.
