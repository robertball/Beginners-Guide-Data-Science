Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup salted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg
8 translucent apples (or granny smith, something with a little tartness) - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.  Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust.  You must pour slowly so that it does not run over the edges.  Add a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar to give a nice glaze.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 40 to 45 minutes, or until apples are soft and crust is golden brown.

Description: 
A favorite in our house especially when I can use our own orchard apples.  It is rich with a sugary sauce, mounded high with apples, and a beautiful addition to a Sunday dinner.Modified from: Apple Pie by Grandma Ople
