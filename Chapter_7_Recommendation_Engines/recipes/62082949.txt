Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberries
1/3 cup fresh squeezed orange juice
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temp
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
2/3 cup granulated sugar, plus 2 Tablespoons more for topping muffins, if desired
2 large eggs, at room temp
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon, for topping mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Put the cranberries and orange juice in a small saucepan, bring just to a simmer over med. heat.  Remove from heat, and set aside to cool and plump.
Line 12-muffin tin with paper liners or lightly brush with butter.  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and set aside.
In a standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, or with a hand-held mixer in a large bowl, cream butter, orange zest, and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Remove the bowl from the mixer.
Fold the flour in 3 parts into the butter mixture, alternating with the milk in 2 parts, until just combined.  Fold in the cranberries.  Do not over mix.  Divide the batter evenly into the muffin tins.  Mix cinnamon with sugar and sprinkle on top of batter.  Bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes.  Cool muffins in the pan on a rack.
