Ingredients:
Crust:
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg
2 teaspoons baking powder
salt to taste
Filling:
4 cups milk
1 teaspoon margarine
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
2 dashes ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until creamy. Add 2 cups flour, 1 egg, baking powder, and salt; mix well until dough comes together.
Press dough into bottom and sides of two 8-inch pie plates to form crusts.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.
Combine milk and 1 teaspoon margarine in a saucepan over medium-low heat; bring to a boil. Remove from heat.
Mix 1 1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 2 1/2 teaspoons flour, cornstarch, and vanilla extract into a smooth paste in a bowl. Pour over hot milk in the saucepan.
Return saucepan to medium heat and stir milk mixture until thick, 5 to 8 minutes.
Divide milk mixture evenly between the cooled crusts. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Cool until filling is set, about 30 minutes.
