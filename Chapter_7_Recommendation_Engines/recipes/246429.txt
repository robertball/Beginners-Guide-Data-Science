Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 10 cups of a muffin tin or line with paper muffin liners.
Combine all-purpose flour, sugar, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl.
Whisk egg lightly in a large bowl. Add applesauce, coconut milk, vegetable oil, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir in flour mixture until batter is just combined. Scoop into the prepared muffin pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Light and moist dairy-free cupcakes with a pleasant aroma that I invented on the spot. They are delicious, not too sweet, and easy to make. Top with your frosting of choice or serve as-is.
