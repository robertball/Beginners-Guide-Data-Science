Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup KRAFT Creamy Herb & Garlic Shredded Cheese with a TOUCH OF PHILADELPHIA, divided
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
1 refrigerated pie shell
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Cook and stir bacon in medium skillet on medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from skillet with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 tablespoon drippings from skillet.
Add onions to reserved drippings; cook and stir 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Stir in mushrooms and thyme; cook 5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in flour, then 1/4 cup cheese; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese is melted. Add tomatoes and bacon; mix well. Cool 10 minutes.
Unroll pie shell; place on parchment-covered baking sheet. Press gently to flatten; sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese to within 2 inches of edge. Top with tomato mixture. Fold edge of pastry over filling, leaving centre uncovered. Brush pastry with egg.
Bake 25 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. Top filling with remaining cheese; bake 5 minutes or until melted.
