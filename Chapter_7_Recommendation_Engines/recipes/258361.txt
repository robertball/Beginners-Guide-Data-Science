Ingredients:
Salmon Cakes:
1 pound salmon, chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped bell pepper
1/4 cup olive oil mayonnaise
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 green onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon spicy brown mustard
1 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
12 slider-size burger buns, split
Aioli:
1 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Mix salmon, bell pepper, olive oil mayonnaise, bread crumbs, green onion, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, mustard, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.
Whisk egg in a small bowl; pour over salmon mixture and mix until evenly incorporated. Form salmon mixture into 12 patties.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook salmon patties in batches until lightly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Place 1 patty in each slider bun.
Mix mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and garlic together in a bowl to make aioli. Spread aioli over the salmon patties.
