Description: 
A tasty and simple salad. Great substitute for a typical green salad. Even the kids love it! Even better when chilled and let to marinade over night. Serve with grilled chicken seasoned with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, salt and black pepper and garlic bread for a wonderfully simple and fast meal!
