Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package crispy corn and rice cereal
1 1/3 cups pecan halves
1 1/3 cups almonds
1 1/3 cups cashews
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut, or more to taste
3/4 cup raisins (optional)
1 stick butter
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place cereal, pecans, almonds, cashews, coconut, and raisins in a large brown paper bag or large microwave-safe bowl and stir or shake to mix.
Melt 1 stick plus 3 tablespoons butter, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour over the cereal mixture and stir to coat.
Microwave on high in three 90-second intervals, stirring between intervals, 4 1/2 minutes total. Spread out to cool before breaking apart.
