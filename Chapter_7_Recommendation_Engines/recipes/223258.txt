Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 pound Portuguese hot chourico sausage
1 large tomato, coarsely chopped
3 drops hot sauce
1 small chile pepper, diced (optional)
1/2 teaspoon fresh lime juice (optional)

Directions:
Spray a medium-sized nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat and stir in onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Thinly slice sausage and then chop it into 1/4-inch cubes. Stir sausage into skillet with onions.
Stir tomato into sausage mixture and adjust heat to medium-high. Stir in chile pepper, if using. Mix in hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have broken down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve warm.

Description: 
In a recent trip to San Francisco, my brother and I frequented a restaurant in the Haight district for breakfast. The inspiration for this came from that trip. Very simple. Use as a side, a topping (for eggs and omelets) or an ingredient. It's great with Egg BeatersÂ® omelets. Hope you enjoy.
