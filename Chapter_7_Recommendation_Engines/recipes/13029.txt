Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 small onion, diced
2 tablespoons margarine
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups milk
6 small potatoes, cubed
2 carrots, chopped
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Fry bacon in pan until almost done. Add onions and celery, and saute until lightly browned.
Transfer to a cooking pot. Add cream-style corn, kernel corn, butter, and broth. Add carrots and potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes.
Mix together flour and a little water to form a paste.
Add milk and flour paste. You might want to add more flour paste, depending on how thick you like your chowder. Simmer for 30 minutes or until you are ready to eat. Add salt and pepper to taste.
