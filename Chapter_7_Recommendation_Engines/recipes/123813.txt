Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, poppy seeds, lemon peel and baking soda. Combine remaining ingredients; stir into flour mixture just until moistened.

Each Christmas, I make plates of goodies for the neighbors. I try to include a few items that aren't as sweet as traditional cookies and candies-- these mini loaves really fit the bill!
