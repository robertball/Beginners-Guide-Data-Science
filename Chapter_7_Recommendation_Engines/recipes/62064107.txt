Ingredients:
1 pkg chicken thighs with skin (approx 10) or 4 chicken breast halves (skin or no), thawed
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 TBS oil
1 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp pepper
1 minced garlic clove
1 c white wine

Directions:
Mix together all ingredients except chicken. Place chicken in a shallow baking dish and cover with marinade. Marinate chicken 6-8 hours in refrigerator. Turning occasionally. Grill or bake chicken at 350 degrees until no longer pink and juices run clear. Baste with remaining marinade every 15 minutes while baking or every 5 minutes when grilling.

Description: 
This chicken smells so good when baking! Using chicken pieces with the skin still on results in a crispy outside and moist inside. Of course, you can use chicken without skin and still get great results.
