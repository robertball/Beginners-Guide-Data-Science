Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
7 carrots, coarsely chopped
1 small white onion, chopped
4 slices ham
1/2 cup butter
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 lemon, zested
2 bay leaves
1 pinch dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon heavy cream

Directions:
Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble very finely and set aside.
In a food processor, chop the carrots, onion and ham.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Stir in carrot mixture and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in cooked beef, beef broth, tomato paste, lemon zest, bay leaves, basil and nutmeg.  Simmer over lowest heat, partially covered, for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Immediately before serving, stir in cream and mix well.

Description: 
This sauce is very different than the other bolognese already listed.  It takes a little work, but after you make it once or twice it is really easy... and SO GOOD!  My dad used to make it for us almost every weekend, and now I make it for my family!
