Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/4 teaspoon green food coloring
2/3 cup white sugar
30 milk chocolate candy kisses (such as Hershey's KissesÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, vanilla extract, peppermint extract, and green food coloring in a large bowl.  Use an electric mixer to beat until soft peaks form.
Beat sugar into egg whites one tablespoon at a time. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form, and mixture is glossy and very smooth, 4 to 5 minutes.
Drop the meringue by half teaspoons onto prepared cookie sheet; top with chocolate kisses. Spoon a scant teaspoon of meringue over chocolate, and smooth to cover completely.
Place cookies in the preheated oven; turn oven off. Leave meringues in oven overnight, or until oven has cooled completely.
