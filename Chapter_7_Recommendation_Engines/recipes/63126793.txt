Ingredients:
2lbs. fresh mussels, scrubbed and debearded
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup white wine
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
1 bunch fresh Italian parsley, chopped
3 roma tomatoes, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place mussels in a large bowl with cold water to cover.  Sprinkle with a little flour (this helps mussels release and sand and dirt) Let them soak for about 20 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Add shallots garlic, and saute for a few minutes, but do not brown. Add the tomatoes, and cook until almost tender. Pour in the white wine, and stir in the butter. Bring to a boil, and allow to boil until the liquid has reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Add the mussels to the pot, cover and allow to cook until the shells are opened, about 7-10 minutes.  Add the parsley right before done. Transfer the mussels and sauce to a large serving bowl, discarding any unopened shells. Serve with lemon wedge. YUM!
