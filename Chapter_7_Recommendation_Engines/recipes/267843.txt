Ingredients:
3 large Gala apples, peeled and cubed
12 tablespoons butter, divided
4 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided
1 cinnamon stick
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped toasted pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan.
Combine apples, 4 tablespoons butter, honey, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan over medium heat. Cover with a lid and cook, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.
While apples are simmering, sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine remaining 8 tablespoons butter, remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat together until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time; beat until fully incorporated. Add vanilla extract.
Discard cinnamon stick and mash cooked apples. Add mashed apples and pecans to the batter. Use a rubber spatula to mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Transfer batter to the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack.
