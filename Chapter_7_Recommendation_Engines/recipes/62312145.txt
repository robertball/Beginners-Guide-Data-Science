In a bowl, mix the soy sauce, garlic, garlic chili sauce, and honey.
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the broccoli, and fry for  3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the soy sauce mixture. Continue cooking and stirring 2 minutes, or until the liquid is nearly evaporated. Serve immediately.
