Description: 
This is one of the most delicious, addictive things I've ever tasted, and it takes about 5 minutes to make! It doesn't have a traditional dressing consistency (it's more like a dip,) but it is great on salads and with raw snack veggies! The best part is that it is rather strong, so a little goes a much longer way than other dressings!
