Ingredients:
2.5 pounds bulk mild Italian sausage
18 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 large onion, diced
2 tablespoon minced garlic
20 boullion cubes & 18 cups of water (for broth)
5lb bag potatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup heavy cream
2 bunch fresh kale, tough stems removed

Directions:
Cook the Italian sausage in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes.
For reduced fat content, optionally drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven.
Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour the water and boullion cubes into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat.
Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes.
Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream, kale and the cooked sausage; heat through.
