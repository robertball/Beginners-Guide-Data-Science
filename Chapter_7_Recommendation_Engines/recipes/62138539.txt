Ingredients:
1 gallon of water
2 cups chicken stock or broth
2 1/2 pounds chicken breast
1/2 cup soy sauce (low sodium recommended)
1 inch of fresh ginger or 1 teaspoon dried ginger
4 large carrots, sliced
1 6 oz. jar of sliced mushrooms, drained
6 green onions, sliced (green and white parts)
1 package of dried chow mein noodles

Directions:
Combine water, chicken stock and chicken in a large stock pot and boil chicken for about 20 minutes.
Remove chicken from pot and shred or chop into bite size pieces
Return chicken to the pot
Add soy sauce, ginger, carrots, mushrooms, and green onions to the pot and simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes.
Add chow mein noodles and simmer until they are tender and have puffed slightly.
Note: After refrigerating, the noodles may soak up all of the broth.  You can just add more water or chicken stock to make it thinner.
