Ingredients:
Bread Pudding:
1 (16 ounce) loaf French bread
6 large eggs
1 cup milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped dried dates
1/2 cup white chocolate morsels
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup vegetable oil
Sauce:
1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup white chocolate morsels
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon rum extract

Directions:
Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs. Then add milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon, baking mix, and vanilla and mix well. Stir in the dates, white chocolate morsels, dried cranberries, and pecans. Fold in the bread cubes and mix well. Let bread soak up the mixture for 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium high heat. Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, scoop the bread pudding mixture, packing firmly. Place the scoop of bread pudding in the hot oil. Place a few in the skillet. Do not overcrowd, and leave room to flip the cakes.
Cook until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and press down with a spatula until about 1/2 inch high. Brown the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove cakes and drain on cooling grate. Repeat until all bread pudding cakes are done.
Prepare the sauce: Bring the heavy whipping cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Take off the heat and add white chocolate, cinnamon, and rum extract; stir until smooth and completely melted. Sauce will be fairly liquid. Pour over the bread pudding as desired.
