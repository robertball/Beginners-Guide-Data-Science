Ingredients:
2 acorn squash
1 red onion, chopped
1 cup chopped cooked turkey
4 eggs
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place squash on a baking sheet. Grease a pie dish.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool squash until able to touch, about 15 minutes; cut in half, remove seeds, and scoop meat into a bowl.
Mix squash, onion, turkey, eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; pour into prepared pie dish.
Bake in the oven until edges become lighter in color and middle is set, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy quiche, sweet and delicious. You could add cream to make it a true quiche. When you cook any squash, it is leisure time. There is no need to watch the oven too closely. You can use chicken instead of turkey if desired.
