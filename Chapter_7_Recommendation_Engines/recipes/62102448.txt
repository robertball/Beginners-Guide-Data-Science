Ingredients:
8 egg yolks
2 c. white sugar
1 cup strong coffee
4 squares, melted, unsweetened chocolate
2 tsp. vanilla
2 tbsp. dark rum
1 lb. unsalted butter, cut in cubes

Directions:
Beat egg yolks until thick, meanwhile cook coffee and sugar on medium high heat until a spoonful dribbled from above, forms a thread that 'floats' from the last drop. Do not overcook or it will be grainy. Under cooking will cause it to be thin.
Slowly pour hot syrup into egg yolks beating constantly.
Add melted chocolate, vanilla and rum.
Beat until mixture is room temperature. This is very important because, if you add the butter too soon, it will melt and the buttercream will be too thin to hold its shape.
When it is room temperature add cubed butter, a few pieces at a time.
Beat thoroughly and chill for an hour.
Remove from fridge, beat until fluffy.
Spread evenly on cake layers.
Sprinkle top and sides with flaked filberts or brazil nuts and refrigerate.
This recipe can also be used to make chocolate buttercream by simply substituting water in place of coffee.

Description: 
Remember the cool, creamy smooth of Swiss chocolate? Here is that same texture quality in a torte.
This recipe was my Mums. Where she got it, I don't know. I do know it's the very best of all buttercreams.
I use this recipe with a simple 6 layer egg cake made in 2 jelly roll pans. I have never attempted this recipe with a hand mixer because of the time it takes to beat it until it is room temperature. I strongly advise using a stand mixer for this recipe.
