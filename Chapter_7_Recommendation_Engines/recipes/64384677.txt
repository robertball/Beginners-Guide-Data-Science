Ingredients:
200 grams rice semolina
100 ml warm water
1/4 tsp salt
1 or 2 Tbsp warm water for correcting the final dough
extra rice semolina for correcting and dusting

Directions:
Melt the salt in the warm water.
Add the water to the rice semolina in a bowl.
Mix together until you get a ball that you can work with. The mixture should be slightly wet where it barely sticks to your hands.
Knead the dough until it is a bit stiffer than in the beginning.
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.
Remove from the refrigerator and separate into 4 pieces. Use a very small amount of semolina to dust your work table and work each piece of dough into a cylinder/snake shape.
Dust your hands lightly with semolina and pinch off a one-inch piece and with your thumb make a dent while rolling it away from you.
Let sit for about 7-8 minutes before cooking in salted water. The pasta is done when it floats to the top. Do not stir the water while the pasta is boiling. Do not use a colander to drain the pasta, use a slotted spoon to scoop out the cooked pasta from the water.

Description: 
Rice semolina is used to make a gluten free version of the famous little ear pasta that comes from the Puglia region of Italy. No eggs or gum binders are needed; they hold up to being boiled and tossed with sauces or saut√©ed in the famous broccoli rabe dish Orecchiette con le Cime di Rapa. Their shape is perfect for your favourite tomato sauce as it pools inside the indentions getting lots of sauce in each bite.
