Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter (1.5 sticks)
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2.5 cups all purpose flour
1 teasoon baking powder

Directions:
Using a stand mixer, mix the butter and sugar til combined.
Add the eggs and vanilla, mix til well combined.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour and baking powder.
Add the flour/baking powder to the mixer (while it is on low) very slowly until it is all combined.
Chill in plastic in the fridge for at least one  hour (will keep for days, weeks probably).
Preheat oven to 350.
Sprinkle flour and roll out cookies. Use cookie cutters to make shapes. After you have made as many as possible, gather the scraps into a ball, roll out again, use the cookie cutters... repeat until all the dough is used.
Bake directly on a baking sheet approximately 7-9 minutes (will depend on the thickness of your cookie)
