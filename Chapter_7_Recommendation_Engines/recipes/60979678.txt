Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 cup diced pitted dates
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine all purpose flour, white whole wheat flour, baking soda, salt, and ginger; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in oats and dates. Cover, and chill dough for at least one hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Flatten each cookie with a large fork.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
My family loves these oatmeal cookies, and with my made-over version, they are a great way to sneak extra fiber and grains into their diet! I reduce the sugar, add whole wheat, use rolled oats and add dates (for extra fiber!).Modified from: Soft Oatmeal Cookies
