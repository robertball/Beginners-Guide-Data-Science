Ingredients:
1 tbs EVOO
2 links hot Italian Sausage crumbled
1 small onion rough chopped
4 large cloves garlic, minced
3 tsp dry oregano
4 cups chicken broth
1 14 oz can Navy beans, rinsed
1 14 oz can low salt, diced tomatoes
1/2 package fresh spinach, washed and torn to bite size
2 cups elbow macaroni cooked to al dente
1/2 cup shaved parmesan cheese
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
In a Dutch oven or heavy pot, lightly brown the sausage, add the onion and garlic cook just until onion becomes
translucent.
Add oregano and chicken broth, beans and tomatoes
Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occassionally.  (The longer the better - tastes even better next day)
Just before serving add the torn spinach to the pot and stir.  The heat will wilt it.
Cook macaroni according to package directions to al dente.
Put 1/2 cup of pasta in each soup bowl and fill with soup.
Top each bowl with cheese and a grind of fresh pepper.

Description: 
My daughter's MIL is a bit of a purist when it comes to Italian food.  When DD served this soup her MIL said she liked it and asked what it was called.  DD asked her what she would call it and was told it is ALMOST Pasta Fagioli.
