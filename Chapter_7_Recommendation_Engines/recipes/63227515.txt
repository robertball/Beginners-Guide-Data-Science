Ingredients:
2 large, seedless cucumbers - peeled & sliced
2 large, white onions - sliced
apple cider vinegar - to taste

Dill - to taste

Directions:
Combine the cucumbers and onions in a large bowl. Add enough water to cover. Then add a few tablespoons of sea salt, depending on your taste. Let this marinate in the refrigerator overnight or at least a few hours.
Remove from fridge and pour out about half of the water and replace it with vinegar. Add in some dill and stir.
Let chill several hours before serving.

Description: 
This is very similar to other cucumber salad recipes I've seen on this site. The difference is that it doesn't involve using sugar or boiling the water first.
My grandma made this all the time and I could never get enough of it. Yum!!
