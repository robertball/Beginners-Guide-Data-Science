Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 small celery rib, chopped
1 small carrot, grated
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup soft bread crumbs
1 teaspoon butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the turkey, mushrooms, soup, celery, carrot, parsley and pepper. Divide the mixture into two greased 2-cup baking dishes. In a small bowl, toss bread crumbs with butter. Sprinkle half over each dish. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly.

Description: 
To change up the flavor, I sometimes substitute leftover cooked chicken for the turkey and stir 1/2 cup of seedless white grapes into the mixture just before adding the topping.
