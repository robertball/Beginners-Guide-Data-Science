Description: 
My wonderful Armenian husband taught me how to cook when we were newlyweds over thirty years ago. This is one of his aunt's recipes - I like it better than Rice Pilaf. The basil is what really makes this dish stand out.
 Believe it or not, adding ketchup to the finished dish tastes mighty good. You could always add a half of a can of diced tomatoes or an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, too!
