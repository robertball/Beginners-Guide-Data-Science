2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 leeks, white part only, thinly sliced

1 rib celery, chopped
1 cup dry white wine
2 1/2 quarts water
1 bouquet garni
10 whole black peppercorns

Directions:
Wash fish in cold water and drain well.
Melt butter in a pan over low heat. Add leeks, carrot, and celery; cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add fish parts, wine, and water and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Skim and discard residue. Add bouquet garni, peppercorns, and lemon; return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes; skim and discard residue frequently.
Strain stock into a bowl through a colander lined with cheesecloth. Allow to cool before storing in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
