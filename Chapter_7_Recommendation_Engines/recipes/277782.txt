Ingredients:
1 bunch kale
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ras el hanout
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon coconut oil
1/2 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Wash kale and shake almost dry. Leave a little water clinging to the leaves. Remove tough stems and coarsely chop or tear the leaves.
Mix garlic, ras el hanout, and salt together in a small bowl with a fork.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 of the kale. Stir until starting to steam. Add remaining kale and stir again. Cook until leaves are dark green and wilting, about 5 minutes. Push leaves to one side of the skillet. Add coconut oil to the empty side and let melt. Pour ras el hanout mixture into the pool of oil and stir until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
Pour coconut milk into the skillet and stir well. Saute until sauce starts to thicken, 4 to 5 minutes.
