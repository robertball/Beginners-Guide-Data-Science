Description: 
This dressing is lovely yellow color, and we use it on a mixed green salad (mixed Romaine and European greens), tossed with small broccoli and cauliflower florets, raisins or sweetened dried cranberries, and shredded Cheddar or crumbled Gorgonzola cheese. The sweet-tart zestiness of the dressing perks up the salad! The yield depends on how much salad dressing you prefer. For us, this recipe makes enough dressing for about 4 large salads.
