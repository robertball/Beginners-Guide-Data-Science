Description: 
This is my favorite dressing of all time and I usually make a largish batch and store in the fridge - it is sweet and sharp and tastes especially great with bitter greens. The trick is to finely grate the garlic (I use a Microplane®) plus the secret ingredient, maple syrup. I like my dressings sweet, but just use less maple syrup if you like your dressings more tart.
