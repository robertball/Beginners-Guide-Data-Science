Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
3 tablespoons flax seed meal
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups raw cane sugar
1 cup vegan butter, softened
1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, flax seed meal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Combine sugar, vegan butter, and cinnamon applesauce in a separate bowl. Mix until smooth. Pour into the flour mixture; beat until thoroughly combined. Fold in walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cookie comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These vegan cookies are amazing. Share these with friends before telling them they're vegan, they're sure to be surprised. I used Earth BalanceÂ® butter spread if you happen to be unsure if the substitute you use is vegan. I also made the applesauce myself because its simple, and because you can control the sweetness. I personally always use whole wheat or white whole wheat flour when I bake, and I love to add flaxseed meal in everything I can. It just makes everything taste better, and adds plenty of fiber and protein to delicious baked goods. (If you insist, you can use butter.)
