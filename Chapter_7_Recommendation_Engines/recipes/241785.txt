Ingredients:
1 tablespoon chia seeds
1 ripe banana, broken into pieces
2 eggs
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon dark cocoa powder, or more to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 pinch sea salt
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or more as needed
1/4 cup blueberries, or more to taste

Directions:
Blend chia seeds in a blender until powdery, 3 to 5 seconds. Add banana, eggs, flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and sea salt; blend, occasionally scraping sides down, until batter is smooth.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; add coconut oil. Pour 1/2 of the batter into the hot oil and sprinkle 1/2 of the blueberries onto the batter. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter and blueberries, using more coconut oil if needed.

Description: 
This is a fast delicious high protein breakfast packed with antioxidants. It's very adaptable and can be made paleo friendly by omitting the flour. I hope you like it as much as I do! I top mine with organic butter and organic maple syrup or raw organic honey.
