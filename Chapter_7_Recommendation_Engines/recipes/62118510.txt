https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/1044071.jpg
Ingredients:
1 loaf frozen bread dough
4 slices hard salami
4 slices thin or chipped ham
4 slices american cheese
1 cup mozzerella cheese
bulk sausage, cooked and crumbled (about 3/4 c for each stromboli)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pat out bread dough, to about 3/4" thickness.
Lay salami in middle of dough.
Add ham and american cheese.
Add cooked sausage, then mozzerella and salt and pepper if desired.
Wrap dough to cover ingredients pinching and sealing edges very well to prevent leakage.  I like to brush with slightly beaten egg whites for a nice brown top.
Bake at 425 degrees for 17 to 20 minutes.
Serve with marinara sauce for dipping or enjoy as is.

Description: 
This is a baked sandwich using frozen bread dough, meats and cheeses. The meats and cheeses can be changed to suit your taste!  My picky eaters LOVE this for easy night! GREAT served with a soup!  I buy the package of 3 bread loaves and triple all ingredients.  My family fights over the left overs!!!
