Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs
1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (15 ounce)can cooked pumpkin
4 ounces cream cheese
Sunflower seeds or chopped nuts, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease or line a muffin tin.
Combine flour, spices and baking soda in a small bowl and set aside.
Cream eggs with brown sugar in large bowl, add vegetable oil and canned pumpkin, mix to combine. Add flour/spice mixture to creamed mixture and mix until just combined.
Fill greased or paper lined muffin tins half full. Use approximately 1 teaspoon cream cheese per muffin and poke it down in the center. Sprinkle with optional seeds or nuts.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center (avoid cream cheese) comes out clean. Let cool in pan 5 minutes and remove to a rack to cool completely. Be extra careful, the cream cheese stays hot for a while!

There's nothing I like better than a certain coffee chain's  Pumpkin Spice Latte and one of their Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins. I don't like paying the price, so I cloned them, to the best of my ability, at home.
