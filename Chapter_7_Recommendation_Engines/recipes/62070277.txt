Ingredients:
1/4 cup melted margarine
1-250 g pkg. marshmallows (approx. 40)
1 tsp. vanilla
5 1/2 cups Rice Crispies Cereal
Coloured marshmallow chicks
Assorted colored Easter eggs

Directions:
Melt margarine, and marshmallows in microwave.  Add vanilla and Rice Crispies, and mix till combined(just like Rice Crispie Squares).  When mixed, divide the Rice Crispie mixture into sections.
Here's where the kids can help, with well-greased hands, form each section into a bird's nest shape.  Sometimes using a bowl can help, but I find my hands work just fine!  Wrap individually in plastic wrap to set.
Place about 2 marshmallow chicks and a few eggs into each nest(depending on the size of the nests).  Rewrap to keep fresh, then enjoy.

Description: 
Rice Crispies form the nests in which sit marshmallow chicks and coloured eggs.  These are great to give out at school functions, especially when you give them as treats in clear, plastic bags decorated for Easter.  My mum used to make these for my class and I every Easter!
