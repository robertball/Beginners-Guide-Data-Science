Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons milk
Filling
4 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon ground coffee (not instant)
4 tablespoons butter or shortening, softened to room temp
3-3 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. In a mixing bowl, beat sugar and oil until crumbly. Add eggs and beat well. In separate bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.
Gradually beat flour mixture into sugar mixture. Add milk and mix together well.
Scoop out small mounds of batter and place 2 inches apart on a greased or parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake at 425 for 5-6 minutes or until tops are cracked. Cool for 3 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool.
Filling: Heat milk slightly and add coffee grounds. Let steep until cool. In a mixing bowl, beat together butter and confectioners' sugar. Strain the milk and beat into the sugar until fluffy.
Spread filling generously on to flat bottom of cooled whoopie pie and top with another whoopie pie to make a sandwich.

Description: 
Being Canadian, I had never had a Whoopie Pie, but I've heard of them. I looked at a few recipes and decided to add coffee to the filling to cut some of the sweetness. These seemed to go over well during snacktime at church, so I'll be making them again.
