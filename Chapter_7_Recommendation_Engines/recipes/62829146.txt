Ingredients:
1 lb. Ground Beef
1/2 Medium Onion, chopped
1 Taco Seasoning Packet (or homemade equivalent
1 can Diced New Potatoes
1 can Whole Kernel Corn (or frozen equivalent
20-24 Taco Size Corn Tortillas
2 cans Medium Enchilada Sauce (or homemade equiv.)
2 cups Shredded Mozzerella Cheese
2 cups Shredded Sharp Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Spray two 9x13 baking dishes with non-stick cooking spray.  Pour enchilada sauce into shallow bowl wide enough to dip tortillas into.  Combine two cheeses into a separate bowl.  In a large skillet, brown ground beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink.  Drain liquid from meat.  Add taco seasoning, potatoes and corn to meat and simmer over low heat for approximately 15 minutes.  Dip tortillas in enchilada sauce, gently scraping side of bowl to catch drips.  Transfer tortilla to baking dish and fill with approximately 2-3 tablespoons of meat mixture.  Add approximately 1-2 tablespoons of shredded cheese.  Roll and place in baking dish.  Repeat until all meat mixture is used.  Spoon remaining sauce over enchiladas.  Cover enchiladas with remaining cheese.  Bake in 350 degree oven for approximately 20-30 minutes, until cheese is slightly brown and bubbly.
