Ingredients:
2 cups dry great Northern beans

Directions:
Pour beans into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Cover with a few inches of cool water. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual; set timer for 28 minutes on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain beans and let cool.

Description: 
Instead of buying canned beans, I use my pressure cooker to cook them from dry--no soaking required! If you do decide to soak the beans, check your appliance manual because cooking time will be shorter.
