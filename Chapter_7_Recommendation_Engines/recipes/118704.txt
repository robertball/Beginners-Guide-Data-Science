Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole beef tenderloin, trimmed
2 teaspoons olive or canola oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Tie tenderloin at 2-in. intervals with kitchen string. Combine oil and garlic; brush over meat. Combine the basil, rosemary, salt and pepper; sprinkle evenly over meat. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
