Ingredients:
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon minced onion
1.5 cups flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon seasoning salt

Directions:
In a deep fryer, heat 1 inch of fat or oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a medium mixing bowl combine all other ingredients, blend well and let stand for 10 minutes.
Use a serving spoon to scoop up tablespoon size pieces of batter and gently drop them into the oil. Rise the spoon as needed to keep the batter from sticking.
Cook the hushpuppies, 8 or 10 at a time, until brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and roll on paper towels to briefly drain. Serve hot.
