Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole chicken, rinsed
1  lemon, halved
kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place chicken into a roasting pan and insert lemon halves into the cavity; spread kosher salt over outside of chicken.
Roast in the preheated oven until skin is browned and crisp, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching bone, reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour. Let chicken rest for 15 minutes before carving.
