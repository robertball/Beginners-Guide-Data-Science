Ingredients:
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 (16 ounce) package frozen Brussels sprouts
1/2 pound smoked bacon, diced
1 large onion, minced
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
3 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; dissolve bouillon cube in the boiling water. Add Brussels sprouts; cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, leaving bacon drippings in the skillet.
Cook and stir onion in bacon drippings until transparent and tender, about 10 minutes. Add honey and soy sauce; stir until liquid starts to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in Brussels sprouts, bacon, raisins, and pine nuts; cook until Brussels sprouts are heated through and well coated, 3 to 5 minutes. Garnish with sesame seeds before serving.

Description: 
An easy recipe for Brussels sprouts. The mix of honey and soy sauce give it an original and interesting flavor.
 Serve with plain rice, white or whole grain. Great with sausages or pork chops. I do not add salt and pepper, as the bouillon cube, soy sauce, and bacon give enough flavor for our taste. 
You may cook the sprouts in a microwave instead of boiling if you prefer.
