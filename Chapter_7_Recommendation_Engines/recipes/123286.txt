Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter, melted
1 (14 ounce) package caramels
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; stir in butter. Set aside 1 cup for topping. Press remaining mixture into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
Meanwhile, combine caramels and cream in a heavy saucepan or microwave-safe bowl. Cook over low heat or microwave until melted, stirring often. Sprinkle chocolate chips and peanuts over the crust; top with caramel mixture. Sprinkle with reserved oat mixture. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until topping is golden brown. Cool completely before cutting.

Description: 
With goodies like chocolate, peanuts and caramel peeking out from between golden oat and crumb layers, these bars are very popular. They taste like candy bars but with irresistible homemade goodness. -Ardyce Piehl, Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin
