Ingredients:
1.5 pounds hot Italian sausage
1/4 cup white wine (optional)
1 medium onion, diced
2 cups diced carrots
1 can (15 ounces) cannellini beans, drained
2 cans (14.5 ounces) fire roasted diced tomatoes
1 quart chicken broth
Parmesan rind (optional)
1 bunch Swiss chard, stems removed and chopped

Directions:
In a large dutch oven over medium high heat, brown the Italian sausage with the white wine, using a wooden spoon to break it up.  Drain the fat from the pot once browned.
Add onions, and cook until softened, 3-4 minutes.
Add the carrots, beans, tomatoes, chicken broth, and optional Parmesan rind.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 30-45 minutes, until carrots are cooked.
Stir in the chard, and simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes.  Serve with grated Parmesan for garnish.
