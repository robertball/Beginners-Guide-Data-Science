Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf round bread
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 cup cooked ham, diced
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut a circle in the top of the bread. Remove top, and set aside. Hollow out the loaf, reserving removed bread for dipping.
In a medium bowl, mix the Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, ham, green onions, green chile peppers, and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon into the bread bowl, and replace the top. Wrap loaf tightly in foil, and place on a baking sheet.
Bake until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, cut reserved bread into small pieces. Toss with oil and melted butter, and place on the baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a yummy appetizer. Creamy, cheesy and spicy - a variety of flavors are blended throughout. A real treat for your palate. Easy to put together, and well worth the time in the oven. You can bake the scooped out pieces of bread and use them for dipping.  I usually buy an extra loaf of bread, just for dipping.
