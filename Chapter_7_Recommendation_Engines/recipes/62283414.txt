Ingredients:
Vegetable oil, for frying
1 (15-ounce container) ricotta cheese
2 eggs
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cups seasoned breadcrumbs, divided
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
Tomato sauce, for dipping

Directions:
Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot or deep fryer, until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360º.
Mix together ricotta and eggs. Add mozzarella cheese, 1½ cups breadcrumbs and garlic powder. Roll cheese about the size of golf balls, toss in remaining ½ cup breadcrumbs. Carefully place in oil. Fry a few at a time, about 1 minute 30 seconds.
Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Let cool. Dip in tomato sauce, if desired.
