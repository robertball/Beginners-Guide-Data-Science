Ingredients:
2 quarts popped popcorn
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Place popcorn in a large bowl and set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine molasses, sugar, water, vinegar and butter. Cook, without stirring, over medium heat until the mixture reaches 235 degrees F on a candy thermometer (soft-ball stage). Add baking soda and stir well. Remove from heat and immediately pour over popcorn, stirring gently with a wooden spoon until well coated. When cool enough to handle, quickly shape into 3-in. balls, dipping hands in cool water to prevent the syrup from sticking.

Description: 
Our whole family loves popcorn. These old-time popcorn balls are great anytime, but they're especially fun to pass out to trick-or-treaters or to use at Christmastime as stocking stuffers! They always look appealing when covered in a clear warp and tied with a festive ribbon.
