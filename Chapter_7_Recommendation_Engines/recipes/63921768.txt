Description: 
I thought about pulling out the macbook pro to get to allrecipes.com to look up something to make with steak that wasn’t too common and it dawned on me to just make something from scratch. The ideal ingredients (what I could think of off top) of the night happened to be steak, onions, sour cream, and lime zest/juice. This was going to turn into another Mexican dish. When it comes to steak, people rarely think of finely slicing the steak into thin pieces. Thats what happened here.
