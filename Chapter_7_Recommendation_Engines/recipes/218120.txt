Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 onions, peeled and chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound lean ground pork, veal or crumbled sausage
4 cups Heinz® Tomato Juice
1 (455 ml) bottle Heinz® Chili Sauce, Chunky with Sweet Peppers
1 (156 ml) can Heinz Tomato Paste
1 tablespoon Heinz Worcestershire Sauce
12 oven-ready lasagna noodles
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Heat oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add onion, green pepper, garlic and dried herbs; cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until vegetables soften.
Crumble in beef and pork and brown all over, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato juice, chili sauce, tomato paste and Worcestershire Sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes.
Spread 1/4 of the sauce in to a 13- x 9-in (3 L) casserole dish. Top with 3 noodles. Layer with 1/4 more sauce and 1/3 of the cheese. Repeat layers twice, ending with cheese.
Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour. Remove foil and bake for 15 minutes or until golden. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
