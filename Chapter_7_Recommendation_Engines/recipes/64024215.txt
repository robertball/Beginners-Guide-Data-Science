Ingredients:
4 cups granulated sugar
1/4 cup light corn syrup
2 cups heavy cream
coarse salt
2 sticks cold unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla

Directions:
Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook without stirring until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully pour in the cream (mixture will spatter). Stir until smooth. Return to heat and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238 degrees, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon course salt and vanilla and let cook slightly, (10-15 minutes) then stir in butter and let completely cool.
