Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 (24 ounce) jar Sloppy Joe sauce
4 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any fat and set beef aside.
Saute onion and garlic in the same skillet until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add corn and bell pepper; cook until soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Return beef to the skillet. Stir in Sloppy Joe sauce, cream cheese, paprika, salt, and pepper. Simmer over medium-low heat until sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Pour the beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and spread evenly. Top with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Arrange potato nuggets over the top. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the potato nuggets are crispy and golden, about 25 minutes. Serve hot.
