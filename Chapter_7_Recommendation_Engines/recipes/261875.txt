Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup vegetable oil
1 egg, beaten
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, or more to taste
1 cup walnuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cake mix and pudding mix together in a large bowl by hand. Add oil; mix well. Mix in egg. Add banana and mix until combined. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts until evenly distributed. Spread into a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, puffed, and slightly soft to the touch, about 25 minutes. Place on a cooling rack until set, at least 10 minutes.

Description: 
These cookie bars came about when I had a few extra bananas that needed to be used. They are super yummy and really easy to make! After baking they should still be a bit soft and a little gooey. These have been a definite hit!
