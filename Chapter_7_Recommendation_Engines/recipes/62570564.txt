Ingredients:
3/4 c. butter
1 1/4 c. sugar
1 TBLS rum extract
1 egg
1 1/2 c. sifted flour
3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa
1 1/2 tsps double action baking powder
1/4 tsp salt

Directions:
Cream butter, gradually add sugar and cream together until light and fluffy. Add extract and egg and mix thoroughly. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Add sifted dry ingredients gradually, mixing well after each additio to make a light dough.  Chill the dough until quite firm (overnight if you have time) Roll the dough out 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly sugared board and cut into rounds. Place on ungreased baking sheet in 375 oven and bake for 8 min. Instead of rolling and cutting and transferring. I found it easier to form the dough into a log, allow it to firm up and then slice thin and bake.
