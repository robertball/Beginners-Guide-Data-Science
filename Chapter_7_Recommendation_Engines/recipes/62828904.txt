Description: 
A sweet, refreshing soup served chilled. For convenience, canned peaches may be substituted for fresh. Also, you can make your own coconut milk if you don’t have any on hand. Blend together ¼ cup coconut flaked with ½ cup water and milk and then refrigerate overnight. Strain the next day for homemade coconut milk.
