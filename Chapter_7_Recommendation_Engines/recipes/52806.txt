Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
1 1/2 tablespoons steak seasoning rub
1 (1 1/2-pound) London broil roast, thinly sliced along the grain

Directions:
Combine the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and steak seasoning in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.
Pour the marinade into a glass or plastic bowl and add the meat slices. Stir to coat and then cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Turn or stir occasionally to marinate the meat evenly.
Preheat the oven to 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Arrange the beef strips on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. If you like, you can sprinkle a little more steak seasoning on it at this point.
Bake for 60 to 90 minutes in the preheated oven, until dry but still pliable. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I am spoiled to this recipe and I know you will be too. It doesn't last long around my house. I've occasionally caught others sneaking a few pieces out of the oven before it was completely finished. Once you try it you will never want to go back to store bought ever again.
