Description: 
This is a very easy shrimp etouffe recipe that utilizes your microwave! I usually add four dashes of hot pepper sauce to the dish, but bring the hot stuff to the table in case someone wants a zestier dinner! This recipe is one I learned while going to school in southern Louisiana - Geaux Tigers!Modified from: Shrimp Etouffee II
