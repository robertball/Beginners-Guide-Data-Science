Ingredients:
2 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp grated lemon rind
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp ground red pepper
2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
1 cup fresh cilantro
1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Cooking spray
2 medium eggplants, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices (about 2 pounds)

Directions:
Heat dry skillet over medium heat. Add cumin and coriander seeds; cook 3-4 minutes or until toasted and fragrant. Crush seeds with mortar and pestle or small heavy skillet.
Add rind, salt, paprika, red pepper, and garlic; mash to form paste. Place spice mixture, cilantro, parsley, and juice in bowl of food processor; pulse until finely chopped, scraping sides of bowl as needed. With processor on, slowly pour olive oil through food chute, processing just until blended.
Heat large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Arrange a quarter of the eggplant slices in pan; cook 3-5 minutes on each side or until browned and tender (slightly charred is better). Place cooked eggplant on platter.
Repeat procedure with remaining eggplant, respraying the pan before each quarter. Drizzle cilantro mixture over eggplant.

Description: 
While not Israeli in origin (chermoula is actually a Moroccan condiment), this dish speaks to the many culinary influences of Israel's North African and Middle Eastern neighbors.
