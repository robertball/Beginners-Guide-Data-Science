Ingredients:
1 large boneless chicken breast
2 tablespoon basil pesto
2 tablespoon lite mayonnaise
3 tablespoons panko breadcrumbs
3 tablespoons finely grated parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Slice chicken breast into 1/2 inch cutlet pieces.  Blend together the pesto and mayonnaise in a small bowl.  In a separate small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.
Heat a medium size skillet over low/medium heat and add the oil.  As the oil is heating, dip each piece of chicken into the pesto/mayonnaise mixture then place it in the breadcrumbs/parmesan cheese, coating both sides of each cutlet.  Place the coated cutlet into the skillet.  Cook each side until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
Remove cutlets from skillet and place on a plate with a paper towel.  Remove from paper towel and serve immediately.

Description: 
I love making homemade pesto and am always trying to think of new ways to utilize one of my favorite ingredients.  This recipe is something I created on a whim and even my wife said they were outstanding.  The pesto and the parmesan cheese make a great combination.  There is nothing better than crispy chicken cutlets bursting with flavors!
