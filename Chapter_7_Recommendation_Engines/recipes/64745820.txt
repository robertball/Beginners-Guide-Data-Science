Ingredients:
7 cups plain popped popcorn, unsalted
8 oz white chocolate chips (such as Ghirardelli Classic White Chips)
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1/8 tsp almond extract (optional)
1/4 tsp salt, or to taste
1 cup shredded sweetened coconut
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1 cup chocolate mini eggs (such as Cadbury Mini Eggs)

Directions:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.
2. Mix popcorn, shredded coconut, almonds, and candy eggs in a large bowl. Toss to combine.
3. Place white chocolate chips in a small microwave safe bowl. Microwave until white chocolate is melted, about 1 1/2-2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Mix in butter and almond extract (if using), until butter is fully melted and incorporated.
4. Pour white chocolate over popcorn mixture and toss to thoroughly coat. Sprinkle in salt, and stir once more. Pour mixture onto prepared baking sheet, and sprinkle with additional salt, if necessary, to taste. Allow popcorn to cool and harden. Store in an airtight container.
Note: Make sure to store this in a  cool, dry, and airtight container, or the popcorn will become soft. It should be eaten within a few days of being made.
