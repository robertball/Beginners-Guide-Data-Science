Ingredients:
1 pound frozen chopped spinach, thawed
2 cups water
4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups half-and-half
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place spinach, water, bouillon, onion, and garlic powder in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until onion is tender.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan and whisk in the flour until smooth. Cook for 2 minutes. Slowly stir in half-and-half; mix until smooth. Pour the cream mixture into the spinach soup, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
