Ingredients:
2 sweet tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
1/2 cucumber, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste, peeled
1 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot Â®), or more to taste
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon water as needed (optional)
1/2 green bell pepper
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, or more to taste, drained and flaked

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, cucumber, and garlic in a high-powered blend; blend until smooth, 15 to 30 seconds. Add olive oil, hot sauce, salt, and pepper and blend until smooth, 5 to 15 seconds. Add about 1 teaspoon water at a time if mixture is too thick and blend until smooth. Add bell pepper to tomato mixture; blend until finely chopped but not liquified, 1 to 2 seconds.
Chill gazpacho in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Top gazpacho with tuna to serve.
