Ingredients:
10 cups popped popcorn
1 1/2 cups pecan halves, toasted
1 1/3 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup butter, no substitutes
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Lightly butter two 15- in x 10- in x 1- in baking sheets. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine popcorn and toasted pecans.
In a large, heavy saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, light corn syrup and cream of tartar. Cook and stir over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook without stirring, over medium heat, until a candy thermometer reads 300-310 degrees (hard crack stage).
Remove caramel mixture from the heat and stir in the baking soda and extracts. Working quickly,  pour the caramel over the popcorn mixture and toss gently.
Spread mixture into prepared pans. Press gently to flatten. Cool completely, then break into pieces. Store in airtight containers.

Description: 
This is absolutely the best, old fashioned, no-bake caramel popcorn. Nuts are optional, but a delicious addition. We have tried several other recipes, but none compare to this one.
