Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 onions, sliced into thin slivers
3 pounds cubed beef stew meat
salt and pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, sliced, or to taste
3 (16 ounce) packages frozen black-eyed peas

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir the onions in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the juices have cooked away, about 30 minutes.
Stir in the garlic and peas; pour in enough water to cover. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and simmer over low heat until the peas change color and are tender and hot, and almost all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a family variation of a Lebanese green bean and meat stew.  I grew up eating this every New Year's, and it is the only way my family will eat their peas! I try to include 1 bag of frozen field peas with snaps in my recipe.
