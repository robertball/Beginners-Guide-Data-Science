Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package angel food cake mix
1 (6 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-OÂ®
1 (16 ounce) package frozen strawberries
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
2 cups boiling water
1 cup water

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, mix together flavored gelatin with boiling water and stir until dissolved. Stir in cold water and frozen strawberries. Chill until slightly thickened to the consistency of egg whites. If adding lots of frozen strawberries, it may reach this stage while stirring.
Cut cake into cubes, or just rip it into bite size chunks and trim off the dark brown edges. Gently fold in frozen whipped topping and cake into the strawberry mixture. Chill until set. Decorate top with any extra topping and strawberries.
