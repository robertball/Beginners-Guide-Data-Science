Ingredients:
2 cups cooked stuffing
1 cup whole-berry cranberry sauce
2 cups chopped, cooked turkey
1 cup cooked corn (frozen or canned, drained)
2 cups mashed potatoes
1 cup gravy

Directions:
Layer the first four ingredients in a 2 quart casserole dish in whatever order sounds best to you.
Top with mashed potatoes.  Poke holes in the mashed potatoes using a chopstick or skewer.
pour gravy over the top of the mashed potatoes.
Bake at 350 F for 20 minutes, or until warmed all the way through.
If you can't let this sit to blend, it might be best to serve the cranberry sauce on the side.  The recipe is very versatile, you can use whatever leftovers you have.

Description: 
A delicious combination of all the Thanksgiving leftovers - stuffing, turkey, cranberry sauce, corn, mashed potatoes and gravy all combine together into a delicious turkey dinner in every bite.  It tastes the best when left to blend overnight, otherwise the cranberry sauce can overwhelm the other flavors.
