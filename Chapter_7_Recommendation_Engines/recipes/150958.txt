Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch chunks
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped carrot
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 canned Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon cumin
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 quarts chicken broth
1 (15.5 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained
1 cup corn kernels, fresh, canned, or frozen
2 limes, cut into wedges
1 (10 ounce) bag tortilla chips, for topping
1 cup sour cream, for topping
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican blend cheese, for topping

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the squash, and cook until it begins to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion, celery, and carrots. Cook until the onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, chipotle peppers, basil, parsley, and cumin; cook 2 minutes more. Mix in the tomatoes and chicken broth. Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the cannellini beans and the corn; cook just until heated through.
To serve, ladle the soup into bowls. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl, and top with tortilla chips, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkling of Mexican cheese.
