Ingredients:
2 lb boiled med shrimp
1 bottle bloody mary mix ( I like zing zang)
1 finely chopped jalepeno, seeds removed
1 C finely chopped large sweet vidalia or red onion
1 C finely chopped jicama or celery
juice of 4 limes
1 or 2 chopped avocado
2 T worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Place all ingredients EXCEPT AVOCADO into bowl.  Mix gently and refrigerate at least 4 hours to allow flavors to blend.  Add avocado 1 hour before serving.  If serving as appetizer, gently ladle into decorative glasses with a fork and add marinated green beans or celery sticks like a bloody mary. For a meal, serve in bowl with garlic bread and salad.  Also fun is to add a shot of vodka to the glass and drink the liquid when the shrimp and vegetables have been eaten!
