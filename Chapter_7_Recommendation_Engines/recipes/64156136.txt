Ingredients:
9-10lbs tomatillos husked, washed and cored
3  onions quartered skins removed
3 jalapeno peppers (remove seeds to reduce heat)
1 habanero pepper (remove seeds or omit altogether if you want a mild salsa)
8 garlic cloves, peeled
1 bunch cilantro (washed well),
1 cup lime juice (lemon will also work)
2 Tbl dried ground cumin
1.5 tablespoon kosher salt (or to taste)
1 teaspoon cracked black pepper (or to taste)
4 dried chili’s –

Directions:
The easiest way to make this is to put the ingredients into a blender or food processor.  I used my vitamix blender on a low setting so it wasn’t completely liquefied.  You can chop all of the ingredients by hand it just gives you a chunkier salsa (not a bad thing) and takes much longer.  If you use a blender, do the tomatillos first in batches and add to a large saucepan.  Then blend the onion and garlic and add to pan.  You can blend the peppers, lime juice, and entire bunch (cut off roots if attached but leave stems) of cilantro together and add that to the pot.  Then add your salt, pepper, cumin and dried chili’s to the pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Ladle into hot pint jars and process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.
