Ingredients:
2 cups fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
1 medium onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup reduced-fat biscuit/baking mix
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups fat-free milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Transfer to an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with cheese. In another bowl, whisk the biscuit mix, eggs and milk until smooth; pour over cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until set and a thermometer inserted near the center reads 160 degrees F. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
