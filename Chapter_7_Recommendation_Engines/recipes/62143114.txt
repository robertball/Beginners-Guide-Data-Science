Ingredients:
1 Egg
1 Tbls Sugar
1 teas vanilla
1 C milk
1 cup prepared pancake batter, (I use 1 cup Krusteze with 3/4 cup of water)
1 tsp cinnamon
6 slices of bread, preferably on the dry side
6 pats of butter

Directions:
Heat skillet to medium high (add a pat of butter just before putting bread in pan.)
Whisk egg, milk, vanilla and sugar together in a bowl.
In a separtate bowl, prepare your pancake batter.  Any kind will do.  Just make sure that it is not too thick.  Add cinnamon and blend well.
Place a slice of bread in the egg mixure, coating both sides.  Then take that same peice and place in pancake batter, coating both sides.  Place in hot skillet and cook 2-3 minutes per side or until crusty brown.  Top with your favorite condiments and enjoy!
