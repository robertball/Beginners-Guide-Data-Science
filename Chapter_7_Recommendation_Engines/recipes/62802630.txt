Ingredients:
2 pkgs. dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (about 110 degrees)
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup instant potato (flakes)
1/2 cup water
2 eggs
6 cups flour
1 cube margarine or butter, softened
For filling:
1/3 cup softened butter (or more to taste)
3/4 cup brown sugar (or more to taste)
1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon (or more to taste)
may also add raisins
Powdered sugar glaze:
1 1/2 cups unsifted powdered sugar
1 tbsp softened butter or margarine
1/8 tsp vanilla
2-3 tbsp warm water

Directions:
In a small bowl dissolve the yeast in the 1/4 c. warm water.
In a saucepan combine salt, milk, sugar, potato & water and heat until a little cooler than 110 degrees.
In a large bowl beat the eggs and then add the warmed milk mixture, whisking to combine. Add half of the flour to the egg/milk mixture and mix to combine.
Add the dissolved yeast and the other half of the flour. Mix to combine; mix in the cube of butter and turn out onto a lightly floured surface to knead until smooth and satiny (about 10-20 minutes) adding small amounts of flour to prevent sticking.
Turn dough over in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled. Punch dough down. Knead briefly on a lightly floured board to release air; let rest, covered, for 10 minutes.
Then divide dough in half; roll and stretch each piece of dough into a long rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Spread each rectangle with softened butter and then sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon, adding raisins if desired.
Roll up like a jelly roll and pinch the dough ends to seal. Cut in 1 inch width slices and place on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled. Bake about 18-20 minutes in a 350 degree oven until lightly golden brown.
May drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze when nearly cooled: beat together thoroughly 1 1/2 cups unsifted powdered sugar, 1 tbsp softened butter or margarine, 1/8 tsp vanilla and 2-3 tbsp warm water.
