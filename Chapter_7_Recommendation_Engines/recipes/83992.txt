Ingredients:
1/2 red bell pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup water
1 cup vegetable broth
3 plum tomatoes, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained and cut into chunks
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf
1 pinch dried thyme
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch dried rosemary
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch onion powder
1 pinch mustard powder
1 pinch cumin
1 pinch coriander
salt and cracked black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Set oven to broil. Brush red bell pepper lightly with olive oil, and place cut-side down on a baking sheet. Place sheet under broiler, and broil until pepper is blackened and blistered. Remove from broiler, and when cool enough to touch, peel skin. Chop pepper into bite-size pieces.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, celery, and garlic; cook until onion is soft and translucent.
Mix in water, vegetable broth, tomatoes, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and chopped bell pepper. Add brown sugar, cinnamon, cayenne, and red pepper flakes. Add bay leaf, thyme, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Mix in garlic, onion, and mustard powders. Stir in cumin and coriander.
Bring contents to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer, covered, until sweet potatoes begin to disintegrate, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and cracked pepper to taste. Stir in fresh parsley, and serve.

Description: 
Contrasting the flavors of sweet (roasted red bell pepper and sweet potato), spicy (cayenne and crushed red pepper) and earthy (black eye peas) was the inspiration for this dish.  Equally tasty whether served hot or cold.
