Ingredients:
3 cups prepared spaghetti squash (6 greens)
1 tablespoons olive oil (3 healthy fats)
1 clove garlic, minced (1 condiment)
1 cup chopped tomatoes (2 greens)
1/2 cup chopped zucchini (1 green)
3/4 cup crumbled reduced fat feta cheese (1 oz per serving 1/4 lean)
1 teaspoon basil (1 condiment)
10 Olives, chopped (Optional - 2 Healthy Fats)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Place spaghetti squash cut sides down on the prepared baking sheet, and bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a sharp knife can be inserted with only a little resistance. Remove squash from oven, and set aside to cool enough to be easily handled. Use a large spoon to scoop the stringy pulp from the squash and set aside 3 cups. Save the rest for later. Go here for a tutorial making the squash using a microwave.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic in oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, zucchini, and olives and cook only until warm.
Toss squash with the sauteed vegetables, feta cheese, and basil. Serve warm.
