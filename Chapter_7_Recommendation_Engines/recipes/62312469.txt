Ingredients:
8 ounces spaghetti, coocked and drained (or, if you prefer, enough macaroni for 4 servings)
1 cup grated cheese (I use flamengo cheese, a common cheese here in Portugal. You can use cheddar or edam)
Béchamel sauce:
4 cups milk
4 ts all-purpose-flour
salt, ground pepper, grated nutmeg

Directions:
Season 3 1/2 cups of milk with the salt, the pepper and the nutmeg. Put it in a pan on the stovetop until it starts boiling.
In the meanwhile, mix the remaining milk with the flour, until it's creamy and without any chunks.
When the seasoned milk starts to boil, pour in the batter. Mix continuously with a spoon, until it thickens. Remove from the heat.
Mix the spaghetti with the cheese in a backing tray and pour the béchamel sauce on top of it.
Bake it in high heat for 10-15 minutes, or until brown spots start to appear on the top layer.
