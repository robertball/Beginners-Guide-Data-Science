Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef roast
1 (32 ounce) carton beef broth
2 cups water
1/4 cup polenta (coarse or fine)
8 red potatoes, cut in half
1 onion, quartered
1 1/2 pounds slice of pumpkin (calabaza)
2 ears corn, cut into thirds
1 carrot, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1 small red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 stalk celery, cut into chunks
1 leek, split in half, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon mild paprika
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves (lightly packed)

Directions:
Cut the piece of beef into 6 large chunks (one per serving). Place the beef into a large saucepan; pour in the beef broth and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until nearly tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Stir the polenta into the stew along with the potatoes and onion. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Cut the pumpkin into 6, serving-sized pieces, and add to the stew along with the corn, carrot, bell pepper, celery, and leek; simmer until the vegetables are tender, adding more water if needed to barely cover. Stir in the oregano and paprika during the last 5 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into serving bowls, and sprinkle with chopped cilantro.
