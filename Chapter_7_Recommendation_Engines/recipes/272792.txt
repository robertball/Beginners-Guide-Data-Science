Ingredients:
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 eggs, or more as needed
1 cup macadamia nuts
1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 tablespoons ghee, or more to taste
1 pinch sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Line a second cookie sheet with several layers of paper towels.
Mix coconut flour, onion powder, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Whisk eggs thoroughly in a second bowl.
Grind macadamia nuts in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Avoid overmixing or mixture will start to clump. Empty ground nuts into a third bowl; mix in coconut until blended.
Place each shrimp in the coconut flour mixture, lightly coating on all sides. Then dip in the egg, and finally in the macadamia-coconut mixture. Place on the parchment-lined cookie sheet; repeat with remaining shrimp.
Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat until melted; add shrimp. Cook, turning often, adding more ghee as needed, until golden brown and evenly cooked, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Drain shrimp on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

Description: 
My coconut shrimp is a great choice for a keto snack. I like the coarse, long shredded coconut. The smaller the shrimp, the faster they will cook. Serve with spicy aioli sauce.
