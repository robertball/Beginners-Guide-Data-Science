Ingredients:
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/4 cup diced (yellow or purple) onion
2 1/2 cups water
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups quinoa
3/4 cup diced fresh tomato
3/4 cup diced carrots
1/2 cup diced yellow bell pepper
1/2 cup diced cucumber
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic and 1/4 cup onion in the hot oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the water, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and bring to a boil; stir the quinoa into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover. Simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Drain any remaining water from the quinoa with a mesh strainer and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Refrigerate until cold.
Stir the tomato, carrots, bell pepper, cucumber, corn, and 1/4 cup red onion into the chilled quinoa. Season with cilantro, mint, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Drizzle the olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the salad; gently stir until evenly mixed.
