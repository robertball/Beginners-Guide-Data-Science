Ingredients:
1 large head of fresh broccoli (about 1 pound)
1 1/4 cups grated parmesan cheese or Italian cheese blend
2 to 3 cups tomato sauce flavored with garlic (like Newman's)
2 tablespoons sliced green olives (optional)
1 tablespoon black olives (not canned), finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs or Panko
salt and black pepper to taste
1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
fresh parsley
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Boil or steam the broccoli until tender when pricked with a fork (about 15-20 minutes).
Strain to remove any excess water. Transfer the broccoli to a casserole dish and crush it coarsely with a fork. Mix in the tomato sauce, the green olives and about 1 cup of the parmesan cheese. Season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and parsley.
Even out the surface of the preparation with a fork. Sprinkle with the rest of the cheese, the chopped black olives and the bread crumbs. Drizzle with olive oil.
Bake at 350Â°F for 15-20 minutes. Pass under the oven broiler for 1-2 minutes or until slightly golden. Serve warm on its own or as an accompaniment to pasta.
