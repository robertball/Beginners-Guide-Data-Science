Ingredients:
1 head red leaf lettuce
4 green onions (white part only)
1/4 cup soy sauce
5 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Wash, rinse and dry lettuce leaves; cut into bite-size pieces and place in a salad bowl. Slice the white parts of the green onions lengthwise into long thin strips (if they curl as you slice them, they are perfectly thin); add the sliced onions to the salad bowl.
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, water, white sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes.
Directly before serving, pour the dressing over the lettuce and green onions in the salad bowl and toss to coat.
