Ingredients:
2 pork loin butterfly chops, 3/4 inch thick
2 cups water
2 cups quick-cooking rice, uncooked
2 (16 ounce) packages frozen stir-fry vegetables
3/4 cup bottled sweet and sour-style stir-fry sauce
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained

Directions:
Cut chops into 3/4-inch cubes; set aside. Cook rice according to package directions.
Meanwhile, coat large nonstick skillet or wok with nonstick cooking spray; heat skillet over medium-high heat. Stir-fry pork for 3 to 4 minutes or until slightly pink in the center. Remove from skillet and cover. Add vegetables and stir-fry for 7 to 8 minutes, or until crisp-tender; drain any water. Return pork to skillet. Stir in stir-fry sauce and pineapple; heat through. Fluff rice with fork. Serve pork mixture over rice.

Description: 
Use convenience foods to help with getting a meal together. Vary the mix of vegetables to find your family's favorite blend. Sprinkle each plate with chopped peanuts for added crunch and flavor. Or substitute your favorite bottled stir-fry sauce in place of the sweet and sour sauce. Serve with pepper-cheese breadsticks and fresh cantaloupe slices or orange sherbet.
