Description: 
'I've made this salad many times for my husband and me,' Nancy Adams of Las Vegas, Nevada writes of her flavorful and fetching macaroni medley. 'We like it for lunch with pineapple-topped ham slices and sweet potatoes. Or you can stir in a can of tuna into the salad for a complete meal.'
