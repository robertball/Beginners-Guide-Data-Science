Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, softened
1 1/4 cups shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
1 medium firm ripe pear, finely chopped
1 scallion, white and green separated, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
Reynolds KITCHENS® Quick Cut™ Plastic Wrap
1/3 cup finely chopped toasted pecans

Directions:
Stir cream cheese, Cheddar, pear, scallion white, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.
Coat a large piece of plastic wrap with cooking spray. Scoop the cheese mixture onto it. Using the plastic wrap to help you, form the cheese mixture into a ball, then completely wrap in plastic. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
Just before serving, combine pecans and the reserved scallion greens in a shallow dish. Roll the cheese ball in the mixture, pressing to adhere.
