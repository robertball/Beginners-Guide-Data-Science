https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup steel-cut oats
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/2 cup chopped dried mixed fruit
1/4 cup chopped mixed nuts
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine water, oats, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a low simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, to desired chewiness, 10 to 20 minutes. Drain cooked oats in a colander and place them into a bowl.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch pie pan.
Whisk milk, egg, and maple syrup together in a bowl until frothy. Stir egg mixture into oats. Fold in dried fruit, nuts, canola oil, and cinnamon until batter is combined and pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and oatmeal has no liquid on top, 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool before cutting into bars.

Description: 
Steel-cut oats in a ready-to-go breakfast bar. Lower your cholesterol and enjoy a nice treat in the morning or take it to go. My boys love it hot or cold, in a bowl or as a square, with milk or maple syrup. It's 5 stars for all of my family. My in-laws tried it and love it as well. Serve with additional maple syrup.
