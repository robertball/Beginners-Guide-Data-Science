Ingredients:
24 mini peppermint candy canes
12 lollipop sticks
Â¾-1 cup any type of chocolate wafers

Directions:
On a parchment lined baking sheet, arrange the candy canes as hearts with the lollipop stick centered in between the two candy canes.
Melt the candy melts in a microwave safe bowl according to package directions.
Spoon the melted chocolate into the center of each heart. Use your finger to smooth out the top. Immediately, top with sprinkles of your choice.
Chill the candy pops in the freezer for 10 minutes until set and hardened.
Remove from the freezer and store the pops in Ziploc bag or place in individual baggies to give away as gifts.
