1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1 1/2 cups milk

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Let stand 10 minutes. In a 2 quart container glass, plastic or ceramic container, combine 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added. Slowly stir in 1/2 cup milk and dissolved yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle. Leave loosely covered at room temperature.

Day 10; stir in 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup milk. Remove 1 cup to make your first bread, give the remaining cup to a friend along with this recipe, and your favorite Amish Bread recipe or you can store the remaining 1 cup of starter in a container in the refrigerator, or begin the 10 day process over again (beginning with step 2).

Description: 
The original recipe is about as basic as you can get, to make it budget friendly I cut the recipe in half which still gives you enough starter to make one loaf and one starter for a friend.  Using store brand or sale priced flour, sugar and milk helps save on this recipe.Modified from: Amish Friendship Bread Starter
