Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large pot over low heat. Saute onion, celery and chopped green pepper for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and saute for 2 minutes. Season with parsley, Creole seasoning, file powder, salt and pepper. Increase heat to medium high, and add ground Turkey. Cook until turkey is evenly browned. Stir in cabbage, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir rice and cheese.
Stuff each bell pepper half (Peppers cut in halves), and lightly sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Place stuffed bell pepper halves in ungreased baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.  Last step I top with more cheese in the last 15 minutes if you want it cheesier or mix some into your topping of bread crumbs.

Description: 
I love the favor that the peppers put in the filling from just cooking it inside of them.  It also puts a great smell in the house for at least 24 hours.  Enjoy!Modified from: N'Awlins Stuffed Bell Peppers
