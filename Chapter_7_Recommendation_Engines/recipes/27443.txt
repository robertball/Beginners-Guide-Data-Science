Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares German sweet chocolate, chopped
2/3 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
2 1/2 cups sifted cake flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup white sugar
3 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 3 (8 inch) round pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in melted chocolate and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. When cool, frost between layers and on top of cake.
To make the Frosting:  In a large saucepan, combine evaporated milk, 1 cup sugar, egg yolks, 1/2 cup butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Cook and stir on medium heat for about 12 minutes, or until thick and golden brown. Remove from heat. Stir in coconut and pecans. Cool to room temperature, and spreading consistency.
