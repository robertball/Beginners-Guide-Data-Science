Ingredients
FOR CHICKEN FRIED STEAK
oil or shortening, for frying
6 -8 beef cutlets, tenderized (round or cube steak)
3 -4 cups seasoned flour (flour with savory seasonings of your choice or Seasoned Flour)
3 eggs
2 cups milk
FOR CREAM GRAVY
1/4 cup flour
salt and pepper
4 cups milk
1 -2 tablespoon dripping, included the cooked bits

Directions:
Heat about 1/4-1/2 inch of oil or shortening in a frying pan.
Beat eggs then combine with milk.
Dredge tenderized beef cutlets in flour, then egg-milk wash, then a second time in flour.
Place dredged cutlets into heated oil and fry until golden, about 10 minutes.
Turn steak over and cook for another 5 minutes or so until both sides are golden.
Remove to a plate lined with paper towels and allow to drain.
TIME TO MAKE THE GRAVY: Drain all but 1-2 tablespoons of drippings from the frying pan; leave all the cooked bits you can.
Combine flour and seasonings with milk, then pour into the pan with drippings and bits.
Continually stir/whisk the gravy over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, or until desired consistency.
Taste and add more salt or pepper if necessary.
Serve generously over each piece of chicken fried steak.
Sop up any extra gravy with a biscuit.
