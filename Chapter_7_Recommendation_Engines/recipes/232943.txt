Ingredients:
12  skinless chicken wings
¾ cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
¾ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Rinse chicken wings in cold water; drain and pat dry with paper towels.
Mix flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a 1-gallon resealable bag; add chicken wings. Seal bag and shake to evenly coat chicken.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Remove chicken from bag and shake off any excess coating; fry in the preheated oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Combine hot sauce and butter in saucepan over medium heat; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Coat cooked chicken wings with sauce.

Super easy delicious chicken wings. My wife doesn't like the hot sauce, so she heats BBQ sauce in the microwave and uses that.
