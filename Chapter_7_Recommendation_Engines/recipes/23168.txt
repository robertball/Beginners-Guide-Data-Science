Ingredients:
5 cups vegetable oil for frying

4 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3 ½ cups dry bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place broccoli in a medium saucepan with 1 cup boiling water. Return to a boil. Cook covered until firm but tender, about 5 minutes.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the Cheddar cheese. Mix in the broccoli. Allow the mixture to cool and thicken approximately 15 minutes.
In a medium bowl, mix the bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Spread the mixture onto a large piece of wax paper.
Form the broccoli cheese mixture into balls and roll in the bread crumb mixture until thoroughly coated.
Deep fry the balls until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
