Ingredients:
1/2 cup instant oatmeal
1/4 cup cottage cheese
1/2 cup egg whites
water, as needed
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 dash cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
olive oil cooking spray
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
2 slices Canadian bacon, diced
1 ounce crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Blend the oatmeal, cottage cheese, and egg whites in a blender until smooth; add water as needed to keep the mixture moving. Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper; blend to combine.
Prepare a saucepan with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook the mushrooms in the hot pan until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; set aside.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat; cook the cottage cheese mixture in the hot skillet until bubbles begin to form on the top. Flip the pancake and cook until browned on the bottom; remove from heat. Spread the mushrooms over one half of the pancake; top the mushrooms with the spinach, Canadian bacon, and feta cheese. Fold the other half of the pancake over the fillings like you would an omelet.

Description: 
Savory veggie-filled pancakes for breakfast or any meal. This is my go-to meal when I come home late and don't feel like cooking. Experiment with other veggie, meat, and cheese combinations.
