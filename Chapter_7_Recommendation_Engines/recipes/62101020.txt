Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 beaten egg
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon vegtable oil or melted butter

Directions:
Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.
In a separate bowl, combine egg, buttermilk, vanilla and oil.  Add egg mixture to flour mixture all at once.
With a fork, stir just until moistened.  Batter will be lumpy.  Do NOT overmix.  Add additional buttermilk to thin the batter if necessary.
