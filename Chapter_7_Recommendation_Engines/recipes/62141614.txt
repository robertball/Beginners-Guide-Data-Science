Ingredients:
French Bread cut to 12" size
1/2 C. Munster cheese, grated
1/2 C. Fresh (not pre shredded), Mozzarella, grated
2 Slices Swiss Cheese
2 Slices Provolone Cheese
1 Red Onion
1 tbs. Olive Oil
1 Fresh off the vine tomato, sliced thick
A Handful of baby spinach
Splash of Balsamic Vinegar, (optional)

Directions:
First you need to slice the red onion thin and saute it in the oil slowly until it's caramelized.
Cut the French Bread length wise and take out a little of the extra bread on the inside.
Layer all the cheeses, caramelized onion, tomato, and spinach on the French Loaf. (This is when you sprinkle with the Balsamic vinegar if you like it, I highly recommend it!)
Cook in a panini maker until all the cheese is melted.
But if you are like me and don't have a panini maker use a non stick pan with just a touch of butter or oil. Use something heavy to weight the sandwich down, I used my cast iron pan. Cook on both sides on low so the inside has time to get hot and the cheese is all melted!
