Ingredients:
½ cup mayonnaise
½ cup plain yogurt
2  chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, finely chopped
2 large spinach tortillas
½ cup shredded lettuce, or to taste

1  Haas avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced

1  red onion, finely chopped
1  tomato, chopped
2  cooked chicken breasts, cut into chunks

Directions:
Whisk mayonnaise, yogurt, and chipotle chiles together in a bowl.
Cook tortillas in the microwave until warm and pliable, about 30 seconds.
Spread 1 tablespoon chipotle mayonnaise down the center of each tortilla. Spread 1/2 the lettuce, 1/2 the Monterey Jack cheese, 1/2 the avocado, 1/2 the bacon, 1/2 the red onion, 1/2 the tomato, and 1/2 the chicken, respectively, in the center of each tortilla. Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling into a wrap.

Description: 
I work in a corporate office, and our cafe has a 'wrap station' every Friday and these are a huge hit with everyone. I got hooked so I watched closely and finally made my own version at home; they are so delicious! If desired, place wrap in a panini maker for 1 to 2 minutes, or until wrap has grill marks and cheese is slightly melted.
