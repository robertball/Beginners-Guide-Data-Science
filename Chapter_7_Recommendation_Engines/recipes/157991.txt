Ingredients:
2 (14.4 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 jalapeno chile, seeds and ribs removed
1/2 yellow onion, quartered
1/2 bunch cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Pour 1 can of tomatoes into a blender, and add the jalapeno pepper, onion, cilantro leaves, lemon juice, and salt. Blend until fairly smooth. Pour in the second can of tomatoes and blend briefly. Adjust seasonings to taste by adding more lemon juice and salt. Let the salsa rest for 1/2 hour before serving to allow the flavors to blend.

Description: 
My family begs me to make this during football season, with or without company coming over. It's so easy to make, that I don't mind. Use caution with the jalapeno pepper, however. I recommend using kitchen or disposable gloves. These amounts are the flavor my family likes, but you can use less or more jalapeno pepper depending on your tastes.
