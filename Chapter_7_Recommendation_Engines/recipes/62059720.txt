Ingredients:
1-1/2 lbs. angel hair pasta
2 c. boiling water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
15 sun-dried tomatoes
1/2 c. olive oil
1/4 c. butter
2 heaping Tbl. minced garlic
32 oz. stewed tomatoes, undrained
16 oz. artichoke hearts, drained
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. pepper
1 tsp. dried oregano
1 tsp. dried basil
1/2 tsp. hot pepper sauce
1 lb. large bay shrimp, thawed
Parmesan Cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring large pot of water to a boil, in preparation for boiling pasta.  Add pasta 6 minutes prior to serving.
In a one quart glass container or saucepan, dissolve chicken bouillon cubes in 2 cups of boiling water.  Add sun-dried tomatoes, and soak for 5 minutes.  Remove tomatoes, reserving liquid, and chop coarsely.
In a large, non-stick skillet, combine olive oil, butter, and garlic; saute until garlic just barely begins to brown.  Add chopped, sun-dried tomatoes, reserved liquid, stewed tomatoes, quartered artichokes, and seasonings to taste.
Heat to boiling, adding shrimp to the tomato mixture, just after adding angel hair pasta to the separate pot of boiling water.  Do not overcook shrimp - 5 minutes is sufficient time - or they will become tough.  Pour tomato/shrimp mixture over cooked and drained pasta.  Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired.
