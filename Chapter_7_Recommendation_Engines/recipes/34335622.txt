Ingredients:
1-1/2 Cup Hot Water
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil (any oil)
1 Teaspoon Salt
1/2 Cup Sugar
4-1/2 cups flour (all purpose or soft)
3 Tablespoons Yeast (6 tsp or 1/8 cup)

Directions:
Heat water in microwave for 2 minutes.
Put the ingredients in the machine pan in the manufacturerâ€™s suggested order. If there are no instructions, put water, oil, salt, and sugar in pan.
Then put the flour on top, covering liquid (not mixing).
Make a crater in the flour and pour in yeast.
Put your machine on Express bake or Quick bread setting, around 50-60 minutes for kneading and baking. You can use a normal "white bread" 3 hour setting for a 2 lb loaf.
