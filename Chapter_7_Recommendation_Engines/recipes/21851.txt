1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 tablespoon garlic salt

1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/3 cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 Hungarian hot peppers, cored and seeded

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the sausage, cream cheese, garlic salt, Romano cheese, oregano, basil, bread crumbs and olive oil.
Stuff the peppers with the sausage mixture. Place on a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, until the stuffing is lightly brown and bubbly.
