Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. rib eye steaks (about ½ in. thick)
3 tbs. light brown sugar
2 tbs. ground coriander
1 tbs. ground turmeric
1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
3 tbs. Asian fish sauce or soy sauce
3 tbs. vegetable oil
Singapore Cucumber Relish and Fried Garlic Peanut Sauce (optional, recipes follow), for serving

Directions:
1. Cut steaks into 1/2-in. cubes (do not trim fat). Place in nonreactive mixing bowl. Stir in brown sugar, coriander, turmeric, cumin, pepper, fish sauce or soy sauce, and oil. Let beef marinate in refrigerator, covered, at least 2 hours.
2. Drain beef cubes; discard marinade. Thread beef onto bamboo skewers, leaving bottom half of each skewer bare for a handle and ¼ in. exposed at pointed end. Satés can be prepared to this stage several hours ahead. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to grill.
3. Preheat grill to high. When ready to cook, brush grill grate clean and apply thin coat of oil. Arrange satés on hot grate, with piece of aluminum foil placed under exposed ends of skewers to keep from burning (fold foil in thirds, shiny side out). Grill satés until cooked to taste, 1 to 2 minutes per side for medium-rare, a little longer for medium. (Editor’s note: Beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F.)
4. Serve satés with Singapore Cucumber Relish and Fried Garlic Peanut Sauce, if desired.
