Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs
2 cups of chicken broth
1 1/4 cup of milk
1 stick of butter
1 can of cream of chicken soup
1 1/4 cup of self-rising flour
6 to 8 medium size potatoes

Directions:
Salt chicken thighs and then boil them in water until tender (about 45 min.)Remember you'll need two cups from this broth later or you can buy a large can of chicken broth instead. Peel and cut up potatoes into cubes. Boil them in a separate pot until tender. Put milk and butter in a separate pot and bring to a boil. Stir continuously. Allow milk and butter mixture to then cool COMPLETELY. Debone the chicken and place in the bottom of a large rectangular Pyrex dish. Pour tender potato cubes over the chicken. Mix 2 cups of the broth the chicken was cooked in with the can of cream of chicken soup. Pour over the potatoes and chicken. After the milk and butter mixture have completely cooled begin stirring in a little flour at the time until the entire 1 1/4 cups have been added. Pour this mixture over the chicken and potatoes. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until the crust is brown.

Notes: 
Make sure you use enough water to boil the chicken so you'll have two cups of broth for the recipe. Otherwise, you'll need a large can of chicken broth. 

The crust will be lumpy if you do not allow the milk and butter mixture to cool completely after bringing it to a boil. So you'll want to go ahead and prepare this as soon as you have the chicken and potatoes boiling.
