Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury® Grands!™)
1 (8 ounce) ham steak, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
8 tablespoons shredded Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unroll crescent dough and separate individual rolls at perforations. Place 1 piece of ham and 1 tablespoon of Gruyere cheese in the center of each triangle. Fold over the 2 longer sides of the triangle, overlapping them to seal ham and cheese.
Arrange crescents 1 inch apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool completely on a cooling rack.
Wrap crescents individually with wax paper and place into a large resealable bag. Place in the freezer.
