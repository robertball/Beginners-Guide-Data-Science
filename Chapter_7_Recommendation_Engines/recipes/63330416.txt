Ingredients:
3 lbs Dry Lentil beans -These are used because they are the fastest* cooking beans.  They don't need hours of soaking & are the highest protein beans. *Red lentils especially.

3 lbs of Boneless chicken thighs
2 packs of Williams Chili seasoning mix
3 tsps of fresh ground black pepper
6 tbsp Extra virgin olive oil

3/4 tsp minced garlic
1 lb Freshly diced Roma tomatoes
16 oz Your Favorite salsa; preferences: Pace Picante or Guy Fieri's Chipotle Salsa
1 to 3 Whole, non-diced Habanero peppers (optional - see notes for easy, hands off soaking then in this chili)
Kitchen items needed:
1) Lidded container large enough to mix marinating beef/sliced chicken then place in refrigerator.
2) 4 to 5 gallon soup pot (or a 2 gal for 8 servings)
3) Large skillet to saute' onions. garlic and meats.
4) 9" X 15" cake pan for temporarily shredding the hot chicken
6) Two long-handled, large spoons to hold down & pull apart/shred the hot chicken strips. Shred... Don't cut with knives
7) Obviously, you'll need cutting boards and other utensils too!
8) Kitchen shears for the optional habaneros.

Directions:
Warning:  For 60 minutes...You will be "multi-tasking" this recipe (marinating meat/boiling beans/saute onions,garlic & cooking meat in this busy meal - - so keep distractions to a minimum.
Cut each chicken thigh into 3 LONG, THICK strips. Cut off & throw away any large globs of fat. Mix with broken up ground chuck, chili seasoning & black pepper. Set aside. If preferred: Chill marinate 30 min or overnight
Rinse the lentils under running water & pick through them to remove any bits of soil or rocks. Add lentils, tomatoes & hot tap water (up to top of beans) in soup pot w/lid) & bring to a boil. Turn heat down to low & cover to let the lentils simmer, but leave the lid ajar a bit so that they don’t boil over. Check on them occasionally to make sure the water has not boiled down below the level of the lentils & add more as needed,BUT NEAR THE END use warmed salsa as the liquid additive so the chili is thick and not "soupy".
When the lentils are tender & can easily be mashed with a fork, they are done. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes for them to cook.
Skin & cut the onions into approx. 1/3" size pieces
While the lentils are cooking, In the skillet, do the following.
Heat the olive oil on med-high heat until a piece of onion dropped into it will sizzle.  Now add the chopped onion - Sauté for 4 minutes.
Clear a space in the middle & add the minced garlic. You only leave the garlic there for 30 - 40 seconds until you can smell the garlic cooking. The onions should be translucent** by now.
Add about 1/3 of the chicken/ground chuck marinade to the heated skillet.  Cover & cook on low-med heat for 10 min - place in cake pan.  Repeat this for the rest of the meat. Shred hot chicken the spoons. Mix w/beans. Cook for additional 10 minutes so the flavors merge.
