Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  In a medium bowl, cream butter and vanilla until smooth. Combine the 1/2 cup powdered sugar and the flour.  Stir in flour mixture, nuts and salt until just blended. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and place them 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 10 - 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Immediately roll in remaining powdered sugar. I also like to roll mine in the sugar a second time.
