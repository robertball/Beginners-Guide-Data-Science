Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces
1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
2  dried California chile pods
3  dried red chile peppers
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the tomatillos, California chilies, and red chile peppers into a small roasting pan or a rimmed baking sheet. Roast for about 20 minutes, turning frequently. If the chilies start to get too dark, remove them and place into a food processor or blender.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook, turning to sear evenly on all sides.
Combine the tomatillos and chilies in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Season with salt to taste. Pour this mixture in with the chicken. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until chicken is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Chicken pieces are seared and then simmered in a tomatillo sauce. This is my mother in law's recipe from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. Serve with warm tortillas and your choice of rice or beans as side. We recommend a cold cola pop to accompany your delicious meal.
