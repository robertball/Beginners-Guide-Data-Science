Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose biscuit baking mix
1/2 cup lemon-lime soda
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Whisk baking mix, lemon-lime soda, sour cream in a bowl until batter is smooth. Add more biscuit mix if needed to make the dough smooth, but slightly sticky.
In a small casserole dish distribute 1/4 cup melted butter evenly over the bottom of pan. Spoon or hand form balls of dough into casserole dish.  Save remaining butter to brush on tops halfway through baking.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let biscuits rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
