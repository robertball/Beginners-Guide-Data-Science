Ingredients:
1 cup syrup from canned mandarin oranges, oranges reserved
1 cup apple juice
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (4 pound) precooked spiral-cut ham
2 (10 ounce) jars maraschino cherries
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ham in a deep roasting dish.
Mix syrup, apple juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and cloves together in a small bowl. Pour over ham.
Coat ham with maraschino cherries and crushed pineapple.
Bake ham in the preheated oven, basting every 30 minutes with juices, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 1 hour 30 minutes.
Garnish ham with reserved mandarin oranges.
