Ingredients:
4 cups chopped strawberries
1 cup white sugar
1 cup sour cream
4 cups cold water
1 cup Burgundy or other dry red wine

Directions:
Use a food processor or blender to puree the strawberries. Pour the strawberry puree into a large saucepan, and stir in the sugar, sour cream, water and wine. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring gently for 20 to 25 minutes to fully blend the flavors. Do not allow to boil. Serve warm or chilled.

Description: 
This is an old family holiday tradition. I guess it is the red color, because strawberries sure aren't in season in December. May be served either hot or cold as a first course or a dessert. We always had it as a first course served hot.
