Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 1/2 cups diced onions
8 whole garlic cloves
1 1/2 cups celery, roughly chopped
6 green onions, chopped (use all parts except for root)
1 large yukon gold potato, peeled and diced
6 cups baby peeled carrots (use organic if possible)
10 cups good vegetable stock
4 cups heavy cream
1/2 tsp mild curry powder
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a large (8qt minimum) pressure cooker, melt butter over medium heat.  Once it is hot, add onions.  Season with salt and sweat until translucent.
Add celery, garlic, potato, and green onions.  Stir to combine and continue to sweat for 3 minutes.
Add carrots and stock.  Increase heat to high, put lid on pressure cooker and set valve to 15 PSI or 'high', depending on your pressure cooker.
Once cooker has come up to 15 PSI, reduce heat to medium-high and set timer for 7 minutes.
Once the time is up, transfer cooker to sink and release pressure by pouring cold water over the cooker (this is known as the quick-release method).
Once pressure has been released, transfer back to stove and open the pressure cooker.
Add cream and curry powder and puree with an immersion blender until completely smooth.
Season with salt and pepper to your taste.
Garnish with finely chopped green onions or chives and serve with warm bread.
