Ingredients:
1   cup   raisins
5   tbs   concentrated orange juice
1/2   cup   butter, softened
3/4   cup sugar (can mix 1/2 and 1/2 with brown sugar)
1   large   egg
2   tsp   grated orange peel
1   cup   all-purpose flour
1 1/2   tsp   baking soda
1 1/2   cup   rolled oats
12   oz.   white chocolate chips
1 1/2   tsp   canola oil

Directions:
Combine raisins and juice overnight to soak.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Add egg and orange peel.  Add baking soda and flour until just blended.  Fold in oats and raisins with all the juice.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto a greased baking sheet.  Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes.  Cool on wire rack completely.  Melt chips and oil in microwave, 1 minute first, then 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each.  Do not over heat.  The white chocolate will seize.  Dip cookies into chocolate or spread over half with a knife.  Let set.
