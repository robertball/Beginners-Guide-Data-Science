Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup water
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
Icing:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 tablespoon margarine
1/2 cup miniature marshmallows
1 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish.
Mix flour, 1 cup sugar, mayonnaise, water, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl until smooth; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
Stir 1 cup sugar, evaporated milk, and margarine together in a saucepan; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat, add marshmallows, and stir to melt them completely into the mixture. Stir peanut butter and vanilla extract into marshmallow mixture until icing is smooth; pour over warm cake.

Description: 
This is my mom's recipe handed down from her mother. The cake is very moist and light but it's the icing that makes this cake unresistable!
