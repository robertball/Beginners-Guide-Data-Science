Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Pinto Beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup fresh tomato salsa
1 avocado, diced
1 head romaine lettuce, washed, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 lime, juiced
Salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup sliced green onions
6 cups tortilla chips

Directions:
Line 8-inch springform pan or baking dish with plastic wrap. Set aside.
Mash beans lightly with a fork in a medium bowl.  Add 1 tablespoon of the liquid for a creamier consistency.
Combine beans, sour cream, garlic, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Mix well. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.
Place bean mixture in an even layer in the bottom of the spring form pan. Sprinkle with cheese.
Top with a layer of salsa, scatter avocado on top. Top with shredded lettuce and squeeze lime juice on top. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the green onions. Let sit in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove sides of the springform pan, wrapping or trimming the plastic. Serve on the base with tortilla chips.
