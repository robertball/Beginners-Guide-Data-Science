Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground turkey
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (16 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, undrained

1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
1/2 cup uncooked elbow macaroni
1 cup shredded lettuce

Directions:
Bring a small saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until almost tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Crumble the turkey in a large skillet set over medium heat. Cook and stir until evenly brown; drain.  Add onion to browned turkey meat and cook until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, gravy mix and chili powder until combined then mix in the corn and macaroni.  Cover; reduce heat to low and simmer, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Serve on a bed of tortilla chips topped with shredded lettuce and sour cream.

Description: 
Ground meat, tomatoes and corn with a little spice creates a quick meal everyone loves.  My husband usually requests a double batch! The ground turkey can be replaced with ground beef, pork or chicken.
