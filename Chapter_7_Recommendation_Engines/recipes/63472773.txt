Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 Tbsp orange zest
1/4 cup orange juice
2 large eggs
1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 cup shredded coconut, separated
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tbsp orange juice
pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour one 8 x 4 loaf pan.
Cream butter and sugar until fluffy; beat in eggs, one at a time.  Add orange juice, zest, yogurt and vanilla; mix well.
Sift or whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and 1/4 tsp salt.  Mix into butter mixture, stirring until dry ingredients are just blended.  Stir in 1/2 cup of the coconut, reserving the remaining 1/4 cup.  Pour into prepared pan.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until tester inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool in pan 5 minutes, then remove to wire rack.
Place reserved coconut in small skillet and heat over medium heat until very lightly browned, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat.
Mix together confectioner's sugar, pinch of salt and just enough orange juice to make a thick glaze.  Spread over loaf and immediately sprinkle with toasted coconut.  Let sit until cooled and icing has hardened slightly.
