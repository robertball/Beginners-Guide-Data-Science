2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cup flour

Soften yeast in warm water and let stand for 10 minutes. In large bowl, combine cheese, butter, sugar, salt and soda. Add onion, dill, egg and yeast. Beat or stir well. Gradually add flour, stirring well with each addition. Cover bowl and let stand and rise in warm place until double in size, about 1 hour. Then stir down dough and turn into well greased 1.5 or 2 qt casserole dish. Let rise again about 30 to 40 minutes.
Bake at 350 for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Brush top with butter and sprinkle with salt. Leave in casserole 5 minutes before removing.
(I grease my hands with oleo and work flour in instead of using a spoon)
