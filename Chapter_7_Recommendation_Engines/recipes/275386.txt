Ingredients:
4 ounces lean ground beef
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 tablespoon taco seasoning
1 frozen margherita pizza on cauliflower crust
3/4 cup canned refried beans
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet until browned and crumbly, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain grease from skillet, stir in tomato sauce and taco seasoning, and cook for about 2 minutes. Set aside.
Place frozen pizza on a pizza or round baking pan. Spread refried beans evenly over the crust, followed by a layer of the ground beef mixture. Sprinkle the pizza with shredded Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is crispy, edges are golden brown, and cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes.
