Ingredients:
4 oz thickly sliced pancetta, chopped
1 red onion thinly sliced
1 tsp ground cumin
salt and pepper
1 lb gouda, courselt shredded
2 tbsps all purpose flour
3/4 cup dry riesling
8 soft pretzels, warmed

Directions:
In a medium skillet, cook the chopped pancetta over moderately high heat, stirring occasionaly, until it is crisp, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon,  transfer the pancetta to a plate. Pour off all but 1 tbsp of fat in the skillet. Add the sliced onion, cover and cook over moderate heat until its softened, 5 minutes. Add 2 tbsps of water to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in the cumin and season the onion with salt and pepper.
In a bowl, toss the cheese with the flour. In a medium saucepan, bring the wine to a simmer over moderate heat. Add the cheese in handfuls and stir constantly until each batch is completely melted before adding more. Cook, stirring vigorously, until creamy, about 2minutes longer. Stir in the pancetta and half of the onion and season generously with pepper. Float the remaining onion on top of the fondue and serve with warm pretzels.
