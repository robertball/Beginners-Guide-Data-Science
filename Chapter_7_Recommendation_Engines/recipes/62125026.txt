1/2 cup sugar

5 egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup melted butter

Let yeast stand until foamy then beat well.
Add butter, beaten egg mixture, salt and vanilla to yeast mixture and mix lightly.
Begin adding flour, mixing thoroughly until all flour is incorporated and dough pulls away from bowl.
Remove the dough from bowl and knead on floured surface until dough no longer sticks to hands.
Return to bowl and cover with a damp towel to rise until doubled.
Divide into 4 parts, kneading each part individually a few times before letting rise again for 5 minutes.
Roll each part flat, into a rectangular shape.
Spread filling on each part of dough, leaving about an inch around edges.
Roll each dough/filling like a jelly roll and place on baking sheet.
Let rest 5-10 minutes.
Brush with some melted butter before baking 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven.
Filling:
Beat egg whites stiff, add nuts and sugar and mix well.
Add milk a little at a time until mixture forms a paste.
Crumble topping:
Mix ingredients together until small balls form.
Sprinkle on top of bread before baking.
