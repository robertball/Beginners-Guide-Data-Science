Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound lean ground pork
3/4 cup warm water
2 slightly beaten eggs
1/3 cup picante sauce
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup minced green bell pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed nacho cheese soup (such as Campbell'sÂ® Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Mix the beef, pork, water, eggs, picante sauce, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and bell pepper together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Pack into the prepared loaf pan, then poke holes into the loaf with a fork nearly to the bottom of the pan. Pour the undiluted cheese sauce over the top of the roast and spread evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
