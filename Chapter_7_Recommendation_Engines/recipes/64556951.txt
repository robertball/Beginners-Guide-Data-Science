Ingredients:
For the Dough:
1 Lb Flour
2 Eggs
Pinch of salt
1/2 Lb Butter, cold
Milk, as much as needed
For the Filling:
1 Lb Ricotta cheese
5 Eggs +1 egg for the egg wash
1/4 Lb Provolone - Sharp
1/4 Lb Mozzarella
4 Tbs Grated Pecorino cheese
1/4 Lb Prosciutto
1/4 Lb Sopressata
1/4 Lb ham
Fresh black pepper, as desired

Directions:
In a stand mixer, add the flour, salt and the butter cut in cubes.
Let the flour absorb all the butter. Add the eggs and let them mix well.
Add enough milk (about 1/4 + Cups) until you have a firm ball of dough.
Let it rest.
Prepare the Filling:
I buy the meats and cheese in one piece.  I just ask them to cut it 1 inch thick.
Cut all the meats and cheeses in small cubes and put in a large bowl.
Add the grated Pecorino and mix.
Add the eggs and mix.
Add the ricotta and mix well. Add fresh black pepper as desired. Set aside.
Assemble the Pizza Rustica:
Preheat the oven at 350F
Butter and flour a 9" springform pan.
Cut a little less than 1/3 of the dough and set aside.
With a rolling pin, roll the large piece of dough in a thin circle.
Place the dough over the springform pan so that it overflows the borders of the pan.
Add the filing and spread it evenly.
With a sharp knife, cut the excess dough from around the border of the pan.
With the remaining dough, roll it thin and with a ravioli cutter, cut strips to make the criss-cross strips and arrange them on top of the filling.
Wet the strips with egg wash and bake for about 1 hr and 15 mins.
