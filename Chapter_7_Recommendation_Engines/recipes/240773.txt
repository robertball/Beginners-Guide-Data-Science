Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
2 tablespoons butter
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell's®)
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup (such as Campbell's®)
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef to skillet in small chunks; cook and stir to break the beef into smaller pieces as it cooks until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over the beef mixture, stir, and cook for 1 minute. Stir mushrooms and garlic salt into the beef mixture. Pour mushroom soup and chicken soup over beef, stir, and cook until hot, about 5 minutes; add sour cream, stir until smooth, and cook until again hot, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour beef mixture over the cooked egg noodles.
