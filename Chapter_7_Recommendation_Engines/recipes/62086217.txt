Ingredients:
1/4 lb unsalted butter
2 huge vidalia onions
1 huge red onion
1 minced clove of garlic
1/4 c cognac
1/4 c red wine
1 T flour
3 T fresh thyme
8 c beef broth
1 T of beef soup base
salt and pepper to taste
3/4 lb grated greuyere cheese
Fresh Croutons:
1/2 loaf of day-old french bread
1/4 c melted unsalted butter

Directions:
Slice onions 1/4" thick then into quarter rounds.  Cook onions in a large stock pot in butter over medium heat until carmelized, which could take close to an hour.  Stir occasionally at the beginning and more frequently as time goes on.
While carmelizing, cube bread into big 1" squares.  Shake with melted butter in a large ziploc bag until coated.  Spread on an ungreased baking sheet and bake 15 minutes at 350 until dry and crisp.  Set aside to cool.
When onions are carmelized, add garlic and cook about a minute.  Add cognac and wine and stir until mostly evaporated.  Sprinkle with flour and thyme and cook stirring 3 minutes.  Slowly stir in broth and soup base and bring to a boil.  Drop heat, partially cover with a lid and simmer 20 minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
Ladle soup into large straight sided oven-safe bowls, top with 5 or 6 fresh croutons and grated cheese.  Broil until bubbly and golden.  Serve with a fresh crips salad.  Enjoy!
