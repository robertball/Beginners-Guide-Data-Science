Ingredients:
12 Oysters, Large
1/2 CUP Oyster Liquor And/Or Clam Juice And/Or Water
1 1/2 CUPS Zucchini, 1/8" Slice
1/2 CUP Heavy Cream
13 TBSP Butter, Cut Into 1 TBSP Portions
4 TSP Lemon Juice, Fresh
TT Salt
TT Pepper
TT Cayenne Pepper

Directions:
Open the oysters and pour their liquo through a wet cheesecloth into a small saucepan.  Use clam juice, if needed, to obtain the 1/2 cup of liquid.  Save the deep halves of the oyster shells and set oysters aside until ready to serve.  Reduce the liquid by half (to a 1/4 cup).
Blanch the zucchini in salted boiling water for about 2 minutes and then drain.
Bring the reduced liquid to a boil and add the cream.  Let reduce on high heat for 1 minute.  Then, whish in 12 tbsp of butter, piece by piece, while the liquid is still at a boil.  When all the butter is completely incorporated, add the lemon juice, remove from heat, and adjust seasoning to taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.
Continue to whisk the sauce for another minute or 2 off the heat.  This step is essential so the temperature is reduced or the sauce may separate.
Melt the last tbsp of butter over medium heat and add the zucchini.  Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.  Cook until the zucchini is warm then remove from heat.
Add the oysters to the butter/oyster sauce and heat over very low heat for 30 seconds, shaking the pan in a circular motion while heating.  Remove from heat.
Place 1 oyster in each shell.
Arrange the zucchini rounds on top of each oyster.
Spoon a small amount of the sauce over each oyster, garnish with cayenne pepper (if desired), and serve.
