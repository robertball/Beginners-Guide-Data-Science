Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom of a 7x11-inch freezer-safe baking pan.
Melt butter and chocolate in a small pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Add sugar and remove from heat. Stir in eggs one at a time. Add vanilla extract.
Combine flour and cocoa powder in a bowl. Add the butter-chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Immediately place brownies in the freezer to lock in the moisture.
