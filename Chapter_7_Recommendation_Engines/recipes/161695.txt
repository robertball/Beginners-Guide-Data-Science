Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cups quinoa, rinsed
3 cups chicken broth
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes; set aside.
Melt the butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa to the melted butter and let it brown, about 3 minutes. Pour the chicken broth over the quinoa; bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer 10 minutes. Stir in the sauteed mushroom mixture and cook another 2 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
Quinoa is a healthy grain that can be substituted in most recipes for rice or couscous. I recently experimented with quinoa and made this dish which my husband and I both love.  This easy-to-make and tasty side dish is similar to a pilaf.
