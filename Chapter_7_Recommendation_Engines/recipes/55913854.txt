Description: 
Quinoa is a super grain, even though it's really a seed(!). It's a nutritional wonder. Unfortunately, it's pretty bland when left to it's own devices, so adding ingredients is the key to making it tasty. Because of this, it's extremely versatile. It's a great base ingredient to incorporate into your cooking.Modified from: Quinoa with Asian Flavors
