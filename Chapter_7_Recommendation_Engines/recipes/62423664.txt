Description: 
I came up with this because we were having a pizza party and I felt left out because I am dieting and couldn't have any! We had grilled a tray of veggies so I scooped up two slices of squash and added pizza sauce and Parmesan cheese. After tasting it, I felt like everyone else at the pizza party was missing out on what I was eating!
