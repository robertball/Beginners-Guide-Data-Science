Ingredients:
2 T oil
1 lb beef stew meat
1/3 cup chopped yellow onion (optional*)
1/3 cup chopped bell pepper (optional*)
1/4 cup chopped celery (optional*)
1 T or to taste of Tony Chachere's (pronounced SA-sher-ees)
salt to taste (aoubt 1/2 - 1 tsp)
water
1 1/2 cups raw medium grain rice
3 cups water (give or take)
1/2 to 1 tsp salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep cast iron or other heavy skillet or pot until it is screaming hot.
Carefully add stew meat.  When the water in the meat hits the oil, it will spit hot oil back at you.
Brown the meat until it has a nice dark color.  It's ok to burn the meat a little.  This is what gives the gravy its flavor.
Lower the heat and let the meat cool off a little
Optional, add the onions, bell pepper, and celery and cook down until translucent
Add the Tony's and salt and stir - the more Tony's the spicer
Fill the skillet with water up to about an inch from the top.
Bring to a boil
Continue to boil on medium heat for about 30 minutes
Check your water level
Refill
Cook another 30 minutes
Repeat this until your total time is around 2 hours or until the meat is falling apart.
When the meat is almost cooked, put rice, water, and salt in a heavy 1 or 2 quart pot covered.
Bring to a boil
Turn the heat all the way down
Cook for 20 minutes
Do not stir or lift the lid while the rice is cooking.
Serve the rice covered in the meat and gravy.
Suggested side dishes: vinegar coleslaw, pickled beets, blacked peas or dry butter beans

Description: 
Very traditional Cajun meal with braised beef stew meat in a gravy with rice.  Rice is a staple of Cajun food.  Not all Cajun food is seafood.
