Description: 
Debbie Hunt of Anthony, Kansas likes to add tasty Grape-Nuts cereal to this hearty loaf. 'This moist bread is so easy that I make it at least twice a week,' she says. 'Once, I put it together in the middle of the night when I suddenly remembered that I didn't have any bread for breakfast.'
