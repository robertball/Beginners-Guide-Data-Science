Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground pork
1 egg
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3.5 fluid ounce) wine glass white wine

Directions:
Mix the pork, egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, onion powder, tarragon, and salt until everything is well incorporated; form into meatballs the size of a tablespoon. Spread bread crumbs into a shallow dish; roll meatballs in bread crumbs to coat.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook meatballs in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Add white wine half a glass at the time; cook at a simmer until the wine is reduced to a nice thick sauce, about 15 minutes.
