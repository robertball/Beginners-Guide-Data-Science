Ingredients:
2 c. (10 oz.) unbleached all-purpose flour
1 Tbl. sugar
3/4 tsp. table salt
1/2 c. dried buttermilk powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 c. sour cream
2 large eggs
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
1/4 c. vegetable oil
1 1/4 c. unflavored seltzer water

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place baking sheet in oven.
Whisk flour, sugar, salt, buttermilk powder, and baking soda in large bowl to combine.
Whisk sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and oil in medium bowl to combine. Gently stir seltzer into wet ingredients.
Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir until just combined. Batter should remain slightly lumpy with streaks of flour.
Heat waffle iron and bake waffles according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions (use about 1/3 cup for 7-inch round iron).
Transfer waffles to rack in warm oven and hold for up to 10 minutes before serving with butter and maple syrup.

Description: 
From America's Test Kitchen -- uses powdered buttermilk.  While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. Seltzer or club soda gives these waffles a light texture that would otherwise be provided by whipped egg whites. (Avoid sparkling water such as Perrier.)  For crispier results, we used oil instead of melted butter in our batter.
