Ingredients:
1 large delicata squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
3 tablespoons butter, divided
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup uncooked quinoa
2 cups water
2 shallots, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange the squash halves cut side up in a baking dish. Fill dish with about 1/4 inch water. Place 1 tablespoon butter on each half, and season halves with salt and pepper. Cover dish, and bake squash 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until very tender.
Place quinoa in a pot with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.
Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in shallots and garlic, and cook until tender. Stir in pine nuts, and cook until golden. Gently mix into the pot with the cooked quinoa.
Cut the squash halves in half, and fill each quarter with the quinoa mixture. Serve each stuffed squash quarter on a bed of the remaining quinoa mixture.

Description: 
Delicious baked delicata squash is stuffed with and served over a fragrant mixture of quinoa, shallots, and pine nuts. This recipe is a great way to use the squash and shallots in your farm share delivery! We can't wait to try it with different seasonings and different types of squash. Two of us finished off the whole thing, but we think it ideally serves four.
