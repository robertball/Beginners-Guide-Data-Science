Ingredients:
4 cups oats
1 1/2 cups nonfat dry milk powder
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup milk
4 eggs
1/2 cup oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
Mix oats, milk powder, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; stir into oats mixture just until mixed. Fold cranberries into oats mixture; spoon into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until oatmeal is set, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
Healthy, delicious, cheap. It freezes fantastic, but you probably will not get the chance to do that. As a protein powerhouse that travels well, it is ideal for breakfast on the run and for lunch boxes.
