Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1/2 cup sour cream
2 eggs
2 cups whole grain wheat flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
butter for cooking

Directions:
Blend together milk, sour cream and eggs. Add flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt and beat with a wire whisk at medium speed until smooth.
Melt approx. 1/2 teaspoon butter in a non-stick skillet on medium heat. Spread out the molten butter with a wide spatula, so that it forms a thin layer.
Pour approx. 1/3 cup of the batter into the hot skillet and bake the pancake until the edges begin to dry and the underside is golden brown, then flip. Let the pancake rise, do not pat.
Remove the pancake from the skillet when also the second side is nicely brown. Keep warm until serving.
You need to melt an additional 1/2 teaspoon butter only every 2-3 pancakes, or you may leave it out completely (except for the first pancake) if you like to use less fat.
Continue to bake pancakes until all batter is used up.
Serve with maple syrup, butter, fresh or preserved berries or whipped cream to your liking.

Description: 
This is a simple, quick and healthy recipe for any pancake lover! We like to cook it as a Sunday morning breakfast, before we head outdoors, and we found that these pancakes keep you full and energized for hours.
And on top of it all, it supplies my kids with a lot of healthy whole grain without them even noticing it.
