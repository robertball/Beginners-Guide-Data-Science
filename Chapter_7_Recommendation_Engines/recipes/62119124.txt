Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil, divided
1 tablespoon chopped onion
2/3 cup Arborio rice
3 cups chicken broth
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
2 tbsp. fresh or jarred pesto
parmesan cheese
salt and pepper, to taste
1/8 cup heavy cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat broth until very hot, but not quite boiling.
Heat olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add chicken, and brown.  Set chicken aside.
Add 1 tbsp. olive oil to the pan.  Saute onion until soft, about 2 minutes.  Add rice, turn heat to low and toast for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add 1/2 cup hot broth to rice, and stir until completely absorbed.  Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until absorbed, about 10-12 minutes.  Rice should be soft, but still slightly chewy.
Add cooked chicken and pesto to rice.  Stir until combined, about 1 minute.  At this time, you can add parmesan cheese, and for particularly indulgent meals, the cream.
Remove from heat and serve with additional Parmesan cheese and cracked black pepper.
