Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds beef bones, such as oxtail, short rib, knuckle, and shank
2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 large onion, cut into 8 pieces
1 medium leek - roots trimmed off, cleaned, and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 whole head garlic, halved crosswise
12 cups water, or as needed
2 bay leaves, or more to taste
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place beef bones on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast bones in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, turning over at the halfway point.
Carefully place bones into a large stockpot and pour in any juices that have collected on the baking sheet. Add celery, onion, leek, and garlic to the stockpot, and add just enough water to completely cover the bones. Stir in bay leaves, vinegar, salt, and pepper.
Bring broth to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a very low simmer and cover, venting the lid a bit. Simmer for 12 hours, occasionally skimming off any foam and "gunk" that rises to the top. Add additional water whenever bones and vegetables are no longer covered.
Remove the pot from the heat and cool broth to room temperature. Strain broth with a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot. Discard bones and vegetables.

Description: 
This is a very basic beef bone broth recipe that you can make as a Sunday project. Freeze the broth for use within six months. If desired, refrigerate before freezing so that you can skim off any hard fat that forms or solidifies on the top.
