Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into bite-size pieces
1 (15 ounce) can sliced beets with liquid
5 large mushrooms, sliced
1 onion, sliced

Directions:
Mix the ginger into the diced chicken until thoroughly combined; set aside. Pour half of the liquid from the can of beets into a large skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in the chicken. Cook and stir until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Pour the beets and the remaining liquid into the pan along with the mushrooms and onion. Continue cooking and stirring until the liquid has evaporated once again, about 5 minutes more.
