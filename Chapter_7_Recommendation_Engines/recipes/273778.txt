Ingredients:
10 red potatoes, skin on
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
8 slices bacon
1 bunch green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and let potatoes cool 10 minutes. Cut into bite-sized pieces and set aside.
Whisk mayonnaise, buttermilk, and ranch dressing mix together in a bowl. Set aside.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Let cool 5 minutes; chop into small pieces.
Assemble potatoes, bacon, green onions, and parsley in a large bowl. Pour ranch dressing mixture over salad and refrigerate until serving.
