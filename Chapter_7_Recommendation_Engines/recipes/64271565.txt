Ingredients:
12 cups water
4 to 5 cups ham, cooked and cut into bite sized pieces or chunks
1/2 cup onion, diced
1/2 cup celery, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/2 teaspoon chives
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
2 cups self-rising flour
1/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup boiling water

Directions:
Add 12 cups water, ham chunks, onion, celery, salt, pepper, basil, chives and parsley to a large pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover and simmer for an hour.
Meanwhile, make the dumplings by pouring flour into a large bowl. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender or fork. Add 3/4 cup boiling water a little at a time until the dough can be shaped into a ball. Knead several times. Roll dough to about 1/8 inch of thickness on a floured board. Cut into strips using a pizza cutter.
After broth has simmered for an hour, turn up heat until it returns to a boil. Remove lid and add dough strips a few at a time. Allow broth to come back to boil before adding additional dough strips.
After all the dumplings are added, lower heat to simmer for about 20 minutes and then serve.
