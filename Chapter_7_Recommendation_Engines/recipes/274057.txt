Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add curry powder and chili paste and cook for 2 minutes.
Add chicken, onion, and bell pepper. Stir-fry until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
Add fish sauce and garlic and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Add coconut milk, chicken stock, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Bring to a low simmer and cook until flavors come together, 7 to 10 minutes more.
