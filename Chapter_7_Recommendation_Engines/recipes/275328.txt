Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
5 cups miniature marshmallows
1 teaspoon orange gel food coloring
6 cups crispy rice cereal
12 chewy chocolate-flavored candy (such as Tootsie Roll®)
1 green fruit roll (such as Fruit Roll-Ups®)

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add mini marshmallows and stir until melted. Add orange food coloring and stir until color is even. Stir in crispy rice cereal until combined and marshmallow coating is even.
While the marshmallow mixture is still warm, shape into 12 small balls. Indent the tops of each for a spot to place chewy chocolate-flavored candy in the next step.
Melt candy in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave for 10 seconds. Shape softened candy into stems and press into the tops of the balls to appear like pumpkins.
Cut small leaf shapes from fruit roll and press onto the tops of the pumpkins next to stems. Let cool completely before eating.
