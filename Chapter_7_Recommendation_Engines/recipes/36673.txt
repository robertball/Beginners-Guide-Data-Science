1 3/4 cups uncooked long-grain rice
4 large ripe tomatoes
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion

2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cut tops off tomatoes, and reserve. Carefully scoop out tomato pulp, leaving shells intact; reserve 1/2 cup pulp. Discard remaining pulp.
Heat oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; saute 3 minutes. Add garlic; saute 1 minute. Add reserved 1/2 cup tomato pulp; cook 5 minutes or until liquid evaporates. Add onion mixture, cheese, and next 5 ingredients (cheese through shrimp) to 2 cups rice.
Place tomato shells in an 8-inch square baking dish. Divide rice mixture evenly among tomato shells; replace tomato tops. Add hot water to baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes or until tomatoes are tender and rice mixture is thoroughly heated. Serve warm or chilled.
