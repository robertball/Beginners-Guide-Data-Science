Description: 
This has been a favorite since my childhood! I liked it before I even would eat salad! It's always a huge hit and goes especially great with outdoor gatherings (i.e grilling, barbeques, etc.). My husband and I often make a huge salad and split it for our dinner. It's very flavorful, filling, and colorful. I am often requested to bring this to gatherings with friends.
