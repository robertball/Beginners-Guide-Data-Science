2 banana blossoms, sliced crosswise into fine strips
salt to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) pork loin, diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Sprinkle salt over banana blossoms and knead to release juice. Discard juice.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute garlic until slightly brown and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add pork, salt, and pepper; mix well. Cover and cook until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add banana blossoms, vinegar, and water. Cover and cook until flavors blend, about 5 minutes more.
