Ingredients:
8 wooden skewers
8 breakfast sausage links
Dip:
1 cup maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
Corn Dog Batter:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup milk
1 egg

Directions:
Soak wooden skewers on a shallow bowl of water for 30 minutes; drain.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; saute sausage links, turning every 2 minutes, until cooked through and browned, about 6 minutes. Thread each sausage onto a wooden skewer.
Whisk maple syrup, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a saucepan over low heat until warmed, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove maple dip from heat.
Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add milk and egg; whisk just until batter is smooth. Pour batter into a tall water glass to 3/4 full.
Dip each sausage into the batter, swirling and dipping to evenly coat.
Place the battered sausages gently in the hot oil, 4 at a time; cook, turning every 30 to 60 seconds, until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Adjust heat as needed to maintain 360 degrees F (182 degrees C). Transfer corn dogs to the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Serve with the maple dip.
