Ingredients:
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
3/4 cup refined coconut oil*
6 tablespoons light or dark corn syrup

Directions:
Fill a medium saucepan with 1 in. water and bring to a simmer. Combine chocolate, coconut oil, and corn syrup in a medium bowl and nest into saucepan, making sure bottom of bowl doesn't touch simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate melts and mixture is well combined.
Step 2
Remove from heat and let cool completely.
*You can also use unrefined (virgin) coconut oil, but it has a stronger coco-nutty flavor.
Make ahead: Up to 1 month, stored at room temperature in a lidded container (ingredients are shelf-stable; plus, chilling affects the texture). To liquefy again, microwave 15 seconds, then stir well.

Description: 
With a wondrous ability to instantly freeze into a crisp shell when dipped in anything cold, this coating is also amazingly easy to make. Use it for Ice Cream Tacos and the Oatmeal Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches. Use any extra as a dip for frozen bananas or cold strawberries.
