Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons butter
1 (6 ounce) package fast-cooking long grain and wild rice mix
1 (14.5 ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup water
2/3 cup sliced water chestnuts, chopped
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped green onions
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
5 Cornish game hens

Directions:
In a large saucepan coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook celery and mushrooms in butter until tender. Stir in rice; cook 1 minute longer. Stir in the contents of the rice seasoning packet, broth and water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5-6 minutes or until rice is tender.
Stir in the water chestnuts, cranberries, onions and soy sauce. Stuff into hens. Place on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Bake at 375 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer inserted into stuffing reads 165 degrees F. Cut each hen in half lengthwise to serve.
