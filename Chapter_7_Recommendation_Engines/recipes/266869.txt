Ingredients:
1 cup olive oil
1 cup fresh basil, chopped
3 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (8 ounce) loaf Calabrese bread (crusty Italian bread), cut into 1/2-inch slices
salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix oil, basil, and garlic in a bowl.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Cook bread slices on the grill until underside is toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip bread over and baste the grilled sides with about 1/2 of the oil mixture. Grind salt and pepper on top. Grill until bottoms are toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Flip bread slices over once more; baste with remaining oil mixture. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.

Description: 
So simple and so good. My wife and I always freeze our leftover baguettes and sometime they do not thaw quite as fresh, so I tried grilling the bread and used the abundance of fresh basil I have in my garden. It was a hit the first time we tried this and still is, and is now is our summertime favorite, for fresh and leftover bread alike.
