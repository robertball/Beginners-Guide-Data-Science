Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder.
Pour the batter evenly into loaf or cake pans and sprinkle the remaining sugar-cocoa mixture on the top.

ENJOY!
