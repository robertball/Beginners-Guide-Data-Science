Ingredients:
1 9 inch shortbread crust, either premade or homemade
3 egg yolks, large
1 14 ounce can condensed sweeten milk
3/4 cup freshly squeezed Meyer lemon juice (can substitute regular lemon or key lime juice)
1 cup lemon curd (use Croth's Lemon Curd or store bought)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Beat together yolks and condensed milk.
Slowly add in the juice, combine well.
Pour into prepared crust.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, the pie will still be wiggly inthe crust. (It will set up once cooled.)
Allow to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then store in refrigerator overnight to cool completely.
Spoon lemon curd over the top of the pie and smooth with a rubber or offset spatula.
(Serve with fresh blueberries or whipped cream.)
