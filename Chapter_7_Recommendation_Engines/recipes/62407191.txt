Ingredients:
4  round squash from Summer Squash Mix
2  zucchini type squash from the same mix
salt
½  cup sour cream
½  cup grated Parmesan cheese
1  tablespoon chopped marjoram
2  large fresh eggs
bread crumbs
some olive oil

Directions:
Cut round squash in half, cut the zucchini in chunks, salt and steam all squash until tender. When cool enough to handle, scoop seeds out of round squash. In a mixing bowl mash the zucchini and add all other ingredients, minus the breadcrumbs and oil. Do not over mix. Fill the round halves with this mixture, and sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top. Drizzle oil on crumbs. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, at 400 degrees, in a pan in which you will have poured a little water.
