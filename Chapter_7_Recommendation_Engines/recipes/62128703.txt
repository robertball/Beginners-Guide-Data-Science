Cold & Crunchy Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups Rice Krispies
1 cup coconut
1 cup chopped pecans
1 stick margarine, melted
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream (block style)

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt margarine in a 13x9 pan.  (I usually let the margarine melt in the pan in the oven while it is pre-heating - keep a watch on it because it will scorch easily)  After the margarine has melted, remove from the oven and stir in the cereal, coconut and pecans; coating well.  Bake the mixture in oven for 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes.  Add the brown sugar at the end of the 30 minutes and mix thoroughly.  Remove half of the mixture from the pan and reserve for the top of the dessert.  Slice the ice cream into 1 inch thick slices and put on top of mixture in pan.  You will probably have to cut the ice cream to fit in the seams and such.  Once all the ice cream is in the pan I usually just kind of smoosh it down to make it all one level layer.  Cover the ice cream with the remaining crunchy topping.  Cover and freeze for several hours before serving.

Description: 
This is the best ice cream dessert that I make and everyone absolutely loves it!!  Some have told me that it reminds them of fried ice cream.
