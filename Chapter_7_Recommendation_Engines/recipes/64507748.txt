Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 large avocado
1 tsp lime juice
1 tsp fresh cilantro
Pinch garlic powder, salt, and pepper
paprika

Directions:
Hard boil eggs by placing eggs in a pot with cold water. Bring water to a boil, cover with a lid, turn heat off and allow eggs to sit in water for 12-15 minutes. When eggs are done, place into cold water to stop cooking. When slightly cooled, peel eggs and slice in 1/2 lengthwise.
Remove the cooked yolks from the hard boiled eggs and place in a bowl.
Add the avocado to the same bowl along with the chopped cilantro, lime juice, garlic powder, salt & pepper.
Fill the hallowed egg whites with the avocado mixture, sprinkle with paprika and serve.
