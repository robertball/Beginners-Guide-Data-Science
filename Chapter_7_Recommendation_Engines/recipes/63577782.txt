Ingredients:
Carrot Cake
•	2 cups all-purpose flour
•	2 teaspoons baking soda
•	1/2 teaspoon salt
•	2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
•	3 large eggs
•	2 cups sugar
•	3/4 cup vegetable oil
•	3/4 cup buttermilk
•	2 teaspoons of good quality vanilla extract
•	2 cups finely grated carrot
•	1 (8-ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
•	1 Cup of flaked coconut
•	1  cups toasted chopped pecans
Cream Cheese Frosting
•	¾ cup (1 ½ sticks) of REAL Butter
•	2 (8 oz) packages of softened cream cheese
•	6 cups of powdered sugar
•	3 teaspoons of good quality vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 350 Degrees
Line 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with wax or parchment paper;  lightly grease and flour wax paper.
Set pans aside.
Take all 4 cups of pecans, spread them evenly over a cookie sheet and toast them in the oven while working on the cake (be careful not to burn them) about 5 minutes
Stir together first 4 ingredients – (I always use a paper plate, it makes it easier to put the ingredients in the stand mixer when I’m ready for it)
Beat eggs and next 4 ingredients at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth.
Add flour mixture, beating at low speed until blended.
Fold in carrot and next 3 ingredients. Pour batter evenly into prepared cake pans.
Bake at 350° for 25 to 30 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
Spread frosting between each layer as you assemble the cake, building up the edges where there will be a gap on the side as you go along; frost the sides of the cake and the top.
Take the chopped pecans in your hand and press them along the sides of the cake and viola you are done!
Tip #2:  Carrot cake always tastes better and it will cut cleaner once it has been refrigerated for a couple of hours.
