Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother-in-law. Even my two young sons love this dish, despite their aversion to all things vegetable! Delicious served with a green salad and crusty bread.

This can also be frozen for up to a month. I often buy a large squash, double the sauce, and make a second batch to freeze. Cover with a layer of plastic wrap, then a layer of foil and freeze. Defrost overnight in the fridge and bake as directed.
