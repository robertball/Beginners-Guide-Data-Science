Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup tomato juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons seasoning salt
1 teaspoon browning sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in oil until it begins to brown. Add onion and saute until soft. Add beef and saute, stirring constantly with a fork to crumble as finely as possible.
When meat is browned, add the tomato juice, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, browning sauce and cayenne pepper. Stir together and let simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquids have evaporated (about 15 to 20 minutes). Spoon mixture onto hamburger buns and serve.

Description: 
I don't know if this is similar to the loosemeat sandwiches served at 'Roseanne's diner', but it's worth a try.
