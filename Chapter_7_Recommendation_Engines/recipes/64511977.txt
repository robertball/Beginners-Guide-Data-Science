Ingredients:
The evening before:
1/4 cup warm water
8 grams fresh cake yeast (or 1/2 Tbsp active dry yeast)
1 tsp light honey
1/4 cup light olive oil
1 cup milk, at room temperature
2 cups gluten free flour (divided)
For the next morning:
1 egg, well beaten
pinch of salt

Directions:
Mix the water, yeast, and honey in a small bowl. Stir and then let it rest 5-10 minutes or until it becomes bubbly.
In a large mixing bowl, add the olive oil and milk together. Add 1.5 cups of flour, 1/4 cup at a time mixing well between each 1/4 cup. After you have mixed in 1.5 cups look at the consistency. It should be a thick batter but still pourable. If it is too thin, add more flour 1/8 cup at a time until this consistency has been achieved.
Add in the yeast mixture until just combined. Cover with plastic wrap and leave it out on the counter all night. I mix mine up approximately 9 hours from when I'll be using it. Remember that the batter will double or even triple in volume so make sure your bowl is a size that will handle such an increase.
The next day, add the beaten egg and the pinch of salt.
Make waffles in your waffle machine according to manufacturer's instructions. I get approximately 3 cups of batter when I use 2 whole cups of gf flour. The number of waffles will depend on the size of your machine.
