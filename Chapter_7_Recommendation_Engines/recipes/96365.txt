Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE® Turkey Bacon, each slice cut in half crosswise
2 pounds small sea scallops
1/3 cup olive oil
1/2 cup brandy
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
Salad greens (optional)

Directions:
Wrap 1 piece bacon around each scallop; secure with toothpicks, if necessary (metal toothpicks pictured; if using wooden toothpicks, soak in water 20 minutes). Place wrapped scallops in 13x9-inch baking dish. Combine oil, brandy, parsley, garlic, pepper, salt and onion powder in a small bowl; mix well. Pour over scallops; cover and marinate in refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Remove scallops from marinade; discard marinade. Arrange on rack of broiler pan. Broil, 4 inches from heat, 7 to 10 minutes until bacon is brown. Turn over; cook 5 minutes or until scallops are opaque. Remove toothpicks. Arrange over salad greens and garnish, if desired.
