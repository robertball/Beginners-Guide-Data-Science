Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large clove garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, or more to taste
4 Idaho potatoes, each cut into 8 wedges
1 teaspoon garlic salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine olive oil, crushed garlic, chopped rosemary, and chopped thyme in a covered container; let stand for 2 hours or longer.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Put potatoes in a large saucepan and pour in enough salted water to cover; bring to a boil; cook over medium-high heat until mostly tender, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl.
Remove garlic from the olive oil mixture and discard. Pour oil over potatoes, sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper, and toss to coat.
Place potatoes skin-side down on the grill over direct heat; reserve remaining oil. Grill for 10 minutes; move potatoes to indirect heat until completely cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle remaining oil over potatoes.

Description: 
We just started cooking with a 30-inch gas grill after decades of using a WeberÂ® charcoal grill. While we still use the charcoal grill, the extra space allotted to us on the gas grill has made us really branch out with different sides. I created this one knowing we could put the potatoes directly on the grill and not have to make a foil packet to make it fit!
