Ingredients:
8 oz of spaghetti noodles (maybe a little less)
1 jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce
1/2 lb of hamburger meat (cooked)
1 refrigerated package of pizza crust (I like Pillsbury)
2 cups of mozz. cheese
1/2 cup of parm. cheese
1 garlic clove minced
3 tbsp of olive oil

Directions:
Cook spaghetti noodles according to the package directions. Drain and return to pot. Add spaghetti sauce, meat (or no meat), & parmesan cheese; mix well until noodles are thoroughly coated.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a rectangular cookie sheet and roll pizza dough on to the cookie sheet. You are going to want to braid the dough over the spaghetti so make 1 inch cuts down the two long side of the pizza dough; then place a rectangular pile of spaghetti down the center of the dough. Add your mozzarella cheese atop the spaghetti.  Then begin by folding one end up and then folding each side, left then right, overlapping the dough, looking like a braid when it's done. Combine olive oil and minced garlic, using a cooking brush cover the top of the bread.
Place in the oven and let cook 25 - 30 minutes or until top is golden brown.  Cut and serve! :-)

I had a co-worker share this recipe with me and I put my own twist on it and thought it turned out to be quite tasty! My hubby does not like regular spaghetti but really enjoyed it this way!
