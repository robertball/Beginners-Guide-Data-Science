Ingredients:
.5 C butter
2 C salted peanut butter
.5 C brown sugar
2.5 C powdered sugar

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, peanut butter, and brown sugar.  Cook until thoroughly melted and combined, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat when you see large bubbles just beginning to form.  Stir in powdered sugar, half at a time, until combined.  Store in an airtight container.
You may also spread the warm mixture in a 9" x 13" pan (for thin bars) or an 8" x 8" pan for thick bars, topping with melted chocolate.

Description: 
There are many Reese's Peanut Butter Cup clones online, but this one has both brown sugar *and* is cooked which makes all the difference.  It creates the exact same crumbly texture as a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
