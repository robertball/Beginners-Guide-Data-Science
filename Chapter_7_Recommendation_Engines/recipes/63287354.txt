Directions:
Combine sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan. Gradually stir in evaporated milk to dissolve cornstarch. Whisk in egg yolks (whites will make the texture a bit gritty). Add butter.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken, this will take a few minutes, don't stop until you see and feel the consistency change.
Reduce heat to low; bring to a simmer and cook for two minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and banana extract. Let cool slightly, add bananas.
Line bottom and sides of a 2-1/2 qt bowl with vanilla wafers. Pour pudding over wafers.
Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Top with whipped topping.
