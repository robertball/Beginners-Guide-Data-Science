6 cups nonfat milk
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
5 egg yolks
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 cup dark rum, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the nonfat milk, evaporated milk, sucralose sweetener, nutmeg, and egg yolks in a heavy saucepan. Warm over very low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 10 minutes. Pour the eggnog through a strainer. Stir in vanilla extract. Refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.
Just before serving, stir in dark rum, if using.
