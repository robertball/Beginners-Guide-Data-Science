Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1 teaspoon roasted garlic
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic and onion
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 (8 ounce) package manicotti shells
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
30 ounces cottage cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and roasted garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to simmer until pan juices evaporate, about 10 minutes more. Add diced tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, oregano, thyme, bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and garlic salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook manicotti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.
Mix mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl. Spoon a generous amount of the cheese mixture into each manicotti shell.
Pour enough tomato-beef sauce to cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange stuffed manicotti over sauce; pour remaining sauce over pasta. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese over manicotti and return to the oven. Bake until cheese filling is melted, 10 to 15 minutes more.

Homemade meat sauce served over manicotti stuffed with three cheeses. This is the best manicotti I have ever had. I  always get requests for the recipe.
