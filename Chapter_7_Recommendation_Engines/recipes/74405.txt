Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the first eight ingredients; cook and stir over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until smooth. Reserve half of the sauce. Slice chicken lengthwise into 1-in. strips; thread onto metal or soaked wooden skewers.
Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 2 minutes; turn and brush with peanut butter sauce. Continue turning and basting for 4-6 minutes or until juices run clear.
Place cabbage on a serving plate; top with chicken. Sprinkle with onion tops. Serve with reserved sauce.
