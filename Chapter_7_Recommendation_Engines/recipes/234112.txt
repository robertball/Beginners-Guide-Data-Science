Ingredients:
4 cups shredded zucchini
3/4 cup water
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon basil
2 cups warm milk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons minced onion
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir zucchini, water, salt, and basil together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until zucchini is tender, about 15 minutes.
Pour zucchini mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend until smooth. Puree in batches.
Whisk warm milk, flour, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour pureed zucchini and milk mixture into the skillet; bring to a boil while stirring continually. Season with pepper.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite soups! It's my grandma's recipe that she just handed down to me this year in celebration of my garden producing enough zucchini for a small army! It's creamy and filling but mild. This soup can be frozen.
