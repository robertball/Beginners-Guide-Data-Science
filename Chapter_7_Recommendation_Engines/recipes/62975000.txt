Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon, cooked until medium-brown
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup All-Purpose Flour
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cups All-Purpose Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold butter
1 cup cold milk or buttermilk

Directions:
Chop the cooked bacon into 1/2" pieces. Combine the bacon with the remaining syrup ingredients, stirring until well combined.  Spread in the bottom of the prepared pan.
Whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Work in the butter until the mixture is crumbly; some larger pea-sized pieces of butter may remain intact.  Add the milk or buttermilk, stirring to make a sticky dough.
Drop the dough in heaping tablespoonfuls atop the syrup in the pan.  A tablespoon cookie scoop, slightly overfilled, works well here.
Bake the biscuits for 10 minutes.  Turn the oven off, and leave them in the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until they're golden brown.
Remove the biscuits from the oven, and immediately turn the pan over onto a serving plate.  Lift off the pan, and scrape any syrup left in the pan onto the biscuits.  Pull biscuits apart to serve.

Description: 
Here's one of the easiest, tastiest sticky buns you'll every enjoy.  Simple biscuit dough is dropped atop a sweet/salty maple-bacon-brown sugar syrup.  Once baked, the biscuits are turned out of the pan upside down, so the sticky topping drips down their sides.  Trust us, this is a breakfast treat you'll find yourself making over and over again.
