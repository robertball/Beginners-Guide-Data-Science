Ingredients:
1 ½ lbs strip loin grilling steak
1 Tbsp cornstarch, divided
2 tsp vegetable oil, divided
1 bunch broccoli, cut into small florets
1 red pepper, thinly sliced
½ cup teriyaki cooking sauce
1/3 cup beef broth
2 green onions, sliced diagonally

Directions:
Slice beef across the grain into very thin strips, trimming and discarding any excess fat. Place in a bowl with 1 tsp cornstarch and soy sauce. Let it sit 10 minutes.
Heat 2 tsp oil in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add beef and stir fry until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. Transfer to plate.
Return skillet to heat and add remaining oil. Add broccoli and red pepper and stir-fry until tender-crisp, about 3 minutes. Add beef and cooking sauce, tossing to coat; cook until hot.
In small bowl, whisk remaining cornstarch with beef broth until smooth; stir into skillet. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce thickens. About 2 minutes. Transfer to platter and top with green onions.
