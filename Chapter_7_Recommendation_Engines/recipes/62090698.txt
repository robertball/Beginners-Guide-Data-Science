Ingredients:
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
1/2 green pepper
1/2 white onion
1 puff pastry sheet
1/2 package cream cheese (softened)
2 Tablespoons Dijon Mustard
1 egg

Directions:
Brown chicken, onion and green pepper in skillet.  Thaw and roll out one puff pastry sheet.  Cut chicken into smaller pieces (I usually end up with 6).  Mix cream cheese with the dijon mustard.  Slice the puff pastry into 6 pieces and layer the mustard mix, chicken and top with the pepper and onion.  Carefully fold in the corners of the puff pastry and place seam-side down on a baking sheet.  Beat the egg with one tablespoon of water and brush over the top of each puff - you can also seal each side of the pastry with the egg wash.  Cook pastry according to package directions - until puff pastry is golden brown.
