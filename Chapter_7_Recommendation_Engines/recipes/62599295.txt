Avocado Rolls Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 c sliced green onions, finely chopped (2 Tbsp)
1/2 c cilantro leaves, finely chopped (2 Tbsp)
1/4 c finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil
1/8 tsp salt, or to taste
2 pinches pepper, or to taste
2 medium avocados, diced
6 spring roll wrappers (or lumpia wrappers)
vegetable oil for frying
sauce for dipping (I prefer Mr. Yoshida's)

Directions:
Combine green onions, cilantro, sun-dried tomatoes, salt and pepper. Then stir together with avocados.
Divide filling evenly into 6 spring roll wrappers. Position wrappers so that a corner is pointing toward you; fold the bottom corner up, 1/4 of the way over the filling. Brush remaining corners and edges of the wrapper with water. Fold sides in, then roll, folding top corner over all and pressing to seal. Repeat with remaining wrappers.
Fry in preheated vegetable oil at 375F until crisp and golden, about 1-2 minutes. Serve warm with dipping sauce.

Description: 
A friend was raving about avocado egg rolls from a favorite restaurant, so I had to try to some. I don't know if these are close to the original, but they are SO good!
