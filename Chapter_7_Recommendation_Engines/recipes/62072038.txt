Ingredients:
2 medium potatoes - (abt 2 cups chopped)
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup diced white onion
2 tablespoons flour
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups water
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 1/2 cups instant mashed potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/8 teaspoon thyme
1 cup half-and-half
=== GARNISH ===
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon
2 green onions, green part only -- chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake the potatoes or 1 hour or until done.
When potatoes have cooked remove them from the oven to cool.
As potatoes cool prepare soup by melting butter in a large saucepan, and
sautee onion until light brown. Add the flour to the onions and stir to
make a roux. Add stock, water, cornstarch, mashed potatoes, and spices to
the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out contents with a large spoon.
Discard skin. Chop baked potato with a large knife to make chunks that
are about 1/2-inch in size. Add chopped baked potato and half-and-half to
the saucepan, bring soup back to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer the
soup for another 15 minutes or until it is thick.
Spoon about 1 1/2 cups of soup into a bowl and top with about a tablespoon
of shredded cheddar cheese, a half tablespoon of crumbled bacon and a
teaspoon or so of chopped green onion. Repeat for remaining servings.
