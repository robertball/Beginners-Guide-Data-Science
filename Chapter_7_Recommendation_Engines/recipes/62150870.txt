Ingredients:
3 LBS TILAPIA
2 MED. ONIONS
5-7 TOMATOES
1-2 BUNCHES CILANTRO
6-8 LIMES
3-4 TABLESPOONS SALT
1 BOTTLE VALENTINAS HOT SAUCE (OR WHAT YOU PREFER)
1 PKG TOSTADAS

Directions:
The traditional way to cook the ceviche is to soak the Tilapia in the lime. To speed this up bring a small pan of water to a boil(just enough to cover the Tilapia).  Once boiling lay the Tilapia in the pan about 3-5 minutes, the fish will turn white and start to fall apart.  Drain all the water, press all the water out of the fish.  Dont leave any water.  Place fish in bowl and with a fork shred it to peices.  Dice the onion & tomato.  Place them in the bowl.  Cut cilantro into very small peices, add that to the bowl.  Cut the limes in half start with about 5 (you can always add more to your taste).  Mix all ingredients in bowl together.  Then sprinkle 3 tbspn salt over the bowl.  Take the lime and squeeze all of them into the bowl, mix together.  If it seems dry continue to add lime. Then place in fridge covered for about 2 hrs (the longer you let it sit the more flavor).
Then serve in bowls with hot sauce and tostadas.  You may need to add more salt at this time.  Enjoy!!
