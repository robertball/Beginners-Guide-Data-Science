Description: 
This salad has been a family favorite for over four generations, requested every Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is smooth and creamy with the crunch of pecans, and light green in color. It has a very unique flavor, and goes very quickly at our home. Any left over crushed pineapple and cottage cheese make a great snack for kids.
