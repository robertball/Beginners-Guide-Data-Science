Description: 
This summer in Fort Bragg, my husband went on a fishing charter and came back to the campground with a lot of fresh caught Cod.  We came up with this recipe, which was inspired by a pan roast dish we once had in a restaurant.  This dish is very versatile, delicious, and is also healthy and light!
