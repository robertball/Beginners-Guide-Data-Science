Ingredients:
1 rostisserie chicken (meat removed and shredded)
8oz cream cheese
1 cup shredded cheese
1 cup franks hot sauce
1/4 cup ranch
1 small can green chiles
10 10" flour tortillas

Directions:
Combine first 6 ingredients in a quart size pot and heat over medium until all cheese has melted
Spread the mixture over each tortilla. Be sure to spread evenly and get all the edges. Roll tortillas up, jelly roll style. I roll them on wax paper to get a good tight roll.
Secure each with a toothpick and refrigerate 4-6 hours.
After refrigerating, slice each roll into 1-2 inch peices and serve with ranch dressing or blue cheese!!
