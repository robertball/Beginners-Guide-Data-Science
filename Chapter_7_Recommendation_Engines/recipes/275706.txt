Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon garlic base (such as Better Than BouillonÂ® Roasted Garlic Base)
2 1/2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
nonstick cooking spray
Cobbler Topping:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup milk
1 pinch Italian seasoning
1 pinch garlic granules

Directions:
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in 1 tablespoon flour to create a paste. Slowly add in water, stirring to incorporate. Stir in 1/2 cup milk and garlic base until mixture begins to bubble. Add turkey, carrots, celery, and onion and heat until warm, about 5 minutes. Mix in oregano, thyme,  parsley, salt, and pepper. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x6-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Whisk together 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt for cobbler topping in a bowl. Cut in 3 tablespoons butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually stir in 1/2 cup milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
Pour turkey filling into the prepared casserole dish. Drop cobbler topping on top and sprinkle with Italian seasoning and garlic granules.
Bake in the preheated oven until cobbler topping is golden brown, about 25 minutes.
