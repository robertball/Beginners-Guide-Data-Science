Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1/3 to Â½ cup chunky peanut butter
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 cups sifted whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 to 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350-375 degrees F (175-190 degrees C) depending on oven temperament.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, peanut oil, white sugar, brown sugar, honey and peanut butter until smooth. Stir in the vanilla and eggs. Combine the whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, baking soda and salt; gradually blend into the creamed mixture. If batter seems dry add 1-3 tablespoons milk or cream. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. For bar cookies, press dough into a 10x15 inch jelly roll pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes.
