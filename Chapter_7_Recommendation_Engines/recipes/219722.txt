Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 small leek, cleaned and thinly sliced
1 stalk celery, thinly sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 carrot, grated
2 tomatoes - peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup couscous
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup dried currants
1 teaspoon curry powder, or to taste
1 pinch ground turmeric, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons sliced almonds

Directions:
Place vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, leek, celery, red bell pepper, and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and stir in the carrot, tomatoes, couscous, raisins, and currants. Season with curry powder, turmeric, salt, and black pepper; bring the mixture back to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and allow to cook for 5 minutes.
Remove from heat. Let the couscous stand covered for 5 minutes, and fluff with a fork. Sprinkle with sliced almonds.

Description: 
A variety of veggies make this interesting side dish versatile. I like to serve chicken in an apple, onion, and curry sauce over the top and sprinkle it with flaked coconut. Can also be made with quinoa, just adjust cooking time.
