Cheesy Bacon Burgers Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3-4 slices center-cut bacon, diced
1 lb ground beef, room temperature
1/2 bag pre-shredded Monterey Jack cheese
4 scallions, diced
Few dashes Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp sea salt
4 slices Swiss Cheese
4 Burger Buns
2 tbsp mayonnaise (optional)
1-2 tbsp dijon mustard (optional)

Directions:
In a large non-stick skillet (or griddle) over medium-high heat, cook bacon until fat rendered but bacon is not quite cripy.  Meanwhile, mix together ground beef, Monterey Jack cheese, scallions, Worcestershire sauce, and salt in a mixing bowl.  Once it's almost crispy, add bacon to the beef mixture and form 4 patties, each 3/4 inch thick.  They shouldn't be less than 1/2 inch thick, or you'll have a dry burger.  Cook the burgers in the bacon fat (in the same skillet), about 4 minutes per side for medium-well burgers.  During the last 2-3 minutes of cooking, top the burgers with the Swiss cheese to melt.  If desired, toast/grill the buns as well.  Spread mayo and mustard on each side of the buns, add burger, and enjoy.
