Ingredients:
5 large eggs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
1/2 cup milk
8 links breakfast sausage, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, diced
1 (9 ounce) bag fresh spinach
4 cups cooked brown rice
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs, Cheddar cheese, and milk together with a fork in a large bowl.
Place sausages in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to a work surface and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.
Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is slightly translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Gradually add spinach to onion mixture; cook and stir until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add sausage pieces and cook until heated through, about 1 minute more.
Slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir rice, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper into eggs.

Description: 
I used to get something similar to this for breakfast every day from a local co-op. After moving, I realized how easy it was to make, and replicated it. Serve immediately, or refrigerate and reheat throughout the week.
