Description: 
I came up with this recipe a couple of years ago, and my family can't stop eating it! It is delicious and spicy, but you can tone it down if you like by using regular pork sausage and leaving out the chipotle pepper, Adobo sauce, and cayenne pepper.  I hope you and yours enjoy this dish as much as my family does!
