Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
3 ½ (32 fluid ounce) containers chicken broth
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons ground thyme
1 teaspoon ground dried rosemary
1 teaspoon paprika
6  carrots, sliced
4 stalks celery, sliced
3 ears corn, shucked and kernels removed
1  onion, chopped
2 ½ cups dry cheese tortellini
1 bunch green onions, chopped
½ bunch fresh spinach, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add chicken and garlic; cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth, basil, thyme, rosemary, and paprika into the pot with the chicken; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add carrots, celery, corn, and onion; continue to boil until carrots are crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
Pour tortellini into the soup pot and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes and add green onions and spinach. Continue cooking until tortellini are tender, about 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Yummy chicken soup with tortellini...something I've 'thrown together' for years now. It has always been a favorite when I've made if for potlucks. It also tastes very good with egg noodles (homemade or store-bought) instead of tortellini.
