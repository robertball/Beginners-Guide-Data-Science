Ingredients:
2 cups Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced
1/2 cup chopped pimento-stuffed olives
1/2 cup cilantro
1/4 cup jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons capers
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 (6 ounce) fillets sea bass
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 cups sliced onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine tomatoes, olives, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and capers together in a bowl. Place flour in a shallow bowl.
Place fish on a flat work surface and season with salt and pepper. Dredge one side of each fillet in flour.
Heat oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish, flour-side down, and saute for 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Stir broth into skillet and scrape the bottom to deglaze. Add 1/2 the tomato mixture. Add onion, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Saute 3 minutes more. Nestle fillets into the skillet.
Place skillet in the preheated oven and roast until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove and discard bay leaves. Add remaining tomato mixture to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Serve fillets topped with tomato mixture.
