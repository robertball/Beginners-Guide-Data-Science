Description: 
I got this recipe from a friend and have been requested by others to share it. It's super easy, cheap and delicious. Don't be tempted to add more smoke flavoring. It will ruin the dish. Also, don't be tempted to add garlic or onions. I made these mistakes before. I recommend using very good crackers to serve with.
