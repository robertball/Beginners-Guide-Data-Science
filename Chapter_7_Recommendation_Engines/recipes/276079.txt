Ingredients:
1/4 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
3 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1/2 cup pitted dates
1/4 cup roasted almonds
1 1/4 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Mix pineapple juice and coconut oil together in a microwave-safe bowl or jar and melt in a microwave, about 1 minute. Add vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt; stir.
Pour rolled oats and sunflower seeds into a large bowl.
Place dates and almonds into an electric blender with pineapple juice mixture. Pulse for about 15 seconds to combine. Pour into oat mixture and stir using a large spoon. Stir in quick-cooking oats. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet evenly.
Bake in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and add raisins and cranberries. Continue to bake until golden, about 30 minutes more. Let cool for 30 minutes before serving.
