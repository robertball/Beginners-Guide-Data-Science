Ingredients:
1 c (2 sticks) plus 2 T unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 c sugar + 2 T for sprinkling
3 T honey
2 large eggs
3 c all purpose flour
1 c yellow cornmeal
3 1/2 t baking powder
1/2 c milk
1 c blueberries

Directions:
Heat oven to 375'.  Place a Silpat or parchment paper on a baking sheet; place six 2 3/4 x 2" pastry rings on it.  Cut parchment paper into 6 10x3 inch strips; use them to line molds (paper will extend above rims).  Place softened butter, 3/4 c sugar, and honey in bowl of mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.  Beat on medium speed until fluffy, about 1 minutes.  Add eggs; beat 1 minute more.  Whisk flour, cornmeal, and baking powder together ina medium bowl; add to butter mixture in mixer bowl.  Beat until combined.  Slowly pour in milk, beating on low, until just combined.  Fold in blueberries.  Divide dough among molds (do not pack too firmly; each will take 1 cup).  Brush tops with cold water; sprinkle 1 t; sugar over each.  Bake until tops are browned, centers are set, and a cake tester inserted in center of muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.  Let cool in pans 5 minutes.  Tie kitchen twine around muffins to hold parchment.  Serve at once.
