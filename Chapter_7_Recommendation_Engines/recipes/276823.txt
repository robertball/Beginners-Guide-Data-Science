Ingredients:
1 cup dried pinto beans
1 cup dried black beans
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices
1 cup diced yellow onion
1 cup diced green bell pepper
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
3 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Place the beans in a large mixing bowl and add 6 cups of water. Let rest for 8 to 12 hours. Drain.
Using the Saute function, heat the multi-cooker over high heat. Add the olive oil then smoked sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 6 minutes, until lightly browned and some of the fat has rendered. Remove with a slotted spoon to a plate.
Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the salt, chili seasoning, beans, diced tomatoes, and chicken stock. Stir well to combine, scraping browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Lock the lid in place and turn the top valve to seal. Set the multi-cooker to cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Let pressure release naturally for 15 minutes, then release remaining pressure manually.
Return the sausage to the pot and stir well to combine.
