Description: 
This recipe was developed by my 10-year old daughter, based on one of her favorite flat bread sandwiches. She calls it a Saladizza because it is a salad on a pizza! This recipe is fresh, nutritious and delicious. It is ideal for anyone with nut allergies, as the pesto is nut-free and packed with anti-oxidants and nutrients. This is a great meal for lunch or dinner.
