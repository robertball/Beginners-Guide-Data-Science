Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus
1 quart fresh grape tomatoes
1 medium bunch green onions
1 bottle fat-free italian dressing
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Clean and cut the asparagus up into 1 inch pieces, skinning any parts off that are dead, dried out, etc.  In a large pot boil the asparagus until just barely tender (this will vary depending on the asparagus and your tastes, keep watch over it--it doesn't take long!) Either half or quarter the grape tomatoes depending on their size and slice the green onions into small slivers. When the asparagus is cooked, drain it and rinse with cool water.  Combine the tomatoes, asparagus and green onions with some of the italian dressing--enough to coat everything or more, depending upon your tastes.  Put everything into a sealable bowl and refrigerate until chilled.  Salt and pepper as needed!
