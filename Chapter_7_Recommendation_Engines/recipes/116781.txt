Ingredients:
1/2 cup crushed cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookie
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons butter, melted
FILLING:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup mashed fresh strawberries
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Combine the cookie crumbs, sugar and butter; press into a 7-in. pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the strawberries. In another small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken.
Gradually add confectioners' sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cream cheese mixture. Spoon into the crust. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

Description: 
My mother treated us to strawberry desserts each spring, and this was the one we always looked forward to. I tried making it with the chocolaty cookie crust and now make it that way all the time. It's a winner.      --Judith Kapcsos                                                          Colorado City, Arizona
