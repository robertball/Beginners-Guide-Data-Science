Ingredients:
FOR THE MARINADE:
1 rack pork back ribs
4 Tbsp light soy sauce
3 Tbsp of white wine
1 Tbsp sesame oil
2 tsp white sugar
1/4 tsp Chinese five spice
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 1/2 tsp ginger pureed
1/4 tsp pepper
I like to use 1 lg Ziploc bag to marinade each rack of ribs
FOR THE BBQ SAUCE:
3 Tbsp hoisin sauce (Lee Kum Kee is best,or the thickest one you can find)
3 Tbsp honey
1 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp white wine
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp of Chinese five spice
1/8 tsp of pepper

Directions:
(Optional) Peel membrane off bone side of rib.
Stab meat all over between ribs with a fork.
Mix all marinade ingredients together, then pour over ribs in Ziploc bag.
Marinade for at least 1 hr, overnight is much better. Shake bag occasionally.
Bake at 350 Deg for 50-55 min or until cooked through, turning once.
Wrap up in aluminum foil until ready to BBQ. Sometimes I do all this the day before the BBQ and just keep it in the fridge, plastic wrapped.
Finish the ribs off on the BBQ on med to med low, brushing the BBQ sauce on both sides, brushing and turning until the BBQ sauce is used up. This is just to warm the ribs back up and to thicken up and stick the BBQ sauce to them, also to give them some delicious carmelized grill marks. Do not overcook or they will become dry, reheat only.
Slice and enjoy!

Description: 
Always THE croud pleaser at any BBQ. Sweet and sticky. This family favorite was handed down to me. I wouldn't do ribs any other way. It's a little involved: overnight marinade, baking, then finishing off on the BBQ, but well worth the effort. And kids love them too!
