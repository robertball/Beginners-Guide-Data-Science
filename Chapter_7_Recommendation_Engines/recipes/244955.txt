Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/3 cup melted unsalted butter
2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 egg
1/2 (10 ounce) bag chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking dish.
Mix brownie mix, cocoa powder, brown sugar, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger together in a bowl.
Stir butter and coffee together in a bowl; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Stir sour cream and vanilla extract into butter mixture; stir into brownie mix mixture and add egg. Stir 25 times with a wooden spoon until batter is smooth; fold in chocolate chips and stir 25 more times. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
