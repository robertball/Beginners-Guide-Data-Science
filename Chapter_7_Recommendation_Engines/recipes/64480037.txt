Ingredients:
One Box (32 oz.) of Beef Stock
¾ Cup Shredded Swiss Cheese
One Can (15 oz.) of Pinto Beans
Six Slices of Bacon
One Handful of Baby Carrots (diced)
Two Shallots (minced)
½ Cup Peas (fresh or canned)
One Sprig of Rosemary
1 tsp Corn Starch
A Spoonful of Sour Cream (for garnish)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Dice the baby carrots, and then heat them up in a pot of beef stock on the stove.
Fry bacon in frying pan until crispy, then put aside. Place the sprig of rosemary in the bacon grease and sauté for two minutes, then remove it. Chop up the two shallots and sauté them in the flavored bacon grease, along with the peas and drained beans, for two minutes.
Add the sauté mixture to the beef stock.
Toss grated Swiss cheese with corn starch, then pour into the simmering broth. Stir until cheese melts and soup thickens.
Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve topped with a dollop of sour cream and crumbled bacon.

Description: 
When I first tried to make this recipe, I was still a beginner, and I thought the cheese would melt into the soup and it would look similar to my other cheesy soup recipe, Creamy Cheesy Soup. It didn't happen, but this one was still really good!
