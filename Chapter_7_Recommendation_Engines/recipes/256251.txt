Creamiest Winter Squash with Raisins and Sage Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound butternut, acorn or kabocha squash
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1/4 cup roughly chopped parsley
2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage
Zest of 1 orange, removed in wide strips and roughly chopped
1 (16 ounce) package silken tofu, drained
1/2 cup fine sea salt (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange whole squash on a baking sheet and roast until the skin is papery and a fork inserted in 2 or 3 different spots reveals very tender flesh, about 1 1/4 hours. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Peel away the skin, and discard the seeds.
Meanwhile, pulse raisins, pecans, parsley, sage and orange zest in a food processor until finely chopped and transfer to a bowl; wipe out food processor.
In the clean food processor, puree warm squash and tofu until very smooth and creamy. (Reheat, if needed, in a medium pot over medium heat.) Transfer to a large bowl or platter, scatter raisin-sage mixture over the top and serve.
