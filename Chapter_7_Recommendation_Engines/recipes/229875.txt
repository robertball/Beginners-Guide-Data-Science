Ingredients:
3/4 cup sorghum flour
3/4 cup almond flour
1/4 cup rice flour
1/4 cup tapioca flour
1 tablespoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
4 small Golden Delicious apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan; lightly flour with gluten-free flour.
Whisk sorghum flour, almond flour, rice flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, and eggs together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until incorporated and batter is thoroughly combined. Fold in apples and walnuts. Pour and press batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
My Romanian family all make some version of this dense apple walnut cake every autumn. I think it's common to Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians too. I'm so pleased that I could almost replicate the taste and texture without wheat! Coconut flour can be substituted for almond flour. Makes a 9x13-inch pan. When cool, you can dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
