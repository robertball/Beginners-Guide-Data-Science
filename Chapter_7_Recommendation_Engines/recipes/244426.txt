Ingredients:
4 cups thinly sliced apples
2 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust (such as PillsburyÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine apples, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Place pie crust on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon apple mixture into the center of crust, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold crust over the edges of the apple mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and crust is golden, about 30 minutes.
