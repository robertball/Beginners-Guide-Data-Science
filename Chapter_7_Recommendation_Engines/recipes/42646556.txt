Ingredients:
1 can of Coco Lopez Cream (not milk)
2 cans of coconut milk
4 egg yolks
2 cups of white Boricua Rum (I used Bacardí Coco, but regular white rum is also OK)
1 can of Condensed (sweet) milk (Eagle Brand)
pinch of nutmeg
pinch of cinammon powder

Directions:
Mix 1 cup of rum, coco cream, nutmeg, milk and yolks in a blender. (30 secs OK) Pour it unto a bowl and taste. You may want to put a bit of this mix aside for the weak. If not, pour in the 2nd cup of rum and stir not shake!.
Put in bottles and refrigerate (1 hr OK... If you can't wait that long, skip fridge). To serve, shake caneca well and pour in small cups.
Sprinkle cinammon to taste. Pa' encima!
You can also cook the egg yolks with the coconut milk very slowly in a saucepan, then mix with everything else.
