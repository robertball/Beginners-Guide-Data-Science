Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon split Bengal gram (chana dal)
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/8 teaspoon asafoetida powder
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 green chile pepper, chopped
2 cups plain yogurt
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry the chana dal, mustard seeds, and asafoetida powder in the hot oil until the mustard seeds pop and the chana dal turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the tomatoes and green chile pepper into the mixture; cook until the tomatoes are tender, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes; stir the yogurt and salt into the mixture. Garnish with cilantro to serve.

Description: 
Delicate tomatoey yogurt dish that you can serve along something spicy. This is my favorite raita recipe of all time. I think it goes particularly well with my crunchy potato curry.
