Ingredients:
2 potatoes
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons butter
1 green onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch paprika
1 pinch red pepper flakes
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Prick potatoes several times with a fork and place into a microwave-safe dish. Microwave until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Place potatoes on a flat work surface. Slice each potato in half; scoop out the flesh into a bowl, leaving only the skins. Flatten the skins into a single layer in an 8-inch baking pan.
Mash the potato flesh. Mix in eggs, Cheddar cheese, butter, green onion, garlic, turmeric, paprika, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Layer the mixture over the potato skins.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned on top, about 20 minutes.

I love the idea of stuffed baked potatoes but can't be bothered with the long cooking time or making things look nice and neat. This is my lazy man's version of stuffed baked potatoes... with added zip!
