Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef round steak
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Trim and discard all fat from meat. Cut meat into 5-in. x 1/2-in. strips. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the remaining ingredients; add meat. Seal bag and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Place wire racks on foil-lined baking sheets. Drain and discard marinade. Place meat strips 1/4 in. apart on racks. Bake, uncovered, at 200 degrees F for 6-7 hours or until meat is dry and leathery. Remove from the oven; cool completely. Refrigerate or freeze in an airtight container.
