Ingredients:
2 cups butter
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups brown sugar
2 cups sugar
5 cups oatmeal, blended
3 cups chopped walnuts
24 oz. white chocolate chips
18 oz. semi-sweet baker's chocolate, grated
2 tsps. salt
2 tsps. baking powder
2 tsps. vanilla extract
4 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375ÂºF.
Combine separately both wet and dry ingredients, except chocolate chips and walnuts. Once well-mixed, combine both the wet and dry ingredients until well-blended. Fold in chocolate chips.
Roll batter into tight balls and place on cookie sheet; flatten cookies a little with the back of a spoon.
Bake for 10 minutes.
