Description: 
The absolute best minestrone I have tasted. A spicy twist on a traditional soup. I make this in large quantities and freeze in 1 cup portions for a fast meal. I sometimes slice and brown a spicy chicken sausage and add it to this soup for my husband who loves meaty soup. Penne pasta or orrichette pasta may be cooked on the side and added at the end!
