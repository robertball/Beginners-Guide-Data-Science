Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup wheat germ
2 eggs
1/4 cup honey
1 cup chopped almonds
1 cup jumbo semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup unsweetened flaked coconut
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, 3/4 cup honey, and lemon juice until well blended. Combine the flour, oats, and wheat germ; mix into the honey mixture. Spread evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch baking pan. Set aside.
In another bowl, beat eggs while gradually pouring in 1/4 cup honey. Stir in almonds, chocolate chips, dates, apricots, coconut, and sesame seeds until they are evenly distributed and well coated. Spread over the crust in the pan.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until center is set, and the top is lightly browned. Cool completely before cutting into bars.

Description: 
I have used raisins in place of dates, and used chopped walnuts and pecans instead of almonds; up to you.  The perfect snack and energy booster for a day in the great outdoors, or any occasion.  Warning:  Addictive!
