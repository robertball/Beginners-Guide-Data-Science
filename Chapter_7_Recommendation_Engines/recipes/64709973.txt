Ingredients:
6 corn with husk on
Butter (to taste)
Salt (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)
Fresh Parsley, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.
Peel back corn slightly and remove silk from top of corn. No need to remove the silk inside the corn because as it cooks the silk will stick to the husk. Cut any husk hanging off of the top of corn.
Place corn on oven rack and roast for 25-30 minutes. Carefully remove corn from oven and allow to cook for 5 minutes. They will be extremely hot.
Peel corn using husk as holders and season with butter, salt, pepper & parsley. Enjoy.
