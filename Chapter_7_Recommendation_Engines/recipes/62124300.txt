Ingredients:
Jasmine rice
onion
garlic (or powdered garlic)
carrots
peas (frozen or fresh)
3 eggs (depending on how many you are making this for one egg pp)
fish sauce (optional can be found in asian isle)
soy sauce
lime or vinager
chili peppers
sugar
any meat you wish
oil (any kind but sesame pref.)

Directions:
The secret to making great fried is to use left over rice thats been in the fridge and is cold the next thing is to use a wok (or else this is messy i warn you!) Another thing i must metion is i didnt add measurements  thai style adds to taste but about a tablespoon for all the sauces is about enought.
also try and work as fast as you can this should only take 10-15 minutes
get the wok as hot as you can!!!!!!!!
add a few tbl of oil and stirfry your meat
after it is fully cooked take out the meat or push to the side and add one egg fry till cooked
next add you rice, take it off the heat while you stir and then set back down fry for 3 minutes or so( my grandma can toss it in the air...im not so special)
next add your seasonings about a tbl or two of both (its easy to mix in a bowl then add at one time)
add veggies stir for one minute or so
stirfry for about a minute then add a few eggs (2 or 3)
crack right in the pan and stir right away it will make the rice sticky but fry and mix untill it isnt shiney anymore.
yummy!
serve with scallions and lime wedges if desired enjoy your thai dish!
