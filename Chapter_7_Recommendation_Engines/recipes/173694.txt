Ingredients:
4 cups shredded zucchini
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon melted butter
4 eggs
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup all-purpose biscuit baking mix

Directions:
Toss the zucchini and salt together and place into a colander set in the sink. Allow to drain for 1 hour, then squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini, and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with the melted butter.
Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl with the pepper, garlic powder, and parsley. Stir in the zucchini, Monterey Jack cheese, and baking mix until combined. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until set and golden brown on top, 45 minutes to 1 hour. The souffle is done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.
