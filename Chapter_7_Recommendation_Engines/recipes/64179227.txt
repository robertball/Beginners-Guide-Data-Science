Ingredients:
1 ½ cloves garlic, halved
1 jalapeño seeds and membrane removed, large dice
½ cup firmly packed cilantro leaves, large stems removed
½ lime, juiced
¾ cup olive oil mayo
¾ teaspoon cumin
¼ teaspoon salt (+/- to taste)

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor, blend until all ingredients are finely chopped. Refrigerate one hour and taste test it. Add extra salt, pepper, and/or cumin to your liking (be careful, the flavors will continue to develop so go easy on any extra additions at this point).
Serve over turkey burgers & fish tacos with red cabbage garnish or as a dip for other Mexican-inspired dishes.
