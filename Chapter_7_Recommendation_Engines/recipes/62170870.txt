Ingredients:
about 1.5 pounds hamburger meat
1 packet taco seasoning
1/2 cup shredded cheese of your choice
1/4 cup your choice salsa
2 eggs
about 1 cup of tortilla chips

Directions:
preheat oven to 375
mix all ingredients in a bowl
put in a loaf pan or other oven safe pan
cook for about half an hour or until done all the way through.
I put cherry tomatoes cut in half on the top of mine while baking.
you can play with this recipe and do the cheese on top, or less salsa... i have even made it with no taco seasoning, and it turned out YUMMY!!
