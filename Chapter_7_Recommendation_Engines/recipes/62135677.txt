Ingredients:
4 fresh hoagie buns from your local grocery
2lbs of good roast beef from the deli (I prefer Boarshead londonport...a little pricey, but well worth it
Smoked emmentaller cheese or smoked provolone if you can't find it
2 cans beef consomme
2 small or 1 lg shallot minced
4 tbs butter divided
1/4 c sherry
thinly sliced red onion
capers optional

Directions:
Add 2 tbs butter to a small saucepan, melt add shallot sautee until soft.  Add sherry and simmer for 2 min.  Add consomme and simmer.
Cut open buns and thinly spread remaining butter on the inside. Broil till toasted.  Separate beef into 4 parts and dip in the au jus before placing on bun. Cover meat with cheese and onion and broil till melted top with fresh cracked pepper and serve with the au jus in a bowl for dipping. I like to serve this with some rinsed capers, it adds a little zing!
