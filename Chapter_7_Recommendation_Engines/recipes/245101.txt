Ingredients:
2 tablespoons bacon drippings
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 smoked ham hocks
1/2 pound collard greens, stems and center ribs discarded and leaves chopped
1/2 pound kale, large stems discarded, leaves chopped
32 ounces Swanson® Unsalted Chicken Broth, or more as needed
1 (14.5 ounce) can chopped tomatoes with liquid
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning
1 (15 ounce) can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste

Directions:
Heat bacon grease on medium heat in large Dutch oven or stock pot. Stir onion and garlic together in pot, cooking until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.
Place ham hocks, collards, kale, 32 ounces Swanson(R) Unsalted Chicken Broth, tomatoes, and Creole seasoning in pot. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium-low and cover. Simmer until greens are tender, about 45 minutes. Add the black-eyed peas and heat through.
For a thinner soup, add a few more ounces of chicken broth. Adjust seasonings, if needed; add hot pepper sauce to taste.
