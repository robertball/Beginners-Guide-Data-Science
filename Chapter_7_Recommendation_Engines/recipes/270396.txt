Ingredients:
4 cups buttermilk
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
1 tablespoon wheat germ (optional)
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
2 teaspoons salt
4 eggs
1/2 cup applesauce
10 drops green food coloring, or as needed

Directions:
Combine buttermilk and oats in a large bowl; let soak for 5 minutes.
Combine flours, brown sugar, wheat germ, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Whisk eggs, applesauce, and green food coloring into the oats mixture. Add more green food coloring if desired. Stir in flour mixture until batter is just moistened.
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Heat a lightly oiled griddle to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour batter onto the griddle using a 1/3 cup measure. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place pancakes on a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Here is a wholesome breakfast alternative for your St. Patrick's Day celebration. They are a little less fluffy pancake and a little more hearty goodness. These are based on Taste of Home's Brown Sugar Oatmeal Pancakes. I made them a little healthier. And green. We served with applesauce, strawberry simple syrup, powdered sugar, or maple syrup. You could also try molasses. Originally posted on my blog.
