Canola oil cooking spray
1 tsp. grated lemon zest
2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1 tsp. ground cumin

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat baking dish just slightly larger than chicken breasts with cooking spray.
2. In small bowl, whisk together lemon zest, juice, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, turmeric, salt, pepper and honey until honey dissolves.
3. Place chicken in prepared baking dish, rib-side down. Spoon spice mixture over chicken taking care to coat completely.
4. Bake chicken for 10 minutes. Remove chicken from oven. Tipping pan, use spoon to baste chicken with liquid for 1 minute. Bake 10 minutes, and baste chicken again. Repeat baking and basting one more time. Bake chicken until white in center when cut into at thickest point or meat thermometer shows internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Total baking time will be about 35 minutes, depending on size of chicken. Let chicken rest for 10 minutes.
5. Place chicken on deep serving plate. Spoon liquid from pan over chicken. Good accompaniments are string beans and mashed sweet potatoes.

Description: 
The chicken breast has been reinvented time and again, but all it takes is a little spice to transform your go-to dinner into something new and flavorful. Adding cinnamon, cumin and ginger not only keeps the sodium level in check, these spices may also contain some cancer-fighting properties. Combine with a side vegetable like string beans and whole grain rolls for a new family favorite.
