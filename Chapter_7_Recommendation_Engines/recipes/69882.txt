Ingredients:
2 cups cider vinegar
1 cup vegetable oil
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
8 boneless chicken thighs, with skin

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the cider vinegar, vegetable oil, egg, salt, and poultry seasoning. Place the chicken thighs in the bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange the chicken thighs in a baking dish, and cover with about 1/4 of the marinade mixture.
Bake chicken 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Drain off the marinade so that the chicken skin will become crisp (a baster works well for extracting the marinade). Continue baking 15 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
