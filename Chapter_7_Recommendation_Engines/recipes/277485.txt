2 (16 ounce) jars dry-roasted, salted peanuts
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

3 pounds white bark, broken into pieces

Directions:
Layer peanuts, chocolate chips, unsweetened chocolate, and white bark (in the order listed) in a 4- or 5-quart slow cooker.
Cover and cook on Low, without removing the lid, for 3 hours. Turn off and cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Drop chocolate mixture by teaspoonfuls onto pieces of waxed paper. Let sit until thoroughly cool, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This slow cooker candy is almost like the peanut clusters that you can buy. I have taken it to parties several times and there is never any left to bring home.
