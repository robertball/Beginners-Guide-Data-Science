Ingredients:
1/2 cup cooked cauliflower
1 egg
4 Tbsp. tomato sauce
1/3 cups mushrooms
10 pieces turkey pepperoni
1/3 cup low fat mozzarella
Italian seasoning, salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 45o F. Spray cookie sheet with non-stick spray. Cook cauliflower to where it is soft enough to mash and/or mix with hand mixer, drain well before mashing so it is not soggy! In a medium bowl, combine cauliflower and egg. Spread out on cookie sheet and bake crust for 15 min or longer for a firmer crust.  Heat tomato sauce on stove and cook chopped mushrooms in it, add Italian seasoning if desired. When crust is brown and firm, add sauce, cover with shredded cheese and pepperoni.  Place under high heat broiler until cheese is melted.  Recipe makes one lean & green. **The egg and low fat cheese are listed under meatless options for lean portion so it is legal!**
