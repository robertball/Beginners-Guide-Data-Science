Ingredients:
2 cups cornmeal
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 T taco seasoning (I used McCormick's which is gluten free)
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups plain yogurt
4 T melted butter
3 T honey
1/3 cup pickled (or fresh) jalapeños, chopped
1 cup grated cheddar or or jack cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400º F and grease or line your muffin tin.  2. Sift together dry ingredients in a large bowl. 3.  In another bowl whisk together eggs, yogurt, butter, and honey.  Add jalapeños and cheese.  4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, add the wet mixture.  5. Stir until just combined, then distribute evenly in the muffin tin and bake for approx. 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
