Ingredients:
2 cups almonds
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 cup chopped semisweet chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Finely grind the almonds, sugar, cinnamon and salt in a food processor.
Separate one of the eggs and add the white, the other egg, and almond extract and process until the mixture  holds together.  Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chocolate.
Moisten hands and roll mixture into 1-inch balls. Place on prepared  cookie sheet.  Flatten to 1/3-inch thick rounds.
Bake until tops puff  and centers are still soft, about 12 minutes.    Remove to a rack and cool completely.  Replace parchment paper for next  round of cookies.
