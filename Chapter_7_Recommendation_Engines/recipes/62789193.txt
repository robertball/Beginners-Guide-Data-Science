Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, 1 medium banana, 2 cups soy milk and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.

Directions:
(1) Bake (60 minutes at 350 degrees) or microwave (about 10 minutes) the sweet potato hours before making this (preferably the night before) and let it cool in the fridge. You can remove the peel before or after you cool it -- but definitely after you cook it. (2) Once cooled, blend the ingredients together.
