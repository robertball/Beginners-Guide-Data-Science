The Best Pumpkin Bread Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 c. sugar
1/2 c. brown sugar, packed
1/2 c. oil
1 c. canned pumpkin
1/4 c. water
2 eggs
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. each salt, cinnamon and nutmeg
1/4 tsp. ginger
1 c. raisins (optional)
1/2 c. chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a loaf pan.
Combine sugars, oil, pumpkin, water and eggs. Mix well.
Sift together flour, soda, salt and spices.
Add dry ingredients to wet and stir well to combine.
Stir in raisins and nuts, if using.
Pour into prepared loaf pan and bake for 65 to 75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean.
Remove and cool on rack for about 10 or 15 minutes. Turn out bread onto rack and continue to completely cool...if you can wait that long!
For muffins - Grease & flour muffin tins instead of loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool about 5 to 10 minutes and turn out onto cooling rack. Cool completely - these can be individually frozen, too.

Description: 
This recipe is actually an old one from the side of a C&H brown sugar box. Grandma John(son) & mom made this recipe and itâ€™s simply the best - IMHO anyway! On the very first day that gives the slightest hint of fall (you know the crisp smell or feel in the air?), this is the one thing I HAVE to make! The house smells heavenly! I usually double this recipe when I make it.
