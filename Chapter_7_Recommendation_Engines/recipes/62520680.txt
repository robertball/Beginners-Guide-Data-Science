Ingredients:
Serves 4
•2 large egg whites
•1/4 cup cornstarch
•1/4 cup sesame seeds
•Coarse salt and ground pepper
•1 1/2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
•1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more if needed
•1 cup fresh orange juice
•2 tablespoons soy sauce
•1 tablespoon sugar
•4 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced

Directions:
1.In a large bowl, whisk together egg whites, cornstarch, sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper until frothy. Add shrimp, and toss to coat.
2.Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Working in two or three batches, cook shrimp until golden and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate to drain. Add more oil to skillet if necessary for remaining batches.
3.Wipe skillet with a paper towel. Add orange juice, soy sauce, and sugar. Boil over high heat until syrupy and reduced to about 1/3 cup, 4 to 5 minutes. Return shrimp to skillet; add scallions, and cook until heated through and coated with sauce, about 1 minute.

Description: 
Using egg whites instead of whole eggs (or yolks) in the batter creates a crispier coating; cooking the shrimp in batches (so as not to crowd the pan) also helps.
