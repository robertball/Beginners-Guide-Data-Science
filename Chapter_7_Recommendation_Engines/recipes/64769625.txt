Ingredients:
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1 lb fuyu persimmons (approx 4-5 persimmons)
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp lemon zest
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tbsp cup white sugar
1 tsp Madagascar vanilla powder
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp corn starch
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup superfine cornmeal
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold
1/2 cup cold buttermilk
1 tbsp milk
2 tbsp cane sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Butter a 9x9 square baking dish. Set aside.
Peel and cut the persimmons into two-inch chunks. Put them into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle lemon juice, lemon zest, brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cornstarch. Mix well and set aside.
Mix the flour, cornmeal, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl. Cut in the butter until it resembles small pebbles. Add the buttermilk little by little mixing the dough with your hands. Once the dough forms a ball, turn it out onto a flour- dusted work surface. Knead until smooth. Roll out into an 8x8 square, 1/2 inch thick.
Add the persimmon mixture with all its juices into the prepared baking dish. Tear off pieces and lay them onto the top of the persimmons like patchwork. Allow a bit of space between each piece so the juices can bubble up around the pieces.
When covered, brush with the tablespoon of milk. Sprinkle the two tablespoons of cane sugar.
Bake, uncovered, for about 40 minutes or until the persimmons are bubbling and the biscuit topping has browned.
Allow to cool then serve with fresh whipped cream.
