Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 egg
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG) (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
2 green onions, chopped and divided
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 head napa cabbage, cored and cut into chunks
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups water, or as needed
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil

Directions:
Mix the ground pork, egg, cornstarch, 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, ginger, monosodium glutamate, salt, and half of the chopped green onions together in a bowl. Use your hands to mix until the ingredients are evenly distributed. Set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, fry the napa cabbage, stirring constantly, until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, water, and soy sauce. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium.
Use a spoon to form the meat mixture into 1 inch balls. Drop them into the boiling soup. When the last ball has been added, cover with a lid and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste, and adjust salt before serving. Garnish with remaining green onions and a drizzle of sesame oil.

Description: 
This is my family's version of lion's head soup and for me it is the best type of comfort food!  It is best served with white sticky rice, and wonderful enjoyed on a cold winter day.
