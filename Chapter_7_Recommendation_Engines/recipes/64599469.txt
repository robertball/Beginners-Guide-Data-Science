Title:
(Grain-Free) Pumpkin Blender Cookies Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 banana, frozen* (approx. 2 oz.)
1/4 cup natural peanut butter or almond butter
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
pinch of salt
*You can use fresh, ripe banana instead, but only use about 2 oz. (roughly half a medium-sized banana) or else the texture will be off.

Directions:
Add all ingredients into a blender and blend just until smooth. Spoon batter in 1/4 cup increments onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a baking mat.
Bake at 350Â°F for 12-14 minutes. Then remove from the oven and allow to cool on a cooling rack.
Place leftovers in a Ziploc bag, seal, and refrigerate. They'd be fine in the refrigerator for up to a full week. If you'd like to make a bigger batch and save them for longer, I would consider freezing them.

Author: Emma Chapman. I tend to think of these as snack cakes more than cookies as they are a fairly soft, sort of mix between a pancake and a cookie.
