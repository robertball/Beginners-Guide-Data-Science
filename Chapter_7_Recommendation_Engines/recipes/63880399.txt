Ingredients:
3 cups sifted all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground mace
OR
1 teaspoon ground allspice instead of mace
1 Tablespoon vanilla
3/4 cup soft butter or margarine
2 cups sugar
9 large egg yolks
1 large egg
1 cup whole milk

Directions:
Grease and sprinkle a bit of flour into a 10 inch Tube Pan.  Set aside.
Sift together the flour and baking powder and set aside.  Add the next four ingredients to the softened butter and mix until blended.  Gradually mix in 1 cup of the sugar.  Beat in 3 egg yolks.  Add remaining sugar, alternating with remaining egg yolks, beating well after each addition.  Beat in the whole egg.  Then add the flour, alternating with the milk, mixing well between additions.  Beat another 1/2 minute or so, then pour it into the tube pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 1/4 hours or until a cake tester comes out clean and the top is golden brown.  Cool the cake for 20 minutes, then carefully remove the cake from the pan and finish cooling on a rack.  Store in an airtight container.  This cake tastes better the next day.
