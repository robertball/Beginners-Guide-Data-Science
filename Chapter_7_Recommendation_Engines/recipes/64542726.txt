Ingredients:
1 small  napa cabbage
3 tablespoons coarse sea salt (less if using finer salt)
2 scallions
2 ounces  garlic chives, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 stalks  water dropwort, cut into 2-inch pieces
4 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper flakes
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon Korean rice syrup)
1 tablespoon Korean plum syrup
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon finely grated ginger
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Separate the cabbage leaves. Cut each leaf lengthwise, and then cut crosswise once or twice into long bite sizes. Rinse in water and drain.
Place a layer of cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with a tablespoon of salt. Repeat with the remaining cabbage and salt. Toss well to coat evenly. Leave it for 40 to 60 minutes until softened, tossing once halfway through.
Roughly chop the scallions. Cut the optional minari and buchu into about 2-inch lengths. Combine all the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl, and mix well with 2 tablespoons of water.
Rinse the cabbage twice and drain well.
Add the seasoning mix to the cabbage. Using a kitchen glove, toss everything by hand until the cabbage pieces are well coated with the seasoning. Add the scallion, minari, and buchu. Add a little salt or more fish sauce to taste.
