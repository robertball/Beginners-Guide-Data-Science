Ingredients:
1 1/2 tsp. dry yeast
2 T. warm water
3 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
2 T. Oil
1 tsp. baking powder
2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
2 T. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt

Directions:
In a small bowl dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside (should begin to foam as you are mixing other ingredients).  Mix all dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl; make well in center.  Add liquid ingredients including yeast and mix until blended.  If making waffles use about 1/4 cup batter in hot waffle iron and bake about three minutes.  If making pancakes bake on hot griddle until done. (May make recipe night before and store in covered container in refrigerator.)

Description: 
Brunches are a big hit in our family.  They think this recipe makes the best waffles of all and it is easily doubled or tripled.  I sprinkle blueberries or pecans on top of the batter for those who want them just before closing the waffle iron - it's definitely my favorite way to have them. Plus, you can make this the night before!
