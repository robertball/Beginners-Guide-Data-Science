Description: 
I begged for this recipe at my favorite Indian restaurant. It is quite unlike any other onion chutney recipe that I've tried. It is surprisingly simple and full of taste. The ketchup and vinegar produce an orange hue and preserve the crunch of the onion. Serve as a garnish with toast. Try it!
