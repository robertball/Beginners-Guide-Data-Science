Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 vegetable bouillon cube
2 cups chunky vegetable salsa
1 (15 oz) can whole kernal corn
1 (15 oz) can creamed corn
1/4 cup fat free refried beans
1 lb cooked extra lean ground turkey
Few dashes of your favourite hot sauce, to taste
2-3 scallions, chopped
Fat free sour cream

Directions:
In a large pot, dissolve the vegetable bouillon cube in the water. Add the salsa, corn and creamed corn, fat free refried beans, cooked ground turkey and the hot sauce. Stir and cook on medium-high for 12 minutes. Add the chopped scallions and cook 3 minutes more. You may add salt, pepper, or favourite seasonings to taste if needed. I like to add a little fresh ground pepper.
Serve hot in bowls, garnished with a dollop of fat free sour cream. My husband likes to add a little low fat grated cheese to his.
