Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 pounds beef skirt steak, cut into strips
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon Thai red curry paste, or to taste
1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce
1 1/2 cups sliced zucchini
1 large lime, zested and fruit cut into quarters
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle beef strips lightly with salt and black pepper, and sear the meat in the hot oil until well browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes, working in batches. Do not crowd beef. Transfer beef to a plate.
Reduce heat to medium, and cook the shallots until they start to become tender, about 2 minutes; stir in ginger and cook 1 additional minute. Stir in the curry paste, and fry 1 more minute. Mix in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil, scraping up and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet. Stir in the coconut milk and fish sauce.
Increase heat to medium-high, and return beef and any juices to the skillet. Stir to coat with sauce, and simmer until tender, 10 to 12 minutes; stir in the zucchini, cover the skillet, and simmer until zucchini are tender, about 8 minutes. Mix in the lime zest; sprinkle with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
