Description: 
This is an easy-to-make family favorite and has always been served as a side dish at our Thanksgiving dinners. Don't let the horseradish scare you. It merely adds a tangy flavor. You can use pre-made bread crumbs to make it even easier. Light mayo works fine and so does cooking spray on the casserole dish in place of butter.
