Directions:
Combine peaches and bourbon in a bowl. Let soak for 30 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill bread slices until grill marks appear, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Grill peaches until dark grill marks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Place Burrata cheese and arugula on a platter. Drizzle olive on top; season with salt and pepper. Add grilled peaches to the platter. Drizzle balsamic glaze over Burrata cheese, arugula, and peaches. Scatter prosciutto on top. Serve with grilled bread.

Description: 
I hope I had you at bourbon-soaked peaches. Sometimes ingredients come together so perfectly all you need to do is assemble and enjoy.
 These juicy, ripe peaches soaked in bourbon, combined with rich, salty prosciutto, creamy Burrata, and peppery arugula hit all the right flavor notes making this the most amazing harmonious dish I've had in a long time. Plus grilling fruit deepens its flavor which enhances everything. I'm not kidding about this one. Time to hit the patio and put this dish on heavy summer rotation.
