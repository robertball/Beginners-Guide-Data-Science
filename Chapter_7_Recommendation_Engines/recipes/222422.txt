Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup sour cream
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups chopped rhubarb
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk flour, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl. Beat butter and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth, and stir in sour cream, egg, and vanilla extract, mixing well. Stir flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until incorporated; pour batter into prepared baking dish. Spread rhubarb over batter. Mix white sugar with cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the rhubarb.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is an 'any time of day' cake that my mom used to make. Good warm or cold, this cake is incredibly moist inside, while the surface has a tiny bit of crisp from the sugar granules. Tangy rhubarb and sour cream are offset by the sweet cake and sugar sprinkle. It is DE-lish!
