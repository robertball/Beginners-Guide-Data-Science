Ingredients:
10c white flour (the finer, the better)
2 packages active dry yeast (quick works well)
10 heaping TBS butter-flavored crisco
1 TBSP sugar
1 tsp salt
2 c warm water (almost untouchable)

Directions:
Disolve yeast in water and add the sugar. Let sit for 10 minutes or until the yeast is visably active. (It will make little bubbles)
In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Slowly add in the yeast mixture until it is partially combined. Add in the crisco one spoonful at a time. Combine until the dough doesn't stick to hands anymore and knead for 10 minutes on a floured surface.
After you're finished kneading, put the dough in a greased bowl and cover the top with plastic wrap. Put in a warm area for an hour and a half or until doubled.
