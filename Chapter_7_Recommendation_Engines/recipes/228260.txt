Description: 
Perfect recipe for those who enjoy eating delicious food more than preparing it! Letting the frozen vegetables thaw instead of cooking them cuts down on the prep time and helps keep them crisp. Feel free to mix and match with different types of beans; I've also used garbanzo beans, white beans, black-eyed peas, and kidney beans in this recipe.
