Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans, rinsed
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1/2 pound bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground cumin, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
Place pinto beans into a large pot and pour in enough water to cover by 2 to 3 inches. Let beans soak overnight.
Drain beans, return to pot, and pour in fresh water to cover; add diced tomatoes, bacon, onion, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 hours.
Stir cilantro and salt into bean mixture; simmer until beans are soft, about 1 more hour.

Description: 
Pinto beans are simmered with onion, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and garlic. I love making these beans just because they make the whole house smell so good, and the longer they simmer the better they taste. You could add 1/2 can of beer to make 'borracho' beans. I personally taste-test throughout the entire cooking process and add extra seasoning as I feel it needs it. These beans could simmer all day long; just make sure they have plenty of water to keep the beans covered.
