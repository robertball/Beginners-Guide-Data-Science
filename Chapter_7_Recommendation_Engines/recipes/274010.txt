Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced, or more to taste
1 small head green cabbage, cored and shredded
1/4 small head red cabbage, shredded
1 carrot, grated
1 cup sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
1/2 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and saute over medium-high heat, until evenly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.
Combine green cabbage, red cabbage, and carrot in a large bowl.
Mix sour cream, mayonnaise, sugar, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a separate bowl.
Add about 1/2 the dressing to the cabbage mixture and combine well. Continue adding and stirring in enough of the remaining dressing to thoroughly coat vegetables.
Stir in blue cheese and green onions. Sprinkle bacon on top before serving.
