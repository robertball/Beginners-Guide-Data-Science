Ingredients:
8 large Yukon gold or red salad potatoes (approximately 2 lb.)
2 tbsp. finely chopped sweet Vidalia onion
8 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced
1 cup sour cream
1-1/2 cups mayonnaise
3/4 c. creamy Vidalia onion salad dressing

Directions:
Cover potatoes in cold water.  Bring to a boil and turn low.  Gently simmer until fork poked into largest potato goes in easily, taking care not to allow potatoes to overcook and become mushy.
Rinse potatoes with cold water and allow to cool for 15 minutes.
Remove peelings from potatoes and slice thinly into bowl.
In separate bowl, mix all remaining ingredients, except eggs.
Fold dressing into potatoes.  Add eggs.  Gently fold eggs into potato salad.  Cover and refrigerate 2-3 hours, or until well chilled.  Serves 6-8.
Note:  May substitute Henri's Tastee dressing or other creamy dressing to taste.
