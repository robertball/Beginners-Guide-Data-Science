Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) cans jellied cranberry sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup cranberry juice
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
4 pounds pork roast
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water
salt to taste

Directions:
Mash cranberry sauce with a fork or a potato masher.  Stir in sugar, cranberry juice, mustard, and cloves.
Place pork roast in a large, roasting pan.  Pour cranberry sauce mixture over the roast.
Cook at 275 degree F (135 degrees C) for 6 to 8 hours, or until meat is tender.  Remove roast, and keep warm.
With a metal spoon, skim the fat from the liquid in the roasting pan.  Pour 2 cups of the remaining roasting liquid (add water to fill out the measure if necessary) into a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Blend cornstarch and cold water to make a paste; stir gradually into boiling liquid.  Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens.  Add salt to taste. Serve with the roast.
