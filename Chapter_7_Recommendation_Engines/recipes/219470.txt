Ingredients:
12 mini graham cracker crusts
3 cups sweetened condensed milk
1 cup sour cream
1 cup freshly squeezed Key lime juice
3 tablespoons grated Key lime zest
2 fresh Key limes, thinly sliced
1 (7 ounce) can whipped cream topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place mini graham cracker crusts onto a baking sheet.
In a bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, Key lime juice, and Key lime zest until smooth.  Pour the filling into the graham cracker crusts, filling to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot, 5 to 8 minutes. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. To serve, garnish each mini pie with a Key lime slice and a dollop of whipped cream topping.
