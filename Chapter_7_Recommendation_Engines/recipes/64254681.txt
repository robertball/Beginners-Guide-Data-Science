Description: 
Traditional Italian apple cake. Most grandmothers make this simple treat for breakfast or a afternoon snack for the family. It's my husband's favorite. It is so easy my daughter has been making it since she was 12. This is a gluten free adaptation. Use all purpose, sifted, wheat flour cup for cup for a gluten version.
