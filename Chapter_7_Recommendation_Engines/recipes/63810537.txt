Ingredients:
2-3 tablespoons of Ortega reduced fat refried beans OR mushed up beans of choice
2 tablespoons of daiya cheese (totally optional)
1 low carb/ high fiber soft taco shell (or average taco shell, if you're a fatty xD)
Iceberg/Romaine Lettuce (not optional!)
Optional Topping Include:
-yellow or red sauteed/raw bell peppers
-diced tomato
-diced red onions
-corn
-guacamole (or hummus, if you're feeling greek)
-salsa or sofritos

Directions:
Heat up the refried beans in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Stir.
Lay the soft taco shell on a large plate and microwave for 10 seconds (optional).
Evenly spread 2-3 tablespoons of refried beans in the center of the taco, leaving space on two horozontal sides.
Layer your toppings, but make sure not to overfill.
Fold in the two sides where you left extra room while filling slightly. Then wrap the other sides over. This should ensure that the taco is not messy while eating.
Enjoy!
