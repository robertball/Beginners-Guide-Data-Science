Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 cups Sesame seeds, sesame seed oil

Directions:
Soak seeds overnight with a towel covering them, rinse in the morning. Lay on a cookie sheet and roast at 300 for 15 mins. Allow to cool. Put sesame seeds in a food processor and pulse while watching the seeds, the consistency should begin to look like peanut butter, add sesame seed oil one tablespoon at a time to achieve the desired consistency (should be like a peanut butter). Olive oil, or coconut oil can replace sesame oil if in a pinch. I make this with olive oil sometimes.

Description: 
I was desperate for hummus and realized that I had all of the ingredients aside from tahini, so I googled how to make it... Modified it for a small batch and voila! The idea seems to be pretty consistent on how to do it.
