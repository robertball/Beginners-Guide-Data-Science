Ingredients:
0.75 liters full-cream milk
1 tin condensed milk
1 tin evaporated milk
1 pinch saffron threads
8 cardamom (elaichi) pods, shelled and ground fine
¼ cup sugar (more or less to taste)
5  6 slices white bread
¼ cup blanched almonds (optional)

Directions:
Add milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk into a heavy-bottomed pot. Add saffron, cardamom, and sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, to prevent milk from scorching at the bottom. Cook 10 – 15 minutes, till slightly thickened.
Remove all the crusts from the bread. Break the bread apart into tiny pieces by hand. Add the bread to the milk mixture. Turn the heat off.
Toast the almonds in a pan for a few minutes till nutty and light brown. Chop the almonds into small pieces. Save some of the almonds for garnishing. Add the rest of the almonds to the rabri.
Chill the rabri for a few hours.
The rabri will thicken when cooled. When you are ready to serve, add a bit of milk till you get the desired consistency. Ladle rabri into serving bowls, garnish with almonds and serve.
