Ingredients:
3 oranges
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup long-grain brown rice
1/4 cup low-sodium beef broth
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons chili-garlic sauce
2 tablespoons low-sugar marmalade
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cornstarch
cooking spray
3/4 pound beef shoulder tender, cut into bite-size strips
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 carrot, julienned into 2-inch pieces
6 green onions, bias-sliced into 2-inch pieces
1 large red bell pepper, cut into bite-size strips
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Remove 1 tablespoon zest and 1/4 cup juice from 1 orange. Peel and section remaining 2 oranges.
Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes.
Stir together zest, orange juice, broth, soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, marmalade, sesame oil, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk in cornstarch.
Coat a wok or large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat. Stir-fry beef until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add vegetable oil and carrot to the wok; stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes. Add green onions and bell pepper; stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add garlic and ginger; stir-fry for 30 seconds more.
Return beef to the wok. Stir cornstarch mixture, then add to the wok. Cook, stirring, until thickened and bubbling. Add orange sections; cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.
Divide rice among 4 plates; top with beef mixture and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
