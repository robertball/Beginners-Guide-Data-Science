Ingredients:
1-1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp granulated sugar
1 package active dry yeast
2 tbsp olive oil
1 cup warm water
2-1/2 cups bread flour

Directions:
In medium bowl, mix salt, sugar, and yeast. Add olive oil and warm water. Stir until dissolved.
Mix in 1 cup of flour and then slowly add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until dough can no longer be mixed with wooden spoon.
Turn dough onto floured board. Knead dough for about 5 minutes, adding flour when necessary to create a soft dough.
Divide dough into 8 equal parts and form into balls. Keep dough balls on board and cover to rise for 20 minutes.
Move oven rack to the bottom setting. Preheat oven 500 degrees F. Place the baking sheet in oven so that it is hot when you place the dough on it.
After the rise, flatten each dough ball with your hand. Use rolling pin to roll each dough ball so that it is a 1/4 inch thick and about 5 inches across.
Place two rounds on the baking sheet and bake on lowest rack for 8 minutes or until puffed. Remove from oven, use metal spatula to remove the pita breads, and place the next two rounds in oven.
After each pita has been baked, poke a hole in it with the corner of the spatula and flatten.
