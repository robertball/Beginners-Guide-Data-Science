Ingredients:
8 medium eggs
2 cups sugar
12-oz can evaporated milk
6 cups whole milk
2 cups whipping cream
1 Tbs vanilla
1 tsp salt
5 lbs rock salt more or less
20 lbs ice (not crushed ice) more or less
1-2 glasses water more or less

Directions:
Break eggs into a large mixing bowl -- beat at low speed.
While mixing slowly, add sugar, evaporated milk, milk, and cream to mixing bowl.
Add vanilla and salt to mixing bowl -- mix well.
Pre-chill mixture for an hour in freezer for best results
Pour cream mixture into freezer-can.
Twist paddle in cream to mix and assure that the container will turn freely.
Close and attach freezer motor.
Start freezer motor -- begin alternately adding salt and ice around can.
Add enough water to ice around the can to prevent motor from jamming up.
The freezing time should be about 20-30 minutes
Continue to add salt and salted ice as needed (so the ice level comes up to the top)
When the motor strains and finally quits, turn the motor off and remove the motor.
To firm the consistency of ice cream after freezing, allow ice cream to "ripen" as follows: Remove the beater - be careful not to get salt in ice cream Replace the lid. Pack additional salted ice around the can -- cover freezer with heavy towels or newspaper. Let stand for 1 hour (or even a little more).
You can also ripen in the freezer.
