Ingredients:
WHITE CHOCOLATE BAR:
2 oz cocoa butter
? cup Swerve confectioners
1 vanilla bean (OR 1 Tsp vanilla extract or other extracts like MINT, make sure it isn't alcohol based or it will be separated)
? tsp Celtic sea salt
MILK CHOCOLATE BAR:
Add ¼ oz unsweetened baking chocolate
DARK CHOCOLATE BAR:
Add ½ to 1 oz unsweetened baking chocolate (depending on how dark you like it)

Directions:
Place cocoa butter in a double boiler and heat on medium high until fully melted (or microwave safe bowl and heat on high for one minute, check and heat for 30 seconds until melted). Melting cocoa butter takes longer than traditional fats.
Stir in natural sweetener.
Stir in vanilla beans (split and strip beans from a vanilla bean) or extracts and salt.
Place into truffle mold and cool in the refrigerator until white chocolate is solid, about an hour. Or the speedy method; you can place the molds in a freezer till they are set up, which will only take a couple of minutes versus an hour.
