Ingredients:
2 spaghetti squash, quartered and seeded
1 pound kale
1 quart tomatoes
1 pound ground beef
1 medium yellow onion, minced
1 head garlic, peeled and minced
1/4 cup dried basil
1/4 cup dried oregano
2 tablespoons kosher salt
2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 cup cottage cheese, divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese

Directions:
Place 2 pieces of spaghetti squash on a microwave-safe place with cut sides facing down. Microwave on high until tender, about 15 minutes. Repeat with remaining 2 pieces of spaghetti squash. Scoop squash out of shells into a large bowl and reserve shells.
Transfer 1/2 the cooked squash to a food processor and finely chop. Return squash to the bowl and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Place kale in the food processor and chop finely. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Puree 1/2 the tomatoes in the food processor. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add basil, oregano, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Let simmer for 5 minutes.
Add spaghetti squash, kale, tomatoes, tomato puree, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/2 of the cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and cream cheese to the skillet with the ground beef. Reduce heat to low and simmer until cheeses are melted, about 5 minutes. Remove lasagna sauce from heat.
Spread 2 tablespoons of cottage cheese into each spaghetti squash shell. Scoop lasagna sauce into the shells up to the top. Freeze or refrigerate leftover sauce. Top filled shells with remaining mozzarella cheese.
Place filled shells on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake for 10 minutes. Turn the oven to broil and cook lasagnas until cheese is browned, about 5 minutes more.
