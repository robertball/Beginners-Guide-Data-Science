Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups chopped onions
2/3 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon curry powder
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 cups peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
3 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
2 tablespoons dark rum
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 3/4 cups pineapple juice
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice, or to taste
1/4 cup toasted unsweetened coconut flakes (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onions and celery and cook until translucent, about 10 minutes. Cover the pot and stir often to prevent sticking.
Add ginger, curry power, bay leaves, salt, and nutmeg to the pot with the vegetables. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute. Add sweet potatoes, stock, rum, and lemon zest and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves. Pour pineapple juice into the pot and cook until warmed, about 3 minutes.
Puree soup using a stick blender until smooth. Reheat gently, if necessary. Stir in lime juice. Garnish individual bowls with coconut flakes and cilantro.
