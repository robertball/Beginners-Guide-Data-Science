Ingredients:
1/2 cup jasmine rice
5 1/2 cups water
5 fluid ounces coconut milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place jasmine rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Bring jasmine rice and 5 1/2 cups water to a boil in a large pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until rice breaks down and grains disappear, about 20 minutes.
Stir coconut milk and sugar into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 15 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This sweet Burmese porridge is usually served after the main dish on a cold night. It is common knowledge in Burma that coconut milk helps you sleep. That is why my hubby and many others only eat this dish in small portions.
