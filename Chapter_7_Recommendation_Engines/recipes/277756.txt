Ingredients:
12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 cups half-and-half

Directions:
Place chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted and completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Add half-and-half slowly to avoid cooling chocolate mixture too much, stirring while you add it. Heat until hot but not boiling.

Description: 
I was always taught that hot chocolate was made with chocolate and hot cocoa was made with cocoa powder. This is the richest hot chocolate you'll ever have. I don't remember where I got this recipe from. Add cinnamon or nutmeg, if desired. Serve in small tea or coffee cups, because it is very rich!
