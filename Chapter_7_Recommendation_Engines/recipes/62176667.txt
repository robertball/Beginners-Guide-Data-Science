Ingredients:
5 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 sweet onion, chopped
1/2 lb diced smoked sausage or ham
1 can whole kernel corn, undrained
1 can cream style corn
2 tablespoons margarine
salt and pepper to taste
2 cubes  chicken bouillon
1 can carrots
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
4 oz velveeta cheese, cut into small cubes

Directions:
In a slow cooker, place the potatoes, onions, smoked sausage or ham, corn, butter or margarine and salt and pepper to taste. Add water to barely cover and two bouillon cubes.
Cook on low setting for 8 to 9 hours and then stir in the can of carrots, evaporated milk & cheese. Cook for 30 more minutes.
I like to insert a hand blender when almost done & blend a little bit to thicken the broth & smooth the texture. Make sure to leave at least half unblended to maintain nice chunks in the soup.
