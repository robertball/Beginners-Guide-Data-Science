Ingredients:
1 egg
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons margarine, melted
1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 cups cooked white rice
1 1/2 cups shredded zucchini
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat the egg in a large bowl. Pour milk and margarine into the egg. Slowly stream the soup into the egg mixture while stirring to prevent lumps. Stir rice, zucchini, and Cheddar cheese into the mixture; pour into an 8-inch baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A gooey, cheesy side dish that I invented while trying to use up my plentiful zucchini crop. Comfort food with an interesting texture and mild flavors. Great for the little ones!
