Ingredients:
2 Tbsp organic lemon zest (one large lemon)
1 Tbsp organic lemon juice
150g superfine white sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
4 medium eggs, at room temperature
500g fresh ricotta, at room temperature
3 Tbsp corn starch

Directions:
Preheat airfryer to 160Â°C. Do not preheat the baking pan, only the basket.
Sift the corn starch and set aside.
Add ricotta, sugar, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest to a mixing bowl. Mix on medium speed until a smooth consistency is achieved.
While mixing, add the eggs one at a time waiting to add the next egg until the previous one has been fully incorporated. Add the sifted corn starch. Mix well.
Pour the batter into the baking pan. Insert the baking pan into the fryer basket. Set the timer for 25 minutes.
At 25 minutes, check the cheesecake. It is ready when the middle has set.
At high altitude, it will need between 5 and 8 minutes more.
