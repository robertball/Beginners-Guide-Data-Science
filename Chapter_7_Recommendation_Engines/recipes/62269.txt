Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 limes, juiced
1 (12 ounce) bottle pale ale style beer
1 teaspoon honey
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. When grill is ready, brush the grate lightly with oil.
In a shallow bowl, mix together the lime juice, beer, honey, cilantro, salt and pepper. Place chicken into the sauce, cover, and marinate for about 30 minutes.
Remove chicken breasts from marinade, and place on the grill. Grill for about 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear, and the internal temperature of the meat has reached 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Discard leftover marinade.
