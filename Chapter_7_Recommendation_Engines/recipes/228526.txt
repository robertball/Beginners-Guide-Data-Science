1 cup kasha (toasted buckwheat groats)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 onions, peeled and chopped
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
1 cucumber, peeled and diced
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
6 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1 lemon, juiced
1 pinch dried mixed herbs

Directions:
Rinse buckwheat groats. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil, sprinkle in the buckwheat groats, and simmer until buckwheat is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Lightly toss cucumber, parsley, mint, lemon juice, and mixed herbs in a large salad bowl until thoroughly combined; stir in cooked buckwheat and onion mixture.
