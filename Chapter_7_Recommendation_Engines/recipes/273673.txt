Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can refried black beans
1 (16 ounce) can black beans
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 corn tostada shells
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/4 cup salsa, or as desired (optional)
1/4 cup shredded lettuce, or as desired (optional)
1/4 cup sour cream, or as desired (optional)
1/4 cup guacamole, or as desired (optional)

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Combine refried black beans, black beans, green chiles, garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until warm and combined, 3 to 4 minutes.
Place tostada shells on an ungreased baking sheet and evenly distribute bean mixture between them. Top with Monterey Jack cheese.
Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully to avoid burning tostadas, 1 to 3 minutes.
Serve immediately and garnish with salsa, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole.
