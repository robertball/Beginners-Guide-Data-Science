Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup vinegar
1/4 cup oil
1 egg
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 2 mini muffin tins with cooking spray.
Mix milk and vinegar together in a bowl; let stand until milk curdles, about 5 minutes. Beat in oil and egg.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; stir into milk mixture until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tins with a tablespoon or a small batter scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until batter is risen and still pale, about 8 minutes. Remove from muffin cups with a silicone scraper.

Description: 
Pancakes didn't turn out so well on my electric stove top, so I invented these. They are light and airy and freeze well too. Try them with strawberry jam, dipped in syrup, or sprinkled with powdered sugar. Perfect for kid and adult brunches! This is a wonderful pancake recipe on its own too.
