Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) very fresh salmon fillet
1 teaspoon minced shallot
1 teaspoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 teaspoon minced fresh chives
1 teaspoon minced cornichon (small pickled cucumber)
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, or more to taste
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove salmon skin and cut out the grey colored blood line so you have only the shiny pink flesh. Cut salmon into small cubes and place in a bowl. Mix in shallot, parsley, chives, pickle, lemon juice, sea salt, and pepper. Let marinate for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A beautifully simple preparation of raw fish that is a celebration of freshness. The thing I love about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavor, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a cooked texture on the surface of the meat whilst leaving the centre rare and soft. Serve with buttered crusty brown toast.
