Ingredients:
10 stalks fresh rhubarb, chopped
2 cups white sugar, or to taste
1 quart water
1 quart water
8 black tea bags
1 tablespoon honey
1 cup white sugar

Directions:
Place rhubarb into a large pot with the sugar and 1 quart of water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, until rhubarb becomes a thick paste. Cool, then spoon into ice cube trays and freeze overnight.
Bring 1 quart of water to a boil. Pour into a pitcher over the tea bags. Stir in honey and sugar. Cool, then refrigerate until chilled. Serve cold ice tea with rhubarb ice cubes.

Description: 
This recipe actually started out as ice cubes for my son to chew on while teething, but I threw a few in my ice tea and it was great!
