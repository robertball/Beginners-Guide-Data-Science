Ingredients:
Crust:
Crisco速 Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
5 tablespoons Crisco速 Vegetable Oil
Filling:
1 quart chocolate ice cream, softened until spreadable
1 (17 ounce) jar Smucker's速 Hot Fudge Microwaveable Ice Cream Topping, heated just until pourable
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
2 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9-inch pie plate with Crisco No Stick Cooking Spray; set aside. In a medium bowl combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and oil; mix well with fork. Press firmly onto bottom and up sides of pie plate. Bake 5 minutes; cool.
Using a flexible spatula spread half of softened ice cream evenly into cooled crust. Pour Smucker's Hot Fudge Sauce evenly over. Return to freezer to set; about 10 minutes. Spread remaining ice cream over, covering fudge layer completely. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.
Drop marshmallow creme by spoonfuls over top of pie. Using moistened fingertips, spread in even layer, covering top of pie completely. Sprinkle mini marshmallows evenly over, pressing slightly to adhere. Cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
Preheat broiler. Cover pie crust edges with foil. Broil pie just until marshmallows are lightly golden, watching closely to avoid burning, about 1 minute. Serve immediately.
