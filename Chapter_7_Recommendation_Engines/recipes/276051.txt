Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 pounds boneless prime rib roast
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine garlic powder, basil, oregano, onion powder, and pepper in a bowl.
Trim excess fat from the top of the roast and place in a shallow roasting pan. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Coat with the herb mixture on all sides.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven, cover with foil, and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing.
