Ingredients:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups vanilla wafer crumbs
3/4 cup toasted, ground hazelnuts
2 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur
13 skinned, toasted hazelnuts
4 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon hazelnut liqueur

Directions:
Using a blender or a food processor, finely chop 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips.  Place in a small mixing bowl.  Add vanilla wafer crumbs, ground hazelnuts, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and melted butter or margarine.  Mix until well combined.  Press onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch springform pan.  Bake in a preheated 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) oven for 15 minutes.  Cool.
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until fluffy.  Gradually add 1 cup white sugar; mix well.  Add the eggs and 3 tablespoons liqueur.  Mix until well blended.  Coarsely chop 1 cup of the semisweet chocolate chips, and add to the cream cheese mixture.  Stir.  Pour batter into the cooled crust.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour.  Let cake cool for 1 hour.  Remove outer ring from pan.  Then let cool completely.
Melt 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips over hot (not boiling) water.  Stir until smooth.  Dip 13 hazelnuts into the chocolate, covering one-half of each nut.  Shake off the excess chocolate.  Place on a waxed-paper lined plate.  Chill until set.
To the remaining melted chocolate, add sour cream.  Mix well.  Stir in 1 tablespoon liqueur.  Spread glaze on top of the cooled cheesecake.  Garnish with chocolate dipped hazelnuts.
