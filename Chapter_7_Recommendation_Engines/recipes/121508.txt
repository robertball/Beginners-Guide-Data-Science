Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package chopped dates
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
2 tablespoons chopped red candied cherries

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, combine dates, sugar and water. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in walnuts and cherries. Cool completely. Divide dough in half; roll one portion between two sheets of waxed paper into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread with half of the filling. Roll up into a tight jelly roll, starting with a long side; wrap in waxed paper. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until firm. Cut into 3/8-in. slices with a sharp knife; place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

When I want to make a cookie with fruit in it, this recipe is my first choice. It turns out well each time and has earned plenty of praise, including ribbons at our state fair.
