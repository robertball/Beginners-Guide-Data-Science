Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 cups sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cocoa
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup wesson oil (or another liquid oil)
2 whole eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Mix vinegar in with one cup and milk and let it sit at least 5 minutes or until milk is curdled.
Mix in order: flour, sugar, salt cocoa, soda, oil, eggs, curdled milk, vanilla, and boiling water.
Bake at 350Â° until done. When you can poke a toothpick in the center and it comes out clean then it is done.
This will make a much lighter, less dense cake if you mix ingredients by hand.

Description: 
This is a homemade chocolate cake that just can't be beat for moistness. I'm the third generation in my family to make this old family favorite.
