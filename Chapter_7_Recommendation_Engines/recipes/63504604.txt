Ingredients:
4 Cups Flour
3 Medium Eggs
1/4 cup Melted butter
3/4 cup Milk
Salt & Pepper
2 Peeled Medium Potatoes, roughly sliced into medium chunks.
2 Slices of Well-Toasted Rustic Bread (Sourdough, French, Italian)

Directions:
Mix flour, eggs, melted butter and milk together, with a pinch of salt and pepper, to form a ball of dough that is not too sticky or dry.  Let sit for 10 minutes.
Set a large pot of water to boil and add potatoes chunks. Quarter the dough and roll the pieces into long sausage size tubes.  With scissors in one hand and the roll of dough in the other, flatten the dough and cut 1/4-1/2 inch diagonals over the boiling water (allow the cuttings to gently slide into the water so they don't splash). Let cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Strain noodles and potatoes and put into a large bowl.  Crush the toasted bread into the noodles, and mix with a spoon.
Serve with gravy and your favorite meatballs.
