Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/4 cup shortening, melted
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12 cup muffin pan or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the egg, shortening and milk. Stir until well blended. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
