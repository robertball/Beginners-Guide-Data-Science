Ingredients:
Nonstick vegetable oil spray (like Pam)
4 large eggs
3/4 cup low-fat (1% or 2%) cottage cheese
1 cup buttermilk baking mix (like Bisquick)
3 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sauteed mushrooms, drained and chopped
2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees if using a conventional oven (350 degrees if using convection/bake mode oven).  Spray forty-eight of 1 ¾” diameter muffin cups (2 pans) with nonstick spray.
Whisk eggs thoroughly in a large bowl and then add remaining ingredients and whisk to blend well.
Fill each cup to just below the top (less than a full tablespoon) with batter.
Bake tarts until golden and puffed. This will be about 20 minutes, but may vary based on oven calibration. Keep a close eye on them so as not to burn them. Remove from pans onto cooling rack after 2-3 minutes of in pan cooling.
