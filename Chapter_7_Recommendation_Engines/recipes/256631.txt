Ingredients:
1 tablespoon salt
2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
Â½ cup peach preserves
1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Fill a bowl with warm water; stir in 1 tablespoon salt until mostly dissolved. Add chicken breasts and let brine in the salt water for at least 15 minutes.
Bring peach preserves and jalapeno to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Reduce heat to low.
Rinse chicken with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.
Stir olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a bowl until combined. Brush over each piece of chicken.
Place chicken in the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven grill pan. Press "Auto Cook" and select setting 1. Cook chicken until juices run clear, flipping halfway through, about 18 minutes. Brush with peach glaze and cook for 2 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Let chicken rest for 3 to 4 minutes; brush with glaze again. Drizzle remaining glaze over chicken and serve.
