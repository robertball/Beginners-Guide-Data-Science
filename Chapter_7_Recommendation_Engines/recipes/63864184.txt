Description: 
Ive been experimenting with my slow cooker ever since I got it. Without fail, this is the best recipe to come out of it yet. The chicken is super moist and tender, with a great garlicky roasted flavor. Although there is only two people in my household, I always make two, because it all gets eaten every time!
