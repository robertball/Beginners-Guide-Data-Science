Ingredients:
For the Sriracha mayo:
1/2 cup real mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce
For the pickle chips:
1 16 oz. jar dill pickle chips (8 oz. drained)
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
Non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise and Sriracha sauce together in a small bowl.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Heat air fryer to 400 degrees.
Drain pickle chips, and dry the chips with paper towels.
Mix egg and milk together in a bowl.
Mix flour, cornmeal, seasoning salt, paprika, garlic powder, and pepper in another bowl.
Dip pickle chips in the egg mixture, then dip in the flour mixture, coating both sides and lightly pressing the flour mixture onto the pickle chips.
Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray, then place pickle chips in the basket in a single layer.  You may need to split the pickles into two batches depending on the size of your air fryer basket.
Cook pickle chips for 4 minutes, then carefully flip the chips.  Cook for an additional 4 minutes, or until desired brownness.
Serve with Sriracha mayo.

Description: 
This crispy and satisfying appetizer is a lower-guilt alternative to deep-fried pickle chips.  Using pre-sliced pickle chips is a shortcut that makes this quick to prepare.  You can reduce the Sriracha sauce to one tablespoon if you like a less-spicy sauce.
