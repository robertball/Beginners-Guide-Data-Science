Ingredients:
1 3/4 Cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 Cups powdered sugar, sifted
1/2 Cup Coca (natural or dutch)
1 Cup butter (2 sticks), cold
1 8 oz. package cream cheese
1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk
1 egg
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 Cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, and cocoa.
Blend in the butter until the mixture is crumbly and rather dry. If you don’t mind a little mess, it is easier to do this with your hands. Reserve 2 Cups of the mixture for the topping.
Press the remaining mixture into the bottom of an ungreased, 9x13 pan.
Bake the crust for 15 minutes. While the crust is baking, beat the cream cheese until fluffy.
Beat in the condensed milk until smooth. Add the egg and vanilla. Mix well.
Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust.
If you are using walnuts, combine them with the 2 Cups of reserved cocoa mixture. Sprinkle over the top of the cream cheese filling.
Bake for 25 minutes until bubbly. Chill for at least 2 hours before cutting. Store in the refrigerator.
