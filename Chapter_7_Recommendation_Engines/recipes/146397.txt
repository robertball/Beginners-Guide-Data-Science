Ingredients:
3 tablespoons corn oil
6 cloves garlic, chopped
2 habanero peppers, seeded and minced
1/2 teaspoon flaked sea salt
1 1/2 teaspoons honey
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 dill pickle, minced
1/3 cup mayonnaise
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the corn oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, habanero peppers, and sea salt. Cook and stir until the garlic begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir honey into water until dissolved, then pour into garlic mixture. Simmer until the water has almost evaporated, then scrape the mixture into a metal bowl.
Stir in cream, pickle, and mayonnaise. Place mixture into refrigerator, and chill until cold. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
This delicious, just spicy enough tartar sauce is especially good with fried seafood.  The honey really mellows the habanero and makes the tartar perfect.
