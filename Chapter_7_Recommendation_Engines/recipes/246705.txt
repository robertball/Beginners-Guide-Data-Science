1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (optional)

2/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread apple pie filling in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top.
Mix flour, brown sugar, margarine, and baking powder in a large bowl to make a soft dough. Spoon dough over apple filling.

Description: 
This is a family treat that's been passed down for generations. The recipe was sometimes tripled because it had to be shared among a family of eight. This can be served with ice cream! It tastes best served hot.
