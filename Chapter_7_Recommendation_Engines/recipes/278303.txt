Description: 
My best French friend Cecile introduced me to Espelette pepper powder and I can't get enough of it! It's a red pepper powder from French commune of Espelette that is mildly spicy and full of flavor. This pasta dish combines Espelette pepper with shrimp and feta and the three ingredients work together beautifully. I like to call this dish Les Pates de Cecile (Cecile's Pasta). For additional flavor and a nice presentation, you can crumble some additional feta over each serving and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.
