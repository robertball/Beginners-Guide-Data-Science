Ingredients:
4-6 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes
1 large onion, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
2-3 cloves garlic minced
kosher salt
1/4 cup butter, cold, cut into chunks

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
Place potatoes and onions (and mushrooms) in a large foil packet, using about 3 layers of foil. You may also want to spray the foil with cooking spray to prevent potatoes from sticking to foil. Sprinkle with garlic and salt.
Cook potatoes on preheated grill until tender, 30 to 40 minutes.  Turn at least once during cooking to ensure that they cook evenly.
Remove to serving dish and sprinkle with blue cheese (or feta or goat...)
