Ingredients:
1/3 cup skim milk
1/4 cup old-fashioned oats
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon low-sugar raspberry preserves
1 1/2 teaspoons chia seeds
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/3 cup sliced raspberries

Directions:
Combine milk, oats, yogurt, raspberry preserves, chia seeds, and almond extract together in a jar or container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and vigorously shake mixture until well mixed. Remove lid and stir in raspberries. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours.

Description: 
You can really use any combination of preserves, extract and berries you like. The oatmeal absorbs all the liquid overnight, and becomes almost pudding-like. My husband, who has an intense dislike for cooked oatmeal, loves this. Chia seeds can be found in most health food or Whole FoodsÂ®-type stores.
