Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/4 cup milk
1/2 roma tomato
1/2 slice of onion
1 tsp "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" light
1 tbsp grated parmasan cheese

Directions:
Beat together in a cup 2 egg white with milk
Heat up small pan and add the buttery spread to coat pan on low heat
Add diced tomato and onion to the egg and milk and continue beating
Pour the egg, milk, onion, tomato mix to the pan and raise heat to medium high - be sure that the mix covers the entire pan to the edges
Sprinkle the grated parmasan cheese over the open faced omelet
After about 3 minutes the edges should be browning and the egg has changed from clear white to opaque white. With a spatula gently lift the browned edges, working your way around the pan. Do this to check that the omelette had cooked enough to be folded
Next, with the spatula lift one side of the omelette and fold so that it meets the other side. Your omlette should now be a half circle and nicely browned
Enjoy!
