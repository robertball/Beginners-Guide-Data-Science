Description: 
In honor of my Irish heritage and maiden name, I am dedicating these to my children. My kids love mint and I put this recipe together for St. Patrick's Day a few years back. It turned out better then anticipated. I want to share with others this recipe and hope others enjoy this as much as my family does.
