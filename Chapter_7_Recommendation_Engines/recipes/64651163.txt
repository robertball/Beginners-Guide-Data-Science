Ingredients:
1 octopus hot dog (step by step directions included below)
3 ounce package instant ramen noodles (flavor of your choice)
6 cauliflower florets (this with the noodles creates a coral reef appearance)
1/4 cup chopped baby spinach
Get creative with the rest of the bento by using baked fish crackers, grapes for sea pebbles, seaweed chips, all things ocean related cookie cutters including fish, turtle, shark, star for starfish, lobster, etc.  for other items to go in the box. Don't forget that special sweet treat. I used gummy octopus but swedish fish and gummy worms would work well too.

Directions:
Make your octopus using these directions:  http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Hot-Dog-Octopus
Prepare ramen noodle according to package directions and include the cauliflower in this step.
Add the spinach after you turn off the heat and let it sit 3 minutes or until the spinach is wilted.
Refrigerate until ready to assemble your bento box.
