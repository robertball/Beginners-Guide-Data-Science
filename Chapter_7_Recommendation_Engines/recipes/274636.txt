Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package whole wheat penne pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 medium zucchini, halved and sliced
1 medium yellow squash, halved and sliced
1 cup sugar snap peas
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
16 ounces cold heavy cream
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a nonstick wok. Add garlic and saute for 15 seconds. Add zucchini, squash, snap peas, dill, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Saute, stirring constantly, for 10 minutes. Stir cooked pasta into veggie mixture.
Bring heavy cream to a light boil over medium-high heat in a saucepan. Add Parmesan cheese once cream begins to thicken (usually right after it begins to boil); stir constantly just until cheese has melted, making sure not to overcook as it will be lumpy. Stir sauce into veggie-pasta mixture to coat. Serve immediately.
