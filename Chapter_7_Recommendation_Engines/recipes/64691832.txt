Description: 
This was a recipe in a family cookbook from my wife's aunt. I changed it to cook in the slow cooker instead of on the stove. This is simply a chili that is a quick and easy recipe to throw together. I wouldn't say it's overly spicy but it is meaty. Serve with a salad and/or a very small portion of rice.
