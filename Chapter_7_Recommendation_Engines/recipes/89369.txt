Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry fettuccini noodles
3/4 cup butter, divided
1 pound baby portobello mushrooms, sliced
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 ounces cream cheese
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pint whipping cream
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 pounds medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup green onions, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat 1/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms, and cook until soft. Remove mushrooms, and set aside. Wipe out skillet.
Heat 1/2 cup butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Stir in garlic, and cook 1 minute. Add cream cheese, and cook until melted.
Reduce heat to medium low, and stir in flour, whipping cream, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Stir in shrimp, and season with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook until shrimp are pink and sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Fold mushrooms, green onions, and fettuccine into sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan, and serve.

Description: 
This is an easy dish and can be made with different variations. It's also good with chicken breasts, or other seafood such as crawfish tails, scallions or crab meat.  Also great with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles. Sliced white mushrooms can be used if preferred.  Hope you enjoy as much as my family does!
