Ingredients:
5 egg whites
1 cup white sugar, divided
5 egg yolks
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/8 cup powdered sugar, or as needed
1 1/2 pints peppermint ice cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a shallow 11x5-inch baking pan with greased waxed paper.
Beat egg whites using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually add 1/2 cup white sugar and beat until combined.
Beat egg yolks and salt together using an electric mixer in a separate bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until combined. Fold in egg white mixture. Fold in flour and cocoa powder. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven and turn cake onto a towel sprinkled heavily with powdered sugar. Remove waxed paper from cake and form into a roll. Let stand for about 4 minutes.
Unroll cake and spread evenly with peppermint ice cream. Re-roll and freeze until ready to serve.
