Description: 
Amazing personal treats that are easy and fun to make. As an additional garnish, you can use any leftover crumble or sweetened cocoa powder or hot chocolate powder. Also, personalizing the jars with labels or tags for a nice get-together is an extra-special touch and makes a great presentation.
