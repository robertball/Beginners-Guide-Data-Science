Ingredients:
3 pounds russet potatoes
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Dash pepper
Minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until tender. Drain well. Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Peel and grate potatoes. In a bowl, combine the eggs, 3/4 cup flour, bread crumbs, salt, nutmeg and pepper. Add potatoes; mix with hands until well blended. Shape into 1-1/2-in. balls; roll in remaining flour.
In a large kettle, bring salted water to a boil. Add the dumplings, a few at a time, to boiling water. Simmer, uncovered, until the dumplings rise to the top; cook 2 minutes longer. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.

Description: 
With a few additional basic ingredients, my mom transforms potatoes into these delightful dumplings. This authentic German side dish is so hearty and comforting. We love the dumplings covered in sauerbraten gravy.                                                                --Cathy Eland                                                           Hightstown, New Jersey
