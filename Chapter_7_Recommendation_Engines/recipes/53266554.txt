Ingredients:
For the lemongrass dipping sauce
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup honey
1 stalk lemongrass, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
1 teaspoon red chili flakes
For the cucumber salad
1 seedless cucumber
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
Salt, to taste
For the spring rolls
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon ginger, minced
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1/2 pound medium shrimp (about 12Â–13)
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon soy sauce
For assembling
6 Vietnamese rice paper wraps, soaked in cold water for 45 seconds
2 ounces red bell pepper, julienne
1/2 large carrot, shredded (about 2 ounces)
2 cups bean sprouts
2 ounces sugar snap peas, julienne
2 ounces shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced
6 teaspoons fresh mint, shredded, for garnish
2 tablespoons scallions, green parts only, sliced on the bias, for garnish

Directions:
For the lemongrass dipping sauce: In a small stainless-steel saucepan over medium heat, combine the rice vinegar and honey. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes or until it reaches a syrupy consistency. Remove from the heat and add the minced garlic, ginger and chili flakes, and let steep until cooled, about another 30 minutes. Set aside and reserve.
For the cucumber salad: Wash and cut the cucumber in half, lengthwise. Slice into thin half-moons and transfer to a bowl.
In a separate, smaller bowl, whisk together the mirin, sesame oil and rice vinegar. Season to taste with salt. Drizzle the dressing over the sliced cucumber and toss. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
For the shrimp: Over medium to high heat, place the sesame oil, minced ginger, garlic and the shrimp. Cook until the shrimp are pink and not too firm. Add the mirin and let it reduce. Add the soy sauce and cook another minute. Let cool and set aside.
For the assembly: Soak the rice wrappers in cold water for 45 seconds or until pliable. Be careful not to rip the wrappers when removing from the water. Place on cutting board lined with a clean dish towel and spread evenly.
Place some red bell pepper strips, shredded carrots, bean sprouts, shiitake mushrooms, sugar snap peas, two shrimp and 1 teaspoon of shredded mint on each wrapper. Start wrapping at one end and roll over once, then bring in both ends and continue to roll, making sure the filling remains inside and fits snugly. Continue with remaining wrappers and filling.
Cut each spring roll on the bias, and serve with the cucumber salad and the lemongrass dipping sauce. Garnish with sliced scallions.
