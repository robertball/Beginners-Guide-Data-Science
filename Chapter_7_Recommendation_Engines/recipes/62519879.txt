Ingredients:
1 15 OZ can of corn
1 15 OZ can of red kidney beans
2 small or medium red bell peppers
4 OZ walnuts, chopped small
2 medium size dill pickles
2 garlic cloves (optional)[though not for me ;-)]
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (can also be made with parsley or dill)
Extra Virgin Olive oil or mayo to taste
Salt and Pepper to taste, if necessary

Directions:
Drain corn and beans. Chop peppers and pickles into small cubes. Crush garlic though a garlic press. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients. Taste before you add salt -- the pickles add saltiness to the salad. YOU ARE DONE! Check the footnotes.
