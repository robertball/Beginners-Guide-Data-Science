Ingredients:
1 Cake Mix--(Your favorite kind of chocolate cake mix)
1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 cup coconut, divided
1/2 cup slivered or sliced Almonds
1 small 8 oz. can Cream of Coconut (not coconut milk)
1 large (16 oz.) size Cool Whip (if using 2 round cake pans) OR
1 (12 oz.) size Cool Whip if using 9x13 pan

Directions:
Prepare 9x13 pan or 2 9 inch round pans by greasing and flouring well.
Prepare cake mix as directed on package plus the flour.
Fold in 1 cup of the coconut until well combined.
Divide between the 2 round pans or pour into 9x13.
Bake for time given on box plus 5 minutes extra.
While cake is baking, toast the almonds by placing in a skillet on low/med heat for about 10 minutes, stirring often.  Set aside.
Remove cake from oven. While warm, poke cake with pencil size holes all over cake.  Shake the cream of coconut can well and very slowly pour over warm cake allowing cream to soak in as you go.
Cool for 1/2 hour, then place in refrigerator to complete cooling.
Frost with the Cool Whip, adding 1/2 of the toasted almonds between the layers then topping cake with the remaining toasted almonds and 1/2 cup coconut that has been tinted with blue food coloring (ie...the Almond Joy bar has blue on the wrapper)
Slice with a sharp knife cutting with a sawing motion.
Enjoy!!!
