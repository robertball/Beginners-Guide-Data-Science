Description: 
Ceviche is a Peruvian dish that is usually made with rocoto peppers. Since rocoto peppers are difficult to obtain outside of Peru, jalapeno peppers are an adequate substitute. Excellent as dip for tortilla chips. Excellent served in any option with blackened fish (i.e. ahi tuna), blackened chicken, or char-grilled steak.
