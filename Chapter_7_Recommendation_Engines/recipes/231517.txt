Ingredients:
3/4 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirds
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) wedge Brie cheese, cut into small chunks
1/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orecchietta pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a casserole dish.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus in the melted butter until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Spread asparagus over pasta layer.
Pour cream over asparagus and pasta; season with salt and black pepper. Arrange Brie cheese chunks in the pasta mixture; sprinkle top with bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread crumbs are lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
