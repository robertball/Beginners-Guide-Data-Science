Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 acorn squash - halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 ounce crumbled blue cheese
2 green onions, thinly sliced
12 smoked almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Place acorn squash slices, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl and toss to cover all the slices evenly. Place slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with honey and cinnamon.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn each slice carefully. Continue baking until tender and well browned, about 10 minutes more. Move slices onto a serving plate and sprinkle with blue cheese, green onions, and almonds.
