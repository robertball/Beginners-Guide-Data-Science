1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
6 tablespoons water

Directions:
Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Beat egg, water, and melted butter in a small bowl. Stir flour mixture into the egg mixture until well blended.
Drop batter by spoonfuls onto simmering broth or gravy. Cover and simmer until fully cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is the only fool proof dumpling I have ever made. It is a keeper! It stirs together in no time and cooks up so light and fluffy every time. It has never failed me. It is perfect for chicken dumplings. Just spoon on top of your favorite recipe and enjoy. I usually double the recipe.
