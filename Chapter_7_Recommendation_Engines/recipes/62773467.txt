Ingredients:
1 package of Nufatel or cream cheese (softened)
6 slices salami, diced in to small shreds
4 scallions, minced (green and white parts)
3 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon prepared honey or dijon mustard
1 small chili, minced (or cayanne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to taste)
2/3 cup finely shredded cheddar (we prefer sharp)
Salt and Pepper to taste (if necessary)

Directions:
Combine ingredients.
Salt and pepper to taste if desired.
Place cling film on counter top and remove the cheese mixture to the middle of the cling film.
Wrap the cheese with the clingfilm in a mound and roll the ball around to get the desired "ball" form.
Allow to sit for twenty minutes before refrigerating.

Description: 
This appetizer tastes best when prepared the day before.  We add a small chili to spice it up but the chili can be substitued with cayanne pepper.  We wouldn't leave out a little heat.
