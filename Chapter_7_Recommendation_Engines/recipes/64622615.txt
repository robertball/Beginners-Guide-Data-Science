Description: 
I really, really like EASY!  If there's a short cut that works for my low carb lifestyle, I'm all for it.  This parfait is one you can literally put together in 3 minutes, and it's pretty enough to serve to company.   An easy way to add fats to an LCHF meal or snack.  SUITABLE FOR:  gluten free, Atkins, keto, lchf, low carb, diabetic, low glycemic, dairy free
