Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 yellow squash, cut into bite-size cubes
1 zucchini, cut into bite-size cubes
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into bite-size cubes
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until just fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add squash and zucchini, cook and stir until vegetables soften, about 7 minutes. Transfer squash mixture to a bowl.
Place skillet back over medium-high heat, place tofu pieces in the skillet, and top with brown sugar and soy sauce. Cook and stir until each side of tofu is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Return squash mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in Sriracha sauce and season with salt and black pepper.
