Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 teaspoons salt
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 cup water
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup low-fat cottage cheese
4 egg whites
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, salt and yeast. In a saucepan, heat water, honey and oil to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F; stir in cottage cheese. Add to flour mixture with egg whites; blend at low speed until moistened. Beat for 3 minutes on medium. Add whole wheat flour, wheat germ, oats and enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Shape into two loaves. Place in two 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans coated with non-stick cooking spray. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown; cover with foil during the last 15 minutes to prevent overbrowning. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks.
