Ingredients:
1 teaspoon corn oil, or to taste
1 teaspoon sesame oil, or to taste
2 carrots, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon sake (rice wine)
1 tablespoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon fish soup stock (such as HonDashiÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pound ground turkey
1 pound ground pork
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat corn oil and sesame oil in a large skillet. Add carrots, green bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, and fish soup stock. Mix in garlic and ginger. Let cool, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix turkey, pork, and eggs together in a large bowl until blended. Stir in cooled carrot mixture and bread crumbs until well combined. Press evenly into a loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 minutes more.
Let stand before serving, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I adapted this from a korokke recipe I frequently use. Korokke is a Japanese fried croquette made with seasoned ground meat and mashed potato. I combined the seasoning used there with a standard meatloaf recipe to create this fun hybrid. I serve it with mashed potatoes and a spicy barbeque sauce.
