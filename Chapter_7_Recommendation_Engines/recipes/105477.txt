Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 egg yolk
1 whole egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees  F. Lightly spray a cookie sheet with baking spray.
Make cookie dough.  Cream butter, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, vanilla and almond extract together until light and well mixed.  Add egg yolk.  Blend well.  Add whole egg.  Blend well.  Add flour and baking powder.  Mix well.
Press cookies.  Press out cookies using a cookie press.  Ready the press by inserting the desired plate and sliding it into place and locking it or by following cookie press manufacturers instructions.  If dough is too soft and not coming out of the cookie press cleanly add 1-2 tablespoon flour and mix well.  Deposit cookies on prepared cookie sheet approximately one inch apart.
Bake in preheated oven 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned on the bottom.
