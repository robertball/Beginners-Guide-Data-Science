Ingredients:
4 cups brown sugar
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 2/3 cups finely chopped pecans

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, cream and butter.  Stir until dissolved.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and stir vigorously until mixture loses its gloss, or process in a food processor 30 seconds.  Quickly stir in vanilla and nuts and spread into a 9x9 inch dish.  Chill before cutting into squares.
