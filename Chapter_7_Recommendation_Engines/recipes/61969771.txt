Ingredients:
1 lb. elbow macaroni
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. dry mustard
freshly ground black pepper
few shakes hot pepper sauce
5 cups milk
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Cook macaroni in boiling, salted water for 2 minutes less than label recommends; drain. Butter a 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in flour, salt, mustard, pepper, and hot sauce until smooth. Gradually stir in milk; cook until mixture boils, stirring constantly. Gradually stir in the cheese. Cook just until the cheese is melted, stirring constantly.
Pour into the prepared baking dish. Mix the bread crumbs with the melted butter; sprinkle evenly over top of the casserole.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until very hot and bread crumbs browned.
