Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/3 cup nonfat Greek yogurt
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup sucralose-sugar blend for baking (such as TruviaÂ® Baking Blend)
2 large egg whites
1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup pureed butternut squash
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/3 cups oat flour
1/4 cup miniature chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Blend applesauce, Greek yogurt, and coconut oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Mix in sucralose-sugar blend until combined. Add egg whites and almond milk; blend until fluffy. Mix in butternut squash and almond extract. Add cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; mix to combine. Add oat flour slowly, mixing batter until no dry spots remain. Fold in about chocolate chips by hand, reserving a few to sprinkle on top.
Pour batter into the prepared pan; sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool in pan for 1 hour.
