Ingredients:
4 cups sugar
2 cups white vinegar
4 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
15 whole cloves
4 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced

Directions:
Pour sugar and vinegar into a large saucepan, and stir to dissolve sugar. Add cinnamon sticks and cloves, and bring to a boil. Cover and boil for about 5 minutes. Strain out the cloves and cinnamon sticks, or you can leave them in for a stronger flavor.
Pack peaches into hot sterile 1 pint jars to within 1 inch of the rim. Fill each jar with syrup to within 1/2 inch from the top. Wipe rims with a clean dry cloth, and seal with new lids and screwbands. Process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.

Description: 
These peaches are very different and very yummy. We had a bumper crop of peaches one year and I remember my grandmother making these. We ate them for months and I still love them.
