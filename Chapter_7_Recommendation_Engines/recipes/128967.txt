Ingredients:
2 delicata squash, halved and seeded
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon lime zest (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the squash cut side down into a baking dish. Pour water into the dish to about 1/4 inch deep.
Bake in preheated oven until the squash pierces easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, blend the butter with the lime juice and chili powder in a small bowl. Mix in the lime zest, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the butter mixture into the cooked squash, and serve immediately.

Description: 
My new favorite squash is Delicata, an heirloom squash happily being rediscovered. Look for them in the winter squash section of your grocery store. They're cream to pale yellow with green stripes, and their flesh is orange, slightly sweet and smooth but not stringy. My sister suggested the lime butter topping (my personal favorite), but a blend of maple syrup and butter is good, too. The squash usually aren't very big, so plan half a squash per person.
