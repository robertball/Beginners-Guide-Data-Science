Ingredients:
12 ounces asparagus spears, trimmed
2 tablespoons flour
1/2 teaspoon OLD BAY速 Seasoning
1/2 teaspoon McCormick速 Paprika
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 pound sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry on paper towels
1/2 cup dry white wine
3/4 teaspoon McCormick速 Dill Weed
1 medium lemon, cut in quarters (optional)

Directions:
Cook asparagus in boiling water in a large skillet 3 minutes or until just crisp tender.  Drain on paper towels and set aside on a serving platter.  Cover to keep warm.
Combine flour, Old Bay, and paprika in a shallow pan.  Stir to blend thoroughly.  Add scallops and coat evenly with flour mixture.
Dry skillet with a paper towel, if necessary, and place over medium-high heat until hot.  Add 2 tablespoons of butter.  When butter is melted, add scallops and cook 4 minutes, turn and cook 4 minutes longer or until opaque in center.  Top asparagus with scallops and cover to keep warm.
Add wine and dill weed to pan residue.  Bring to a boil and cook 1-2 minutes or until liquid measures about 1/3 cup.  Remove from heat; stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter and stir until completely melted.  Pour sauce evenly over scallops.  Garnish with lemon wedges, if desired.

Description: 
It's extremely important in any recipe using scallops to dry them well with paper towels before cooking them in a skillet or broiling. They retain water and pressing down lightly removes some of the water, allowing them to brown instead of stew.
