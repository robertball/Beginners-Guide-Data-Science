Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil
2 cups packed fresh baby spinach, chopped
1 6oz can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
2 tbsp Italian seasoning
4 tbsp cream cheese, softened
2 tbsp mayonnaise
3 tbsp Parmesan cheese, shredded
1/2 tbsp habanero or jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced (or to taste)
1/4 tsp sea salt
24 baby portabella mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Clean the mushrooms.  Gently remove the stems and gills with a spoon.  Set the caps aside; mince the stems.
In a small skillet, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the spinach, peppers, Italian seasoning, and minced mushroom stems.  Saute until the spinach is wilted.  Add the artichoke hearts and toss to coat with oil and herbs.  Remove from heat.
Whip together the cream cheese, mayo, cheese, and salt.  Add the mushroom-spinach mixture and stir to combine.
Arrange the mushrooms on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  Spoon the cream cheese mixture into each cap.
Bake, uncovered, until the mushrooms are tender, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Mushrooms, artichokes, and a touch of heat combine to make these irresistible.  Try substituting plain Greek yogurt for mayonnaise for a different taste.
