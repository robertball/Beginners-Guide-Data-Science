Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup warm milk
1 egg
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (2 1/4 Teaspoons Yeast)
1/4 cup butter, melted for spreading on top of cooked rolls

Directions:
Mix water, milk and sugar, stir well and microwave until 110 degrees.  Beat egg with fork and add to milk, water and sugar and microwave again to get temperature back to 108-110.   Add yeast and mix yeast in well, let stand for a total of 13 minutes then add salt.  Melt the 1/3 cup butter and add it to the milk and sugar and egg.  Beat together and then slowly add the flour until proper consistency using dough beaters.  Knead by hand over the sink for two minutes to get the dough consistent.  Warm the oven to 350 and place bowl on top of the stove, then turn the oven off, so it just is warm.
Let dough rise till doubled in size around 90- 120 minutes.  Form dough into balls.  The rolls should be weighed and be 3 ounces.  Place on cookie sheet to rise for another 90 - 120 minutes.
Bake at 400 for 8.5 - 9.5 minutes until golden brown on top.  Being lightly brown on top is when they are done and should be removed from the oven.
Recipe makes 11 rolls at 3 ounces.
Enjoy!
