Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket
1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®), or as desired
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, sliced
6 cloves garlic, sliced
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef.
Rinse and pat dry the corned beef brisket before brushing it with browning sauce on both sides.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, about 5 minutes per side.
Lay a sheet of heavy duty foil out flat and then place another sheet crosswise.
Lay the browned brisket on top and add the onion, garlic, and water on the fat side.  Make sure the fat side is facing upwards.
Close the foil tightly and place another piece of foil over the top of the brisket.
Place on a rack set in a roasting pan.
Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours.
Turn off the oven and allow the corned beef brisket to sit for about 30 minutes (in the oven.)
