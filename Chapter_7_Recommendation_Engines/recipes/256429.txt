Ingredients:
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1/3 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut, plus
1 tablespoon finely shredded unsweetened coconut
1 cup Sunsweet® Amaz!n™ Diced Prunes
3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks
3 ounces butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Oil an 8x8 inch baking pan and line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.
Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and bake until lightly toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool. On the same baking sheet, spread out the coconut and bake until lightly golden brown, about 4 minutes.
Place the Amazin Diced Prunes in a bowl and pour enough lukewarm water to cover and let them soak for 5 minutes. Drain well. In a bowl, mix together the flour, oats, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir in the almonds and coconut. Stir in the butter until a batter forms, then stir in the Amazin Diced Prunes and chocolate chips until evenly incorporated.
Press the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 25 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Unmold and cool completely. Once cool, cut into 16 (2x2 inch) bars.
