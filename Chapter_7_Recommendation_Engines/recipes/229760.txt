Description: 
The spicy green aji sauce from Inka Mama's. This sauce is commonly served with bread as an appetizer, and goes well with almost any Peruvian dish. It is fantastic over rice. Add or remove peppers as needed for your taste. Before removing peppers, remove the seeds and ribs from existing peppers. When adding more olive oil, add no more than 1 teaspoon at a time and wait 30 to 45 seconds between adding more.
