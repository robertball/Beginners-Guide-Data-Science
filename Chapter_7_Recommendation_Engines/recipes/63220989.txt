Ingredients:
12 6" white corn tortillas
Toothpicks
1 1/2 c shredded or pulled Queso Oaxaca
1 green jalapeno
1 red pepper
2 plum/roma tomatoes
14 oz black beans
10 oz frozen corn
canola oil
To taste:
chili powder
basil
cilantro
salt
red wine vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Slit the radius (3") of each tortilla.
Take a tortilla and overlap 1/4 to 1/3 of it where it is slit to form a conical shape.  Towards the rim, insert a toothpick to keep it put.  Repeat for all of the tortillas.
Place the cone-shaped tortillas in muffin tins.  Place them in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until no part of the tortillas is soft anymore.
Remove from the muffin tins and let cool.
When cool enough, remove the toothpicks.
Cut the red pepper into 1/4 to 1/2 inch squares.  Chop the jalapeno finely.  Chop the tomatoes.  Defrost the corn.  Drain the liquid from the beans.
Place the red pepper, jalapeno, and tomato in a frying pan with enough canola oil to coat them and the bottom on the pan but leave little excess.
Cook on high heat.  Season to taste.
When the tomatoes have mostly broken down, add the corn and beans.  Season again, to taste.  It is done cooking when it is hot.
Serve this bean mixture in the tortilla cups, and top with the cheese.
