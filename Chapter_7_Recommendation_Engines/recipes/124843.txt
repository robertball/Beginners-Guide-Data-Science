Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 cups chopped, peeled apples
1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
TOPPING:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup milk
1 cup packed brown sugar
Pinch salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat eggs until foamy; gradually add sugar. Blend in oil and vanilla. Combine flour, salt and baking soda; add to egg mixture. Stir in apples and pecans. Pour into a greased 10-in. tube pan; bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake tests done. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cake to a serving platter.
For topping, combine all ingredients in a saucepan; boil 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly pour over warm cake (some topping will run down onto the serving plate.)

When you visit friends or relatives in my area of the country, you can be sure the coffee will be brewing soon and their favorite dessert will be served. This is my favorite - maybe that's why I get a lot of visitors!
