1 cup evaporated milk
3 eggs, separated
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Butter a 1 quart baking dish or pudding basin.
Melt chocolate over low heat in small saucepan.  Stir in milk and heat through.  Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
