Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
3 cups quick-cooking oats
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa. Bring to a boil, and cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in peanut butter, oats, and vanilla.
Pour the chocolate mixture into a parchment lined 9x13 pan. Let cool until set and use the paper to remove the set mixture from the pan before slicing.  This can also be poured directly onto parchment on a flat surface and allowed to cool and set.

Description: 
My kids laugh at my desire to make everything faster but they don't complain that we almost always have a homemade treat in the cookie jar.  I like these in drop cookie form but in a pinch, I can speed these up and my kids never complain about the bar version.  Start timing when mixture reaches a full rolling boil; this is the trick to successful no-bakes. If you boil too long the cookies will be dry and crumbly. If you don't boil long enough, the cookies won't form properly.Modified from: No Bake Cookies I
