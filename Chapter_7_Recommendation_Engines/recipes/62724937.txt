Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup cream or top milk (or milk)
1 cup cooked chicken; chopped
2 tablespoons sherry flavoring (optional)
1 cup mushroom; sliced and sauteed
1/2 cup green pepper; slivered
1/4 cup slivered pimentos

Directions:
Melt butter.
Blend in flour, salt and pepper and cook over low heat until bubbling.
Remove from heat and stir in chicken broth and milk.  Bring to a boil and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Gently stir in chicken, mushrooms, green pepper and pimentos.   Just before serving, add sherry if desired.
Serve hot over toast. (also recommended in the cookbook were noodles, rice, in biscuit rings, patty shells, etc)
Note: although original recipe calls for cream or top milk, any milk, including skim milk, works well.
Note:  for "Creamed Chicken", double the chicken and omit the mushrooms, peppers and pimentos.
