Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese(about 8 ounces)
1 cup chopped pepperoni
1 package (17.3 ounces) Pizza Dough, thawed according to package directions

Directions:
1. Heat the oven to 400Â°F. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork or whisk.
2. Stir the tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni in a medium bowl.
3. Prepare the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Place about 1/2 cup pepperoni mixture in the center of each square. Brush the edges of the squares with the egg mixture. Fold the squares in half over the filling to form triangles. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Place on 2 baking sheets. Brush the pizza dough with the egg mixture.
4. Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown.

Description: 
Instead of a heavier dough, these pizza turnovers have a light and flaky puff pastry crust.  Filled with pepperoni, mozzarella and Italian sauce, these turnovers really satisfy!
