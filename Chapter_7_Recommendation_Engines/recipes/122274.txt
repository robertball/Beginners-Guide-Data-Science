Description: 
I ACTUALLY created this recipe when I was a girl. Since then, I've found it's a good way to use up the second pastry when I make a one-crust pie.    When I tell my husband, 'It's chicken potpie tonight,' he lights up and thinks I've slaved in the kitchen all day! -Marva Vandivier, Battle Ground, Washington
