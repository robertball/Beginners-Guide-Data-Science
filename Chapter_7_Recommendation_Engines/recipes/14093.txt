Ingredients:
24 cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Cut each tomato  in half through the middle, not the ends. Put the tomato halves in a food dehydrator, cut side up. Dry for at least 12 hours.  When the tomatoes are totally dry and firm, put them in a plastic bag, and store in the freezer.

Description: 
Cherry tomatoes are easily dried in a food dehydrator. When I make soup or stew I throw in a handful, and they taste like they were just picked. You could also rehydrate them in warm water for some other use.
