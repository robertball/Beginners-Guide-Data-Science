Ingredients:
I cup oat flour
I cup raw whole unsalted almonds
1/2 cup real maple syrup
1 tsp. real almond extract (not imitation)

Directions:
roast almonds, cool, grind
mix everything together
roll into 6 balls
on a well oiled or sprayed prepared cookie sheet flatten thin with hand approx. 1/4 in. just enough to hold together nicely.
place in preheated oven at 350 degrees
12-15 minutes or till crispy brown around the edges. I like them crispy so you need to watch carefully cause they will brown fast toward the end.
Remove carefully with sharp edged metal spatula. Let cool a bit to crisp up.
