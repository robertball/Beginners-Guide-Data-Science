Ingredients:
Equipment:
4 half-gallon milk cartons, empty, rinsed, and dried
Heavy duty foil wrap
Lighter
Safe location for open flame (fire pit, etc.)
Ingredients:
4 flour or corn soft tortillas
4 cups shredded cheese  mozzarella, cheddar, jack
Ground beef, canned beans, other proteins as desired
Salsa and sour cream to garnish

Directions:
Preparation:
1.	Cut several 1” diamond-shaped vents into two corners of the milk carton, near the bottom.
2.	Place tortilla flat on a piece of foil wrap cut to at least 3” larger on all sides.
3.	Assemble desired ingredients in a line down the center of tortilla.
4.	Roll tortilla, and wrap tightly in foil, sealing the ends.
5.	Stand tortilla up vertically inside empty milk carton.
6.	Set milk carton in a fire-safe area and light on fire at one of the vents.
