Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
1 pound fingerling potatoes
2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®), or to taste
1/4 cup butter, at room temperature
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced, or to taste
1 package microgreens

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, use "Auto-Cook" option 2. Choose setting and enter fish weight.)
Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil over fingerling potatoes in the bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to combine.
Rub 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over each salmon fillet. Season each with 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning. Arrange salmon, skin-side up, in center of a cast iron skillet or baking dish. (Place salmon on the grill pan if using countertop induction oven.)
Bake in the preheated oven until bottom of salmon is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip salmon and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. (For countertop induction oven, cook on medium-high grill setting for 1 1/2 minutes with skin side up. Flip and grill salmon until fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes more.)
Heat cast iron skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir potatoes until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
Combine remaining 1 teaspoon garlic powder, butter, thyme, and sage in a small microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until butter is melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Mix well. Pour over cooked potatoes.
Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil and lemon juice together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed. Toss microgreens and dressing together in a bowl.
Place salmon on serving plates; garnish with micro greens. Serve potatoes alongside.
