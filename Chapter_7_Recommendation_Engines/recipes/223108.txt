Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package whole wheat rotini pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 green onions, slivered
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) jar quartered marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added whole tomatoes, undrained and chopped
2 tablespoons capers
1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/3 pound crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic until onions are tender, about 4 minutes. Add artichokes, tomatoes, capers, and chipotle chile powder; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer. Place shrimp into sauce; cook and stir until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
Divide pasta evenly into 4 bowls and top with shrimp and tomato sauce. Scatter goat cheese over sauce.

Description: 
This dish is one of my favorites. If you like goat cheese it will become one of yours as well. I was inspired to make this dish after trying a similar one made with chicken at a local restaurant. Serve with a nice crusty loaf of french bread, a garden salad, and a glass of your favorite red wine!
