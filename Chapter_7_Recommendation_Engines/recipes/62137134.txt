Ingredients:
1 to 1 1/2 cup white/light Miso paste
3/4 cup Water
1/4 cup Mirin
1 cup Vegetable Oil
1 tsp Sesame Oil
1 cup Soft Tofu
1/2 cup chopped Sweet Onion
3 tablespoon Honey
2 tablespoons white Rice Vinegar
1 clove Garlic roughly chopped

Directions:
Place everything, except the green onions, in a blender and blend until smooth.
Add the green onions to the dressing. Pulse lightly, ensuring that they retain their texture and are only blended (not pureed) into the dressing.
Transfer dressing to air-tight container and refrigerate.
Serve chilled over salads, vegetables or whatever you like.
The green onions can be omitted if you desire. It's not a necessity, but it does add a nice texture to the dressing. Just don't over puree them.
The miso paste should be adjusted to preference. Some miso pastes are much saltier than other. Start with 1 cup and add more if necessary.
More tofu can be added if a creamier, thicker consistency is desired.

Description: 
A creamy, multi-purpose miso dressing. Great on salads, vegetables or whatever else your heart desires.

The recipe is a variations of the Miso Salad Dressing recipe. The ingredients are more true to the Japanese style. Mirin gives the dressing a slightly sweeter, more complex taste; tofu gives the dressing a creamy texture and the sesame oil adds a distinct Japanese flavor to the finish.
