Ingredients:
2	racks	ribs (approx 3lbs)
~~~~~~~~~
Dry Rub
1/2	cup	Brown sugar
1	Tablespoon	Garlic powder
1	Tablespoon	onion powder
1	Tablespoon	Chili power
1 	teaspoon	salt
~~~~~~~~~~
BBQ Sauce
1	bottle 	Favorite store bbq sauce (aprox 18 oz)
1	12 oz can	cola (not diet)
1	small	onion finely chopped

Directions:
Picked up a rack of ribs ~ we used pork baby back ribs
Trimmed off the brisket bones and most of the fat and silver skin ~the shiny skin on the back of the bones (I didn't need to do this with the ones I bought)
Cut into 4-5 rib pieces,
Mix together dry rub ingredients
Add rub to each slab ~ I let sit in refridge for 1/2 hour to an hour
Sear on the grill on high heat about 10 mins each side.   (Our grill runs really hot.  On high it was a 6-7 min on each side)
Remove ribs, wrap tightly in foil you have to options on the next step
_______  Opt 1
Lower your heat on grill to 250 degrees(turn off all but one burner and turn that one to low) place the packages of ribs over your unlit burners and close the lid for 2 1/2-3 hours.
or
_______  Opt 2 (turned out more tender)
place seared ribs on top rack  in oven at 250 degrees for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
I highly suggest wrapping a lipped cookie sheet with foil and place on rack under the ribs to collect the drippings.
Go in the house, have a beer etc for about an hour to an hour and a half.
In a pot mix together bbq ingredients ~ Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer (covering it is also good) for about 1 hour.
Have another beer and read the daily paper
When the ribs are just about done, unwrap them, (this was a bit tricky when I made them the option 2 way as they were falling apart)
turn up the heat on all burners,
slather the ribs w/sauce on one side cook for 10 mins, flip-slather, cook for 10 more mins.
Enjoy!
