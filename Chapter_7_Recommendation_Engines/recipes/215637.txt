Description: 
I had an ice pop with this combination at the Pecan Street Festival in Austin, Texas, and thought it was the most amazing flavor! I recreated the recipe at home--who knew basil paired so well with pineapple?! An alternative is after blending everything, pour into ice pop molds and enjoy!
