Ingredients:
1 pound fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup margarine
4 green onions, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups vegetable broth
1 cup light cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 sprig fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Thinly slice the mushroom caps, discarding the stalks.
Melt the butter in a heavy-based pan and cook the spring onion, garlic and lemon thyme, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the  garlic is golden. Add the mushroom and salt and white pepper. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mushroom just softens. Add flour and cook, stirring for 1 minute.
Remove from the heat and add the stock, stirring continuously. Return to the heat and bring to the boil, stirring. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Whisk the cream into the soup, then reheat gently, stirring. Do not allow the soup to boil. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and garnish with the chopped chives and thyme.
