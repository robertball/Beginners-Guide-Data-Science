Ingredients:
4 globe squash, about the size of baseballs
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp ground black pepper

Directions:
Slice squash into 1/2 inch thick slices
Mix the rest of the ingredients in a bowl large enough to hold all the squash slices.
Add the squash slices to the bowl and mix all around. Allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes.
Get a grill to high heat.
Lay the squash slices across the grill with tongs. Cook for three minutes. Flip and cook for another three minutes, until the slices are slightly floppy when you pick them up. Remove from grill with tongs and server.

Description: 
Saw local globe squash at Whole Foods and wanted to try it. Turns out it's perfect for the grill since it's so thick and easy to pick up.
