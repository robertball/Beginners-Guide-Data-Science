Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 serrano chile peppers, halved (optional)
2 cloves garlic, sliced
1 teaspoon chopped ginger
1 cup coarsely chopped onion
1 cup chopped potatoes
2 cups coarsely chopped cabbage
5 cups chicken stock
1 teaspoon garam masala, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir serrano peppers, garlic, and ginger in the hot oil until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and transparent, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix potatoes into onion mixture and cook for 2 minutes. Add cabbage and cook for 2 minutes more. Pour chicken stock over cabbage mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season soup with garam masala and salt.
Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return soup to saucepan and cook until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted to make cabbage soup, but my Indian palette loves spices, so decided to Indianize cabbage soup. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
