Ingredients:
3 fresh Tuna steaks, cut into rectangles
1 egg beaten
1/2 cm (1”) fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1/2 ““ 1 small chilli, finely chopped
few leaves coriander, finely chopped
1 pack (125 g) Rosenborg® Extra Creamy Blue Cheese, crumbled
5 tbsp. (75 g) sesame seeds
oil for sautÉing
1 mango (for garnish if desired)

Directions:
Combine the ginger, chilli, chopped coriander and Blue Cheese. Press the Blue Cheese mixture in an even layer on the tops of the Tuna pieces. Dip the Tuna in the beaten
egg to give a very light coating then toss in the sesame seeds to give as even a
coating as possible. Heat a little oil in a shallow pan and cook the Tuna pieces for
approximately 6 minutes, turning once half way through. Serve hot with diced mango and cucumber relish or other accompaniments of your choice. Serves 4
