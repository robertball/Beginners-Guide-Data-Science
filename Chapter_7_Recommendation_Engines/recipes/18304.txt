Ingredients:
4 large cucumbers, sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt (optional)

Directions:
In a large serving bowl, combine cucumbers, onions and dill. In a medium size bowl combine sugar, vinegar, water and salt; stir until the sugar dissolves. Pour the liquid mixture over the cucumber mixture. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving (the longer this dish marinates the tastier it is!).
