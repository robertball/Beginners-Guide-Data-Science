Ingredients:
8 ounces braunschweiger liver sausage
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon minced onion
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons cognac or brandy

Directions:
In a food processor mix braunschweiger liver sausage, cream cheese, onion, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and spirits.
Pulse the food processor until mixed and smooth.  Do not over process as this will mix in an excessive amount of air resulting in a thin, mousse-like consistency.
Move the mixture to an appropriate container then chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
