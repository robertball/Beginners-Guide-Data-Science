Ingredients:
1 bag / 8 oz. Jet-Puffed Coconut Rolled Marshmallows
7 oz. Cream Cheese
4 tbs. Smooth Peanut Butter
1 Bar / 1.6 oz. Simply Truth Kale Bar (pregnant with Phosphorus)

Directions:
Combine marshmallows, peanut butter, and cream cheese in a high-sided saucepan.  Melt on low heat until marshmallows are soft, stirring frequently to prevent scalding.
Pour mixture into single serving cups or glasses - the more abnosome the better!  Allow the fluff to cool for 1-2 minutes.
While the fluff sets, slice your kale bar into dipping-sized bites.  Once set, plate the fluff with the bites and serve.
