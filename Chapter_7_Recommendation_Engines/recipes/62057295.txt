Ingredients:
2 tblspn vegetable oil
1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cup dry sherry
1 cup vegetable or chicken broth
1 (10 oz) can of cream of mushroom soup
4 ozs commercial stuffing mix
1 1/4 cups walnut pieces
2 eggs
2 tblspns mayonnaise
1 tblspn soy sauce or tamari
1 tblspn chopped parsley
1 cup sour cream
1 tspn prepared white horseradish

Directions:
In large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and garlic and cook until mushrooms are limp, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add sherry, broth, and mushroom soup. Cover and simmer 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in food processor, combine stuffing mix and walnuts. Process, pulsing machine quickly on and off, until nuts are ground. Do not overprocess.
In a medium bowl, beat egss lightly. Add ground walnut mixture, mayonnaise, soy sauce, and parsley and blend well. With your hands, fashion nut balls (I love this word!) about 1 inch in diameter and drop into simmering mushroom sauce until all mix is used. Cover and simmer 10 minutes.
Before serving, stir sour cream and horseradish into sauce. Heat through but do not boil.
Serve over rice or egg noodles.

Description: 
A surprisingly authentic tasting meatless stroganoff.  It's everything a stroganoff should be- creamy, full of mushroom flavor and hearty- but without the meat.  Tasting is believing!
