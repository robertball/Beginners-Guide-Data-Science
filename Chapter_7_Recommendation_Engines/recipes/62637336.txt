Ingredients:
DRESSING:
1/2 cup low fat raspberry yogurt (or strawberry)
1 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar
SALAD:
1 medium apple, cored and sliced
1/2 tsp Lemon Juice
dash nutmeg
1/8 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup low fat feta cheese
4 cups torn iceberg lettuce

Directions:
Mix the yogurt and balsamic vinegar together for the dressing.
Premix the cinnamon and nutmeg with the lemon juice and immediately add to the apples just after slicing them. The lemon juice will help prevent the apples from turning brown. Add to a salad bowl with lettuce, almonds and feta cheese. Add the dressing just before serving.
