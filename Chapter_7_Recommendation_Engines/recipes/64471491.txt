Ingredients:
olive oil
1 bunch of kale
1 green onion, white part only, chopped
1/4 tsp minced garlic
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup real bacon bits (store-bought or you can make your own)
3 tbsp chopped toasted almonds
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
While oven is heating, warm olive oil in a large frying pan on medium heat. Add onion. Cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic. Cook an additional 3 minutes, stirring constantly.
Reduce hear and add kale to pan and cover. Cook until wilted, stirring occasionally, about 5-8 minutes.
Remove from heat. Add feta, cranberries, almonds and bacon. Season with salt and pepper, if you wish.
Unroll puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Using a pizza cutter, cut into 9 squares. Fold up edges to create a flat, round 'pillow' (it will puff up into more of a pillow as it cooks) with a rimmed edge.
Place pastry pillows onto parchment-lined baking sheet. Fill pillows with kale mixture. Drizzle with olive oil, if desired.
Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes (cook times vary depending on your oven)
Serve warm.
