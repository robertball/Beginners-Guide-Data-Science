Ingredients:
2 29oz cans of Tomato Sauce
2 29oz cans of Fire Roasted Diced tomatos
3 15oz cans dark red kidney beans, drained
1 lb 96% lean ground beef
1 lb spicy italian sausage
1/2 lb applewood smoked bacon, chopped
1/4 onion
2 whole habenero peppers
1 clove fresh garlic
1/2 cup chipotle Chili powder (may be increased or decreased for desired spicyness)
1 Tablespoon Tabasco chipotle hot sauce
1 oz Hershey's chocolate, chopped
1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large pot over low heat, combine the tomato sauce, chopped tomatos and the kidney beans. Let simmer.
In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the bacon and leave the grease. Add the bacon to the pot.
Using a food processor, chop the whole habenero peppers (minus the stems), onion and garlic with the tabasco sauce for moisture. Cook this mixture in the bacon grease until the onions begin to carmelize. Add the ground beef and sausage to the skillet, and brown the meat, but not the point of drying out.
Add the meat/vegetable mixture to the pot
Add the chocolate, chili powder and cinnamon to the pot
Simmer on low heat for 3 hours, stirring every 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is my personal Chili recipe. It has won me numerous compliments and is great for cold winter nights with cornbread muffins. It requires a fair amount of skillet time as opposed to a traditional slow-cooker recipe. The best thing about chili is, however, that you can vary the ingredients all you want and still come out with a great product.
