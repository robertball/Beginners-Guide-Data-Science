Ingredients:
For the Peanut butter ball:
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup + 3 tbs peanut butter
3 tbs spoons softened butter
For the Chocolate Coconut shell:
6 tbs chocolate chips
3 tbs coconut oil

Directions:
Stir together the butter, peanut butter, and powdered sugar until it is well mixed.  I find that using cleaned hands or a kitchen aid, works best for this.
Shape the peanut butter mixture into balls about 1 inch in diameter and length, and place on a baking sheet lined with wax paper, and slide into the freezer while you make the chocolate shell.
Using a double boiler set on medium heat, melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil together, until the mixture is creamy and smooth.
Remove the chocolate mixture from heat and leave the peanut butter balls in the freezer for about 5 more minutes
Remove the peanut butter balls from the freezer and dip them one at a time in the chocolate mixture, making sure to coat them thoroughly.  Place them back in their places on the baking sheet.
If the chocolate mixture does not harden on the peanut butter balls, put the coated balls in the freezer for about 10 more minutes, or until the shell has hardened.
Keep refrigerated.
