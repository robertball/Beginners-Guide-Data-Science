Ingredients:
1 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
salt to taste
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 cup finely chopped celery
1 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped
12 green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons drained capers
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon minced oregano
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Toss eggplant with salt and place in a colander set over a bowl. Let sit, about 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add celery; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft and lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add eggplant and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in celery mixture, tomatoes, olives, capers, tomato paste, and oregano. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until caponata is thickened, about 15 minutes.
Season caponata with vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with parsley.
