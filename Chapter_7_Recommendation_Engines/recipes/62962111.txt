Ingredients:
1 pound butternut squash, roasted (start with a 1.5 lb squash)
1 small onion
2 small apples
1 pint chicken stock, low sodium, fat free
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
For Caramelized Onion Crème Fraîche:
1 Tablespoon light sour cream
1 Tablespoon plain yogurt, nonfat
2 Tablespoons caramelized onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F.  To prepare the soup:
Roast the butternut squash: split in half and lay face down on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.
Cut onion and apples into large chunks and place on the baking sheet with squash.
Roast at 375F until soft (about 45 minutes).
Let everything cool, peel the squash and puree everything with 1 cup of chicken stock (use an immersion blender or regular blender).
Transfer to a pot and simmer for 15 minutes.
Add the rest of the stock, or enough to reach desired consistency.
To make the crème fraîche: Cook onions in a lightly oiled pan until golden brown.
Place onion and remaining ingredients in a food processor or blender and blend until smooth.
Run through a strainer to remove any large pieces of onion.
Place in a squirt bottle or small plastic bag (you can cut the tip off of one of the corners).
Use crème to decorate the top of the soup.
