Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 pound margarine
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
3 eggs
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon together until evenly blended; set aside. Beat the margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the margarine mixture before adding the next. Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the chopped nuts; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
Scrape the dough onto a sheet of waxed paper, and form into a log. Roll tightly in the waxed paper, and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray baking sheets with cooking spray.
Unwrap the dough, and cut into 1/4-inch slices. Place the cookies onto baking sheets, spaced 1-inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
