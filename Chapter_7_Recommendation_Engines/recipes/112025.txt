Ingredients:
2 cups distilled white vinegar
2 cups water
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 onion, quartered
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 canned chipotle chilies
1 tablespoon adobo sauce from canned chipotle peppers
12 hard-cooked eggs, peeled

Directions:
In a large pot, combine the vinegar, water, garlic, onion, salt, sugar, chipotle chiles and adobo sauce. Bring to a boil, and cook until the onion is translucent, about 15 minutes.
Place the hard-cooked eggs into clean jars. Strain the boiling brine into the jars to cover the eggs. Cover with lids and refrigerate for at least 3 days before serving. Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 weeks.
