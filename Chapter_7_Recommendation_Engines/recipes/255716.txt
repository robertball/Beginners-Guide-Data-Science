Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
4 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground allspice
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups canned pumpkin puree
2 large apples - peeled, cored, and grated
2 tablespoons dry vegan egg replacer
1 1/4 cups applesauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 2 muffin tins with cooking spray.
Combine all-purpose flour, brown sugar, white sugar, whole wheat flour, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix in pumpkin puree and apples.
Pour egg replacer into a bowl. Stir in applesauce gradually to avoid lumps. Whisk in oil. Add to the flour mixture; mix well until batter is smooth.
Spoon batter into the greased muffin cups, filling each one almost to the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
