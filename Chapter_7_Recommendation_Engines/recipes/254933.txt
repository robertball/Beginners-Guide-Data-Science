Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups diced yams
3 cups water
2 cups quinoa, soaked and rinsed
4 Persian cucumbers - peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 cup chopped Italian parsley
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup 1/4-inch cubed onion
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 endive spears to garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; add yams.
Bake in the preheated oven until yams are tender and wrinkled at the edges, about 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add quinoa, stirring once; return to boil. Cook uncovered until water is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Strain, shaking the sieve well to remove all moisture. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
Stir cucumbers, yams, parsley, olive oil, onion, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper into the quinoa. Garnish with endive spears.
