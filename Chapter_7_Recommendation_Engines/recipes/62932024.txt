Ingredients:
8 oz of beef, sliced, and pounded
2 tablespoons of cooking oil
2 large green bell peppers, cut 1 to 2 inch square
2 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon of ginger, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, diced (optional, for spicy)
Finishing sauce
1 tablespoon of soy sauce
1 tablespoon of oyster sauce
1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon of sugar
1/4 cup of beef stock
1 tablespoon of dry sherry (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons of corn starch
1 tablespoon of sesame seed oil

Directions:
Take meat and cut thin, I use steak, and fa-lay it thin, then I use a meat pounder, and pound the meat inside a one gallon freezer bag. this will tenderize the meat so you don't have to tare into it like a rabid dog.
put oil in the frying pan on high
fry ginger, and garlic (about 30 seconds)
add meat, and cook thru (3 to 4 mins)
set the meat aside
put some oil in the fry pan, over high
add green peppers, and onions, fry until they start to slightly brown
Add meat back in to warm back up
add finishing sauce, the sauce should thicken up in about 30 seconds
Serve with sticky rice or fried rice.

Description: 
I just love stir fry I used to order take-A-way but I figured it was just as easy to make it my self instead of driving for 30 mins to the restaurant, waiting in line, and then driving back home with cold take-A-way. This is my version of pepper steak one of my favorite chinese dishes.
