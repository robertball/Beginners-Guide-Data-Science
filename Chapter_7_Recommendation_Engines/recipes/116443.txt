Ingredients:
3 (2.1 ounce) packages frozen miniature phyllo tart shells
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
2 eggs

1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1 green onion, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 (6 ounce) can crabmeat - drained, flaked and cartilage removed

Directions:
Place tart shells on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle Swiss cheese into each shell. In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. Spoon a teaspoonful of crab mixture into each tart shell. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until pastry is browned. Serve warm.

Every time I serve these tiny tasty tarts, I'm asked for the recipe. Holiday guests of all ages gobble them up! I've found that finely chopped leftover ham makes a handy substitute for the crab.
