Ingredients:
3 ripe avocados, halved
2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt
1 ½ cups Mexican cheese blend
freshly ground black pepper
3 Poblano peppers
3 10” flour tortillas
3 tablespoons unsalted butter (more as needed)
6 tablespoons salsa (more as needed)

Directions:
Roast the Poblano peppers by placing in a grill, by holding them over the open flame of a gas stove burner, or roast in an oven at 425 degrees F. Keep turning until the skin is blistered on all sides. Immediately place in a plastic zip seal bag, and allow to steam until cool enough to handle. Peel off the outer skin and cut into thin slices.
Cut each avocado half into 3 or 4 slices about 3/8 inch thick. Mix juice and oil. Brush both sides of each slice with mixture. Lightly sprinkle with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Grill or pan fry over medium-high heat, turning once, until lightly browned.
Lay three tortillas out on counter or table. On one half of each tortilla, spread 1/4 cup cheese. On top of the cheese evenly distribute about 7 poblano strips. Top with 5 or 6 avocado slices, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons of salsa. Top with another 1/4 cup of cheese. Fold over the other half of each tortilla.
Melt butter in a non-stick pan. Brown quesadillas on medium heat on both sides.
Cut each quesadilla into 4 pieces, and server with salsa on the side.
