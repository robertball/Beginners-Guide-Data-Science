Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup shortening
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
Â½ teaspoon salt
2 cups quick cooking oats
2 cups orange-flavored fruit slice jelly candies

Directions:
In large mixing bowl, cream together sugars and shortening till fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla; beat well.  Stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Stir into creamed mixture.
Stir in the oats, and the orange candy.  NOTE: Dip a pair of kitchen shears into a glass of hot water or spray with a non-stick spray to make snipping the orange slices easier.   Using about one tablespoon of mixture for each cookie, roll into one inch balls.  Place on greased cookie sheets.
Bake in a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove and cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe is my own adaptation of a recipe that came from my husband's grandmother.  I made a few changes to suit my own family's tastes.  These cookies are a big hit with kids as well as adults.
