Ingredients:
One refrigerated Pillsbury Pie Crust, defrosted
3 cups of Creamy Peanut Butter
1 cup of Powdered Sugar
1 bag of Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels
A pinch of Salt..very important!
1 8-1/2? Pie pan
Electric hand mixer
~~~To Blind Bake the Crust~~~
Parchment paper cut to fit the crust
2-3 cups of dry beans

Directions:
First place the crust into the pie pan.  I used a disposable tin pie pan, so it mimics the candy bar feel of the Reese’s, but use whatever pan you have (8? in size).
Gently press the edges of the crust into the grooves of the pan, so it mimics the candy.  I used a small glass to get in the grooves.
Trim the edges of the crust with a knife so once again, it mimics the candy.
Cut a circle of parchment paper, fit to line the crust and pour some dry beans down in there.
Bake it at 350 for approx. 10 – 12 minutes, or just until the crust is golden and firm.  Remove the beans and the paper and LET IT COOL!!!
While the crust is baking/cooling, mix together the peanut butter, powdered sugar and pinch of salt on medium speed, until it’s light in color, super whipped and fluffy.
When the crust is completely cooled, fill it with the Peanut Butter mixture.  Spread it nice and evenly on the top.
In a microwave-safe bowl or double boiler, melt the chocolate chips.  Pour the melted chocolate over the entire pie and refrigerate for an hour or so.
