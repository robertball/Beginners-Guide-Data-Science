Ingredients:
2 cups of white sugar
1 cup coconut oil
several drops of essential oil - whatever kind desired
Food coloring if desired

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except food coloring.  The essential oil used is based on whatever scent you would like.  For instance I used candy cane oil or peppermint essential oil.  Then added red food coloring to a portion of the sugar mixture.  Layer uncolored sugar mixture with red mixture to make it look like a candy cane.
