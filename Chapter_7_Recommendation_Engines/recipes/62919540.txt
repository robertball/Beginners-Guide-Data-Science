Ingredients:
3 c. oats (not quick-cooking)
3/4 c. brown sugar
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. baking powder
3/4 c. Craisins, raisins, dried cherries, or other dried fruit
1 c. milk
1/2 c. butter, melted (you can substitute applesauce for 1/4 c. of the butter if you want)
2 tsp. vanilla
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl, combine the oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and Craisins. In a smaller bowl, mis together the milk, butter, vanilla, and eggs. Add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture and whisk to combine. Pour into a deep 9? pie plate or an 8×8? or 9×9? baking dish. Bake for 40 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Serve immediately with a splash of warmed milk.
