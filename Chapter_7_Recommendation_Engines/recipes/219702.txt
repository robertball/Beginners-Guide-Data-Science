Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter at room temperature
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1 cup butterscotch chips
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a mixing bowl, beat the butter, brown sugar, white sugar, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. Beat in flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and rolled oats until thoroughly mixed. Stir in the butterscotch chips and coconut. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake the cookies in the preheated oven just until the bottoms are light brown, 7 to 8 minutes. If you prefer crunchier cookies, bake 9 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Don't even think that you can eat only ONE! Boy, are these cookies fabulous! They are so moist and chewy. If you prefer a crisper cookie, just bake for a couple of minutes longer. These are great cookies to send overseas to our troops.
