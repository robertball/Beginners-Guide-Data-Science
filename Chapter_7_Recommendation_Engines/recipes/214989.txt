Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Scrub the potatoes well and pierce with a fork. Cook on full power in microwave oven for 5 minutes; turn the potatoes over and cook 5 more minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and set aside to cool. Thinly slice the cooled potatoes.
Cook and stir the butter and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Gently place the potatoes into the skillet and fry, carefully flipping the potatoes a few times, until slices are browned around the edges. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Description: 
When I was working my way through college at a local diner, I learned that they used leftover baked potatoes from the dinner menu that they baked the day before.  They always made extra baked potatoes so that they could use them for home fries the next morning.  I discovered that this was the 'secret' to having flaky, crispy home fries.  Very easy to make.
