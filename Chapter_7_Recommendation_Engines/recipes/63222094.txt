Ingredients:
1 Slice Fresh bread (cut into cubes)
1/4 cup Milk
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/3 cup Parmesan (powdered)
1/2 teaspoon Garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon Salt
Â¼ teaspoon Pepper
1 Egg
1 lb Ground beef

Directions:
In a large bowl combine bread cubes, milk, Worcestershire sauce, parmesan, garlic powder, salt & pepper. Add egg & mix. Add ground beef & combine with hands.
Roll into individual meatballs of your preferred size. Keep in mind they will shrink a little when cooked. Please meatballs on a microwave safe plate, cook for 2 minutes on high, turn them over and cook for 2 additional minutes.
Depending on the percent ground beef you choose you may want to make sure there is a lip on your plate so any fat that cooks off your meatballs doesn't spill in your microwave or on your hands when you move them!
