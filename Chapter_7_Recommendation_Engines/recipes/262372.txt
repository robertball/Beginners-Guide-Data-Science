Ingredients:
1/4 cup raisins
1 apple, cut into matchsticks
1/4 cup orange juice
1 orange, sectioned and diced (optional)
2 stalks celery, cut into matchsticks
1 large carrot, shredded
1/4 cup chopped fresh pineapple (optional)
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 (5.3 ounce) container plain Greek yogurt

Directions:
Place raisins in a small microwave-safe bowl and cover with water. Microwave until raisins appear plump, 30 to 60 seconds. Let cool slightly; drain.
Toss apple in orange juice to prevent oxidation in a large bowl. Stir in raisins, orange, celery, carrot, pineapple, walnuts, and coconut.
Warm honey in the microwave for about 10 seconds; mix into the Greek yogurt. Pour yogurt mixture over salad and mix well.

Description: 
This slaw is a lighter take on Waldorf and carrot salad, with a tropical spin. Light, refreshing and very tasty! It's best eaten the same day. It can keep a few days, but will not look freshly made. Great for an outdoor party or picnic since there is no mayo.
