Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup sifted all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking pan.
Melt butter and chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove top of double boiler and stir sugar, flour, eggs, salt, and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture until batter is smooth. Fold walnuts into batter; spread into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cut brownies while warm.
