1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
6 slices bacon
1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic

Directions:
In a large pot with boiling salted water cook penne pasta until al dente. Drain well.
Meanwhile, in a medium skillet cook the bacon strips until mostly cooked, but not crisp. Remove from pan, break into bite size pieces. Drain bacon grease from pan. Return cooked bacon to pan, add minced garlic, chopped red onion, olive oil and chili pepper. Saute until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add chopped tomatoes, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Pour ingredients into a large bowl. Add additional grated Parmesan cheese to top and serve immediately over cooked and drained pasta.
