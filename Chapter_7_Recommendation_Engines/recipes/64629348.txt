1 cup rice
100 grams chicken thighs
180 grams clams, cleaned
6 pcs shrimp, deveined and heads removed
1/4 pc onion
1 clove garlic
1 pc dried shiitake, soaked in 1 1/2 cup water (reserve stock)
1 pc bay leaf
100 grams tomato sauce

Put rice in a microwaveable bowl. Pour 1 1/2 cup of shiitake water into rice. Add the reduced tomato sauce, garlic, onion, bay leaf, salt, pepper and parsley. Mix well.
Put a microwave-safe cover on the bowl then cook in the microwave for 6 minutes using 600W. Take out from the microwave then mix and then return and cook more for 4 minutes.
Add the shrimp and clams on top of rice then cover and cook more for 3 minutes. Make sure that all clams have opened. After the microwave stops, do not take the cover immediately. Keep it still about 5 more minutes before opening to allow the rice to cook completely.
