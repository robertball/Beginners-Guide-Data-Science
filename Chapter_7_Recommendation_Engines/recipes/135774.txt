Slice the loaf of French bread in half lengthwise. Scoop out the center portion of each half to make a hollow and discard. Spread mayonnaise on the bottom half of the loaf, and mustard on the top half. Fill the bottom hollow with surimi. Cover the surimi with slices of Muenster and colby jack cheese, then layer with the tomato slices, avocado slices, and sprouts. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with the remaining bread half. Slice across the loaf to make six sections.
