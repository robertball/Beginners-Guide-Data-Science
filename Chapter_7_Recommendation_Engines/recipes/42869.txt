Ingredients:
4 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 cup milk
2 cups fresh or frozen broccoli florets, cooked and drained
2 cups biscuit/baking mix
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute ham and onion in butter until the onion is tender. Combine soup and milk; stir into ham mixture. Add broccoli; heat through. Pour into an ungreased shallow 2-1/2-qt. baking dish.
Combine biscuit mix and water until a soft dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 10 times. Roll out into a 12-in. square; sprinkle with parsley. Roll up jellyroll style. Cut into 12 pieces; place over the ham mixture.
Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until biscuits are golden and the ham mixture is bubbly.
