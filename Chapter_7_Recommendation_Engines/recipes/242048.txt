Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cup coconut milk
1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup rice flour
1 tablespoon coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Beat eggs, coconut milk, 1 1/2 coconut oil, baking powder, and sea salt together in a bowl until smooth. Gradually stir rice flour into the egg mixture until completely incorporated into a batter.
Refrigerate batter for at least 1 hour.
Melt enough coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat to coat cooking surface completely. Spoon batter into hot skillet to make 4-inch rounds. Cook pancakes until bubbles form on the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip cakes and continue cooking until golden on the bottom, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
This is my version of rice cakes. They have a wonderful hint of coconut after each bite. 
Serve these with a dollop of sour cream and drizzle lightly with some molasses or honey for a great morning get you going item or as a side dish with your favorite pork roast. Please enjoy and feel free to leave a comment letting me know whether or not this is a keeper for you.
