Ingredients:
Inspired by Kathleen King
3 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil and 4 oz unsweetened applesauce (or 3/4 cup vegetable oil)
4 eggs
1 can (15 oz) solid packed pumpkin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ F. Grease 2 9" x 3" x 5"loaf pans (I just use parchment paper). Combine dry ingredients in a small bowl.  In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine wet ingredients.  Fold in flour mixture until just combined.  Pour evenly into loaf pans and bake for 55 minutes.

Description: 
When I was little Pumpkin Bread was a Thanksgiving staple and one of my favorites. My mother never wrote down complete recipes so I spent awhile getting it almost right until my sister forwarded me a recipe that with a few tweaks seemed to replicate my mom's.
