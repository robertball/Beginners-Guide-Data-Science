Ingredients:
1 package (16 ounces) extra-wide lasagna noodles
1 packet (1 ounces) Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
¾ cup whole milk
4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
Cook the lasagne noodles according to the package directions and drain.
Arrange the noodles flat on a well-oiled surface.
In a large bowl, mix the seasoning mix together with the cream cheese until well blended. Add the spinach to half of the cream cheese and stir until well mixed. Evenly spread 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture over each noodle. Roll each noodle and place seam side down in an oiled 13x9x2-inch baking dish.
In a saucepan, over a medium heat, whisk the remaining cheese mixture into the milk and tomato sauce, stirring until smooth and bubbly. Pour the sauce evenly over the lasagne. Bake covered for 25 minutes.
Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the cheese and bake uncovered for another 10 minutes or until the top is browned and sauce is bubbly.
