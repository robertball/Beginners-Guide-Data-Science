Description: 
If you enjoy using sourdough, you know it can be a challenge to time the bake with time to feed your starter! When it's time to feed, it's time to discard some of the starter, and you may or may not be ready to bake bread. This recipe uses the starter that you discard to create a yummy coffee cake for those mornings when you have just a bit of extra time. I like to make the streusel first, so it's ready to go when I need it. There is also an optional glaze.
