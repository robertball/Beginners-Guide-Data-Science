Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour, divided
3 cups white sugar, divided
3 cups low-fat milk

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Let stand 10 minutes. In a 2 quart container glass, plastic or ceramic container, combine 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup sugar. Mix thoroughly or flour will lump when milk is added. Slowly stir in 1 cup milk and dissolved yeast mixture. Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly. Consider this day 1 of the 10 day cycle. Leave loosely covered at room temperature.
On days 2 thru 4: stir starter with a spoon. Day 5: stir in 1 cup white whole wheat flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. Days 6 thru 9: stir only.
Day 10: stir in 1/2 cup each all-purpose and white whole wheat  flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. Remove 1 cup to make your first bread, give 2 cups to friends along with this recipe, and your favorite Amish Bread recipe. Store the remaining 1 cup starter in a container in the refrigerator, or begin the 10 day process over again (beginning with step 2).
