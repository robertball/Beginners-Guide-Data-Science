Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon chili powder (optional)
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
water as needed
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
1 cup water, or more as needed
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 tomatoes, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Melt ghee with oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute ginger and garlic in the ghee mixture until aromatic and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion; continue to saute until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes more.
Mix curry powder, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garam masala, and turmeric together in a bowl; add to the skillet and stir. Stir enough water into the skillet to get the mixture to be paste-like; cook to let the flavors intensify for about 30 seconds.
Stir sweet potato, chickpeas, 1 cup water, and salt into the mixture in the skillet; cook at a simmer until the sweet potato is just tender, about 10 minutes. Thin the mixture with more water if too thick.
Stir tomatoes into the sweet potato mixture, bring to a boil, and cook until the liquid reduces to a thick gravy, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
I had some leftover bread that has a short shelf-life. So, I guess this spicy recipe goes well with it. Decided to add sweet potato to the original chana masala, as I didn't want that to go to waste, too. And it tasted good!
