Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped fresh asparagus
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
2 tablespoons chopped red onion
6 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus, green bell pepper, and onion in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Mix cooked vegetables and Cheddar cheese into egg mixture. Spoon about 1/4 cup mixture into each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until frittatas are set in the middle and lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
