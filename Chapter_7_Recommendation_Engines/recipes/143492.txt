Ingredients:
1 large portobello mushroom, sliced
1 small zucchini, sliced
¼ pound butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and thinly sliced
1 cup bite-size broccoli florets
¼ cup chopped red onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 ounces refrigerated pizza crust
¼ cup pesto
¼ cup crumbled Gorgonzola or blue cheese
¼ cup fontina cheese, cubed

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
Place the mushrooms, zucchini, squash, broccoli, and onion in a grill pan, and brush with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook on preheated, covered grill until tender when pierced with a fork, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and set aside.
Roll out pizza dough on a floured surface to make two 8 inch circles 1/4 inch thick. Place onto pizza pans. Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake on preheated, covered grill until browned, turning once, about 3 minutes each side. Remove from grill and spread with pesto. Top with cooked vegetables. Sprinkle with blue and fontina cheeses. Return to grill, cover, and cook until cheese melts, about 3 minutes.
