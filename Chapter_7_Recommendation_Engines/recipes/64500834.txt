Ingredients:
2 chicken breast
2 pats butter (pat = 1" sq.)
1 whole garlic clove
1 1/2 cups corn flakes cereal

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mince the garlic. Divide the chicken breasts into halves. Remove the skin and all visible fat from the chicken.
2. In a small nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the butter and garlic. Cook until the garlic is fragrant.
3. In a plastic bag, crush the cornflakes with a rolling pin to form fine crumbs. Combine the cornflakes, Parmesan and red pepper.
4. Brush the tops of the chicken breast halves with butter-garlic mixture. Sprinkle the cornflakes evenly on the chicken and gently press into the chicken to make sure it sticks.
5. Place the chicken on a nonstick baking pan and bake for 35-40 minutes or until the coating is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through.
