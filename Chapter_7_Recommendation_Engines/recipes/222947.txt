Ingredients:
3/4 cup self-rising cornbread mix (such as Martha WhiteÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 yellow squash, cut into 1/8-inch slices
1/4 cup olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Place cornbread mix in a gallon-size resealable bag; season with salt and black pepper. Add squash, seal bag, and shake to coat evenly. Remove squash from bag and shake off any excess cornmeal.
Heat about 1/4 inch of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry squash in the hot oil, working in batches, until center is cooked and edges are crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
