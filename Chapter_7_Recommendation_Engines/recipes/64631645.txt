Ingredients:
¾ cup warm water
1 envelope active dry yeast (2 ¼ tsp if using from jar)
¾ cup warm milk
2 tbs honey
2 tbs olive oil
1 tsp salt
3 ½ + cups all purpose flour (can use whole wheat)

Directions:
Place water in large mixer bowl. Sprinkle in yeast; stir until dissolved. Add warm milk, honey, oil, salt, and 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough.
OPTIONAL: Add spices and other goodies to dough. The following are suggestions: rosemary and garlic, basil, dill, flax seeds, oat bran.
Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Place in greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover; let rise in warm place until doubled in size, about 30 to 45 minutes.
Punch dough down. Remove dough to lightly floured surface; roll to 12 x 8-inch rectangle. Beginning at short end, roll up tightly. Pinch seam and ends to seal. Place, seam side down, in greased 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes.
Bake at 375°F for 35 to 36 minutes or until done. Remove from pan; let cool on wire rack.
