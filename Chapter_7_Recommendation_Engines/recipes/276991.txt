Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 limes, juiced, divided
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
2 yellow onions, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, coarsely chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped, divided
4 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce
10 slices canned jalapeno pepper
5 kaffir lime leaves
3 Thai chiles, finely chopped, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chicken, fish sauce, and juice of 1/2 of the lime juice. Saute until chicken is no longer pink on the outside, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Add onions and cook until almost translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in chili powder to coat. Add tomatoes and black beans with their liquid. Stir in corn coconut milk, 1/2 of the cilantro, chile-garlic sauce, jalapenos, and kaffir lime leaves. Reduce heat and simmer to desired thickness, about 15 minutes.
Add Thai chiles. Remove lime leaves before serving. Add remaining lime juice and garnish with remaining cilantro.
