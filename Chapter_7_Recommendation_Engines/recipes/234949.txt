Description: 
This is a recipe my mom and grandmother use every time there's a family gathering or a special occasion. To make this a vegetarian dish just leave out the ham. Potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be chilled completely after boiling. Dill can be substituted for parsley if desired.
