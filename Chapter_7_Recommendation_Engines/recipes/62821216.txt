Ingredients:
2 cups black beans (or 1 can of no salt added)
3 lightly beaten eggs
1/3 cup melted coconut oil (or melted butter)
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup honey (or other equivalent sweetener) (next time I want to try palm sugar!)
1/2 cup chopped up bittersweet chocolate (or semi-sweet chips if you don’t mind the added refined sugar in them)
1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts -optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
Grease an 8"×8" pan.
Toss all but the final 2 ingredients (the chopped up chocolate and walnuts) into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.
Fold in the chopped chocolate and walnuts.
Pour into the pan and bake for about 30 minutes.
