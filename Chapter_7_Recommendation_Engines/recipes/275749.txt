Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
4 cups old-fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups slivered almonds
1 cup coconut flakes
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups dried cranberries (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Mix oats, pecans, almonds, and coconut flakes together in a large bowl. Set aside.
Combine vegetable oil, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir gently until it begins to boil; remove from heat. Pour over oat mixture and fold together until dry ingredients are well coated. Spread granola onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Stir and continue to bake on the top rack until golden, about 5 minutes more.
Remove from the oven and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes. Toss with cranberries. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
My grandmother and I created this homemade granola recipe one day, and it is currently loved and requested by the rest of my family, including my other grandma who used to be anti-granola! My favorite ways to serve it are in coconut Greek yogurt or just in a bowl with milk. Simple and awesome.
