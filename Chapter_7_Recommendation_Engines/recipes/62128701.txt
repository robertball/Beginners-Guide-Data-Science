Ingredients:
1 (13x9) brownie mix
2 (1/2 lb.) Hershey Symphony candy bars (the kind with the almonds and toffee in them.  At our Wal-Mart they are found in the candy aisle).

Directions:
Mix brownies according to the package directions.  Pour one-half of the batter into a greased 13x9 pan and spread out the batter with a spatula.  Break the candy bars at the lines and place over the batter in the pan.  Pour remaining batter over candy bars.  Bake according to the directions on the brownie box - which is usually 350 degrees for about 25 - 28 minutes.  Do not overbake - a little under done is better than a little over done!
