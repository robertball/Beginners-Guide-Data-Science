4 Eggs
4 Tablespoons Melted Butter
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 Cup Flour

Description: 
I tweaked this recipe from a favorite Bed and Breakfast to suit my family. These cakes are a first cousin to traditional pancakes but pack a little more protein with the additional eggs and cheese. Kids love them with the chocolate chips, but they are also delicious plain served with maple syrup or jam.
