Ingredients:
1-4 yams

Directions:
Preheat oven to about 400 degrees Farenheit.
Wrap each yam individually (or you can double up, if they're small enough) in aluminum foil.
Cook for about 1 hour, + an additional 5-10 minutes for each yam (for example, if you have 1 large yam cook for an hour, if you have 2 yams cook for 1 hour 5 min, if you have 3 yams cook for 1 hour and 10 minutes, etc.)
Remove from the oven and let sit for 10-15 minutes before enjoying, or carefully unwrap immediately and pierce several times to cool faster.
They can be transfered straight into the fridge in the foil, but be careful since if you cook them for long enough they create a sweet juice that is sticky if spilled.
