Ingredients:
1 pound beef stew meat
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup chopped Spanish onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chopped red potatoes
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (12 ounce) jar sofrito
1/2 cup pitted and halved green olives

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook beef in hot skillet until completely browned, about 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer beef to a slow cooker, retaining some of the beef drippings in the skillet.
Return skillet to heat and heat the retained drippings. Saute onion and garlic in hot drippings until softened, about 5 minutes; add to beef in slow cooker.
Stir potatoes, diced tomatoes, sofrito, and olives into the beef mixture.
Cook on Low until beef and potatoes are fork-tender, 4 to 5 hours.

Description: 
I have never heard a complaint of my beef stew, it's a great new take on an old favorite! I prefer to serve stew over white rice, it all depends on your taste. You can season the beef with a packet of Sazon instead of salt and pepper, for even more Spanish style.
