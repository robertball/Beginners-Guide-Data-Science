Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Pillsbury® Moist Supreme Classic White Cake Mix)
1 (10 ounce) jar raspberry preserves
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
¾ cup milk
3  eggs
¼ cup vegetable oil
1 (16 ounce) container lemon frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch baking dishes.
Mix cake mix, raspberry preserves, sour cream, milk, eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared baking dishes.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cakes completely, at least 1 hour.
Spread lemon frosting over each cooled cake.

Description: 
I don't usually bake with box cake, but I got lazy and it turned out amazing, so I decided to share. I used Duncan Hines® Creamy Homestyle Lemon Supreme Frosting the first time I made this, but I usually make my own glaze or frosting to go with this cake.
