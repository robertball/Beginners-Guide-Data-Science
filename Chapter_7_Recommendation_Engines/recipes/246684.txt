1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, sliced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds lamb shoulder chops, trimmed

1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable stock

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat until melted. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Season flour with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge lamb chops in flour mixture on both sides.
Layer lamb chops with onion, carrot, and celery in a casserole dish.
Mix stock, plum jam, tomato sauce, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl. Pour over lamb in the casserole dish.

Description: 
A family favorite. I don't even like chops and I like this recipe! I ran out of plum jam for this recipe once and used apricot instead. It still tasted good. I normally leave out the celery.
