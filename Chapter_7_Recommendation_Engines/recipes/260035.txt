Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups water
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium saucepan and cook rice, stirring frequently, until transparent, 2 to 3 minutes.
Combine water, cilantro, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth and cilantro is chopped very finely. Pour over rice and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until rice has absorbed all the liquid and is soft, about 20 minutes.
Remove rice from heat and fluff with a fork. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Green rice (arroz verde) is one of my favorite side dishes. You can add chiles and other spices but my favorite is the plain version just with cilantro. I cook the rice in water but you can also use chicken broth.
