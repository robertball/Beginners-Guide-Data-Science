Ingredients:
2.5 - 3 lbs ground beef (Less if lean, more if 22% or higher fat content)
16 oz. sour cream
8 oz. cream cheese
1.5 packages Lawry's taco seasoning
1.5 cup shredded cheddar
1.5 cup shredded monterey jack
4 4-oz cans diced green chiles
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions
1 cup diced tomatos
2 12-oz can black beans
1/2 cup sliced black olives
2 cups favorite salsa
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp cayenne
1 tbsp paprika
2 tbsp garlic powder

Directions:
Set out cream cheese to soften.
In a skillet, put the meat on med heat to start browning.
In separate bowl, mix sour cream, cream cheese and taco seasoning with a hand mixer to get smooth consistency, cover and set aside.
After browning and draining the ground beef, return it to the pan and add the salsa, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder, and 2 undrained cans of diced green chiles.
Simmer while shredding cheese, chopping veggies, etc.
When all is ready, in an ungreased 9x13 baking dish, layer beans, then sour cream mix, beef mix, cheese and the remaining drained chiles.  Place in a preheated oven just until cheese is melted.
Remove and top with tomatoes, green onion, olives, and you're ready to party!  This chip dip is even better the next day when the flavors have all melded. Warning, not for delicate taste buds!  Can get quite hot!
