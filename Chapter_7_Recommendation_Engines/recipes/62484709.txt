Ingredients:
1	pound plum tomatoes
1	medium onion
¼	cup dry unseasoned breadcrumbs
½	cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 ¼	teaspoons basil
3/8	teaspoon pepper
½	teaspoon salt
1	egg
4	turkey cutlets (about ¾ pound total)
2	tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil
2	cloves garlic, minced or crushed through a press
½	cup tomato sauce
½	cup grated part skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
1.	Coarsely chop the tomatoes and the onion.
2.	In a shallow bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, ¼ cup of the Parmesan, ¼ teaspoon of the basil, 1/8 teaspoon of the pepper and the salt.  In another shallow bowl, beat the egg.  Dip the turkey cutlets in the beaten egg, then dredge them in the breadcrumb mixture.
3.	In a large skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add the cutlets and cook until browned all over, about 3 minutes per side.  Remove the turkey to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.
4.	Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet.  Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring for 3 minutes.
5.	Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato sauce, the remaining 1 teaspoon basil and ¼ teaspoon pepper.  Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat.
6.	Return the turkey to the skillet and sprinkle with the mozzarella and the remaining ¼ cup Parmesan.  Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer until the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.
