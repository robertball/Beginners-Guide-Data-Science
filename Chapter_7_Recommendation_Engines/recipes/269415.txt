Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground allspice
3 eggs, separated
2 cups milk
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Combine sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice in a bowl.
Whip egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Reduce speed to medium and beat, gradually adding 1/2 of sugar mixture, until stiff peaks form.
Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until thick and lemon colored. Mix remaining sugar mixture into the yolks. Fold yolk mixture into the egg whites. Add milk and half-and-half; combine gently. Garnish with remaining cinnamon.

Description: 
This eggnog recipe was the traditional holiday drink while growing up and now it's the traditional drink in my home. I've tried several nog recipes, but to this day this one is still my favorite. Optional: add brandy or liqueur of choice when serving.
