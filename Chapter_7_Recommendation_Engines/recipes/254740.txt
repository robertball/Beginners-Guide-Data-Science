Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
4 eggs, beaten
1 red onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
5 small carrots, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 cup chopped cabbage
4 scallions, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces
2 teaspoons soy sauce, divided
1/4 cup curry powder, divided
2 tablespoons chili powder, divided
3 cups chopped paratha (Indian flatbread)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add eggs; cook and stir until scrambled and dry, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, garlic, and ginger; cook and stir frequently until onions are nearly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrots; cook and stir until carrots are nearly tender but still crunchy, 7 to 8 minutes.
Stir cabbage and scallions into the skillet; add 1 teaspoon soy sauce. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons curry powder and 1 tablespoon chili powder over the vegetable mixture; stir until coated. Turn stove top temperature to low.
Mix eggs and paratha into the vegetable mixture. Stir in remaining soy sauce, curry powder, and chili powder; stir until coated. Cook until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
