Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound boneless pork shoulder, cubed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter
1 red onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 shallot, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound new potatoes, cut into 1/2 -inch cubes
2 cups dry red wine
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
1 large Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and diced

Directions:
Heat the oil in a  Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the flour into a bowl. Add cubed pork and toss until coated. Shake off the excess flour and place pork in the hot oil. Cook until browned on each side, and then remove from the pan.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, and melt the butter in the pan. Add the onion, garlic  and shallot; season with thyme, rosemary, basil, salt and pepper. Cook and stir until the onion is tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the potatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.
Pour the wine and beef broth into the pot, and add the pork and apple. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes, until potatoes and apples are tender.
