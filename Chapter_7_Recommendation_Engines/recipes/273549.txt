Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
Cake:
1 cup water
1 chai tea bag
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup light sour cream
2 eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
Icing:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
4 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 10x15-inch cake pan thoroughly with nonstick cooking spray.
Bring water to a boil in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave oven or in a pot on the stovetop. Remove from heat and add chai tea bag. Let steep for 10 minutes; remove bag.
Combine chai tea, applesauce, and butter in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add flour, sugar, sour cream, eggs, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt and whisk until smooth. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes.
Remove cake from the oven.
Combine butter and milk in a large saucepan. Bring to a light boil and remove from heat. Add confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon; whisk icing until smooth.
Pour icing over warm cake and smooth across the surface. Let cool thoroughly before cutting into 24 pieces.

Description: 
I love Texas sheet cake! Chocolate, white...it doesn't matter. But they all have so much butter. I tried to lighten up an excellent white Texas sheet cake recipe I found on this site by using applesauce in place of some (but not all!) of the butter. To complement the flavor of apples, I also used chai spices for a little added flavor.
