Description: 
This hearty pork stew has its origins in Spain and Latin America. Pig's tails and ears can be specially ordered from some butchers. Chorizo is a spicy Spanish sausage, look for it in some grocery stores and Latin markets. Pancetta is an Italian-style bacon. It makes a wonderful and filling meal. Be sure and serve it with lots of fresh bread!
