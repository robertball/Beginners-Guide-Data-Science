Ingredients:
2 zucchini
1 T olive oil
1/4 cup parmesan, grated
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/8 t salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Slice the zucchini into 1/4-inch thick rounds. In a medium bowl, toss the zucchini with the oil.
In a small bowl, combine the Parmesan, bread crumbs, salt, and a few turns of pepper.
Dip each round into the Parmesan mixture, coating it evenly on both sides, pressing the coating on to stick, and place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the zucchini rounds until browned and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove with spatula. Serve immediately.
