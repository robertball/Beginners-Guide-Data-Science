Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 turkey breast tenderloins (about 1 1/2 pounds)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup dry white wine or chicken broth
2 tablespoons butter
4 large onions, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle both sides of the turkey with salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. Cook the turkey in the oil about 5 minutes, turning once, until it is brown on both sides.
Pour the wine into the skillet; reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 30 to 40 minutes or until the turkey juice runs clear when the thickest pieces are cut. Remove the turkey from the skillet and keep warm.
Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onions in the butter 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in brown sugar, thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. Cook 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden brown.
Slice turkey. Serve turkey with onions.

Description: 
Speed the caramelizing process by adding a pinch of salt to remove some of the onions' moisture. If you add too much, your onions will begin to stick and burn.
After 5 minutes, add a little sugar (1 tablespoon sugar for 4 large onions ) also add a little dry red wine.
