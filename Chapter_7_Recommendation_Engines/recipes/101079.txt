Ingredients:
2 cups shredded cooked pork
1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 cup reduced fat sour cream
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
6 (7 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cooked pork, enchilada sauce, onion powder, 1/2 cup sour cream, green chilies, and one cup of the shredded cheese in a large bowl.  In a separate bowl, stir together tomato soup, remaining 1/2 cup sour cream, garlic powder, and cumin.
Pour a thin layer of the tomato soup mixture into a 9x13 baking dish. Spread pork mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll tortillas to enclose filling; place seam side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining soup mixture over the filled tortillas.  Top with the remaining 1 cup cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
