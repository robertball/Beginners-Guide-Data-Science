Ingredients:
•2 - 3 boneless chicken breasts frozen (no need to thaw)
•1 Can Cream of Chicken Soup
•1 Can of Water/Milk (I fill up the Can from the soup with half water, half milk)
•½ onion chopped
•3-4 potatoes, peeled and chopped
•1 bag of Frozen vegetables (I used peas and carrots. Any frozen bag or fresh would work.)
•Celery is good too if you have it (optional)
•Salt and Pepper
•Garlic Salt
•Poultry Seasoning

Directions:
Place the potatoes in the bottom of the crockpot. Then lay chicken on top.
Literally toss everything else in the crockpot.
Cook on low all day. Shred chicken with a fork right before serving. Bake your biscuits and serve.
It is delicious and very easy!

Description: 
This recipe is VERY freezer friendly. Toss all the ingredients except the potatoes in a freezer bag. (potatoes do not freeze well uncooked). Freeze. Then just toss into a crockpot, add your potatoes and cook like normal. If you want to freeze the potatoes, then substitute diced hashbrowns for the potatoes and you will still get the same delicious meal and it will be frozen ready to cook.

Freezing it ahead of time really saves you money in the long run. All you have to do is toss it in the crockpot in the morning. Done! ;)
