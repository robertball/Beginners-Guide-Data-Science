Ingredients:
1 pound salmon fillet
1 onion, sliced into rings
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate.
Place the salmon on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Place the onion rings on top of the filet. Pepper to taste. Wrap the foil around the salmon, but don't seal the top.
Place the salmon (still in foil) onto a preheated grill and cover.  Cook for 15 minutes or until salmon flakes easily with a fork.

Description: 
This is a great way to barbecue salmon for gatherings.  It adds some superficial flavor without hiding the salmons' own great taste.
