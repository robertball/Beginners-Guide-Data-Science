Description: 
I bought a rice cooker and wanted to use it for more than just rice. I've made this mac 'n cheese several times and it always comes out delicious! If you like your mac 'n cheese nice and crusty, leave the pot on warm for another 10 to 15 minutes after stirring the cheeses into the cooked macaroni.
