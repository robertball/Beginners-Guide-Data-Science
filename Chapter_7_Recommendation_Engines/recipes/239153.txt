Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, or more as needed, divided
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 ounce fresh ginger, minced
1 pound pork tenderloin, sliced into thin strips, or to taste
3 hot long green chile peppers, sliced into thin strips, or more to taste
salt to taste
2 teaspoons soy sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until smoking; saute garlic and ginger until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add pork to wok; cook and stir until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate.
Pour remaining 2 tablespoons oil into the same wok over medium-high heat; saute chile peppers until well-coated with oil and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add pork to chile peppers and generously season with salt. Cook and stir mixture until peppers are tender, 5 to 7 minutes more. Mix enough soy sauce into pork mixture to add color and taste for desired saltiness.
