Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 tablespoon seasoned salt (Lawrys)
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon lemon pepper
3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs (italian optional)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - sliced in half & lightly pounded thin
1-2 cups veg oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Slice chicken breasts in half and marinate in buttermilk 4 to 8 hours, or overnite.
Heat oil in elec skillet to 350.
In a shallow dish (or a large resealable plastic bag), mix together half the spices; garlic powder, pepper, lemon pepper, seasoned salt, paprika and flour.
In another shallow dish mix the other half of spices with the bread crumbs.
In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
Dip the chicken into the flour mix until evenly coated.
Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the bread crumb mix until evenly coated.
Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 10 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. (be careful to not overcook - remember these breasts are thin cut!) Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
