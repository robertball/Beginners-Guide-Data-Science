Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust pastry
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup cooked acorn squash
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate.
Beat evaporated milk, squash, white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; pour into pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until pie is set, about 30 minutes more.

Description: 
Grandma Darcy gave me this recipe many years ago. Since then we always have her squash pie on Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin, and like it much better!
