Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 (8 ounce) package white mushrooms, sliced
1 onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 1/2 cups milk
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups cubed leftover cooked turkey
1 cup peas
1/2 (8 ounce) package egg noodles, or more to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and celery until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour over mushroom mixture and stir to coat.
Mix milk, cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and nutmeg into mushroom mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese is melted and sauce is warmed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add turkey and peas to sauce.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and mix noodles into turkey mixture; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and 3 tablespoons melted butter together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over noodle mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
