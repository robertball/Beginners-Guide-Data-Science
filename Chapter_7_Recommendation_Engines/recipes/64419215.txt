Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups heavy cream
4 egg yolks
8 oz  (about 1.5 cups) whole freshly roasted coffee beans
3/4 cup white sugar
1 cups whole milk
1/4 t. of salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Make sure your ice cream maker is in the freezer!
In a saucepan, heat the cream, sugar, and the egg yolks until the cream mixture steams but does not boil--about 15 min over medium low heat stirring regularly--be careful not to cook the eggs.  Turn off the heat, add the whole coffee beans, and refrigerate overnight.
When you're ready to make the ice cream, strain out the whole coffee beans.  (Nobody likes whole coffee beans in their scoop--take them out.)
Stir in the milk, salt, and vanilla extract.
Add to your ice cream maker, and freeze according to your manufacturer's directions.

Description: 
The use of whole beans creates an almost white coffee ice cream, with all the robust flavor of freshly brewed coffee.  The oil from the beans seeps into the cream and the result is almost like a coffee cream tea that turns into smooth, rich ice cream.

Serve this ice cream in cold-brewed coffee for a delicious coffee-coffee float on hot days.
