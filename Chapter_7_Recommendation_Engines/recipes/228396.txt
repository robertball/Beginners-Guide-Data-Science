Ingredients:
4 English (seedless) cucumbers, thinly sliced
2 green bell peppers, cut into thin matchsticks
1 (32 ounce) container plain yogurt
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill, or more to taste
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper

Directions:
Place cucumbers and bell peppers into a colander and allow liquid to drain for 4 hours. While vegetables are draining, place yogurt into a separate colander lined with paper towels and let stand for 4 hours to allow excess whey to drain from the yogurt.
Combine cucumbers, bell peppers, thickened yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, dill, salt, and black pepper in a large salad bowl; chill before serving.
