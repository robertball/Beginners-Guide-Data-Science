Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/3 cup NAKANO® Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Roasted Garlic
1/4 cup dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 tablespoon brown sugar or honey
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon hot chili oil or red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 pounds flank steak, scored
Tangy Wasabi:
4 teaspoons wasabi powder
Water (see wasabi label)
1 tablespoon NAKANO® Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic

Directions:
In a small bowl or 1-cup measuring cup, stir together marinade ingredients. Place steak in a sealable gallon plastic bag. Pour marinade over meat; seal bag. Refrigerate 8 hours or overnight; turn bag at least once during marinating time.
About 10 minutes before cooking the steak, mix wasabi powder and water in a small bowl, following directions on the label to determine the correct amount of water needed. Let mixture stand 10 minutes. Gradually stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar until mixture is the consistency of mustard or just slightly thinner. Drain steak and discard marinade.
Grill over medium direct heat with cover closed until done as desired, about 14 to16 minutes total. To serve, thinly slice steak across the grain. Serve drizzled with Tangy Wasabi.
