Ingredients:
1 pound sliced smoked bacon
1 pound fresh asparagus spears, trimmed
5 tablespoons sriracha sauce

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Divide asparagus into sets of 3 spears; push 1 toothpick through the asparagus bases and 1 toothpick near the tops to secure the sets.
Spread about 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce along the entire length of each slice of bacon.
Secure a slice of bacon to the asparagus using the toothpick at the base of the asparagus and wrap bacon, sriracha-side facing inwards, around asparagus, securing the other end of the bacon to the top toothpick; repeat with remaining bacon and asparagus. Place wrapped asparagus sets in the bottom of a disposable aluminum foil pan.
Cook on the preheated grill, turning asparagus sets occasionally, until bacon is cooked through and crisp, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
If you love your asparagus like we do, here is another way of enjoying it on the grill. The bacon has a nice mellowing effect on the sriracha and isn't spicy at all. The flavors are fantastic, and after just the first time this became an instant family favorite at our house.
