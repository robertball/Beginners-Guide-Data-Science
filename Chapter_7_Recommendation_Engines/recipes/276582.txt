Description: 
This is a fast, easy, and very tasty broccoli salad made with broccoli slaw. I use light products where possible, but you can certainly use whatever you have on hand. This recipe is just the start! You can also add diced apples or crumbled bacon. This is also a great dish to make ahead of time. I'd say it's at its best after at least a day.
