Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 1/3 pounds salmon fillet
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
2 cloves garlic
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon fresh lemon thyme
1 lemon, zested
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup fresh bread crumbs

Directions:
Rub 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over the salmon and season lightly with salt and pepper. Transfer salmon to the center of the grill pan.
Place asparagus in a bowl. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper. Mix well and arrange around salmon.
Place garlic cloves in a food processor or blender; process until crushed. Add Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, lemon thyme, lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; blend well. Add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and bread crumbs; pulse until well mixed.
Top salmon with herb mixture, forming a crust.
Set Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven to "Auto Cook". Select Fish with Vegetables setting. Place the grill pan in the oven and cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork and asparagus is tender, about 18 minutes.
