Ingredients:
2 Pounds Extra Lean Ground Beef
1 Packet Mccormick Taco Seasoning (I use HOT)
1 Packet Dry Hidden Valley Ranch Dip - Fiesta or Zesty
2 Cups Chopped Onions
1 Sleeve Original Ritz Crackers (Crushed)
4 oz of Vlasic Jalapeno Slices (Finely diced)
2 Cups Finely Shredded Fiesta Blend Cheese
1 Large Egg

Directions:
Pre-Heat oven to 350. Prepare cookie sheet, cover in aluminum foil (makes for easier clean up) In a large mixing bowl, add meat, taco seasoning packet, dry ranch packet, onions, finely crushed ritz crackers, Jalapenos, cheese, and finally the egg. Mix with hands, kneading and turning until all of the ingredients are as equally dispersed as possible. If ingredients are not molding together you may need to add another egg or a few drops of water to get it to a proper loaf consistency. Place the ingredients on to the foil lined cookie sheet and mold into a loaf, packing down tight and firm to hold together. Place in oven uncovered and bake for 30-45 minutes. If top starts browning to quickly lay a piece of aluminum foil on top of the meat itself do not fold it around.

Description: 
I don't like meatloaf, not a tomato fan. This one just might knock your socks off, and I have never had anyone ever put additional seasoning on this.
