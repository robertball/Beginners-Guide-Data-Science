Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package shredded coleslaw mix
4 1/2 cups shredded red cabbage
3 tablespoons coarse kosher salt
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 large apples, cored
2 large carrots, grated
1/2 cup fat-free mayonnaise
1/2 cup fat free sour cream
1 teaspoon celery seed
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place a large colander into the sink. Place the coleslaw mix and red cabbage into the colander. Sprinkle lightly with salt, toss, and allow to stand 15 minutes.
Pour the vinegar into a large bowl. Grate apples into the bowl and toss with vinegar to keep from turning brown. Stir in the grated carrots, mayonnaise, sour cream, and celery seed until evenly coated. Season with black pepper to taste.
Rinse the coleslaw mix and cabbage with very cold water; drain, pressing out as much water as possible. Taste, and if still too salty, repeat the process. Pat dry with paper towels. Stir coleslaw and cabbage into apple mixture, and toss to coat evenly with dressing. Chill until ready to serve; stir before serving.

Description: 
This delicious, creamy coleslaw is kind to your waistline because the dressing has been lightened a bit. The addition of apples (Granny Smiths and Macintoshes are great!) and carrots sweetens the salad nicely.
