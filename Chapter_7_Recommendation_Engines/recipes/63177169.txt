Ingredients:
12 small-to-medium-sized (1 - 2" wide) brown mushroom caps (stems removed)
2 oz. drained white crabmeat
2 tbsp. celery; minced
2 tbsp. red pepper; minced
1 wedge The Laughing Cow Light Cheese (any Light flavor)
1 tbsp. fat-free sour cream
1 tbsp. fat-free cream cheese
2 tsp. fat-free cheese flavor sprinkles (like the ones by Molly McButter)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Wipe mushrooms clean with a damp paper towel and then dry them. Place with the rounded sides down on a baking dish sprayed lightly with nonstick spray. Combine all other ingredients and stir until well mixed. Evenly distribute crab mixture among the mushroom caps. Place in the oven for 10 - 12 minutes, until hot. Enjoy the creamy, crab-tastic goodness! Makes 12.
