Ingredients:
Basic french baguette recipe
1 cup water
1 T sugar
1 1/2 tsp bread machine yeast
2 3/4 cups bread flour
1 tsp salt
Topping:
Olive oil
kosher salt
poppy seeds
garlic powder

Directions:
Place all bread ingredients in bread machine in order recommended by manufacturer - set to dough/knead cycle.
Remove dough from pan using floured hands.  Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat on all sides.  Cover with a towel and let rise in warm place about 30 minutes, or until double (indent remains when touched).
Grease cookie sheet.  Punch down dough and roll into 16x12" rectangle on lightly floured surface.  Cut crosswise in half to make two 8x12 pieces.  Pinch edges of dough into roll to seal.  Gently roll back and forth to taper ends.
Preheat oven to 375
Place loaves 3" apart on cookie sheet.  Make 3 or 4 diagonal slashes across each loaf.  Cover and let rise 30-40 minutes or until double.
Brush olive oil over loaves, and sprinkle salt, poppy seeds and garlic powder to your liking.
Bake loaves at 375 for 20-25 or until golden brown, serve warm after cooling on wire rack.
