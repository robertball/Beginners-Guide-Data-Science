4 cups Imperial sugar (Mama said only use the good stuff on the divinity)
3/4 cup water
4 egg whites
dash of salt
1 cup light karo syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup pecan pieces

Directions:
Place sugar, karo, salt and water in sauce pan over low heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved. While this is cooking, beat 4 egg whites in large mixing bowl until stiff, set aside. Meanwhile continue cooking until it reaches 260 degrees (hard ball stage)on a candy themometer. Remove from heat and pour, while beating with electric mixer, constantly in a fine stream into stiff egg whites. Continue beating adding vanilla and pecans until mixture starts to get thick then stir by hand. When it starts to hold shape drop on wax paper. If it is not holding shape, stir alittle longer and try again.
