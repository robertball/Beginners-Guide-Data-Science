Ingredients:
4 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup all-purpose flour
1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
4  bay leaves
⅓ cup dry white wine
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
½ cup orange juice
¼ cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts

Directions:
Coat chicken with flour.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook chicken with garlic, ginger, and bay leaves until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Mix wine, vinegar, and honey together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sauce is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add orange juice, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and continue cooking until sauce is reduced by 2/3, about 10 minutes. Strain reduction sauce.
Pour strained reduction sauce over chicken; add pine nuts and simmer over medium heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
