Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons wheat germ
1/3 cup butter
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 egg

Directions:
Combine buttermilk, rolled oats, and raisins in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Liberally grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Remove buttermilk mixture from the refrigerator. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and wheat germ together in a bowl.
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a large mixing bowl until light. Add honey and egg and mix well.
Add flour mixture and buttermilk mixture in alternating batches to the mixing bowl with the butter mixture; stir until batter is evenly moistened.
Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and golden brown, 22 to 28 minutes.
