Ingredients:
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 lb), cut crosswise into 1/2" strips
2/3 cup pancake mix
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or 1/2 cup Parmesan, 1/2 cup Asiago)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp dried parsley
1/2 tsp paprika
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 stick butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450F. Line cookie sheet with foil; spray with cooking spray. In medium bowl, mix pancake mix, cheese, garlic salt, parsley & paprika.
Line up small bowl with slightly beaten egg, medium bowl with pancake mixture & the cookie sheet to make an assembly line.
Dip the chicken strips into egg and then into pancake mixture and arrange on cookie sheet. (Make sure to press pancake mixture onto the chicken strips so more will stick to them.) Drizzle melted butter over chicken.
Bake 12-14 mins, flipping chicken halfway through bake time, until no longer pink in center.
