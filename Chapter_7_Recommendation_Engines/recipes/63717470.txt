Ingredients:
2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup beer or nonalcoholic beer
1 envelope ranch salad dressing mix
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese
1 medium onion, minced
8 strips bacon, cooked crisp
seasoned salt to taste
cayenne pepper to taste
Pretzels

Directions:
In a large bowl, mash the cream cheese with the ranch dressing mix until thoroughly combined, then stir in the cheddar cheese, onion and 6 strips of crumbled bacon. Mix in beer, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency (add more for a thinner dip). Stir in the seasoned salt and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour. Top with remaining bacon, crumbled.  Serve with pretzels.

Description: 
This dip can be made with any type of beer, including nonalcoholic beer. It is much better if it can be made the day before to let the flavors meld.
