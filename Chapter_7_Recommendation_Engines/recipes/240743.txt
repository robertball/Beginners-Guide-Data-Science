Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
3 slices pancetta, chopped, or more to taste
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 bunch kale, chopped
1 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup freshly grated pecorino cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pancetta until crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon.
Cook and stir artichoke hearts in the same skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer artichoke hearts to a plate.
Place kale in a large bowl and top with artichoke hearts and pancetta. Drizzle 3 tablespoons olive oil over kale mixture and add lemon juice, salt, and pepper; toss. Sprinkle grated pecorino cheese over salad.

Description: 
I created this kale, artichoke, and pecorino salad the other day with ingredients I had in the house as a side dish for company. Everyone just loved this dish! Adding the pecorino right before serving gave the salad and extra flavor that made this dish very yummy! Give it a try! You can omit the cheese to keep it paleo!
