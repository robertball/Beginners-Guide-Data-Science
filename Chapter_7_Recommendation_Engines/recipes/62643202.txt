Ingredients:
4 (1-inch thick) pork chops
3 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles root beer
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup vegetable broth
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 whole chipotle in adobo sauce; chopped finely
1/4 teaspoon of ground clove
1 pinch salt, to taste

Directions:
Place the forked pricked pork chops (take two forks back-to-back and prick the meat all over) in a ziplock type bag; Combine all three cans of root beer, the vegetable broth, clove, brown sugar, chipotle, and Worcestershire sauce and then pour over the chops for at least one night. (I did for two days and flipped them every time I went into the frig)
Remove the pork chops from the root beer marinade; season with salt and pepper.
Once you remove the chops reduce the marinade to a glaze on medium-high and stir regularly.  Reducing until the sauce looks like a jelly.  Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Then glaze each side of the chops with the reduced marinade glaze and then continue to do so often as you cook them for about 8-10 minutes (depending on the thickness)on each side and for a total of about 20 minutes or when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Brush the chops generously with the reduction sauce. Remove from grill and brush with any remaining sauce. Season with salt to taste before serving.
