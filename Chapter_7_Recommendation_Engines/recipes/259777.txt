Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Pillsbury®)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips (such as Enjoy Life®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat coconut oil, brown sugar, and white sugar until creamy and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add applesauce and vanilla extract; mix well. Add flour, baking soda, and salt; mix until well combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are brown and tops look a little undercooked, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes more.
