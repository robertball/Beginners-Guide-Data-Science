Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
2 cups shelled edamame
2 cups diced firm tofu
2 teaspoons soy sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon Chinese hot mustard, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, place a steamer basket into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add edamame, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Place edamame into a large bowl with tofu; add soy sauce and mustard. Mix in cooked quinoa and serve warm or chilled.
