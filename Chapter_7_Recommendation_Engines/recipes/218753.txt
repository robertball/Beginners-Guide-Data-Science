Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 large russet potato, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, chopped
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 (14 ounce) can vegetable broth
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, thawed, well drained
1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated garlic butter crescent dinner rolls

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 9- or 10-inch glass deep dish pie plate with cooking spray. In 12-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add potato, onion, thyme, salt and pepper; cook and stir 10 to 12 minutes until potatoes are lightly browned.
Sprinkle flour over potato mixture. Cook and stir 1 minute. Stir in broth; heat to boiling. Reduce heat; cover and simmer about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are almost tender. Remove from heat. Stir in thawed vegetables, milk and cheese. Spoon mixture into pie plate.
Separate dough into 8 triangles. Starting at short side of each triangle, roll up triangle halfway. Carefully arrange over vegetable mixture with tips toward center; do not overlap. Place pie plate on cookie sheet with sides.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
