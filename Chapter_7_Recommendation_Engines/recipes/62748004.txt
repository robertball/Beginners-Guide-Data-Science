Ingredients:
1/2 onion, diced
3 cups risotto rice
3TB butter
4TB olive oil
8-10 cups chicken broth

1 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 small zucchini, cubed

Directions:
Saute onion and celery in 2TB olive oil. Remove when lightly browned and set aside.
Saute rice 7-10 minutes adding olive oil as needed. Stir constantly to avoid sticking.
Put rice, onion, and celery into large saucepan with 1-2 cups of chicken broth just to cover rice. Cook on low to medium heat. Stir frequently. As the risotto thickens, add additional broth as needed. Cook approximately 30 minutes.
Saute mushrooms, peppers, and ham in olive oil. Add seasoning. Add white cooking wine. Add to risotto and cook.
Saute zucchini in olive oil. Add to risotto along with butter. Add late in process so it doesn't become mushy.
Continue to cook risotto, stir, and add liquid as needed. Total cook time is 60 to 75 minutes. You'll know it's done by the texture. It should be creamy. Remove before rice begins falling part becoming mushy.
Serve in large, flat plates. Grated cheese over dish to taste.
Optional: Try Italian sausage. Try other vegetables. Consider replacing some broth with white wine.
