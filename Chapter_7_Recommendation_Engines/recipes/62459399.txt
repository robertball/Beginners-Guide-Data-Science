Description: 
Our family pumpkin pie spice blend - we use this in all sorts of baked goods, pies, pumpkin butter... my mother always said mace is a must, one aunt said it was the allspice and another the cloves, so we use all three to keep everyone happy! Since mace, nutmeg and allspice are sort of in the same flavor family, you get three layers of nutmeg-ish flavor. Makes a nice jarred gift, too!
