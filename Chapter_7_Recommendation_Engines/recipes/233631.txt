Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup solid vegetable shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
2 eggs
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon baking soda
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups blackberries, drained
Icing:
3 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup evaporated milk
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat white sugar and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; add eggs and mix well. Mix cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture.
Whisk buttermilk and baking soda together in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until thoroughly mixed. Slowly stir flour into butter-buttermilk mixture until batter is smooth; fold in blackberries. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a serving plate.
Combine brown sugar, evaporated milk, and butter in a saucepan; cook and stir mixture over medium heat until a small amount of brown sugar mixture dropped into cold water forms a soft ball. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Beat by hand until icing is thick. Spread icing quickly over top and sides of cake.
