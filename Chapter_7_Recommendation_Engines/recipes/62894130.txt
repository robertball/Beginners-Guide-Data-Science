Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup oat bran
1 cup crisp rice cereal
1/2 cup chopped almonds
2 teaspoons apple pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons canola oil
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup liquid honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped dried apples

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine oats, flour, oat bran, cereal, almonds, apple pie spice and salt.
In a small sauce pan, combine oil, applesauce and honey. Heat over medium heat just to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer, stirring, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add vanilla extract. Pour over dry ingredients and stir to combine well.
Spread onto baking sheet, press down lightly with spatula and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and let sit until cool. Break into chunks, add dried apples and store, refrigerated, in an airtight container.
If you prefer a fine textured granola, don't press mixture down onto pan. Stir after 15 minutes of baking time and stir again upon removal from oven.
