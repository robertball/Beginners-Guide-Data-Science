Ingredients:

1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts, toasted

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, beat eggs until light and frothy. Mix in oil and sugar. Stir in zucchini and vanilla. Combine both flours, cinnamon, soda, baking powder, salt and nuts; stir into the egg mixture. Divide batter into prepared pans.

Description: 
Kristin is right, her mom's zucchini bread recipe is great!  We gave it a healthier spin by reducing the sugar, increasing the nuts, and adding a bit of buckwheat flour. Buckwheat flour is very nutritious: it contains the 8 amino acids, is high in lysine, and is a good source of B vitamins and iron - and it's gluten-free!Modified from: Zucchini Bread IV
