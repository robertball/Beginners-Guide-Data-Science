Zucchini Patties Recipe

Ingredients:
1/4 tsp pepper
2 Tablespoons sugar
1 cup Bisquick
1/4 cup cheese (shredded) or to taste
2 eggs (beaten)
2 cups squash (grated and excess water squeezed out)
1/2 an onion (grated)
2 cloves of garlic (chopped fine)

Directions:
Place the pepper, sugar, Bisquick, onion, garlic and cheese in a bowl and mix with the eggs. Take the grated squash and place in a kitchen towel.  Fold the long edges of the towel into the center and over the squash. Pick up the ends of the towel and twist together, over a sink to squeeze out the excess water in the grated squash. Add the squash to the Bisquick mixture and stir. It may seem very dry at first but there will still be some moisture in the squash that will eventually come out and start turning the mixture into a thick pancake batter. If after 5 minutes, you do not have a thick pancake batter consistency, add a tbs of milk to the mixture.  You may add more milk to the mixture until the batter is at the proper consistency.
Add 2 tbs of Canola oil to a frying pan. Drop the zucchini mixture into the oil by the tablespoon full.  The patties will spread out slightly to about a 2 to 3 inch diameter patty. Brown on one side then turn over and continue cooking until the other side is golden brown. Repeat this process until all of the batter is used.
You may serve these warm or at room temperature. I serve these with sour cream on the side or a sour cream based dip.

Description: 
These small zucchini pancakes are savory with a touch of sweet. My mother has been making these for us for years! They're light and cheesy and can be a main course, an appetizer or a side!
