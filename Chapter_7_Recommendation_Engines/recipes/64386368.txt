Ingredients:
4 c. graham cracker crumbs
1 c. melted margarine
1/4 c. sugar
1 - 16oz pkg. powdered sugar
4 - 8oz pkg. cream cheese
1 1/2 c. roughly chopped walnuts
2 large cans blueberry or cherry pie filling
1 - 16 oz. tub Cool Whip

Directions:
Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted margarine, and sugar together in a bowl. Mixture should resemble wet sand.
Pour mixture into a greased 9"x13" pan, pressing evenly to all four sides.
Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 minutes, until edges brown.
Let crust cool.
Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, cream the powdered sugar and room temperature cream cheese together until no lumps remain.
Spread over cooled crust.
Sprinkle walnuts over cream cheese mixture.
Top with pie filling.
Let chill in refrigerator for 12-24 hours for maximum flavor.

After I made a few changes to this recipe of Grandma's, her own son proclaimed it better than hers! It remains at the top of his favorite food list.
