Ingredients:
2 zucchini, peeled
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 sticks of Real butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut zucchini into 1/2 inch rounds.  Melt butter over medium heat until hot.  Mix flour, garlic powder, and salt and pepper together.  You can add any kind of spices you like.  I also use Old Bay seasoning.  Dip zucchini into the eggs and then into the flour mixture.  Fry until the top is brown and then turn over and fry on the other side.  When they are golden brown, place on paper towels to soak up the excess grease.
