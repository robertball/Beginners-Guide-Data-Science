Description: 
Pinto beans are slowly cooked to perfection with smoked bacon, jalapenos, and cilantro. This is an easy recipe I learned from my friend's grandmother in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. This recipe can be adjusted to taste and is a dietary staple in south Texas. Great for barbecues and potlucks! Make sure the beans are covered by liquid at all times. The longer you cook it, the better it is. Serve with flour tortillas or as a side dish in bowls.
