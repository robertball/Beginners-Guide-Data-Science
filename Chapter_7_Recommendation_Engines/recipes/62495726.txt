Ingredients:
1 lb (500g) mushrooms
1 tennis ball size onion, or smaller depending on personal tastes, chopped
1/4 cup (62.5g) butter or margarine
1/4 cup flour
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
4 cups (1 liter) milk
1/3 cup (125 ml) chicken broth or stock
1/4 cup good Sherry

Directions:
Chop mushrooms, including stems
Saute with onions in butter or margarine for ten minutes.
Blend flour, salt and pepper and cook until well blended.
Add milk and chicken stock while stirring constantly.
The final thickness of the soup will not be seen until mixture reaches a boil.
After it starts boiling, turn down and you may add a little more stock if the soup is too thick for your liking. Let the soup simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. Watch that it doesn't burn.
Just before serving add the Sherry and stir to blend.
