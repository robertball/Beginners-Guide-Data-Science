Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 cup wheat bran
1 1/2 teaspoons quick-rise instant yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup warm water (60 degrees F (15 degrees C))
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed, divided
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Combine 1 cup flour, wheat bran, yeast, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Add water and 1 teaspoon oil. Mix until combined. Add the remaining 1 cup flour; mix until a rough ball is formed. Coat your hands with flour and toss a small handful into the bowl to prevent sticking. Knead the dough until firm but smooth, about 8 minutes.
Preheat oven to 125 degrees F (52 degrees C).
Form dough into a ball. Coat dough and sides of the bowl with the remaining oil. Cover bowl with a clean, damp dish cloth; place in the warm oven until dough is doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Remove bowl from oven. Knead dough briefly. Roll into a ball; let rest for 10 minutes.
Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan.
Punch dough down; turn onto a floured surface. Roll out to the size of your pizza pan using a rolling pin. Transfer dough to the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
