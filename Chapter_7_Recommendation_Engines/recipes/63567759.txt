Ingredients:
1/2 Teaspoon of Salt
3 Cups of Flour
3 Eggs
2 teaspoons of Baking Powder
2 Cups of Milk
1/2 Cup of White Sugar
1 Cup of Crisco (More as needed)
Confectioner Sugar (Optional)
Honey (Optional)
Strawberries (Optional)
Cherries (Optional)
Apple Pie Filling (Optional)

Directions:
Get a deep skillet and use enough Crisco to have about an inch to 1 1/2 inch of Crisco in the skillet. Heat the Crisco to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
Mix together the salt, baking powder, white sugar, eggs, and milk into a large bowl. Use and hand mixer and slowly mix in the flour until all the flour is added and the mixture is smooth.
To make the funnel cakes I personally use a pancake squeeze bottle I bought at Walmart however you can use a plain old funnel (Preferable not one used on your automobile :) ) or any squeeze bottle that the tip is about a 1/2 inch wide or so. When making the funnel cakes start in the middle and spiral outwards. I have found that faster movement works best if your to slow you can have the center of your funnel cake too thick and it will get doughy or bread like. Use a pair of tongs to flip the funnel cake you want them lightly brown on each side about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes each side (longer if you like them more crispy)
Once cooked you can use a plate with some paper towels to absorb any extra oil on the funnel cake. You can top the funnel cakes with any or all of the optional ingredients above or make up your own toppings (I prefer plain old powdered sugar).
Finally eat... and enjoy :)
