Ingredients:
1 teaspoon coconut oil
2 (18 ounce) packages brownie mix with walnuts (such as Ghirardelli速)
2/3 cup unrefined coconut oil
1/2 cup water
2 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 (13 ounce) jar chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella速)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a large cast iron skillet with 1 teaspoon coconut oil.
Mix brownie mixes, 2/3 cup coconut oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl.
Combine cream cheese and chocolate-hazelnut spread in another bowl. Fold into the brownie mixture. Spread evenly in the cast iron skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, about 1 hour. Let cool in the skillet, about 20 minutes.
Run a knife around the skillet to release edges. Cover skillet with a large platter and flip brownies onto the platter. Let cool completely before cutting into squares, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
Came up with this recipe after a trip to Italy where I fell in love with Nutella速 and wanted to use it in everything! They're decadent and rich so one double batch goes a long way. Made them for a friend's dinner party and now every time I'm invited over their kids ask me to bring these!
