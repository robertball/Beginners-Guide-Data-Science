Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
1 3/4 cup + 2 tsp. cake flour
3/4 cup cocoa
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. sea salt
2 tsp. vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F
Grease and flour 2 nine inch round baking pans
(I also cut a circle of waxed paper and put in the bottom for perfect surfaces for frosting cake - and it never sticks)
Combine dry ingredients in mixing bowl - stir together well with a wooden spoon
Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla
Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes
Stir in boiling water - makes a thin batter
Pour into pans
Bake 30-35 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. (Watch it carefully so that sides do not brown)
Cool completely
I use the Perfect Chocolate Frosting to cover.
