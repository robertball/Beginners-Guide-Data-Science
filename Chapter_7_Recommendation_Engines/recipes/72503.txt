Ingredients:
½ cup honey
¼ cup maple syrup
5 tablespoons curry powder
4 tablespoons ground nutmeg
4 tablespoons paprika
3 tablespoons cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
1 (6 pound) whole chicken
3  apples, cored and diced
3  shallots
2 small onions
3 cups water
3 cups brown rice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the honey, maple syrup, curry powder, nutmeg, paprika, cayenne, and black peppercorns. Rub some of this mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin, and inside the cavity.  Stuff the shallots, onions, and pieces of one apple into the chicken's cavity. Coat the remaining apples with the spice mixture, and place in a roasting pan. Place the chicken in the pan, and pour brown rice around the outside. Pour the water over the rice, making sure that all of the rice is down in the water.
Bake uncovered for about 5 hours. The chicken juices should run clear, and rice should be tender.
