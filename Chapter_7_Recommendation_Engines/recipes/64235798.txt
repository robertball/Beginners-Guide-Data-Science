Ingredients:
1 box green jello (not sugarless) (not large box)
8 oz. softened cream cheese
1 can (not large can) of fruit cocktail, drained

Directions:
Prepare jello as directed on package.  Be sure to dissolve all the sugar.  Put in refrigerator until just beginning to set up.  Then mix in softened cream cheese (if the jello has set up too much, you may need to use a mixer to blend into the jello....it is better to put in the cream cheese when the jello is still too runny than after it has hardened)  Then put in the drained fruit cocktail and mix.  Then refrigerate until set.  You can also put chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts) in at this time if you want.
