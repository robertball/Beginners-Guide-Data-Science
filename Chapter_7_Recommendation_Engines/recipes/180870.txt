Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 pounds fresh broccoli, broken into florets
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup roasted cashews
1/4 red onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Cool bacon and crumble into pieces.
Whisk together the mayonnaise, cider vinegar, and sugar in a mixing bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Add the broccoli, raisins, cashews, onion, and crumbled bacon. Stir until evenly coated.  Cover and refrigerate the salad for at least 2 hours. Let stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This was on the table at a potluck cast party/Christmas party, and I hunted down the chef and begged her for the recipe. I'm not usually a nuts-in-nondesserts kind of person, but this stuff is amazing! Trust me, try it...
