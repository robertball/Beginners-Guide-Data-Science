Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup quinoa, uncooked
1 1/2 Tablespoon Italian Seasoning
6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in half
1/2 gluten free flour blend with xanthan
4 tbsp ground chia seeds
1 can light coconut milk
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella (4 oz)
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan
2 cups marinara sauce
1/2 up basil leaves, chiffonade

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degress F. Lightly oil baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.
In a large saucepan make quinoa. Boil 2 1/4 cup of water, mix in 1 1/2 cups of quinoa, turn heat down to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, stir in all of the Italian Seasoning and set aside.
Pat the chicken dry then season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour gluten free flour into a shallow dish (like a pie plate). In another shallow dish, combine the ground chia seeds with coconut milk. Use a whisk to eliminate all clumps.
Working in batches, coat the chicken in the flour, then transfer to the chia/coconut milk mixture and coat completely. Shake off excess liquid and then dredge the chicken through the quinoa and press quinoa to coat. Place the chicken on the prepared baking sheet.
When all are coated, place into oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Finally top with cheeses and marinara sauce and place back into oven until the cheese has melted (~5 minutes).
Garnish with basil and serve over cooked noodles with additional marina sauce.
