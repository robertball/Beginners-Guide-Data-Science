Ingredients:
1 medium onion, cut into chunks
1 small carrot, cut into chunks
4 clove garlic, peeled
2 oz fresh basil
? cup extra virgin olive oil
3½ quarts cold water
1 head escarole or other greens, cut into ½-inch shreds
1 bunch swiss chard, stems removed and leaves cut into ½-inch shreds
1 lb zucchini, cut into ½-inch pieces
2 parmesan rinds
2 tbsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 lb cheese tortellini or other pasta

Directions:
In the bowl of a food processor, combine the onion, carrot, garlic, and basil. Pulse until it forms a smooth paste, called a pestata.
Heat the olive oil in the soup pot over high heat and scrape the pestata into the pot. Cook, stirring until the pestata has released liquid and started to dry out a bit, about 5 minutes. Pour the cold water into the pot, scraping up the pestata from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer the broth, covered, for about 15 minutes. Stir in the greens, zucchini, parmesan rinds, and salt. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 25 minutes, and uncovered for 20 minutes. Add the tortellini in the last 10 minutes of cooking.
While soup cooks, make veggie balls if desired. Add a couple on top of each bowl of soup. (Recipe under appetizer folder.)
