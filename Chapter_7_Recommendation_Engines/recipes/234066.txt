Ingredients:
21 ounces zucchini, sliced
2 onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 cups water, divided
salt to taste
1 bunch chives, chopped

Directions:
Combine zucchini, onions, garlic, and 2 tablespoons water in a non-stick pan over medium heat; cook until zucchini are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
Pour zucchini mixture into a food processor no more than half full. Cover and pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Season soup with salt and garnish with chives.
