Ingredients:
1 bunch of broccoli rabe
2 cups chicken broth
4 links hot Italian sausage (about the size of a regular hot dog)
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 garlic cloves
1 dash crushed red pepper
salt and pepper to taste
optional - grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Boil the broccoli rabe in 2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup water until nearly tender.  Drain and set aside.
Remove sausage casings and crumble the meat.  In a skillet, heat 1 tbsp of the olive oil.  Add the sausage and cook over med-high heat, breaking it up into small pieces, until browned. Add the garlic and cook for 1 min.  Add the broccoli rabe, 1 tbsp olive oil, red pepper, salt, and pepper to the pan.  Cook until broccoli rabe is tender.  Serve with grated parmesan if desired.

Description: 
This recipe has been in my family for a long time.  It works really great as a side dish or as a main dish if served with pasta.  The chicken broth takes a lot of the bitterness out of the broccoli rabe.
