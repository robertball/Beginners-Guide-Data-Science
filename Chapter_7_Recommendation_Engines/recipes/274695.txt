Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup sweet sorghum flour
1 cup brown rice flour
1 cup potato starch
3/4 cup tapioca starch
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
2 large eggs
2 large egg whites
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon sweet sorghum flour
2 tablespoons evaporated cane juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
Whisk together 1 cup sorghum flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, baking powder, xanthan gum, baking soda, and kosher salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center.
Whisk together buttermilk, sugar, canola oil, eggs, egg whites, and lemon zest in a medium bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture into the well of the flour mixture and stir to combine batter; do not overmix.
Toss blueberries with 1 tablespoon sorghum flour in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Fold all but 1/2 cup blueberries into batter. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup blueberries. Sprinkle cane juice on top of the blueberries.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is browned on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 70 to 75 minutes.
Let cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then unmold (remove the outer ring) and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
