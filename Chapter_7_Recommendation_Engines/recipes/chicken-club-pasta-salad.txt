Ingredients:
8 ounces corkscrew-shaped pasta
3/4 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 cups chopped, cooked rotisserie chicken
12 slices crispy cooked bacon, crumbled
1 cup cubed Muenster cheese
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Whisk Italian-style dressing and mayonnaise together in a large bowl. Stir pasta, chicken, bacon, Muenster cheese, celery, green bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, and avocado into dressing until evenly coated.
