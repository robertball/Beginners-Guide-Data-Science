Ingredients:
2 tyson chicken patties cut in half lengthwise
4 pieces sliced Italian bread (sliced like regular bread)
1 cup prepared pizza / marinara sauce
6 slices thin provolone cheese
Prepared garlic spread
Garlic salt
Basil
2 tbsp shredded parmesan or mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook chicken in oven as directed on package (I cooked mine a little longer so it would remain crisp after covered in sauce and cheese).
Remove from oven and cut lengthwise in half so you can overlap them to cover entire bread.
Butter 1 side of each bread with prepared garlic spread.
Mix together about 1 cup of pizza sauce with garlic salt and basil to taste.  Heat in microwave until warm.
Build sandwich:  1 bread (butter side down), 2 thin slices of provolone, 1 tbsp pizza sauce, 2 halves chicken patty staggered to cover bread, 2 tbsp pizza sauce, 1 thin slice provolone, 1 bread (butter side up).
Grill as you would grill grilled cheese normally on low to med heat to allow cheeses to melt.
Sprinkle parmesan/mozzarella cheese on remaining warm sauce and serve on side for dipping.

Description: 
Wanted to eat a chicken parmesan sub but didn't feel like spending the time cooking and breading chicken so opted to cut corners using frozen chicken patties and pre-prepared ingredients to make my life easier.  Picked up the sub rolls and couldn't justify eating that many calories so opted instead for sliced italian bread and thin sliced cheese.  Turned out so surprisingly good, I thought I'd share.  Enjoy!
