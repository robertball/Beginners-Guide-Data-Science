Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2/3 cup diced cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese
2 leaves fresh basil, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 thick slices crusty bread
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup ricotta cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. When cool enough to handle, crumble and set aside.
Combine cherry tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, basil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
Heat a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush bread slices with olive oil on both sides. Cook in grill pan  until grill marks appear and bread is toasted, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Spread toasted bread with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato mixture and sprinkle with bacon. Cut each toast in half and serve.

Description: 
Toast isn't just for breakfast anymore. Eat this creamy and flavorful toast any time of day! Use a thick-cut crusty bread like sourdough so it can stand up to the toppings. If you prefer a smoother consistency, blend the ricotta in a food processor before using.
