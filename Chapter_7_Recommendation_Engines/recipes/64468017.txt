Ingredients:
1 overripe banana
2 T creamy peanut butter
12 Dandie's vegan marshmallows
1 cup Fruity Pebbles cereal

Directions:
With a fork mush up the banana and peanut butter in a bowl until they have the consistency of porridge, this is your batter. Place the Fruity Pebbles in a ziplock bag and pulverize them. Now you will dip each marshmallow in the batter and then again in the Fruity Pebbles mix. Make sure to fully cover the marshmallow then place them on a plate. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. Enjoy!!
