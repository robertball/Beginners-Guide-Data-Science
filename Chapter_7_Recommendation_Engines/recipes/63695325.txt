Ingredients:
2 butternut squash, peeled and cubed into 3/4" cubes (around 8 cups)
2 green bell peppers, cut into large chunks
1 cup sweet bell peppers cut into large chunks
4 large cloves garlic, minced (1 heaping tablespoon)
4 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp mild curry powder
Â¼ tsp white pepper
1 tsp sea salt
2 cups black or brown rice
4 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Bring rice and water (with a large pinch of salt) to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes (longer for brown rice) or until water is absorbed.
Combine squash, peppers, garlic, oil, curry powder, pepper and salt into a large bowl and thoroughly combine.
Pour squash mixture onto a parchment lined baking sheet and distribute evenly.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.  Stir. Return to oven and cook for 10 more minutes. Stir again and cook another 5 minutes or until squash is tender.
Serve squash over rice.

Description: 
This is a very basic curried squash recipe that is delicious on its own, but can be tweaked to meet your individual needs.  The black rice was definitely an interesting change, and can be subbed with brown or white rice if desired.
