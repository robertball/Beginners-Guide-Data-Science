Ingredients:
4 egg whites
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar (actually a bit more, so don't level the cup)
2 cups quartered walnuts
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 F (150 C) and cover 2 baking sheets with baking paper.
Beat together the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar 1 teaspoon at a time while continuing to beat at high speed. Then add vanilla extract. The egg whites won't stay firm, but that's OK.
Fold walnuts into the egg mixture with a spatula. Drop mixture by the teaspoonful onto the prepared sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart.
Bake in preheated oven for about 20 - 25 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheet, then carefully remove from baking sheet and store cold cookies in a tight fitting container.

Description: 
In Germany we call these cookies macaroons but it's closer to a meringue in consistency. They melt in your mouth and I bake them every year - if your walnuts are very large, you can cut them up up even smaller.
