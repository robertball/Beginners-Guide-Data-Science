Description: 
This is my basic Pico De Gallo recipe I use anytime I make any type of tacos or Mexican dips. It could be used as a dip itself but I love to use it on tacos and add it to guacamole or a cheese dip. It's fresh, full of flavor and healthy! The ingredents can be changed to suit your personal taste.
