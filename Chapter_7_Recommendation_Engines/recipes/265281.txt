Ingredients:
1 tablespoon avocado oil
1 large onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 (1 pound) packages cubed beef stew meat, frozen
5 large baking potato, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
6 medium carrots, sliced
3 celery ribs, sliced
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Turn on a multi-cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat oil for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Pour in red wine and continue cooking until wine has reduced by 1/2, about 3 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, parsley, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Add tomato paste and stir. Place frozen meat on top. Add potatoes, carrots, and celery.
Close and lock the lid. Close the vent. Select Meat/Stew button according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 45 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully move the vent to release remaining pressure using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
Unlock and remove the lid. Mix water and cornstarch in a small bowl and slowly pour into the pot. Select the Saute function and cook until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
