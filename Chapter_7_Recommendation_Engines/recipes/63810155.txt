Ingredients:
Biga
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (5 ounces)
1/8 tsp yeast
1/2 cup water (4 ounces), at room temperature
BIGA: Mix flour, yeast, & water in med bowl & stir w/wooden spoon apx 1 minute. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap & let stand at room temperature (apx 70 degrees) overnight (min 8 hrs & up to 24 hours)
Dough
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (10 ounces)
1/2 teaspoon yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons table salt
3/4 cup water (6 ounces), at room temperature
1/4 cup milk (2 ounces), at room temperature (see note)

Directions:
DOUGH: Place biga & dough ingredients in bowl of stand mixer fitted w/paddle. Mix on lowest speed until roughly combined & shaggy dough forms apx 1 min; scrape down sides & continue mixing on medium-low until dough becomes uniform mass that collects on paddle & pulls away from sides of bowl, 4 to 6 minutes. Change to dough hook & knead bread on medium until smooth & shiny (dough will be very sticky), apx 10 min. Transfer dough to large bowl, cover w/wrap & let rise at room temp apx 1 hour.
Spray rubber spatula w/nonstick spray; fold partially risen dough by gently lifting & folding edge of dough toward middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl & fold dough 6 more times (total 8). Cover w/plastic wrap & rise 30 minutes. Repeat folding, replace plastic wrap, & let rise until doubled apx 30 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, oven rack to lower-middle position, place baking stone on rack, & heat oven to 450 for 30 minutes before baking
Cut 2 12x6 pieces of parchment paper & dust w/flour. Set aside. Transfer dough to floured counter, being careful not to deflate completely. Flour top of dough and divide in half. With well-floured hands, press dough into rough 12x6 inch shape. Fold shorter sides of dough to center, overlapping them like business letter to form 7x4-inch loaf. Repeat with second dough piece. Gently transfer each loaf seam-side down to parchment sheets, dust with flour, and cover with plastic wrap. Let loaves rest at room temp for 30 minutes (surfaces of loaves will develop small bubbles).
Using floured fingertips, evenly poke entire surface of each loaf to form 10x6 rectangle; spray with water. Slide parchment with loaves onto baking stone. Bake, (spraying w/water 2x in 1st 5 min) 22-27 minutes (210 int)
