Description: 
We love teriaki chicken, but my husband doesnt like the sweetness.  I came up with this recipe that pleases everyone in the family, but still satisfies our desire for an asian-inspired sticky, fall of the bone chicken dish!  The sauce is blended in a blender and the chicken stays in the same pan from start to finih so cleanup is a snap!
