Ingredients:
1 cup canned pure pumpkin (like the kind by Libby's)
1/4 cup brown sugar (not packed)
2 tbsp. granulated white sugar
2 tbsp. light whipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown)
2 tbsp. fat-free liquid egg substitute (like Egg Beaters Original)
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
3/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/8 tsp. salt
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1/4 cup raisins (not packed), chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine pumpkin, brown sugar, white sugar, butter, egg substitute, and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly with a wire whisk or fork.
Add flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt, and thoroughly stir until smooth. Add oats and chopped raisins (make sure raisins don't stick together), and stir until evenly dispersed. Spoon batter onto the baking sheet in 8 evenly spaced mounds. Use the back of a spoon to spread and flatten batter into circles about 3 inches wide.
Bake in the oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a "softie" comes out clean, 12 - 15 minutes. Allow to cool and then enjoy!
