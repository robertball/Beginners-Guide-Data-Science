Ingredients:
2 cups plain yogurt
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 bay leaf
3 1/2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of fat, and cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons olive oil
8 (8 inch) pita bread rounds
2 tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 onion, thinly sliced
1/2 bunch fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Whisk together the yogurt, vinegar, 1/4 cup of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, oregano, and bay leaf in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the thinly sliced lamb, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the meat and marinade, and cook until the lamb is no longer pink, and is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently as the meat cooks. Divide the cooked lamb meat among the warmed pita breads, and garnish with tomatoes, onion, and fresh mint leaves to serve.

Description: 
Lamb marinated with yogurt, lemon juices, garlic and seasonings is cooked quickly in a skillet. These sandwiches are a delight for all the senses. The lamb can be served over rice instead of being made into sandwiches. This marinade also works well with beef.
