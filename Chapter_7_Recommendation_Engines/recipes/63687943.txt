Description: 
a great breakfast for being on the go.  I make these ahead of time and we can do an easy grab and go in the morning.  Best part - no carbs;  gluten free!  We love warm so we use New Mexico green chile and sometimes I add a bit of cooked Italian sausage depending on how much time I have in the kitchen.
