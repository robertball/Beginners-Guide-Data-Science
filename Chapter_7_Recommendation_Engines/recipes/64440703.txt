Ingredients:
4 pork chops, fat trimmed
1 tbsp oil (olive, coconut, butter, ghee)

1 tsp sage
1 tsp basil

Directions:
Heat a large, heavy pan on high until warm.
Add oil and heat until shimmery (but NOT burning/smoking) about 20 seconds.

Reduce heat to medium-low, add onions.
Stir onions and flip pork chops after 2 minutes on each side.
Add tomatoes, garlic and spices.
Simmer until tomatoes are soft and sauce has set up- about 5-8 minutes.
