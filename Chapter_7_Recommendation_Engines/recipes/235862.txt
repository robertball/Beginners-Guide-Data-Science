Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 (49.5 fluid ounce) can chicken broth
1 (29 ounce) can hominy, undrained
4 cooked skinless, boneless chicken thighs, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice
1 (14.5 ounce) can water
6 green onions, sliced
1 lime, juiced, or to taste
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat; stir cumin and paprika into hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broth, hominy, chicken, diced tomatoes and juice, water, green onions, lime juice, and hot sauce to seasoned oil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes. Garnish soup with cilantro just before serving.

Description: 
This is how you eat soup when it's hot outside. I like to season the chicken with chili powder and cumin, then toss them in the turbo broiler.
