Title:
BBQ'd Democrats and Republicans (Meatballs and Mini-Wieners) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1/2 lb ground beef
1/2 lb ground pork
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp allspice, ground
1/3 cup bread crumbs
2 tbs oil or butter
1 16 oz package mini-wieners (Republicans)
1 large bottle BBQ sauce

Directions:
To make the meatballs (Democrats) combine the beef and pork, worcestershire sauce, egg, onion powder, garlic powder, allspice, and bread crumbs in a bowl. Mix well. If the mixture is too wet, add some bread crumbs.
Roll the meat mixture into ball about the size of a large cherry tomato, but no larger than one inch in diameter.
Fry the meatballs in a bit of oil or butter, turning them to brown on all sides. (How I long to do this!)
Remove the Democrats from the pan and put them in a crockpot.
Open the bag of Republicans (mini-wieners) and add them to the crockpot.
Empty the bottle of BBQ sauce into the crockpot and stir to combine. Turn on the crockpot and heat the Democrats and Republicans on low heat.
Now comes the fun part. Your guests can ladle out the meatballs and wieners onto a plate and stick toothpicks in Democrats and Republicans. Something I have wanted to do for a number of years.

Description: 
This is a renamed classic appetizer of BBQ'd meatballs and mini-wieners. I think it's more fun to stick pointy objects into politicians than meatballs and wieners. Does this promote violence against politicians? Who cares? They commit violence against the citizenry all the time.
