Annalise, Completely Delicious
These classic white dinner rolls are a must at family gatherings and holiday dinners. They are soft and light with just a hint of sweetness. They are of course wonderful slathered with butter, but are also great for dipping in soups and mopping up gravy.

Prep Time: 30 minutes
Cook Time: 20 minutes
Total Time: 50 minutes
Yield: 12 dinner rolls
Ingredients
3/4 cup whole milk
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1/4 cup honey
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active-dry yeast
1 teaspoon coarse salt
2 large eggs
1 large egg + 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash
Additional butter, for brushing
Directions
In small saucepan over medium heat, heat milk, butter and honey just until butter is melted. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes (temperature should be 120-140 degrees F).
Meanwhile, in stand mixer fitted with dough hook, combine 1 1/2 cups four, salt and yeast. Add milk mixture and mix until incorporated. Add eggs and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes.
Add remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until dough clears the bowl but is still slightly sticky to the touch. You may not need all of the flour, or you may find you need a bit more. Knead with dough hook until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes.
Shape dough into ball and place in buttered bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and put in warm place to rise until doubled in size, about one hour.
Punch down dough and divide into 12 equal pieces. Shape into rounds and place in buttered 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again until an indentation remains when lightly pressed with your finger, about 30-45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Brush tops of rolls
