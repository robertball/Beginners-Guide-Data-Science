Ingredients:
2/3 cup creamy peanut butter
1/3 cup corn syrup (such as Karo®)
3 cups crushed sugar-frosted corn flake cereal (such as Frosted Flakes®)
1/2 gallon coffee ice cream, softened
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Combine peanut butter and corn syrup in a bowl; heat in microwave until it can easily be stirred into a smooth mixture, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir crushed cereal into the peanut butter mixture; spread into a pie plate to make a crust.
Spoon softened ice cream over the crust and smooth into a flat layer. Drizzle chocolate syrup over the ice cream layer.
Put pie in freezer and freeze until firm in the center, at least 30 minutes.
