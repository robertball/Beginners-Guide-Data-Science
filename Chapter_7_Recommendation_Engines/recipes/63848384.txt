Ingredients:
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup jarred aji paste or 3-4 aji peppers, seeds removed and chopped
2 cloves garlic, mashed
2 cups queso fresco shredded (I have often used mozerella instead)
4 saltine crackers
3/4 cups evaporated milk (or whole milk)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Saut√© onions, aji and garlic in vegetable oil until onions have softened. The mixture should be a bright yellow color.
Place onion mixture in blender, or food processor add milk and blend.
Add cheese and crackers slowly and blend until smooth. Add more milk for thinner or more crackers for thinner sauce. The sauce should be the consistency of a thick yoghurt.
Season with salt and pepper.
Serve at room temperature or cold over boiled potatoes and top with sliced boiled eggs and kalamata olive, dust with paprika (to rocoto if you have some)
