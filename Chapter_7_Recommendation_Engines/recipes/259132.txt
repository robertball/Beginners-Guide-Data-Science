Ingredients:
2/3 cup milk
3 eggs at room temperature
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, packed

1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons clarified butter
1/2 Meyer lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Preheat a cast iron skillet over high heat.
Blend milk, eggs, flour, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, salt, vanilla extract, cloves, and nutmeg together in a blender until batter is smooth.
Melt clarified butter in the preheated skillet; pour in batter.
Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until golden brown and puffed up to your liking, 20 to 25 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
