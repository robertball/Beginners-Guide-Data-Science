Ingredients:
1 cup wheat grains
1 cup kale, finely chopped
3 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup oil
-Popcorn popper
-Non-stick cooling rack

Directions:
Pour the wheat grains and oil into the popcorn popper.
Turn the popper on and allow it to run until the wheat pops (it will smell similar to baking bread.)
Remove the wheat puffs and place on non-stick cooling rack (you may want to place a large roasting pan underneath the rack to catch drippings.)
While still slightly hot, sprinkle chopped kale and sugar over puffed wheat.
Let cool and enjoy!

Description: 
A wonderfully healthy snack for the kids! Also makes a great dish to bring to parties. Just keep away from wild Osrics. They're sensitive to sugar and can become very excitable when they see these delicious treats!
