Ingredients:
3 28 oz. cans Tuttorosso Italian Style Peeled Plum Shaped Tomatoes in tomato juice
1 6 oz. can tomato paste
1/4 cup olive oil
5 cloves garlic, peeled & sliced paper thin
2 tbsp. oregano
1 handfull fresh, unchopped basil (about 10-15 leaves)
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp water
8 links hot italian sausage, cut in half
1 c. chianti wine (optional)
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large frying pan to med/high heat, and add the 1 tbsp of water.
Add hot sausage and cook for about 15 min., or until brown on all sides, leaving the center slightly pink.
Set aside on a paper towel to drain excess grease.
In a large sauce pan, heat the olive oil on medium heat. Add the garlic & simmer about 5 minutes, careful not to brown the garlic.
Add 3 cans of tomatoes & crush using a masher until tomatoes are evenly broken up, but sauce is still chunky.
Add paste and spices.
Stir until evenly blended.
Add hot sausage & bring the sauce to a low simmer.
Stirring occasionally, cook sauce covered for 4 hours.
If desired, add the wine 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This sauce has been in my family for over 75 years! It is a traditional sauce that can be easily altered by the addition/subtraction of wine or meat, and still taste amazing. This is to be used with pasta, and I recommend thin spaghetti or penne.
