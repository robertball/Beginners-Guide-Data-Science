Ingredients:
1 package frozen puff pastry
2 Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage links
1 cup tomato-based pasta sauce
2 packages Mozzarella String Cheese, cut cross-wise into tiny circles
1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
Italian Seasoning, to garnish/season

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees farenheit.
Remove Italian sausage from casings. Crumble and cook. Drain liquid and set aside.
Unfold one sheet of un-thawed puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface. Cut into one-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.
Place rounds on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Grease the bottom of a glass baking dish and place on top of the pastry rounds. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on a different cookie sheet.
Top each round with one teaspoon of heated pasta sauce, three tiny rounds of mozzarella, a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and Italian sausage.
Pop them back into the oven for a few minutes, until the cheese melts.
Season/garnish with Italian seasoning. Serve.
