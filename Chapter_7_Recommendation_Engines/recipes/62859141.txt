2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium green bell pepper, finely diced
4 cups cooked or canned pinto beans (1.5c raw or 2 cans)

1/4 cup chopped mild green chilies, fresh or canned

Heat the oil in a soup pot.  Add the onion and saute over medium heat until translucent.  Add the garlic and bell pepper and continue to saute, stirring frequently, until all are golden.
Add the remaining ingredients, except the garnishes, plus the cooked grain and 3 cups water.  Bring to a rapid simmer, then lower the heat.  Cover and simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes, then remove from the heat.
Assemble each serving as follows.  Fill each bowl about 2/3 full of soup.  Top with some grated cheese, lettuce and diced tomatoes.  Line the perimeter of each bowl with several tortilla chips.
