Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 c. milk
1 1/3 c. flour
pinch of salt
2/3 stick of melted butter
1 1/2 t. sugar

Directions:
In medium mixing bowl, beat eggs and add milk.
Using a wire whisk or a whisk attachment to your hand mixer, add flour gradually.
Add melted butter, salt, and sugar, mix well.
Let batter rest about 15 minutes.
Heat a skillet to medium to medium low setting. Coat lightly with non-stick spray.
Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter in to the hot pan while swirling pan to spread out the batter into a circle. Cook until it starts forming large bubbles and gets a little translucent.
Flip gently to cook the other side a few seconds.
You can either roll the crepes up with a spatula or slide them flat on a serving platter, depending on what you intend to serve with them.

Description: 
These Swedish crepes are a LOOOONG standing tradition on my mother's side of the family. Great with either sweet fillings or savory. Try it with my husband's Mock Bananas Foster sauce and real whipped cream. Sigh. I think I gained a pound just thinking about it.
