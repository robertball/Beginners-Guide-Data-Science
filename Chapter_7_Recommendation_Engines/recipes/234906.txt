Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 large yellow onion, peeled and chopped
4 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
1 small head green cabbage, cored and chopped
1/2 bunch celery, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
3 tablespoons ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
water, as needed

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer beef and onion to an 8-quart stock pot.
Pour beef broth into the pot. Stir cabbage, celery, kidney beans, pinto beans, garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes, cumin, salt, and pepper into the broth. Add water as needed to assure ingredients are completely submerged in liquid. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the cabbage wilts and the celery is tender, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a nutritious and hearty soup; it feeds a crowd, smells and tastes wonderful on a chilly day, makes great leftovers, and freezes well. The ingredients are easy to keep on hand, and it's pretty quick to throw together. It even tastes better the next day! Serve with crusty bread or cheddar biscuits.
