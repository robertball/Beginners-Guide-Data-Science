1 small red bell pepper, chopped

Place green and red bell peppers, tomato, mushrooms, olives, and pepperoni in the bowl of pasta.
Whisk mayonnaise, Italian dressing, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over pasta mixture and toss to coat evenly. Top with mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Refrigerate at least 1 hour to chill before serving.
