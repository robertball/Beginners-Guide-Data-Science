Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 large onion, diced
2 apples - peeled, cored, and diced
2 (6 ounce) boxes dry stuffing mix
2 1/2 cups boiling water, or more if needed
1 pound bulk pork sausage

Directions:
Heat butter in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir onion until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add apples to onion and cook until onion and apples are tender, 5 to 10 minutes more.
Mix stuffing mix and boiling water together in a bowl. Cover bowl and let sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add more water if stuffing is too dry.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix sausage and onion-apple mixture together with the stuffing.
