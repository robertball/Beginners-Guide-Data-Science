Description: 
An awesome dish to serve for any occasion, that's also easy to prepare. I have been cooking professionally for 9 years and in many different places, and this dish 'took off' every place that I tried it! Can be served over rice or capellini pasta (I prefer pasta) with your favorite mixed vegetables.
