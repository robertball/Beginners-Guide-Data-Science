Ingredients:
CARAMELS
1 cup butter
2 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
CHOCOLATE
1 pound milk chocolate
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Grease an 8 x 8 inch square pan.
In a heavy 4 quart saucepan melt butter over medium heat; add brown sugar, corn syrup and milk.  Stirring constantly, heat to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.  Pour into prepared pan.
When caramel has cooled and set, cut into 1 inch squares.  Chill in refrigerator until firm.
Melt chocolate with 1 tablespoon butter in the top of a double boiler or in a bowl in the microwave. Stir until smooth.
Dip caramel squares in chocolate and place on wax paper to cool.
