Ingredients:
1 bag of oreo cookies
1 or 2 bags (depending on how much dip you want) of chocolate chips or vanilla flavored melts, or try peanut butter chips or mint --have fun experimenting

Directions:
melt the chocolate chips or dip usually 2-3 minutes in the microwave stirring occasionally
dip each cookie one at a time a quarter to half way in the dip, shake excess off, then lay out on tin foil
let cool 15-20 minutes on tinfoil -- will pop right off when cooled completely
put in airtight container until serving to prevent the rest of cookie from going stale
enjoy

Description: 
I made these delicious dipped oreos for a snow party I had, they looked liked they were dipped in snow.  And these have just the right ammount of chocolate dip for much cheaper then buying them from the store, which are only available in winter.
