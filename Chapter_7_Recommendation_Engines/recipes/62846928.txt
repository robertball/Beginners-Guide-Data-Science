Ingredients:
1 cup of cultured buttermilk;
1 teaspoon baking soda;
1, 5 cups of self-rising flour;
1 egg;
Pinch of salt.
Filling: anything you want /have in your kitchen, refrigerator
(BTW it’s not as good with sweet filling: fruit or berries. I don’t know why)

Directions:
Mix buttermilk, baking soda, egg and salt. Add flour. Mix very well. There should be no flour balls (when the flour isn’t mixed properly). You should be able to pour the batter into the baking dish (it should be liquid, same consistency as my apricot and apple pie batter).
Preheat you oven at 350F. Put a baking dish inside for 5 min. Take it out, grease the dish with butter, so that your pie wouldn’t stick. Pour the batter into your baking dish; add your filling on top. I used: braised cabbage and 2 boiled eggs. When it was almost ready (2-5 min before taking it out) I added tomato and lemon basil.
Set to bake for 15-20 min. (or when ready, depends on the oven)
When the pie is ready it should have golden grown crust.
Enjoy!
The pie is good warm and cold!
