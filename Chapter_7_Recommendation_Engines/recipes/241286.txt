Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound ground turkey
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir ground turkey and garlic in hot oil until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour beef broth over browned turkey mixture, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 20 minutes.
Stir crushed tomatoes, onion, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes and green chiles with the turkey mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until thick, about 1 hour.
Stir black beans into the chili; cook until the beans are heated through, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Created from memory of a recipe I once used, this is the best chili I've ever made. It makes a hearty, healthy, and flavorful chili. Difficult to tell that beef was not used. Top as desired with cheese, sour cream, jalapenos, etc.
