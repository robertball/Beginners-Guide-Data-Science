Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 onion, sliced
1 cup kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
4 white mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoons prepared pesto
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Place squash skin side down on prepared baking sheet. Bake until cooked through, about 1 hour. Remove from oven; cool for 10 minutes. Once squash is cool enough to handle, scrape flesh into string-like strands with a fork. Place in a bowl and set aside.
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion begins to turn translucent. Stir in kale and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium low.
Stir in squash, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes; cook for 2 minutes. Remove from stove and place squash mixture in a large bowl.
Stir olive oil and pesto into the squash mixture. Slowly add grated Parmesan cheese, stirring until evenly mixed.

Description: 
When making this meal for the first time, I wanted to use items I would normally incorporate with pasta, such as pesto and mushrooms. Combining all of these things together creates a wonderful dish that most people would enjoy; I know I did! Serve with some garlic bread and mashed potatoes. Enjoy!
