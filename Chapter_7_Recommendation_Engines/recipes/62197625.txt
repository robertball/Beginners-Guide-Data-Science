Ingredients:
1/4 cup lard
1/2 cup diced onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
2 cups hot water

Directions:
Melt the lard in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat; when the lard is hot, add the onions, garlic, and beans. Stir constantly while cooking until the beans reach a paste-like consistency, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low and stir in the 1/2 cup water at a time, repeating after all the water is absorbed. Simmer and stir until the beans cook down to your desired consistency, about 15 to 20 minutes.
