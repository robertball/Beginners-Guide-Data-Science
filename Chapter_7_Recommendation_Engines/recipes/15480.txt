Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon coconut extract
2 tablespoons milk
3 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream  the shortening with the brown sugar and white sugar. Stir in the eggs, coconut extract and milk. Then mix in the sifted dry ingredients. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop cookie dough from a spoon in golf ball sized portions onto an unprepared cookie sheet. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be slightly brown at the edges. Allow cookies to cool for a couple of minutes on the baking sheets before removing to cool completely on wire racks.
