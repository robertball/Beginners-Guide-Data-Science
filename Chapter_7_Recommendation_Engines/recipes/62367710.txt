Ingredients:
1 lb ground deer meat or lean ground beef
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp tumeric
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp cayenne
6 cloves garlic
1 fresh hot pepper (jalepenos are what I usually use)
2 large sweet onions, quartered
3 stalks celery, cut into 3 " lengths
1 red bell pepper, quartered
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp allspice
1/2 tsp nutmeg
2 tbsp soy sauce
1/2 cup corn meal
1 tbsp flour
salt to taste

Directions:
Place deer meat, paprika, tumeric, cumin and cayenne in a large sauce pan and brown.  If needed add a little bit of water at a time to prevent sticking.  Break up the meat by stirring until there are no pink spots left.  Drain off any excess liquid.
Combine garlic and hot peppers in a food processor, pulse until minced in texture.  Add onion, celery, and red pepper and process on high until pureed.
Add pureed mixture and remaining ingredients to the browned meat and stir thoroughly.  Reduce heat and simmer for 8 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool at room temperature before using as filling for your favorite patty pastry dough.

Description: 
These are a family favorite.  If you like things a little on the spicy side feel free to add some habenero peppers to make these more authentic.  If, however, you are not a fan of spicy food omit the hot peppers and cayenne
