Ingredients:
3/4 - 1 cup Magpie's Barbecue Sauce, or tangy barbecue sauce of your choosing
1/2 can pineapple chunks with juice, undrained
1 lb. boneless pork loin chops

Directions:
Mix the barbecue sauce and pineapple in a bowl.
Place the pork chops in a plastic freezer bag and pour in the barbecue sauce mixture.  Seal the bag and mush it around so the chops lay flat but are surrounded on all sides by the barbecue mixture.  Freeze.
To prepare, thaw the  bag with the chops.  Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat (no additional oil is required).  Add the chops and brown each side for about 4 minutes apiece.
Remove chops to a warm platter and pour the rest of the sauce from the freezer bag into the pan.  Heat the sauce through over medium heat and reduce it by about a third, until it's nice and thick.  Pour sauce over warm chops and serve immediately.
