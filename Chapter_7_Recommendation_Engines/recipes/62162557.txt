Ingredients:
2 Very Ripe Bananas, Mashed
3 1/2 Cups Flour
1 1/3 Cups White Sugar
1 Tablespoon Vanilla Extract
2 Teaspoons Baking Powder
1 1/2 Cups Water
Oil, for cooking

Directions:
Mash 2 very ripe bananas.
In a separate bowl combine Flour, Sugar and Baking Powder.
Fold mashed bananas into the dry ingredient bowl.
Add vanilla extract followed by water.
Stir until everything is completely incorporated.
Fill a saucepan about 1/4 of the way with oil, or at least enough oil so that panikekes will not touch the bottom.
Heat the oil over a medium high heat.
When the oil is ready take a big spoonful of the mixture and drop it into the hot oil. (I suggest using two spoons and doing a sort of push off method due to the stickyness of the mix)
The mix should float up to the top, when it has turned golden brown flip it over and cook the other side.
When both sides are golden brown take the panikeke out and place it on a paper lined plate.
Serve warm
*Topping Suggestions* Although very good plain these panikekes go really well with jams, butter, nutella, powdered sugar and even ice cream.
~Enjoy!~

Description: 
My brothers and I used to eat this when we were younger. They're a lot like doughnuts but with the added fun of topping them with your favorite toppings. After a while of not having these I started making them on my own for my family and I enjoy them as much as I did back then today!
