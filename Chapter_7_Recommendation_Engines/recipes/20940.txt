Ingredients:
2 quarts oil for frying
4 eggs
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 zucchini, quartered
3/4 cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan or deep fryer, preheat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a blender, mix the eggs, whipped cream, pepper and salt. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl.
Slice the zucchini into pieces 2 to 3 inches long. Dip the pieces into the egg mixture, then coat them with the bread crumbs.
Carefully place the battered pieces in the oil and fry 3 to 4 minutes, until brown and crispy. Drain fried pieces on a paper towel. Repeat until all the slices have been fried.
