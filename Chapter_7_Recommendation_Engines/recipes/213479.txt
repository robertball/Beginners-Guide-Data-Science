1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
8 ounces sour cream
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
8 ounces frozen mixed vegetables

1 1/2 pounds leftover meatloaf, sliced

Add the tater tots and stir until they are coated with the mixture. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Press the meatloaf slices into the top of the tater tot mixture.
Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes; sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the top, and bake 35 minutes until the cheese browns. Remove from the oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a versatile recipe designed to use up leftover meatloaf in a tasty one-dish meal.  Frozen tater tots, onions and vegetables are coated in a sour cream/condensed soup sauce with meatloaf pieces pressed into the surface. A cheese topping keeps the meatloaf moist during cooking and adds crispness, but ketchup or french-fried onions could also be used.
