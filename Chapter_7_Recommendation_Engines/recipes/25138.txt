Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
4 egg yolks
4 egg whites
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons margarine
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 cup whipped cream
1 recipe  Raspberry Sauce
1 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 . Grease bottom and side of springform pan, 8x2 1/2 inches, or round pan, 9x1 1/2 inches. Melt 1 package chocolate chips and 1/2 cup margarine in 2-quart heavy saucepan over medium heat; cool 5 minutes. Stir in flour until smooth. Stir in egg yolks until well blended.
Beat egg whites in large bowl with electric mixer on high speed until foamy. Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until soft peaks form. Gently stir chocolate mixture into egg whites. Spread in pan.
Bake springform pan 35 to 40 minutes, round pan 30 to 35 minutes (top will appear dry and cracked) or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean; cool 10 minutes. Run knife along side of cake to loosen; remove side of springform pan. Turn cake upside down onto wire rack; remove bottom of springform pan and cool completely. Place on serving plate.
Heat 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 2 tablespoons margarine and the corn syrup over medium heat until chocolate chips are melted. Spread over top of cake, allowing some to drizzle down side. Place whipped cream in decorating bag fitted with tip. Pipe a rosette on each serving. Serve with Raspberry Sauce. Garnish with fresh raspberries.
