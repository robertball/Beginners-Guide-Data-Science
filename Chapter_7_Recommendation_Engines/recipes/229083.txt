Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
7 cups crisp rice cereal squares (such as Rice ChexÂ®)
1 cup roasted pumpkin seed kernels
1 cup pretzel sticks
1 cup goldfish crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish; melt in oven while it preheats.
Stir Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and seasoned salt into melted butter. Gradually stir rice cereal squares, pumpkin seeds, pretzel sticks, and goldfish crackers into butter mixture until evenly coated.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 15 minutes, until crisp and fragrant, about 1 hour. Transfer party mix to paper towel-lined plates to cool.

Description: 
My kid's teacher asked for 'non-sweet treats' for a Halloween party. A search of Allrecipes showed there were very few like that, so I took some party mix recipes and made my own. Pretzel sticks = wooden stakes. Animal-shaped crackers = wild beasts. Toasted rice cereal = tombstones.
