Ingredients:
2 c. uncooked macaroni
salt
6 oz. extra-sharp cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2" squares
2 T. plus 1 t. flour
1 1/2 t. salt
1 1/2 t. dry mustard
1/4 t. ground black pepper
1/8 t. cayenne pepper
1/4 t. freshly grated nutmeg
2/3 c. sour cream
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 c. grated onion, loosely packed
1 1/2 c. half-and-half
1 1/2 c. heavy cream
1 t. Worcestershire sauce
2 c. grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter a 9 x 13 in baking dish.
Cook the macaroni according to package directions.  Drain, and transfer to the baking dish.
Mix in the cubed cheddar cheese.
In a medium bowl, mix the flour, salt, dry mustard, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg.  Add the sour cream, followed by the eggs, and whisk to blend.
Sir in the onion, half-and-half, cream, and Worcestershire sauce.
Pour this custard over the macaroni and cubed cheese, and stir to blend.
Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the surface of the custard.
Bake until custard is set around the edges of the dish but still a bit loose in the center, about 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool for 10 minutes.
