Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1/2 lb ground turkey
1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs, or more as needed
1/4 cup pineapple tidbits, well drained
2 Tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp freshly grated ginger root, or more to taste
1/2 tsp dried thyme, crushed in palm
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 Tbsp pineapple juice, or more as needed
additional brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
In a small food processor, process pineapple tidbits until smooth (like applesauce).  Add brown sugar and grated ginger; process to blend well.
In a large bowl, combine beef, turkey, bread crumbs, pineapple mixture (or half if doubling to have sauce spooned on top of cooked meatloaf), thyme, salt, and pepper.  Mix with your hands until well blended (mixture will be moist; add more bread crumbs if you like your meatloaf drier).
Shape into a football shape and put into a small glass pie pan that has been sprayed with Pam cooking spray.  Sprinkle additional brown sugar (about 2 tsp.) on top of meatloaf.  Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.  Mix pineapple juice into any pan drippings and spoon mixture over top of meatloaf.  Continue baking for another 15-20 minutes until meatloaf is done, spooning pan drippings over top a few more times to glaze the meatloaf.
Remove from oven to a plate; let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
The glaze on this meatloaf is great!  Double the pineapple sauce ingredients (using half in the meatloaf) to have some to spoon on top of the cooked meatloaf when serving.
