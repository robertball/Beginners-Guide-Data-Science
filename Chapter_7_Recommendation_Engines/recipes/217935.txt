Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 small onion, chopped
1 large clove garlic, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (7 ounce) package fideo pasta, uncooked
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
freshly ground black pepper to taste
coarse salt to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place the tomatoes, onion, and garlic into a blender, and pulse several times to get the mixture moving; blend until smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat, and stir in the pasta. Fry the pasta gently, stirring often, until the pasta is golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour the tomato mixture into a large saucepan, and stir in chicken broth and noodles. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium low; simmer until the noodles are tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper, and stir in the cilantro; simmer 2 more minutes to cook cilantro.

Description: 
I've been to many Mexican restaurants and they seem to always give you a small cup of Sopa de Fideos (noodle soup) before the meal. This can easily be made at home with just a few ingredients. This is my version of this tasty Mexican noodle soup.
