https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 tbsp butter
1 small yellow onion, diced small
3-4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1/4 tsp salt, or to taste
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a medium sized pan, sautee the onion and garlic in butter or olive oil over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, until onions are just soft. Reduce heat to medium low.
Add the broth and quinoa. Cover, and allow to simmer until liquid is mostly absorbed and quinoa is cooked, about fifteen minutes.
Remove from heat, and gently mix quinoa to distribute any excess moisture. Season with salt to taste, and top with Parmesan cheese, or, for a vegan version, mix in nutritional yeast instead of the cheese.
