Ingredients:
1/2 pkg. Pepperidge Farm Frozen Puff Pastry Sheets (1 sheet)
1 egg, beaten
1 TBSP water
4 squares Baker's Semi-Sweet Chocolate
2 TBSP milk
1 TBSP butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Thaw pastry sheet a room temperature 30 min.  Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Mix egg and water in small bowl.
Microwave chocolate, milk and butter in large bowl on HIGH 1 1/2 to 2 min. or until chocolate is almost melted; stirring halfway through heating time.  Stir until chocolate is completely melted.
Unfold pastry sheet on lightly floured surface.  Roll into 16x12 rectangle.  Spread chocolate mixture evenly on pastry to within 1 1/2" of edges.  Sprinkle pecans over chocolate.  Starting at short side, roll up jelly-roll style.  Place seam-side down on ungreased cookie sheet.  Tuck ends under to seal.  Brush with egg mixture.
Bake 35 minutes or until golden.  Cool 30 minutes on cookie sheet or wire rack.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired.  Slice and serve warm.
