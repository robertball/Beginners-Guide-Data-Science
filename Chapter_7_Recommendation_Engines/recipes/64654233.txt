Ingredients:
1/2 cup baking cocoa
1 cup hot water
3/4 cup butter, softened
2-3/4 cups packed brown sugar
3 eggs
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
FILLING:
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup 2% milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup butter, softened
GLAZE:
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons baking cocoa
1/4 cup 2% milk
2 cups confectioners' sugar
Chocolate curls, optional

Directions:
1. In a small bowl, combine cocoa and hot water until smooth; cool. In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk and cocoa mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir vanilla.
2. Pour into three greased and waxed paper-lined 9-in. round baking pans. Bake at 350Â° for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks to cool completely.
3. In a small saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch. Gradually stir in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool completely. In a small bowl, cream butter until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in cooled mixture.
4. Place one cake layer on a serving plate; spread with half of the filling. Repeat layers. Top with remaining cake.
5. For glaze, in a small saucepan, melt butter; stir in cocoa until smooth. Add milk. Bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. With an electric mixer, beat in confectioners' sugar until blended. Cool for 15-20 minutes; spread over top of the cake. Garnish with chocolate curls if desired. Store in the refrigerator. Yield: 12-14 servings.
