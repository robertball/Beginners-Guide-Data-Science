Title:
Mel's Cucumber Dip Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 - 1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
8 oz. softened cream cheese
1 pkg. Hidden Valley Ranch Buttermilk dressing (dry)
2 T. mayo
1-2 t. lemon juice, to taste (about 1/2 lemon)
1/2 or 1/4 c. (finely) chopped pecans or walnuts
garlic salt to taste (couple shakes)

Directions:
Mix all with hand mixer & chill 24 hrs.  Serve with fresh vegetables and/or crisp wheat crackers (aka wheat thins).
Tips: peel the cucumber, slice in half length-wise, and use a small spoon or melon baller to scrape down the length to remove the seeds.  Small dice for the cucumber and small pieces for the nuts create the best results.  I use 1/2 of a cucumber if it is a long one, and maybe most of it if it is small.  I  squeeze probably most of the juice of 1/2 of a small lemon (maybe a tiny bit less), and a couple shakes of garlic salt.  I always use light cream cheese and light mayo - it would be good with ff as well.  I live in Texas and have always used pecan chips, but I am sure the walnuts would also be good.  Make a double batch if you are making a large veggie tray - it goes fast.
My favorite veggie tray:  grape tomatoes, sugar snap peas, sliced yellow squash (very good with the dip), red, yellow and orange bell pepper strips, carrots & celery sticks, cauliflower & broccoli florets. Add  some black olives, midget pickles and cheese cubes, or serve these on another tray - the kids keep coming back for more.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a good friend and everyone who has ever eaten this dip on one of my veggie trays has suggested I become a caterer (I am not exaggerating.) Kids love it as well as adults.  (I never call it cucumber dip though - for some reason lots of people don't think they like cucumber when in fact, they do :)
