Ingredients:
500g swiss chard - cleaned and chopped
400g diced stewed tomatoes
1 clove of garlic
1/2 cup of shredded parmesan and/or pecorino
1 TBSP olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a pot.
Lightly brown the garlic in the oil.  Don't over cook the garlic.
Add the swiss chard and saut√©.
When the swiss chard is still crisp add the tomatoes.
Cook until the tomato sauce begins to boil.
Simmer until the swiss chard is tender and the sauce has cooked down.
Don't stir too much or it will break up the vegetable; shake the pot to "stir" the vegetable and tomatoes instead.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Add the cheese on top and cook for another minute or so, until melted.

Description: 
This is one of the first dishes I ate when I moved to Italy.  A Sicilian lady introduced me to this typical dish and I've been making it ever since.  Even my kids will eat it!
