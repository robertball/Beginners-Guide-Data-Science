Ingredients:
1 pound beets (about 1 bunch), about 2" in diameter each, trimmed
1 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 star anise pods
1 tablespoon sugar
1 medium bunch arugula (about 4 cups), trimmed and washed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
1.1.Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.
2.Wrap the beets in aluminum foil and place directly on the oven rack. Roast for 45 minutes, or until a knife easily pierces the beets. Cool for 30 minutes, then peel and cut each beet into 8 wedges.
3.Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the orange juice, vinegar, star anise, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 12 to 14 minutes, or until reduced to about 2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons of syrup. Discard the star anise pods, then toss the syrup with the beets.
4.Toss the arugula with the lemon juice, lemon zest, oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange over 4 serving plates. Divide the beets into 4 portions and place each on top of the arugula. Drizzle any remaining orange-balsamic syrup over each plate. Serve immediately.
