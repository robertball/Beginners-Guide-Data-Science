Ingredients:
2 cups old fashioned or quick cooking oats
1 (15oz) can pure pumpkin
2 large eggs
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (I used 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to add a little extra cinnamon)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (or 375 for mini muffins).  Lightly grease loaf pan with nonstick spray and set aside.
Pour all ingredients into blender.  Blend until smooth.  Pour into loaf pan and bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or 15 minutes for mini muffins).  NOTE: I cooked mine for 45 minutes and it was still a little undercooked.  If the top is starting to brown but the inside hasn't cooked completely, you can cover with foil.
Let loaf cool completely in pan.  Store in an airtight container in the fridge.

Description: 
Easy and healthy.  The directions say to cook 30 minutes, but I had to cook it much longer.  Good as mini muffins, but takes a long time to get into the muffin tins because the batter doesn't pour easily.  Adapted from thebakermama.com/recipes/healthy-flourless-pumpkin-bread/.  Makes about small slices.
