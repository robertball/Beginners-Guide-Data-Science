Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (1 pound) salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, cut into 4 wedges

Directions:
Mix orange juice, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger together in a small bowl.
Place salmon in a shallow dish. Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the orange juice mixture on top. Reserve remaining mixture in the bowl. Let salmon marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Transfer salmon to a baking dish lined with aluminum foil; pat dry with paper towels. Discard marinade. Spoon 1 tablespoon of reserved orange juice mixture over salmon; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 6 minutes. Spoon remaining 2 tablespoons orange juice mixture over salmon. Continue baking until flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 9 minutes more. Serve with lemon wedges.
