Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/3 cups sugar, divided
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, 1 cup sugar and egg until blended.  Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture alternately with buttermilk.  In a small bowl, combine the cinnamon and remaining sugar.
Pour a third of the batter into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan; sprinkle with a third of the cinnamon-sugar.  Repeat layers twice.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
