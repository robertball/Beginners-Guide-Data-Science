Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1 cup white sugar
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
2 pears, diced
1/3 cup honey
2 cinnamon sticks

Directions:
Heat orange juice and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Stir in cranberries, and cook until they start to pop, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in pears, honey, and cinnamon sticks and cook for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and transfer to a bowl. Cranberry sauce will thicken as it cools. Remove cinnamon sticks before serving.
