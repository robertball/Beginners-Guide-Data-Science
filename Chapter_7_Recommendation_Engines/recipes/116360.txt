Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1 dash garlic powder
2 boneless pork loin chops, 3/4 inch thick
1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil
2 tablespoons chopped onion
3/4 cup water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 plum tomato, chopped

Directions:
In a resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, paprika and garlic powder. Set aside 2 teaspoons flour mixture for gravy. Add chops to remaining flour mixture; shake to coat.
In a skillet, brown pork chops in oil for 4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a greased shallow 1-qt. baking dish. Add onion to skillet; cook and stir until tender. Stir in reserved flour mixture until blended; cook and stir for 1 minutes or until lightly browned. Gradually stir in water. Add the bouillon, basil and thyme. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Pour over pork.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes. Uncover; sprinkle with tomato. Bake 5-10 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer inserted in pork reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and tomato is heated through.
