Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, grated
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
4 ounces Cheddar cheese, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Crumble ground beef into a large skillet. Cook over medium-high heat 3 minutes. Add onion and continue to cook until meat and onion are both browned. Drain off excess fat.
Mix in soup, Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, and mushrooms. Pour mixture into pastry-lined pan. Cover with top crust. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until crust is golden brown. Place slices of cheese on top of pie. Serve pie while hot.

Description: 
Satisfying ground beef mixed with onion, tomato soup, and cheddar cheese. This is a good meat pie to serve with a salad. I got the recipe from my mother-in-law. To make this pie lighter, use ground turkey instead of beef.
