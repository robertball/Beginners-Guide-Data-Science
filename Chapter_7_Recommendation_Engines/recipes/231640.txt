Ingredients:
1 small jalapeno pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups long grain white rice
1 (15 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1/2 onion, roughly chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 clove garlic
2 cups water

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place jalapeno pepper on a baking sheet.
Roast jalapeno pepper under the preheated broiler until skin is browned and blistered, 2 to 3 minutes per side Remove from oven and remove stem.
Heat oil in a pot over medium-low heat; cook and stir rice in the hot oil until evenly browned and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes.
Blend roasted jalapeno, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, chicken bouillon, lemon juice, and garlic in a blender until smooth; stir into the browned rice. Continuously stir mixture until rice has absorbed the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour water into rice mixture, continuously stirring until liquid boils. Boil for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is fully cooked, waiting at least 20 minutes before removing the lid. Remove rice from heat and let stand 5 minutes before serving.

This recipe has been passed down to me from my mother who learned it from her mother. It's made from ingredients found in almost every kitchen! It'll sure be a hit. I have tried this rice over and over again and have developed my own new flavor.
