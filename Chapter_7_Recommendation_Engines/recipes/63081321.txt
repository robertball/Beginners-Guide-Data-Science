Ingredients:
2 Bananas
Other add-ins as desired (peanut butter, chocolate, etc)

Directions:
Peel and slice 2 bananas.  Place in an air tight container (such as a tupperware container), and place in freezer until completely frozen.  This will take approximately 1 1/2 hours.
Place the frozen banana slices in blender and whip until smooth.   Enjoy!
You can whip room temp bananas first and then freeze them, but they will have to thaw a bit before you can scoop it (it will freeze completely solid).  This can be done, but it doesn't work as well.
*You can certainly eat the whipped bananas alone, but I find that it always tastes wonderful to add some peanut butter or chocolate to the blender before whipping to give the "ice cream" some depth of flavor.  Be creative and choose whatever you like!*
