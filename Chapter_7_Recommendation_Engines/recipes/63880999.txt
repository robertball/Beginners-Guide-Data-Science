1 28oz can crushed tomatoes

Directions:
Combine peas, scallions, lentils, and tomatoes in a large frying pan.  Place on medium heat.
Add rice vinegar and chili oil to taste until spicy and mildly tangy - it should not be overwhelming!  Also add salt, coriander, and wasabi powder to taste.
When hot, remove from heat.  Stir in file powder until it has reached desired thickness - it should be wet but not runny.  Let sit for about 5 minutes.
Combine the rice and spread.
Serve the lentil mixture over the rice.
