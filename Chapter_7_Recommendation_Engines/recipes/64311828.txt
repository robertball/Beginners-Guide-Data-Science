Black Bean Brownies Recipe

Ingredients:
1 15 oz. can black beans, well rinsed and drained
2 eggs
3 T coconut oil, melted (or sub other oil of choice)
3/4 cup cocoa powder (the higher quality the better)
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted
1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.Lightly grease a 12-slot standard size muffin pan. Make sure you've rinsed and thoroughly drained your black beans at this point.
4.Add all ingredients except non-melted chocolate chips to food processor and puree - about 3 minutes - scraping down sides as needed. You want it pretty smooth.
5.If the batter appears too thick, add a Tbsp or two of water and pulse again. It should be slightly less thick than chocolate frosting but nowhere close to runny.
6. Stir in remaining chocolate chips.
7. Spoon batter into the muffin tin and smooth the tops with a spoon or your finger.
8.Bake for 20-26 minutes or until the tops are dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides.
9.Remove from oven and let cool for 30 minutes before removing from pan. They will be tender, so remove gently with a fork. The insides are meant to be very fudgy, so don't be concerned if they seem too moist.
10.Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. Refrigerate to keep longer.
