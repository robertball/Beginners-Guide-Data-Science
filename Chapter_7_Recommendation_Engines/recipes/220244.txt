Description: 
I know this recipe was given to my Aunt by her mother-in-law when she was a young woman in the early 1900's. It is a quick-fix meal that uses canned oysters. This makes a good hearty light meal to end your day. Serve with a nice bread or in bread bowls with chunks of different cheese. My Aunt used smoked shucked oysters plain shucked oysters. She also cooked this until the edges curled and the center firmed.
