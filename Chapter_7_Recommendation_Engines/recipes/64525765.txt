https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound of ground beef 85%
1 egg
Half -3/4 of a stack of Ritz buttery cracker crumbs
1 envelope of Lipton vegetable soup mix
cracked black pepper
sea salt
1 tablespoon of lawry's all purpose beef seasoning

Directions:
add the groundbeef to a large mixing bowl
next add the ritz cracker crumbs and lipton vegetable soup envelope
next add the egg salt and pepper and lawry's beef seasoning
and mix  thoroughly  I suggest digging in with your hands that way you get a more even mixture with the seasonings.
place into a loaf pan or form a loaf on a sheet-pan I always use tin foil for easy cleanup
and bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes taking the tin foil off at the last 10 minutes to make a nice crust I dont use anything over the top of mine but that is just my preference.
I serve with my homemade mashed potatoes and vegetables. Enjoy!

This isn't your grandmothers meatloaf! For years I stuck with my nana's traditional recipe for homemade meatloaf. Then I started playing with different ingredients and I found a winning combination I love but more importantly my boyfriend begs for!
