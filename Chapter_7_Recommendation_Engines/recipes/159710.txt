Ingredients:
3/4 cup baking mix

1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8-inch square baking dish.
Beat the baking mix, vanilla pudding mix, milk, butter, and egg together with an electric mixer in a bowl for 2 minutes; pour into the buttered dish. Chop the peaches and scatter over the mixture.
Beat the cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and reserved peach juice together in a bowl; pour over the peaches. Stir together the 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over the cream cheese mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
My recipe card for this dessert is stained and worn, if that tells you anything. I've had more requests for a copy of this recipe than any other dish I make. It smells heavenly when it's baking and tastes even better! I almost always double the recipe because it disappears fast.
