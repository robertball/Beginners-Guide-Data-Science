Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dry garbanzo beans
10 cups vegetable stock
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 pounds tomatoes, chopped
1 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
2 pounds fresh fennel bulbs, trimmed and chopped
2 medium onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh shelled green peas

Directions:
Place the garbanzo beans in a pot with enough water to cover, and soak 8 hours, or overnight. Drain and rinse.
In a large pot, stir together the soaked beans and vegetable stock. Mix in 2 cloves minced garlic and the red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes, or until beans are tender.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the remaining garlic, tomatoes, and basil in the skillet, and cook 2 minutes, or just until the basil is wilted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Mix the fennel and onions into the pot with the garbanzo beans. Season with salt. Continue cooking 15 minutes. Mix in the tomatoes, basil, and peas, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until peas are tender. Serve hot.
