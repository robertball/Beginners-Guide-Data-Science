Description: 
This is the best brisket you will ever taste.  No matter who comes for dinner, they always make sure that I'll be making this brisket.  It is a very traditional dish for Rosh Hashanah and Passover but it certainly is a winner any time of the year for anyone who loves very tender beef.
