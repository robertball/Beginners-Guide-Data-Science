Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
4 fresh tomatoes, diced
2 bell peppers, chopped into 3/4 inch pieces
2 heads garlic, crushed
3 green onions, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 (8 ounce) can baby corn, drained and cut into bite-size pieces
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
1 dash lime juice, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, with liquid
1/2 pound cooked crabmeat
1 pinch brown sugar, or as needed (optional)
1 (7 ounce) can hearts of palm, drained and cut into bite-size pieces
1 pound jumbo shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
1 pound sea scallops
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in large stockpot over medium-low heat; add tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, and green onions. Cook and stir frequently until tomatoes have nearly liquefied, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Stir kidney beans, baby corn, and celery into the tomato mixture; add chili powder and lime juice and season with salt and ground black pepper. Cover and cook on low, stirring occasionally, until celery is soft but still has texture, about 1 hour.
Stir crab meat and canned tomatoes with liquid into kidney bean mixture, breaking up tomatoes in thirds with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper; add brown sugar if chili tastes too salty.
Stir shrimp, scallops, and hearts of palm into chili; cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.
