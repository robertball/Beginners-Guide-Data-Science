Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup bananas
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cup flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350. Spray the muffin pan or use liners. Mix together all the wet ingredients first, then gradually mix and add the dry ingredients.  I fill the muffin pan really high. Doing so I get 17 muffins. If you decide to fill them half way you will probably get 24 muffins. If doing the loaf it takes 40- 50 minutes to bake.

Description: 
Super moist recipe. Can be made as a loaf too. Great for breakfast on the go! Even tastier if you spread some cream cheese on them.
