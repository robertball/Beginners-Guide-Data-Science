Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, stir together the cocoa powder, sugar and salt. Mix in corn syrup, and milk until well blended. Add butter, and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Stir occasionally.
Remove from heat, and beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is thick and loses its gloss. Stir in vanilla, and pour into a buttered 9x9 inch baking dish. Let cool until set. Cut into small squares to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is for the good fudge.  The one without nuts or creams. This fudge doesn't use any shortcuts either, so use a candy thermometer for best results.
