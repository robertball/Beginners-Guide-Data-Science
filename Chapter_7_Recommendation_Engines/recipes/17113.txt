Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins
1 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a muffin pan or line with paper muffin liners. Sift together flour, baking powder and cocoa powder, set aside.
In a large bowl, stir together the rolled oats, sugar and salt. Mix in the  sifted ingredients and raisins. Add the milk, egg, and oil, mix until just blended. The batter will be lumpy. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove from muffin cups to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
