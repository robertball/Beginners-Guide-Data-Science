https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 box of Yellow Cake Mix (brand doesn't matter)
Ingredients requested on the cake box (usually 3 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil, and 1 and 1/3 cups of water)
1 bottle of red food coloring
2 tbsp. cocoa powder
Cupcake paper & a cupcake pan

Directions:
Preheat over to temp. on the cake box direction
Just add all of the dry ingredients as well as the eggs, oil, and food coloring to a bowl and mix at a low to medium speed.
Slowly add the water while mixing until you get a smooth texture. I usually don't need all of the water.
Place the cupcake papers in each hole in the pan
Pour the mixture about half way up each cupcake mold.
Bake for about 20-25 mins.
Let cool

Description: 
This is a go-to recipe for when unexpected guests are coming (aka - mom-in-law, cub scouts, cousins from the old country). It's super easy and you use what you already have in the kitchen! It goes great with my Lactose Intolerant Butter cream Frosting!
