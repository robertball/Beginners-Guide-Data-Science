Ingredients:
1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup light corn syrup
2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces.
2 oz unsweetened chocolate; chopped
1 tsp vanilla
pinch of salt
a few drops of malt vinegar

Directions:
In a heavy saucepan, whisk together the cocoa, sugar, and 1/4 cup of the heavy cream until smooth.
Stir in the corn syrup, butter, chocolate and the remaining 1/2 cup of cream.
Bring to a steady, but gentle boil over medium heat. Cook for exactly 3 minutes after the sauce comes to a boil. Do not stir it while it's cooking!
Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla, salt and vinegar. The sauce will thicken upon cooling or when poured over ice cream.

Description: 
This is very similar to the famous hot fudge sundae sauce served at a famous but now-defunct east coast  restaurant chain.  The sauce is the perfect consistency as it breaks into small chewy strands when warm served over ice cream.
