Ingredients:
4 slices whole grain sandwich bread (I used gluten free)
2 Tbsp mayonnaise
2 tsp dijon mustard
50 grams primo sale with hot red peppers (if you can't find primo sale, use pepper jack)

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron.
Mix together the mayonnaise and the dijon mustard. Spread the mixture on one side of each 4 slices of bread.
Put 25 grams of cheese on two slices of bread.
Cover each slice with the empty bread to form two whole sandwiches.
Place the sandwiches in the waffle iron taking care not to push down all the way immediately.
Wait until the bread begins to soften from the heat, then start to gently close the waffle iron. After the sandwich has softened more, about 2 more minutes, apply more pressure to the top part of the waffle iron eventually closing it after a total of 3-4 minutes. Cook until browned. Remove from the waffle iron.
Enjoy!

Description: 
More method than recipe, I heated up my panini maker one night to make a grilled cheese, only to find out that I'd left the waffle plates inside. Instead of changing out the plates, I used them anyway and I loved the outcome. The sandwich gets super crispy but the cheese is still soft and gooey inside the little squares. It's my go to method for grilled cheese now. Serve with spicy pickled veggies on the side!
