Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch thick wedges
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon mild curry powder
1 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss sweet potato wedges with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large bowl; season with sea salt and paprika and toss again. Spread sweet potatoes in a single layer onto a baking sheet.
Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until soft, about 20 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green onions with curry powder in the hot oil until softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir ketchup into the mixture and transfer to a bowl. Serve sweet potatoes with curry ketchup for dipping.
