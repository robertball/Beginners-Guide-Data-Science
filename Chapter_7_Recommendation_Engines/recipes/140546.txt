Description: 
This delicious soup has only 6 ingredients.  It was given to me by my boyfriend's mom who adapted it from another recipe.  It can be as thick or thin as you like, and I like it quite thick.  To dress it up when serving, drizzle some cream on top and float a lime twist or slice of lime on top.  Delicious hot or cold.
