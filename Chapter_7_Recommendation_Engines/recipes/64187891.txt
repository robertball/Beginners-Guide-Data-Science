Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Hershey's baking cocoa
2 cups sugar
1 cup water
Dash of salt
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
You can easily double this recipe. A double batch will re-fill one of the large bottles of Hershey's syrup about 3/4 the way full.
Mix together water and cocoa in a sauce pan. Heat and stir until cocoa is dissolved. Add the sugar, and heat until boiling. Boil for 3 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in salt and vanilla. Cool. When completely cool you can use a funnel to pour it into an empty Hershey's chocolate syrup bottle or you can also store it in a mason jar. This syrup will store for several months in the refrigerator.
Enjoy with your favorite ice cream or use it to make chocolate milk.
