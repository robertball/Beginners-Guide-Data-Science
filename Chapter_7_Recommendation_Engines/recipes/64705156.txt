Ingredients:
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast
1 10.8-oz. package frozen garlic baby peas & mushrooms, such as Birds Eye
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium condensed cream of mushroom soup, such as Campbell's Healthy Request
1 cup corn, fresh or frozen
1 cup sliced celery
½ cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme or ¾ tsp. dried
1 teaspoon lemon zest
¼ teaspoon ground pepper
Topping
1 (10 ounce) package frozen riced cauliflower, such as Birds Eye
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup all-purpose flour or panko breadcrumbs
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°F.
Combine chicken, frozen peas & mushrooms, mushroom soup, corn, celery, onion, parsley, thyme, lemon zest, and pepper in a large bowl. Transfer to a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan.
To prepare topping: Combine cauliflower, Parmesan, flour (or breadcrumbs), and melted butter in a medium bowl. Sprinkle the topping over the chicken mixture.
Bake the potpie until the filling is heated through and the topping is golden, about 40 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with additional parsley, if desired.

You won't miss the crust on this chicken potpie-we promise! We cut the carbs by swapping in a riced-cauliflower-and-panko topping for a thin and crispy top layer that's more nutritious than pie crust (but every bit as satisfying).
