Ingredients:
16 oz pasta (penne, farfalle, shells, rotini… any shape)
8 oz Italian salad dressing
1 can olives, sliced
1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 large cucumber, diced
2 tomatoes, diced

Directions:
Boil pasta according to instructions on the back of the package, or about 10 minutes, until al dente. While pasta is cooking, prepare vegetables.
Drain and rinse pasta with cold water. When pasta is cooled slightly, pour into a large bowl. Add olives, beans, cucumber, and tomatoes.
Pour salad dressing over mixture, and gently stir to combine. Best when refrigerated and served cold.
Looking for an extra flavor blast? Add Italian seasonings, salt and pepper, parmesan cheese, and onions to the mixture.
