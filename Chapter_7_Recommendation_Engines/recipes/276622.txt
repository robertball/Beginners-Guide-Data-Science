Ingredients:
4 ounces bulk breakfast sausage
8 eggs
2 tablespoons heavy cream
8 drops hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or more to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped mushrooms
2/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped onion
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Crumble sausage into a 12-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Cook until browned, about 4 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk eggs in a large bowl. Add cream and hot pepper sauce; mix well.
Add butter to the skillet with browned sausage and melt around the inside rim of the skillet. Add mushrooms, red bell pepper, onion, salt, and pepper. Cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Turn off heat and stir in spinach. Cook for 1 minute in hot skillet, then sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Pour egg mixture on top, making sure all the ingredients are submerged.
Place skillet in the preheated oven and bake until eggs are set and no longer jiggle, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 1 to 2 minutes, before cutting into serving pieces.

Description: 
Dress up your eggs with some great keto add-ins. All the veggies are low-carb, and they add great flavor and texture, not to mention, great nutrition. Leave out the Tabasco for sensitive palates. Bonus: Leftovers reheat well, for those in-a-hurry mornings.
