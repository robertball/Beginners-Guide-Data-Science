Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
1/2 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp. baking powder
4 Tbsp. chilled shortening
2/3 to 3/4 cup cold milk

Directions:
Preheat oven 450 degrees. Sift flour with salt and baking powder. With pastry blender or two knives, blend shortening into flour until shortening particles are the size of small peas. Quickly stir in the cold milk, mixing just until dough forms. Add just enough milk to form soft dough. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Roll with floured pin or pat with heel of your hand to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Cut with a biscuit cutter or juice glass. Gently re-roll trimmings and cut with cutter or glass to use remaining dough. Place biscuits on an ungreased, shiny-surfaced cookie sheet about 1 1/2 inches apart. Brush tops lightly with a little milk. Bake at 450 degrees for about 12 minutes or until golden. Makes about 1 dozen.
