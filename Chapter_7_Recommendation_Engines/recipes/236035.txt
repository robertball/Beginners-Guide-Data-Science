Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground cardamom
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon grill seasoning (such as Montreal Steak SeasoningÂ®)
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 lemon, juiced, divided
1 large clove garlic, minced
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 large onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt
1/4 cup tahini
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
4 pita bread rounds

Directions:
Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Whisk together the coriander, cumin, cardamom, chili powder, grill seasoning, paprika, and turmeric in a bowl; whisk in juice of 1/2 lemon, garlic, and 3 tablespoons olive oil to form a paste. Coat the chicken breasts with the spice paste.
Grill chicken breasts on the preheated grill until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and cool for 1 to 2 minutes; slice thinly.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir onion, red pepper, and yellow pepper into the hot olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir together Greek yogurt, tahini, juice of remaining 1/2 lemon, and remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a bowl until smooth; season with salt.
Place pitas on the grill until heated through and lightly charred on the outside, about 1 minute per side. To assemble each sandwich, place some sliced chicken on each pita; top with some of the pepper mixture and a good dollop of yogurt tahini sauce.
