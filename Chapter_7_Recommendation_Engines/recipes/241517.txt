Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
6 eggs, separated, divided
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 bananas, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, 1/2 of the sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add egg yolks, water, oil, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth.
Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Continue beating until stiff and shiny peaks form; add remaining sugar and beat until incorporated. Fold egg yolk mixture and bananas into egg white mixture just until blended. Slowly pour batter into a 10-inch tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched, 55 to 65 minutes. Invert pan onto a plate and cool. Loosen edges of cake and remove pan.
