Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all purpose flour
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Add butter to a frying pan preheated on low. When the butter is melted, whisk in the flour. Add flour in stages in case it gets too thick.
After about 5 minutes, you'll notice a nutty aroma.
Set the roux aside at room temperature while you begin preparing your soup or sauce.
This roux will thicken 2-4 quarts of soup or sauce.
There are three types of roux. The white and blonde roux is used for white sauces and white soups, while the brown roux is used for dark sauces and soups.
Tips:
A dark roux will thicken less than light roux.
If black specks appear in the roux, it has burned and you'll have to start over.

Description: 
Roux (pronounced roo) is a thickening agent for soups and sauces with roots dating back more than 300 years in French cuisine. Made by cooking a flour and oil paste until the raw flavor of the flour cooks out and the roux has achieved the desired color, a properly cooked roux imparts silky-smooth body and a nutty flavor while thickening soups and sauces.
