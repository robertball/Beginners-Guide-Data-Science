Ingredients:
4 cups cauliflower florets
3 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbs peanut oil

Directions:
Cut the garlic in half and smash with the blade of a knife
Preheat the air fryer to 200
Place the oil, garlic, salt and paprika in a medium bowl and stir.
Add the cauliflower and turn to coat.
Place the coated cauliflower in the bowl of the air fryer and cook for 15 minutes, shaking every 5 minutes.
Note: After 15 minutes the cauliflower will still have some crunch, cook for an additional 5 minutes if you want it crispier.  The timing really depends on the size of the cauliflower, check frequently.

A great, easy side dish that pairs well with any protein. I've used smoked paprika, a favourite of mine, but feel free to add your favourite flavours, enjoy!
