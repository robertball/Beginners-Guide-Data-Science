Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 cups diced ripe mango
1 medium ripe banana, mashed
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, combine the eggs, oil and lime juice; add to the dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in the mango, banana, raisins and nuts.
Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
Fresh mangoes freeze well, so when they're in season, I dice and freeze them in 2-cup containers. That way, I always have some on hand for making these flavorful muffins.
