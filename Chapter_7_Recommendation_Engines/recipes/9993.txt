Description: 
My grandmother used to make these and what a favorite they are.  As I type this recipe, I see her handwriting and remember those good ole days! These are a delicate, cake like cookie with chocolate frosting.  The nuts are optional, if you like them add them. Pecans or peanuts taste just as great as walnuts do.
