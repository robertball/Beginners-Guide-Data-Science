Ingredients:
One 32 oz bag of frozen french fries
6 pieces of bacon
4 oz cheddar cheese, shredded
4 oz Monterey jack cheese, shredded
2 jalapenos, seeded and sliced

Directions:
Cook the french fries according to package directions.
While the fries are in the oven, cook the bacon, drain, and dice.
In a lightly greased 9x13" baking dish, layer the cooked fries, diced bacon, cheeses and jalapenos. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used. Broil for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.
Serve with your favorite condiments- I recommend blue cheese dressing or barbeque sauce.  Enjoy!
