Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
8 red potatoes, cut into quarters
10 crimini mushrooms, quartered
1 large zucchini cut in half lengthwise, then cut into 1-inch moons

Directions:
Cook and stir the garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the potatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini. Cover the skillet and cook the vegetables over high heat for 5 minutes. Stir, replace the lid, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I made this to go along with veal-kabobs the other night, and every one LOVED the combination of mushrooms, potatoes, and zucchini! Make sure the potatoes are cooked through!
