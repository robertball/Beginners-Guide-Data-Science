Ingredients:
4 bone in, skin on chicken thighs
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
8 oz cremini mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup heavy cream
salt and black pepper, to taste
fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

Directions:
1. Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Season both sides of chicken thighs with salt, black pepper, thyme, and oregano. Place thighs into hot skillet, skin side down, and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Flip thighs over and brown on other side, an additional 8 minutes. Remove thighs from skillet onto a large plate, and set aside. Reduce heat of skillet to medium-low.
2. Add mushrooms to skillet and cook 3-5 minutes. Stir in onion and garlic, cook an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add in white wine, scraping up browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Simmer 2 minutes, or until wine is reduced by half. Stir in chicken broth, and allow mixture to come back to a simmer. Put chicken thighs back into the skillet, and cook, covered, about 15 minutes or until internal temperature of chicken reaches 165 degrees. Stir in heavy cream, and heat an additional 1 minute, or until just heated through. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle fresh parsley, if using, over chicken just before serving.
