Ingredients:
1 lb lean beef slices thin across the grain ( READ DIRECTIONS FIRST)
2 T sugar
4 T soy sauce
2 T sesame oil
1 tsp ground sesame seeds
4 T chopped green onion( I do not use the white part just the greens)
1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in mixing bowl and mix well.
Add beef slices and let stand at least 15 mins.
Best grilled over charcoal but may be oven broiled or pan fried.
If you are going to grill the meat instead do not slice the meat!!!
Put meat in with ingredients in a 9x13 pan and let sit for 15 mins.
Grill until about medium or how ever you like your meat.
Slice against the grain very thin.
