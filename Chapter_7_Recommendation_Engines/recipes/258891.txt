Ingredients:
2 boneless pork chops
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 egg
5 tablespoons bread crumbs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Place pork chops between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet, turning occasionally, until very thin. Season with salt and pepper.
Pour flour onto a large plate. Whisk egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow bowl.
Dredge chops with flour. Dip in whisked egg. Coat with bread crumbs on both sides. Shake off excess coating.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add breaded chops; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
