Image:

Ingredients:
1 pound sausage (hot or sweet) with casings removed
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup minced parsley
1/2 cup butter
8 cups cornbread crumbs (stuffing mix)
1 cup chopped pecans
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 tsp dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 can (14.5 ounces) chicken broth or chicken stock
1/2 cup cooking sherry (can substitute white wine if you don't care for sherry)
water (optional)

Directions:
Saute sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through.  Remove sausage (and grease, if desired) from pan.
Saute onion, celery and parsley in butter for about 5 minutes or until tender.
Add remaining ingredients, including sausage.  Mix well.
If the mixture is too dry for your taste, add water (or more more chicken broth) until the mixture is desired consistency.  If you are stuffing a bird with this dressing, the mixture should be somewhat dry and will moisten up with basting.
If not stuffing a bird, place in a greased casserole dish.  Cook at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes, until dish is heated through.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me many years ago by a dear friend.  I have made it for Thanksgiving every year, and it is always a huge hit with my family.  (I stuff the turkey with it, so the basting makes it extra moist.  If not stuffing the bird, add extra water to your desired consistency.)  It is definitely a crowd pleaser!!!
