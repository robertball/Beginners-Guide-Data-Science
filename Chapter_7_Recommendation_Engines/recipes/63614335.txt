Ingredients:
3 pounds of Pork Country Ribs
1 clove of garlic, chopped or grated
2 domestic beers (or 3 cups chicken stock)
2 cups water
Salt and pepper to taste
12 oz jar of Herdez Tradition Chipotle cooking sauce

Directions:
Boil ribs, garlic, beer and water (to cover the ribs) in a covered pot on the stove, bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours until ribs are tender but not falling apart. This can also be done in a slow cooker on low 4-6 hours.
Place ribs on medium hot grill to lightly char. Turn after 10-15 minutes placing ribs on indirect heat of the grill and baste with Herdez Chipotle sauce and grill for another 10 minutes.
Baste again with more sauce before serving or pass around extra sauce at the table. Serve with homemade potato salad and a crisp summer green salad. Enjoy!

Description: 
Country Ribs often go on sale in the summer time and are meaty and tender. Don't skip the parboiling step...this will make them more tender and reduce grill flare-ups! So Tasty!
