Ingredients:
6 big cans of sliced peaches in heavy syrup; drain only 3 cans
2 boxes of vanilla cake mix
1 stick of butter

Directions:
A cast Iron dutch oven is ESSENTIAL for this recipe, nothing else works.
Layer 1: Drain 3 cans of peaches and put in cast iron dutch oven
Add 3 more cans of peaches, do not drain liquid, to the dutch oven
Layer 2: Pour both boxes of cake mix over the top of peaches (do not stir)
Layer 3: Slice up one stick of butter into little pats and drop all over the top of cake mix
Put the lid on the dutch oven and put in the campfire, near hot coals, not on the hot coals.
Place hot coals on top of the dutch oven lid. VERY IMPORTANT.
In about 20 minutes, give the dutch oven a 180 degree turn, to insure an even bake.
In about 20 more minutes, check under the lid.
Dessert is finished when peaches are soft and carmelized, juice will really thicken, you will have a hot, bubbly , golden brown, topping.
Don't let the dutch oven turn all glowy red, it'll burn
