Ingredients:
12 large cucumbers - peeled, seeded, and quartered lengthwise
1 cup pickling lime (calcium hydroxide)
1 gallon water
1 gallon cold water, or as needed to cover
1 3/4 cups white vinegar, divided
1 1/4 cups water, divided
12 1/2 ounces cinnamon red hot candies
1 1/2 teaspoons red food coloring
1/2 teaspoon alum
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 (4 inch) cinnamon sticks
6 pint-sized canning jars with rings and lids:

Directions:
Put cucumber spears in a large container. Stir pickling lime into 1 gallon water in a large pitcher until the lime is dissolved; pour over the cucumbers. Refrigerate for 24 hours.
Drain cucumbers and rinse well; return to large container. Pour enough cold water over the drained cucumbers to cover. Soak at least 3 hours; drain. Transfer cucumbers to a large pot.
Stir 1 1/4 cup vinegar and 1 1/4 cup water together in a bowl; add cinnamon red hot candies. Set aside to soak, stirring occasionally.
Stir 1/2 cup vinegar, red food coloring, and alum together in a bowl until alum is dissolved; pour over the cucumbers. Put a lid on the pot, place the pot over medium heat, and bring the water to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours; drain and return cucumbers to the pot.
Pour cinnamon candy mixture into a saucepan; add sugar and cinnamon sticks. Bring the mixture to a boil; cook and stir until the candies and sugar are dissolved completely into a syrupy liquid. Pour the liquid over the drained cucumbers. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Drain liquid from the cucumbers into a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil and pour again over the cucumbers. Refrigerate 24 hours.
Drain liquid again from the cucumbers into a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil and pour again over the cucumbers. Refrigerate another 24 hours.
Heat cucumbers and syrup to a boil.
Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack cucumbers into the hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids and screw on rings. Refrigerate until chilled before serving.
