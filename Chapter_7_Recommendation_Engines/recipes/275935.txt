Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 cup ground sausage
2 large Eggland's Best Eggs
1 large sweet potato
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup salsa
1 avocado, diced

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat and brown the ground sausage, 5 to 7 minutes.
While the sausage cooks, fill a large pot with a few inches of water and place over medium-high heat until it just starts to simmer.
Crack Eggland's Best eggs individually into a ramekin or cup. Create a gentle whirlpool in the simmering water. Slowly pour the eggs one by one into the water and leave to cook for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
While the eggs poach, cut the sweet potato into noodles using a spiralizer.
Heat the other teaspoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add in the sweet potato noodles and cook until they just begin to soften, about 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer the cooked sweet potato noodles into a large bowl. Drain the ground sausage and add to the sweet potato noodles. Toss with the salsa.
Divide the noodles and sausage between two bowls, top each with diced avocado and a poached egg.
