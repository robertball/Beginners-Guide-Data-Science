Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried currants or raisins
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
5 tablespoons cold butter
1 cup sour cream
2 egg yolks
TOPPING:
1 egg white
1 teaspoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place currants in a bowl. Cover with hot water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Combine sour cream and egg yolks; add to crumb mixture. Stir in currants just until blended.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently 8-10 times. Divide into four portions. On ungreased baking sheets, pat dough into 4-in. circles. Cut each into four wedges, but do not separate. Beat egg white; brush over dough. Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over tops. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.

These tempting triangles perfectly balance a light and airy texture with a rich and moist flavor. I serve them frequently for breakfast with fresh fruit, coffee and juice.
