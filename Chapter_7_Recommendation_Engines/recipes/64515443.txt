Ingredients:
5 cups flour
1 lb lard (like Tenderflake)
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 egg beaten
1 tsp. vinegar
water

Directions:
Beat egg in a 1 cup measure, add vinegar and add enough water to make 1 cup
Blend other ingredients together until crumbly and lard is evenly distributed (I use a blender to help with this).
Add enough (egg/vinegar/water) liquid to make a soft dough. Be careful not to overmix or pastry will be tough.
You can chill x 1/2 - 1 hour to make handling easier, but you can skip that step if you don't have time or feel confident!
Roll out each portion on lightly floured surface to approx. 1/4" thickness.
For pre-baked crust, line pie plate and prick with a fork in several places on whole crust. Bake @ 375 x approx. 14 min., watching for it to turn a very light brown.
