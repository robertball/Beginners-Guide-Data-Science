Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 cup chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced/crushed
1 28oz can crushed tomoatos
3 14 oz cans black beans, drained
1 cup sliced celery
1/3 cup cider vinegar
3 cups water
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1-2 teaspoon salt (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper

Directions:
Cut bacon into small pieces, and cook until well done in large stock pot.  Remove bacon and drain on paper towels.  Reserve bacon fat.
In some bacon fat (you choose how much, but you do need a few tablespoons at least), cook onion and garlic until browned (~ 5 min).
Add all other ingredients except bacon.  Bring to a boil, and simmer 45-60 minutes uncovered.  Add water if soup
gets too thick.
Add bacon and serve.

Description: 
Delicious and fast - this is my family's favorite soup.  If you don't like it spicy, just leave out the red pepper.  If you do like it spicy, add some more!  This also freezes and refrigerates well, so I often make extra.
