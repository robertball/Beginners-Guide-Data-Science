Ingredients:
•1 can (16 ounces) kidney beans
•1 can (16 ounces) black beans
•1 can (16 ounces) garbanzo beans
•1 onion
•2 tablespoons vegetable oil
•2 tablespoons chili powder
•1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
•1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes with juice
•1 cup tomato juice
•salt and pepper to taste
•shredded cheddar cheese (if desired)
•sour cream (if desired)
•1 pound ground beef (optional)

Directions:
PreparationOpen the cans of beans. Drain off the liquid from the cans into the sink. Set the beans aside.
(If including ground beef) Brown ground beef and set aside.
Put the onion on a cutting board. Carefully slice off the root end and the stem end. Use your fingers to strip off the dry skin. Then cut the onion in half from the top to the bottom. Hold an onion half cut side down and thinly slice it crosswise. Now hold the slices together and cut across them in the opposite direction. Be sure to keep your fingers clear of the knife blade. Set aside.
Put the oil in a large saucepan. Set the pan on the stove and switch on the heat to medium-high. When the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and stir with the wooden spoon until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the chili powder and cayenne pepper and stir for 30 seconds.
Add the beans, the crushed tomatoes, and the tomato juice. Stir well. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Serve the chili with the cheese and sour cream on the side.

Description: 
Delicious interpretation of chili with garbanzo beans. A crowd pleaser. I add ground beef for a heartier dish.
