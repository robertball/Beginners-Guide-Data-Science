Description: 
Potatoes in dessert? Many cooks never think of the possibility. But this delicious cake gets its moist texture from Idaho spuds. We raise them here on our farm, and our son has also developed and markets potato ice cream!                                           --LaRene Reed, Idaho Falls, Idaho
