1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce
1 (12 ounce) bottle chili sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 cup crushed cornflakes
1/3 cup ketchup
1/3 cup dried parsley flakes
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 pounds lean ground beef

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine cranberry sauce, chili sauce and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir until smooth. Set aside. In a bowl, combine the next nine ingredients; add beef and mix well. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Pour sauce over meatballs. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-50 minutes or until the meatballs are no longer pink and sauce is bubbly.

Description: 
These meatballs, baked in a well-seasoned sauce, are always on the menu for our family's informal Christmas Eve get-togethers. Leftovers-- if there are any-- are a cinch to reheat in a slow cooker.
