Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans
2 pounds ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
3 celery ribs, chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups water
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
CHILI CHEESE QUESADILLAS:
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chilies
12 (6 inch) flour tortillas
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
3 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Place beans in a Dutch oven or soup kettle; add water to cover by 2 in. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1 hour. Drain and rinse beans, discarding liquid.
In a Dutch oven, cook the beef, onion and celery over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually stir in water. Add the beans, chili powder, cumin and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours or until beans are tender. Stir in the tomatoes, vinegar and salt; heat through, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, for quesadillas, spread about 1 tablespoon of chilies on half of each tortilla. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of cheese; fold in half. In a large skillet, cook tortillas in 1 teaspoon of oil over medium heat until lightly browned on each side, adding more oil as needed. Cut each in half. Serve with chili.
