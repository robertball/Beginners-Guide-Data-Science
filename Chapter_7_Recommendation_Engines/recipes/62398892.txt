Ingredients:
2 cups unsalted butter
2 cups white sugar
4 egg whites
2 teaspoons vanilla
3 cups flour

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Add egg whites and blend well.
Add vanilla and flour.  Mix until well combined.
Scrape bowl until dough forms a ball.  Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Form 1 teaspoon of dough into a loosely formed ball.
Place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Be sure to only place 9 balls of dough on the cookie sheet as the cookies spread out quite a bit.  3 rows of 3 dough balls works well.
Bake for approximately 12 to 15 minutes (ovens vary) or until edges are brown and centers are lightly golden.
Cool on wire rack completely.
Store in an airtight container.
