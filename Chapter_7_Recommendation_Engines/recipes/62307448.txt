Ingredients:
2 tbs Peanut Oil
1 1/2 lb Boneless Beef Chuck Roast, cut into 1in pieces
3 green onions, cut into 1/2 in pieces (we like a lot of onion so we add more)
6 cloves of garlic (we added extra)
1c chicken broth
1/2 c water
1/4 c soy sauce
2 ts ground ginger (i used alot more)
1 ts Asain Chilli paste
9 oz Vermicelli noodles (i used white rice)
3 c Bok Choy, trimmed, washed, and cut into 1in pieces (i used more)
2 c snow peas
1/2 c minced fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over med-high heat untill hot. Sear beef on all sides in batches to prevent over crowding turning each piece as it browns. Sear last batch with onions and garlic.
Transfer to crock pot. Add broth, water, soy sauce, ginger, and chilli paste. Stir well. Cover and cook on low 7-8 hrs, high 3-4 hrs (i found 3 1/2 hrs was more than enough on high). Till beef is tender.
Just before serving turn crock pot to high. Add noodles and stir well. Add Bok Choy and stir again. Heat on high until bok choy is tender crisp, about 15 mins. With 5 mins left add and stir in the snow peas.
Garnish beef with cilantro and serve while hot.
I did rice instead of noodles cause that is what my family likes. Also used extra onions and garlic. I used 5tbs of ginger paste and could use a little more. We also plan to use more bok choy in the future.
