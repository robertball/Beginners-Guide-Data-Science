Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cardamom pods
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 1/2 pounds skinless chicken thighs
1 (8 ounce) container plain low-fat yogurt
6 slices fresh ginger
4 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tablespoon sliced jalapeno chile*
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 English cucumber, peeled and sliced
1 cup thinly sliced fennel
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
Pinch cumin seed

Directions:
Toast cardamom pods in a small skillet, shaking pan, over low heat 3 minutes, until fragrant. (For ground cardamom, toast 1 minute.)  Cool. Pinch pods to open slightly.
Sprinkle the 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper over chicken. Combine yogurt, ginger, garlic, jalapeno, paprika and cardamom in a large bowl. Add chicken, turning pieces several times until well coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate chicken in the refrigerator overnight.
Make cucumber relish: Combine cucumber, fennel, onion, vinegar, 2 teaspoons oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the sugar, and cumin in a bowl; set aside.
Heat and oil grill over medium heat. Arrange chicken with any marinade on grill. Cover and grill chicken 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, until chicken is lightly charred and an instant-read meat thermometer registers 180  degrees F when inserted in thickest part. Serve with cucumber relish.
