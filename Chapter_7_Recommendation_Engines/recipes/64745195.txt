Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large (white or yellow) onion; coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh garlic
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 15oz cans black beans; drained and rinsed
2 15oz can red kidney beans; drained and rinsed
2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes with green chiles (undrained)
1 1/2 lb ground beef
Sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, sliced jalapenos and chopped chives to top
Frank's Hot sauce to top for added heat

Directions:
In medium/large skillet, heat olive oil over a medium/high heat. Add chopped garlic and onions and cook till softened (stirring frequently) approximately 4-5 mins.
Stir in chili powder, cumin, kosher salt, black pepper and ground beef. Cook approximately 5-8 minutes (stir occasionally) until beef lightly browned.
Place beef mixture into slow cooker (I use liners for easy clean up by the way) and stir in beans and diced tomatoes.
Cover and cook on low; 8 to 10 hours setting. Stirring occasionally.
Serve topped with sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped chives and sliced jalapenos (or habanero if you like the heat).
