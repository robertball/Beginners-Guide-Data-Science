1/4 cup dry red wine
2 cups beef broth
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tsp salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon dry parsley
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon browning sauce
Chipolte mayo, optional

Directions:
Allow the roast to come to room temperature, about one hour
Season it with salt and pepper
Pour the oil into the pot and press the saute function, high
Sear the roast well on all sides and remove from the pot
Add more oil if necessary and add the onions, cook until softened
Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds
Use the wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up all brown bits
Pour in the beef broth and add the ACV, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, soy sauce thyme and parsley.
Put the lid on the pot and close the vent.
Press the meat/stew button and adjust the time to 60 minutes.
Allow a natural release for at least 20 minutes.
Remove the roast and set aside
Strain the broth using a fine mesh strainer and add the browning sauce
Skim the fat from the top.
Shred the beef using two forks and add 1 cup of the broth
Divide the remaining broth into individual ramekins or other small dish
Serve on buns that are split and lightly toasted with provolone cheese
Put the bun with the meat and cheese under the broiler until the cheese has melted
