Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/2 tbl sea salt
1 tsp paprika
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp onion powder
1 tbl extra virgin olive oil
Sauce:
1/8 cup Dijon mustard
2 tbl heavy cream
1/8 cup BBQ sauce
1/2 tsp dried rosemary, chopped or ground
1/2 tsp fresh garlic, chopped fine
Main Dish:
1 double breast boneless skinless chicken
1/2 cup of dry white wine
2-4 strips of bacon

Directions:
In a large dish or bowl marinade a double breast of chicken (boneless and skinless) in the refrigerator for one hour or more.
Whisk sauce ingredients together in a bowl.
Preheat over to 400 degrees. Heat a large frying pan or skillet on the stove.  Fry the bacon in the pan, allowing to slightly brown, approximately 2 minutes per side.  Remove bacon and return pan to heat.  Brown chicken in pan, approximately 3 minutes per side.  Baste both sides of the chicken with the sauce mix and continue to brown for about 2 minutes more.  Douse chicken with 1/4 cup of the wine and allow to boil down.  Remove chicken from pan and put into a glass pan or ceramic dish, cover with the bacon and the remaining wine, and place in the oven (uncovered).  Cook for about 15 minutes, or until juices run clear.  Slice and serve on warm plates with a side of rice or fusilli pasta and hot vegetables.
