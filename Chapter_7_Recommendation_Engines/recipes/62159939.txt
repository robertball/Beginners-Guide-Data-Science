Ingredients:
* 2 cups coconut milk
* 1 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 2 cups sliced beef, chicken, or pork
* 4 tsp Vietnamese chili paste
* 3 tbsp green curry paste
* 2 cups cooked rice (cook as directed on package)

Directions:
1) Cut your meat cross-grain into thin slices about 1/8-1/4 inch thick.
2) Heat up the Wok on medium-high heat, then add 1/2 cup of the coconut cream. Add all the paste and mix well. Keep stirring so it doesn't burn. Start the rice on a back burner.
3) Heat the paste and coconut milk mixture. Add the coconut milk a 1/4 cup every minute or two, once the mixture starts to bubble again.
4) After adding last of the coconut milk, add the meat and chili paste. Cook the meat 4-5 minutes until cooked, add the basil and sugar, then cook and additional  3-5 minutes so the meat is soft. Remove and serve w/ rice.
