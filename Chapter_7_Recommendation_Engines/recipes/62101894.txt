Ingredients:
1 cup white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
2 eggs
1 cup yogurt (any kind)
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)
1 cup blueberries (fresh or frozen) optional
1 small chopped apple (optional)
1 chopped banana (optional)
1/2 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Sift the white flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon into a small bowl.  Mix in the whole wheat flour and wheat germ.
In a seperate bowl beat the eggs, and mix in the yogurt, milk, and vanilla.
Mix the dry ingredients into the second bowl and add any of the fruits, nuts, or chocolate variations into the batter.
Drop the batter by spoonfuls onto a lightly oiled frying pan and cook until bubbles appear and pop, then flip over.  Once the pancakes are cooked and have a nice golden brown color, serve them up and enjoy with any of your favorite honeys, syrups, jellies, or just plain.

This is a wonderful weekend morning recipe perfected by my mother and used time and again as a delectable family favorite.  After making the basic recipe, you can add any of your favorite pancake fillings, and don't hesitate to mix-and-match.  Some of our favorites are chocolate blueberry pancakes, apple nutmeg pancakes, banana nut pancakes, or any combination of the above (I like them with all of the above).
