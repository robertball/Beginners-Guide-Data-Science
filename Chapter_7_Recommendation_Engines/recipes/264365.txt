Ingredients:
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 large yellow squash, ends trimmed
2 teaspoons coconut oil
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
4 cups sugar snap peas, strings removed
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl and set aside.
Cut squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out seeds using a spoon. Cut squash halves into thin 'spaghetti' strands.
Heat coconut oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add onion, ginger, and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add squash strands, sugar snap peas, and shrimp. Stir-fry until shrimp are pink and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir sauce mixture and pour into the wok. Mix thoroughly. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy stir-fry with sugar snap peas. And it's delicious! Squash zoodles take the place of rice or noodles for a healthier alternative, but you can skip the squash and serve it with Asian noodles or rice as well.
