Ingredients:
6 medium tart apples (such as Pink Lady or Gala), peeled and sliced into small chunks
1/2 cup (packed) dark brown sugar, divided
8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted - divided into 2 Tbsp and 6 Tbsp
3/4 cup old-fashioned oats
1/3 cup flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon, divided
1/4 tsp kosher salt
Vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream (for serving)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Toss apples, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 2 Tbsp butter in a large bowl.
Toss oats, flour, cinnamon, salt, remaining 1/4 cup brown sugar, and remaining 6 tbsp butter in a small bowl until evenly mixed and no dry spots remain (it should be very wet and form clumps when pressed together).
Spoon apples into baking dish(es).  Spread oat mixture over apples and bake until topping is golden brown (it will crisp as it cools) and filling is juicy and bubbling, 45-60 min.  Let cool 10 minutes to let juices set.  Serve topped with ice cream and/or whipped cream.
