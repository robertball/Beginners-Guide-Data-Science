Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup diced zucchini
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup tomato puree
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain and set aside. In the same skillet, saute the zucchini, onion and green pepper in oil until crisp-tender. Stir in the beef, tomato puree, oregano, salt and pepper; heat through.
Spread mashed potatoes in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Top with beef mixture; sprinkle with feta cheese.
Unroll crescent dough. Separate into four rectangles; arrange three rectangles over the casserole. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until top is browned. Roll remaining dough into two crescent rolls; bake for another use.
