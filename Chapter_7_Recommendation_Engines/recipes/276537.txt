Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup molasses
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking dish.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl.
Place molasses, canola oil, applesauce, brown sugar, white sugar, and eggs into a mixing bowl and beat until well combined. Add flour mixture and mix, starting on low speed, until just combined. Mix in boiling water until combined; mixture will be very wet. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is rounded and edges are golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Cut into squares. Best served warm, or at any temperature.

Description: 
This was handed down by my great aunt. This is super easy and you can mix the dry ingredients and put them into a quart jar so they are ready when you want to make gingerbread; easy as a mix, and so much better. Whipped cream on each serving is a good addition.
