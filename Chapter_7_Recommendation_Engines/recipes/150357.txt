Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
1/2 cup prepared salsa

Directions:
Place the ground beef in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Season with garlic powder and oregano, and cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease, then reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the refried beans and salsa. Cook until heated through.
Warm the flour tortillas for 2 minutes in the microwave, or until pliable. Spoon 1/4 cup of the beef mixture into the center, top with shredded cheese, and roll up, folding in the ends when you get to the halfway point.

Description: 
These are wonderfully different and so good. I like to serve them with Mexican rice. Customize by adding more of your favorite burrito fillings to this basic recipe, such as tomato, lettuce, sour cream or guacamole.
