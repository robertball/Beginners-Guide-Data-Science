Ingredients:
1 pound spicy ground pork sausage
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine sausage, cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, mustard, garlic powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix gently until just combined. Roll heaping tablespoonfuls of the pork mixture into balls. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Place on a paper towel-lined plate to soak up excess grease. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Quick and simple, keto and gluten free. Perfect Game Day snack! I like this recipe best with hot sausage for a little kick, but you can make it to your preference. Serve plain or with honey mustard.
