Ingredients:
16 oz package Lentils
1 lb bacon
5-6 roma tomatoes(dice)
1 medium white onion(dice)
1 bunch cilantro(cut into fine peices)
2 chicken bouillon cube
1 Tspn. cumin
water

Directions:
Follow directions on package for Lentils, add chicken bouillon cube to water when boiling lentils.
While they are cooking.  Fry bacon (not to much you want it to be soft).  Place bacon on plate, cut into small peices.  Save grease in pan.
Take the diced tomatoes, diced onion, 1 chicken bouillon cube and add to pan that had grease in.  Then if you have a potatoe masher or I use the bottom of a cup, smash all the tomatoes and other ingredients until they turn into a liquid.  Then add the cilantro, turn heat off.
Then the lentils should almost be done, so add the other ingredients into pan including cumin.  You may need to add more water to get this to the soup texture you like.
Then cook for about 10 minutes and serve with tortillas, sour cream & green jalapeno hot sauce.
