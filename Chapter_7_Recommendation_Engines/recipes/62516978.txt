Ingredients:
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion (1 medium)
1/2 cup margarine or butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon pepper
8 cups dry bread cubes (I prefer cornbread)
2 cups finely chopped peeled apples
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup toasted wheat germ
1/2 to 1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
In a large skillet cook carrots, celery, and onion in margarine or butter till tender but not brown.  Stir in salt, nutmeg, and pepper.
In a large mixing bowl combine bread cubes, apples, walnuts, and wheat germ; add carrot mixture.  Drizzle with enough broth to moisten, tossing lightly.  Use to stuff one 10-to12-pound turkey.
If desired, place all of the stuffing in a 3-quart casserole.  Cover and bake in a 325 degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes or till heated through.

Description: 
One of my family's favorite. They don't like wet bread stuffings.  This one is hearty.
