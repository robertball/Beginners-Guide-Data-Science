Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1 egg
2½ cups flour
1 cup mini chocolate chips
2 heaping tablespoons instant espresso coffee
1½ teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350° F and grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Set aside.
Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Beat in mashed bananas and egg. Stir in remaining ingredients and pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, tenting loosely with aluminum foil if cake starts browning too quickly during bake time.
