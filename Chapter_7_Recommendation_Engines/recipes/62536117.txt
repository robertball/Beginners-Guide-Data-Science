Ingredients:
1 large bunch broccoli
1 medium cauliflower
1 lb. brussel sprouts
2 cans (10.5 oz) cream of celery soup
1/2 C. mayonaise
1 Tbsp lemon juice
3 C. shredded cheddar cheese, divided
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut cauliflower and broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Cut ends off brussel sprouts, and cut in half if fairly large. Par-boil each vegetable separately starting with the cauliflower for 5-8 minutes in a large pot of salted, boiling water so that each is mostly cooked, then drain. Arrange them in a rectangular casserole dish so they are evenly distributed. In a medium sized bowl mix together the soups, mayonnaise, lemon juice, one cup of the cheese, and salt and pepper. Spread evenly over the vegetables. Bake for 30 minutes, then sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until cheese is melted and beginning to brown.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my mom would make every year for Thanksgiving or other big family meals. My husband now requests I make it whenever the occasion arrises, and it seems to be a favorite among any crowd we serve it to.
