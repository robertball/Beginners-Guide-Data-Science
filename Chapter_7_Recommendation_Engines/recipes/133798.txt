Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups cooked white rice
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat, reduced-sodium cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
3 slices Sara Lee® Soft and Smooth 100% Whole Wheat Bread

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season chicken with salt and pepper to taste, and place in a microwave-safe dish. Cover, and cook in microwave for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until juices run clear. Let cool.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, mix together chicken, rice, and soup. Top with cheese, then with bread cubes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly, and bread is toasted.

Description: 
Just chicken, rice, creamy soup, Cheddar cheese, and soft bread cubes, mixed together and baked. This is a quick and easy dish that even the kids like! Note: If you are in a big hurry, use cooked chicken and minute rice. Can be made ahead of time and refrigerated -- just add the bread topping the night before cooking.
