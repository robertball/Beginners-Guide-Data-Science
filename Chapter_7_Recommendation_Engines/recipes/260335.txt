Beanless Chili Recipe

Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, halved and seeded
2 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 head broccoli
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup chopped yellow onion, or to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground cumin, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, or to taste
3 cups filtered water, or as needed
1 (24 ounce) container crushed tomatoes
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 jalapeno pepper, diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place squash halves on a baking sheet. Coat the flesh with 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool until safe to handle. Scrape flesh into a bowl and mash.
Remove broccoli florets from stems. Grind florets in a food processor.
Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer the beef to a stock pot over medium heat. Add the mashed squash, ground broccoli, water, tomatoes, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper. Bring to a boil. Lower heat; simmer until flavors meld and vegetables are tender, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a quick recipe to throw together and is great for chilly days. The optional broccoli bulks up the chili's nutrition but isn't noticeable in the final product. All recipes I post are made for those who need to live sulfite-free, which means these recipes are also clean-eating recipes.
