Ingredients:
1 cup low sodium soy sauce
1 cup brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon chili paste (Sambal) OR 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon ground paprika
5 pounds skinless chicken thighs - boneless is best
Garnish with sesame seeds and green onions.

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, onion, ginger, black pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes, sambal chili paste, and paprika in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken thighs, and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, preferably 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the chicken thighs on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 5 - 7 minutes per side.
