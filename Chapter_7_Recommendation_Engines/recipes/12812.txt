Ingredients:
1 pound shrimp, heads off and unpeeled
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup zesty Italian dressing
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wash shrimp and drain well.
Melt margarine/butter in a one quart casserole dish.  Add salad dressing, lemon juice, black pepper and garlic powder.
Add shrimp to the casserole dish. Stir gently to cover the shrimp with the mixture. Cover and bake, stirring occasionally for 25  to 30 minutes or until shrimp are pink.
Serve the shrimp hot on a large platter and place the sauce in individual bowls so that you can easily 'dunk' bread in the sauce!

Description: 
This is a sure winner in any home. Be sure and cover the table with old newspapers to gather the shells and make clean up easy.  Make sure to have warmed French bread to dunk in the 'sauce'!  Bibs would be nice to protect your clothing from the sauce but not necessary.
