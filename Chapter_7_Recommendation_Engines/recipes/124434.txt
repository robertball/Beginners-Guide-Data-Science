Description: 
'MY AUNT made a mighty breakfast that revolved around 'The Big Pancake'. I always enjoyed watching as she poured the batter into her huge iron skillet, then baked the confection to perfection in the oven.    'The delicious result defied description! It was a sort of combination pancake, waffle and cruller.    'Sprinkled with powdered sugar and garnished with wedges of lemon, this crispy, golden-brown treat--which covered a dinner plate!--was as delightful to the eye as it was to the palate.'
