Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2 large sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon dried dill

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees.
Peel and cut sweet potatoes into small cubes.
Cut bacon into small pieces (I like to cut lengthwise and then into small pieces crosswise).
Toss together all ingredients in a large bowl and place into preheated air fryer.
Cook for 12-16 minutes, checking and stirring at 10 minutes and then every three minutes, until crispy and browned.
