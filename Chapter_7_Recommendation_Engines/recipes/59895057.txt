Description: 
This is a no fuss sloppy joe recipe.  The tomato flavor intensifies as the sauce reduces down with the meat and the onions.  I left out the bell peppers since they are so expensive, especially when you are only using 1/4 cup.  If you like the flavor the pepper adds to the recipe try a can of diced green chiles in place of the bell pepper.Modified from: Sloppy Joes II
