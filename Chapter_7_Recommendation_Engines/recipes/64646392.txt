Ingredients:
60 g canned tuna
1/4 piece yellow onion
1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon mustard
4 slices bread
3 pieces fish cakes (chikuwa)
1 piece myoga (Japanese ginger)
30 g cheese, for pizza
1 pinch pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Finely mince a quarter piece of yellow onion then combine it with the tuna in a bowl. Add a tablespoon of finely grated parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and a teaspoon of mustard. Mix all the ingredients until it is well-combined.
Spread the tuna mixture evenly on top of two slices of bread.
Slice the chikuwa in half along its length then distribute it evenly on top of two slices of bread.
Slice the myoga thinly along its length then spread the myoga slices on top of the chikuwa.
Add some more grated cheese on top then sprinkle with about a pinch of pepper on each bread.
Preheat your sandwich maker.
Toast the sandwich until it is brown and crispy which usually takes about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This sandwich toast has a delicious tuna-mayo filling combined by my favorite Japanese fish cake called chikuwa. I gave this sandwich toast a distinct tang taste by using Japanese ginger. This sandwich toast is also filled with cheese which really goes well with the tuna and fish cake.
