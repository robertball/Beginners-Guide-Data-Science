Ingredients:
1 cup Rice Flour
1 tbsp granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup shortening
3 tbsp cold water
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine rice flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.
Cut in shortening until mixture is crumbly.
Combine water and vanilla extract and add to flour mixture.
Work the dough to desired dimensions. You don't need to worry about overworking it because it doesn't toughen. It's also super fragile so handle carefully!
Bake this according to your recipe, if using separately, 5 mins @ 375 F will do!
