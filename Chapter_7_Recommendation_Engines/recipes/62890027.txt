Ingredients:
2 boxes of Jiffy Cornbread Mix
1 bunch of green onions, chopped
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup sweet pickles, chopped
1 cup of cooked and crumbled bacon (reserve 1/4 cup to sprinkle on top of salad)
1 3/4 cup mayonmaise
1/2 cup pickle juice
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)
1 tablespoon chives (if desired for garnish)

Directions:
Bake Jiffy cornbread mix according to directions; cool, crumble into large mixing bowl.  Add chopped green onions, chopped tomatoes, chopped pickles, 3/4 cup bacon, 1/4 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 pickle juice.  Toss together until well mixed.  May use more pickle juice to have consistency you desire.  I like mine fairly crumbly.
In separate bowl, combine 1 cup mayonnaise and remaining 1/4 cup sugar, and remaining 1/4 cup pickle juice and mix until sugar is dissolved.  May add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice for more tartness if desired.  Place cornbread mixture in a serving dish and spread mayonnaise dressing on top.  Sprinkle with chives and reserved bacon crumbles for garnish.  Chill until ready to serve.

Description: 
This recipe was shared with me by a dear friend many years ago.  It has been a favorite ever since.  As I've tweaked it to my own taste, you may find it interesting to do the same.  Some like to use Ranch dressing instead of mayo, or dill pickles instead of sweet.  Just as a tossed salad, you may add your favorite ingredients.  Have fun!
