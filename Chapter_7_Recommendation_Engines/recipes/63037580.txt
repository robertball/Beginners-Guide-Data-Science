Ingredients:
2 medium garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 cups Prego Very Veggie
2 TBLS fresh basil
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
1/4 cup white flour
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast; beaten to 1/2 inch thickness
2 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup dry Panko crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
8 ounces spaghetti or linguine
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup grated part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup grated Provolone

Directions:
Put chicken pieces between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, using mallet.
Cover chicken with salt & pepper, then sprinkle with flour.
In a pie pan, beat egg until well-blended. In another pie pan, mix Panko crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan
Working one cutlet at a time, dip both sides of each in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. Let chicken set for 10-15 minutes to seal.
Heat 1/2 cup oil over medium-high heat in a 12-inch skillet. When oil starts to shimmer, add cutlets and saute until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes total.
Transfer cutlets to baking dish. Top each with pasta sauce, Mozzarella, basil, Parmesan, Provolone, drizzle with olive oil. Bake 15 minutes at 350.
Cook pasta according to directions.
