Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
8 drops food coloring
3/4 cup chocolate hazelnut spread
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and food coloring. Mix in the chocolate hazelnut spread. Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture until just blended. Fold in chocolate chips. Drop dough by spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. These cookies spread.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I think the food colour for some reason makes the cookies' texture a lot better...I don't know why...but it helps!
