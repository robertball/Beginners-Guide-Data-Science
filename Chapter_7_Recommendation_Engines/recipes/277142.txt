Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup margarine
Filling:
1 1/2 cups light corn syrup (such as KaroÂ®)
1 cup brown sugar
4 eggs
3 tablespoons margarine
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 (11 ounce) package chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan.
Stir flour, white sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in 2/3 cup margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
While the crust is baking, prepare the filling by mixing corn syrup, brown sugar, eggs, margarine, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in pecans.
Remove the crust from the oven and sprinkle with chocolate chips. Spread filling evenly over the chocolate chip covered crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares.
