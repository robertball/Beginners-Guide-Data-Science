Ingredients:
1 and 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts or tenders
2 cups Diamond of California pecan halves
3 Tablespoons almond flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika1
2 large eggs
chopped parsley for garnish, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat/parchment paper or coat heavily with nonstick spray. Set aside.If using chicken breasts, pound down and cut into strips. Set aside. Pulse 1/2 cup of pecan halves in a food processor or a blender until fine crumbs are formed. In one of the medium bowls from step 1, mix the pecan crumbs with flour, salt, pepper, and paprika. Set aside.Pulse the remaining pecan halves into coarse crumbs--larger pieces than the ground pecans from step 3. Pour them into another medium bowl. Finally, whisk the 2 eggs until beaten in the 3rd medium bowl.Coat each chicken strip in the flour/ground pecan mixture, shaking off any excess. Then, dip in egg. Then, generously roll in the coarsely chopped pecans, shaking off any excess. Place the chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet.Bake for 10 minutes. Turn each piece over and continue baking, about 10 minutes more.
Make ahead tip: Chicken fingers freeze well, up to 2 months. Bake frozen for about 18 minutes (flipping once) at 300F degrees
