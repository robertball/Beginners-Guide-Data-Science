Ingredients:
1 box cake mix (or homemade) for 6 cupcakes--I used half of the recipe for simple 'n' delicious chocolate cake on this site
1 small container of your favorite ice cream (about 1.5 quarts), thawed
1-16 oz container of frosting (or homemade)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease or line 12 cupcake molds.
Make cake mix according to directions.  Drop 1 1/2-2 T of batter into each cup.  Bake for 8-10 minutes.  (You can pre-bake another batch of cupcakes or a regular small cake with any leftover batter.  The recipe I used made a small 5" cake as well.)  When a toothpick comes out clean, remove cupcakes from oven and allow to come to room temp.  Cover and freeze for 4 hours, or until hard.
Scoop 1/2 c of ice cream (more or less to fill each cupcake full) into each cup and evenly spread out.  Cover and return to freezer for 4 more hours, until frozen.
Frost and decorate the cupcakes anyway you wish.  Refreeze or serve fresh.  Enjoy!

Description: 
Time consuming, but easy, and with hundreds of possibilites (cakes, frostings, and ice creams)-- this is sure to be a new favorite!  You can easily double this recipe if they dissappear! (24 cupcakes need less than 12 cupcakes worth of batter.)
