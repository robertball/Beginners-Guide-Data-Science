Ingredients:
3 slices turkey bacon, diced
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, with liquid
1 cup chicken stock (more as needed)
1 teaspoon salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place turkey bacon, onion, garlic, and jalapeno in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook until the onions are transparent.  Turn the heat to low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the onions have caramelized to a deep brown, about 1 hour.
Pour in the beans, and mash roughly with a potato masher.  Pour in 1 cup of chicken stock and bring to a simmer; simmer about 1 hour, stirring occasionally, adding more chicken stock as needed to achieve desired consistency.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in cilantro just before serving.
