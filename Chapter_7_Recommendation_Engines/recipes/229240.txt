Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can sweet peas, partially drained
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, undrained
2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste

Directions:
Empty sweet peas and cannellini beans into a saucepan; cook and stir over medium-high heat until heated through and 1/3 of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir butter into pea mixture until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.
Stir Parmesan cheese and black pepper into pea mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until creamy and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I'm a little bit Italian, but I certainly can't say much in Italian. That's okay, because this recipe speaks for me. This was one of those, 'What can I do with what I have in the cupboard?' recipes, partially inspired by trying Cacio e Pepe ('Cheese and Pepper') earlier this year. It turned out great and I think you'll think so too! Serve with your favorite Italian main dish and enjoy!
