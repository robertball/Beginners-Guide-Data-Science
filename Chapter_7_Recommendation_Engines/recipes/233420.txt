Ingredients:
1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
2/3 cup unsweetened vanilla-flavored almond milk
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
2/3 cup crushed ice cubes

Directions:
Place apple in a plastic microwave-safe bowl; pour in enough water to cover 1/4-inch of the bottom of bowl. Partially cover bowl with a lid or paper towel. Microwave in 1 minute intervals until apple is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Freeze apple in the same container with water until solid, 2 hours to overnight.
Blend frozen apple, almond milk, and pumpkin puree in a blender until smooth; add brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Blend until smooth. Add ice and blend until smooth.
