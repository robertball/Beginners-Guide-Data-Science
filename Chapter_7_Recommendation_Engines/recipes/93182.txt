Ingredients:
3/4 cup well-drained mixed olives
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease cookie sheets or spray with cooking spray. In blender or food processor, place olives, oil and garlic powder; cover and blend until finely chopped.
Unroll dough and separate into 4 rectangles. Press each to form 7x4-inch rectangle; press perforations to seal. Brush dough rectangles with beaten egg. Evenly spread olive mixture on 2 of the rectangles. Top with remaining 2 rectangles, egg-brushed side down; press down.
With thin sharp knife, cut each filled rectangle crosswise into 8 strips. Place strips 1 inch apart on cookie sheets, twisting each 2 or 3 times. Brush tops of strips with beaten egg. Sprinkle strips lightly with cheese.
Bake 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm or cool.
