Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) box whole wheat rotini pasta
2 cups garlic mushroom marinara sauce
1 cup chopped kimchi
½ cup shredded cooked chicken
½ cup diced white onion
1 tablespoon red chile paste
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon chopped scallion

Directions:
Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 15 minutes; drain and transfer to a bowl.
Bring marinara sauce to a simmer in a saucepan. Add kimchi, chicken, onion, and red chile paste; stir until completely mixed and heated through, about 5 minutes.
Mix butter into pasta and toss to coat. Pour marinara sauce over pasta and top with scallions.
