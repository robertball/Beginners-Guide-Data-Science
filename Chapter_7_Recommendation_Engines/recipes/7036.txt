Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons shortening
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups raisins

Directions:
Scald milk.
Soften yeast in warm water; let stand 5 minutes.
Pour scalded milk over sugar, shortening, and salt in a bowl. When lukewarm, blend in raisins and 1 cup flour.
Stir in yeast and beat well. Add 3 cups flour, continue beating until smooth. Beat in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn on lightly floured surface; let rest about 5 minutes.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl; turn to bring greased surface to top. Cover, let stand in warm place until dough is doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch down, cover, and let rise again until almost doubled in bulk.
Turn on lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half; let rest 5 to 10 minutes.
Shape into loaves. Place in 2 greased loaf pans 9 1/2 x 5 1/4 x 2 3/4 inches. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake in a 400 degree F (205 degrees C) oven for about 50 minutes.
