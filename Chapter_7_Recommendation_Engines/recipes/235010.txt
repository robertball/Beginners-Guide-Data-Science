Description: 
One of our town's ancient citizens, Mabel Hill, passed away recently, but thanks to her grandniece, I was able to obtain her famous 'KahluaÂ®' recipe. For over 70 years, Hollis, New Hampshire people have been enjoying this holiday beverage! There is a scant amount more than the 5 pints, which I save for baking or to throw in my cocktail while making it.
