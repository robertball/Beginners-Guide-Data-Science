1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak, cut in half
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, sliced

1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a skillet, brown steak in oil; transfer to a slow cooker. In the same skillet, saute onion for 1 minute. Gradually add water, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan.

'My slow cooker gets lots of use, especially during the hectic summer months,' notes Michelle Armistead from Keyport, New Jersey. 'I can fix this flank steak in the morning and forget about it until dinnertime. I serve it with noodles and a tossed salad.'
