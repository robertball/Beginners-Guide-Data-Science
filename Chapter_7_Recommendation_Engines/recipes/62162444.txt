1/4 cup orange juice
1 Tablespoon honey
2 Teaspoon chile paste

Directions:
Make a cut at the joint where the leg and thigh meet but don't cut all the way through.
Combine the salt, chile powders, cumin, paprika, pepper and garlic powder.  Rub thoroughly all over the chicken and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Lightly coat the chicken with oil and bake in 375 degree oven for 45 mins.
While the chickens cooking add the mango nectar, rum, lime juice, orange juice, honey and chile paste to a nonstick pan over med-high heat.  Reduce until a thick glaze is formed -about 10 mins.
Prepare the grill and brush the chicken w/ the glaze.  Grill over med heat for 10-15 mins till juices run clear brushing with the remaining glaze.

Description: 
The chicken is rubbed with a simple blend of Mexican spices and and baked for the initial cooking, then finished on the grill with tangy sweet glaze that's got just enough heat.  The glaze works equally well on grilled pork chops.  My family prefers leg quarters but any chicken will work by simply adjusting the cooking time.
