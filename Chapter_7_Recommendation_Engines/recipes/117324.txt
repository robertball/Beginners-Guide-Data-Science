Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups yellow cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 cups boiling water
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1/2 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 (26 ounce) jar garden-style spaghetti sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine cornmeal and salt. Gradually add boiling water, whisking constantly. Cook and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes or until mixture comes to a boil. Remove from the heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese.
Spread polenta into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook sausage in oil over medium heat for 5 minutes or until no longer pink; drain. Add spaghetti sauce; cook for 5 minutes or until heated through.
Spread over polenta; sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake 12-15 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.
