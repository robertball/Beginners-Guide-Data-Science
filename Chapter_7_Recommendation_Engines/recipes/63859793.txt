Ingredients:
Huge bag of garlic, peeled and diced
Gallon of olive oil
Can of anchovies
Stick of butter
Loaf of crusty bread
Assortment of other ingredients provided by guests: cabbage, mushrooms, beef, chicken, prawns, onion, Brussels sprouts, Swiss cheese, venison, etc.

Directions:
Dice the garlic and place 2 - 3 CUPS of the diced garlic in an electric fry pan;
Add olive oil so it is about 1 inch deep in the fry pan;
Add anchovies;
Turn fry pan to low setting and allow to simmer for at least an hour - you want it so the bubbles are forming, but it is not quite boiling; stir occasionally;
Add 1 stick of butter 30 minutes before your guests arrive;
Arrange the different ingredients (provided by your guests)around the fry pan;
Explain that each person claims a spot in the fry pan and adds whatever ingredients they want;
Once their ingredients are cooked, they scoop their section out and place it on top of a piece of the crusty bread, thus making room for another guest to prepare their serving in the fry pan;
Expect your house to reek of garlic - I mean eye watering garlic - the trick is to get the pans OUTSIDE before you go to sleep for the night;
Clean up in the morning.

Description: 
This recipe and different variations on it are tradition in Roslyn, WA. It originates from the Piedmont region of Italy, and literally translated means hot bath. In Italy, and in Roslyn, it is typically a communal/party food where guests bring the various ingredients. Bagnas were usually held in the winter, when people didn't have as much food available - so friends and neighbors would come together for this dish, each bringing what was available.
