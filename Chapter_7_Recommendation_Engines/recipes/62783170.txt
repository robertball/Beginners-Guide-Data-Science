Ingredients:
1 pre-made angel food cake
16 oz. tub of cool whip topping (or as needed)
2 tbsp. lemon juice
1 lb. fresh strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Fold lemon juice into cool whip until evenly mixed
Using a bread knife, cut the angel food cake into 3 layers (so you have three cake rings).
Top the base layer 1/2 inch thick with cool whip. Lie strawberries flat on cool whip layer.
Line bottom of the middle layer with cool whip and place on top of base layer.
Again, spread cool whip 1/2 inch on top and cover with strawberries.
Again, spread thin layer of cool whip on bottom of top layer and place on top of the cake.
This time, spread cool whip smooth over entire cake. Arrange strawberries around edges and on top for presentation. Garnish with lemon zest. Store refrigerated.
