Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup toffee baking bits
1 cup chocolate chips
1 tablespoon toffee baking bits, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat brown sugar, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Stir in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir in 1 cup toffee bits and chocolate chips. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 23 to 28 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon toffee bits.

Description: 
Yum, these toffee blondies are one of my favorites treats out there. For those who don't know, blondies are 'white' brownies. But just as delicious! (Maybe a little more?!)
