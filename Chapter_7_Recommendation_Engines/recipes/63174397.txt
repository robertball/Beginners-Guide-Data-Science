Ingredients:
2  carton of liquid eggs
1/2 cups milk
1  teaspoon salt
1/4 cup bacon fat
2 pounds breakfast sausage, pureed
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 red onion, diced
4 tomatos, diced
3 peppers, diced
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
40 flour tortillas

Directions:
Whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt in a large bowl. Heat bacon fat on flat top grill over medium-high heat. Pour in the egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set, about 3 minutes. Chop the cooked eggs and place in a large bowl. Set aside.
Grill sausage peppers and onions over medium heat and stir in garlic. Cook and stir for 5 minutes. Continue cooking and stirring until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Combine the sausage mixture with the eggs and tomatos. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then stir in the Cheddar cheese.
Place a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon some of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of the tortilla. Flatten the filling into rectangle shape with the back of a spoon. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges.  Roll the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Tightly wrap the pan of burritos with plastic wrap and Refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat on flat top until hot, 3 to 4 minutes, before serving.
