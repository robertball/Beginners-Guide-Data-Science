Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package radiatore pasta
½ pound bacon
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces
¾ cup white wine
2 large tomatoes, cut into bite size pieces
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Set bacon aside to drain on paper towels. Drain all but 1 tablespoon bacon grease, then saute chicken until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Break bacon into pieces, and return to skillet. Stir in wine and tomatoes. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning. Simmer until tomatoes are cooked, about 20 minutes. Serve sauce over cooked pasta.

Description: 
This dish is heavenly. It is easy to make (my husband makes it all the time) and I have yet to make it for someone who doesn't ask for the recipe.
