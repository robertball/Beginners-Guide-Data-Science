Ingredients:
4 cups hulled and crushed Strawberries
2 ripe Bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
1/4 cup Lemon Juice (optional)
4 1/2 cups granulated Sugar
1 pkg Liquid Pectin

Directions:
Stir the crushed berries, mashed bananas, lemon juice and sugar together in a large pot, keep stirring so the sugar doesn't burn.
Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat.
Let the jam boil for one minute, stirring constantly.
Remove jam from heat and add the package of liquid pectin.
Continue stirring the jam and pectin together for 5 minutes.
Skim foam off of the top of the jam, if needed, into a bowl.
Can warm jam into sterilized jars. Let them cool.

Description: 
I've been wanting to make a jam like this for a while but I hadn't been able to find a recipe that used the ingredients I had.  I played around a bit and made my own recipe.  Even my husband, who doesn't like bananas, is eating this jam with a spoon!  It was a huge hit at school; great with ice cream, on a scone, or on its own!
