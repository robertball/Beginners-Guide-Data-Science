Ingredients:
2 Idaho potatoes, flesh only
1/4 cup pepper Jack cheese
1/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup milk
1 1/2 scallion, whites, sliced
2 dashes black truffle oil
Salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste
For garnish:
Monterey Jack cheese
Scallions, greens
Black truffle oil

Directions:
Pierce potatoes with a fork all over and bake at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.
When the potatoes are done, cut into 3-inch pieces and scoop out flesh (but leave about 1/8-inch attached to skins) into the bowl of a stand mixer.
While the potato is still hot, mix in sour cream and milk in a mixer with the paddle attachment until smooth.
When mixture is smooth, add  the rest of the ingredients.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Fry the skins in hot oil until crispy. Drain on a wire rack or paper towels.
Add cheese to the top of 3 potatoes.
Place 3 of the pre prepared potatoes into a small baking pan in a straight line.
Place into a 300 degree oven until heated through and lightly browned on top.
Top with scallions and a touch of oil.
