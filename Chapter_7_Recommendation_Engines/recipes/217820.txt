Ingredients:
6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless salmon fillets
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat the broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with nonstick foil. Arrange the salmon fillets on the baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Reserve.
Bring the ketchup, soy sauce, lemon juice, honey, lemon zest and garlic to a boil in a small saucepan; stir occasionally. Cool to room temperature. Brush half the ketchup mixture over the top of the salmon. Broil the salmon for 2 minutes.
Remove the pan from the oven. Carefully turn the salmon over. Brush with the remaining glaze. Broil for 2 minutes. Sprinkle the tops of the salmon fillets evenly with sesame seeds to create a crust. Broil for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
