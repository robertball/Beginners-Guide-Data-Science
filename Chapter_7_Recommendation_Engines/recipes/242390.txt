Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups grated yellow squash
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup blueberry syrup (such as Stonewall KitchenÂ® Wild Maine)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch bread pan.
Whisk squash, honey, blueberry syrup, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; add blueberries and walnuts. Stir flour mixture into squash mixture just until combined; pour into prepared bread pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I started this bread because I needed to bake something to bring as a gift to someone's house and quickly found that my ingredients were limited to a few summertime fruits and veggies and not much else. As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.
