Ingredients:
2 large red bell peppers ( or orange)
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
3-4 sprigs of fresh parsley-coarsely chopped
1 large fresh garlic clove-finely chopped
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place on a baking sheet or rack about 4-5 inches from broiler or directly on a grill or gas burner.
When the skin of the pepper is black and looks burnt, it is ready to be turned. Continue turning each pepper until each side is blackened.
Place peppers inside a brown paper bag or in a covered bowl. The steam from this will loosen the skin from the pepper, making it easy to remove. Set aside to cool.
When cool enough to handle, peel off the charred skin, remove the core and all seeds. Do not rinse them under water. This will rinse away the flavor.
Tear into filets. Add the oil, garlic and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Toss.
