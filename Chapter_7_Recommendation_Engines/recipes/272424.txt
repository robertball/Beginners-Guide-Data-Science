Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, crushed
2 pounds lamb stew meat
1 onion, coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons curry powder
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
2 cups beef stock
1 (15 ounce) can light coconut milk
1 large sweet potato, peeled and diced
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup chopped dried pineapple
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup raisins
1 dash crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add lamb meat and onion and cook until meat is browned and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder and soy sauce and cook 3 minutes more. Add red and yellow bell peppers and cook 3 to 5 minutes.
Add beef stock, coconut milk, sweet potato, dried apricots, dried pineapple, orange juice, raisins, and red pepper flakes to the Dutch oven with the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 2 hours until meat is cooked through.

Description: 
This luscious lamb stew has layers of Moroccan flavor that just don't quit. It might be too spicy for some tastes, but this can easily be toned down to suit your taste. It's best if made a day ahead to let the flavor develop. Serve over rice or couscous, or just eat it up with plenty of good fresh French bread.
