Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups milk
2 pounds brown sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine milk and sugar. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Remove from the heat and stir in margarine, peanut butter and vanilla.  Quickly spread into a 9x13 inch dish.  Allow to cool almost completely before cutting into squares.  Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
This is a great treat that can be made with ingredients that everyone has in their cupboards. It is my grandmother's recipe.   It makes a good gift when put into boxes and keeps for a very long time in regular temperatures.
