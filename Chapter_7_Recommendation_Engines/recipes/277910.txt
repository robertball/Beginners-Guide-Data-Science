Preheat an electric smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Place shrimp in a bowl. Add oil, paprika, and parsley and stir gently to coat. Transfer to a 6x8-inch baking sheet.
Smoke shrimp in the preheated smoker until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Shrimp take on a smoky flavor nicely in the short time it takes to cook them, so I like to keep the seasoning simple so that the smoky flavor is the star. I use hickory chips but feel free to use wood of choice.
