Ingredients:
1 Cup Water
3 Cups Whole Milk
1 Cup farina cereal (aka Cream of Wheat)
1/4 Cup Apple Butter
1/2 Cup Pure Maple Syrup
Splash of milk or cream (optional)
Sprinkle of cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
In a nice heavy saucepan, combine water and milk, bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, slowly sprinkle the farina in while whisking to keep out the lumps. Return to a boil, then turn down to low and continue to stir until thickened. Add the apple butter and maple syrup, mix well. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for five minutes. Top with milk or cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
