Ingredients:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
1 (16 ounce) can prepared vanilla frosting
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
3 tablespoons grated orange zest
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch pans. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, walnuts and butter.  Divide mixture evenly between the prepared pans.  Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cake mix, water, orange juice and oil until blended.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the orange zest.  Pour the mixture evenly over the crunch layer in the pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and cool completely before frosting. Frost (crunch side up) between layers, on top and sides. Arrange orange sections on top, then refrigerate.
To make the frosting:  In a medium bowl, beat the vanilla frosting until light and fluffy, then mix in the whipped topping.  Stir in the orange and lemon zest.  Use frosting on completely cooled cake layers.
