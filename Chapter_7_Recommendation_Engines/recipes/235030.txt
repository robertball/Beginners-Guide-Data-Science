Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar and lemon juice, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls egg mixture onto a baking sheet, making little peaked mounds.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and dry on the outside yet soft and no longer gooey on the inside, 15 to 20 minutes.
