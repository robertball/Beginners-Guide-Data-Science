Ingredients:
1/3 cup raisins
1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 cups water
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
3 saffron threads, crumbled, or to taste

Directions:
Place raisins into a bowl, cover with boiling water, and let stand to plump.
Place sweet potatoes into a saucepan, cover with 2 cups water, and bring to a boil. Add honey, butter, salt, cinnamon, black pepper, turmeric, and saffron to potatoes; reduce heat to low. Simmer until potatoes are tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain raisins and stir into sweet potato mixture.
Continue to simmer until mixture has thickened, about 10 more minutes. Let cool before serving.
