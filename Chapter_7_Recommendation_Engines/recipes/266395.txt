Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup almond milk, at room temperature
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Streusel Topping:
1/3 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and slightly cooled
1/2 cup pecan pieces, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a jumbo 6-cup muffin tin and 1/2 of a standard muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix almond milk and vinegar together. Set aside until milk appears curdled, about 5 minutes.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, and salt together in a large bowl.
Whisk almond milk mixture, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fold in flour mixture using a rubber spatula until batter is just combined. Do not overmix.
Fill each jumbo muffin cup with 1/2 cup batter. Fill each standard muffin cup with 1/4 cup batter.
Mix oats, flour, cinnamon, and salt together to make streusel topping. Rub in coconut oil until large clumps form. Fold in pecans. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the streusel over the jumbo muffins. Top standard-sized muffins with 1 tablespoon streusel.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake standard-sized muffins for 5 to 8 minutes more. Bake jumbo muffins for 10 to 15 minutes more.
Let cool for a few minutes before removing from the tins.
