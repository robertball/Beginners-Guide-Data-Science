Ingredients:
Filling:
2-3 Granny Smith Apples
3 Braeburn Apples
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1/4 cup Sugar
1/2 cup Butter
1 cup Brown Sugar, packed
Crust:
2 Refrigerated Piecrusts
1 Egg white (no yolk)
2 Tbs. Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven 350
Peel and slice apples.  Toss apples with cinnamon and 3/4 cup sugar.
Melt butter in a 10 inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, add brown sugar, cook stirring consistently 1-2 minutes until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, place 1 crust in skillet over sugar mixture.  Spoon in apple mixture and top with remaining piecrust.
Whisk egg white until foamy and brush top of crust, then sprinkle with 2 Tbs of sugar.  Cut 4-5 slits on top to let steam escape.
Bake for 1:10 or until golden brown and bubbly.  Shield edges with foil during last 10 minutes to prevent excessive browning.  Cool on wire rack 30 minutes before serving.  Suggest sieving with butter-pecan ice cream.
