Ingredients:
A half dozen Portobello mushrooms (mine were home-grown!)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small bunch shallots
1 clove fresh garlic
Splash of chardonnay or other nice white wine
3 tablespoons fresh pesto
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1/2 cup shredded romano/mozarella/parmesan cheese mix

Directions:
Remove stems from mature portobello caps. In a cast-iron pan, saute in the olive oil over medium heat fine-chopped stems, shallots, and garlic, about 5 minutes or until all ingredients are softened (stirring frequently). Reduce with a splash of chardonnay for about 1-2 minutes until most liquid has evaporated (continue stirring with a wooden spoon).
Cool mixture for at least 10 minutes then drain off oil and use it to brush the tops of the portobello caps. Place caps inverted onto grilling pan.
Mix the pesto and pine nuts into the sauteed mixture, then spoon evenly onto caps. Top generously with sprinkled cheese mixture.
Grill for 10 minutes over open flame or smoldering charcoal (medium heat) from alder, cedar, or other fine smoking wood, depending on the flavor you desire. Edges of caps will blacken, but watch to be sure they don't overcook. After stuffing is bubbling and browned, remove and serve hot.

Description: 
Pesto-stuffed grilled portobellos make for the perfect summer outdoor meal. It stands alone as vegetarian fare if you serve it with fresh fruit (such as mixed chunk watermelon and blueberries); or I love it with cedar plank grilled salmon, as well. You will think you've died and gone to heaven.
