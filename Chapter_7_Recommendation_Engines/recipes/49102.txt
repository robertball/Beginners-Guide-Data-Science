Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons McCormick® Italian Seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons McCormick® Garlic Powder
1 teaspoon McCormick® Season-All® Seasoning Salt
1 teaspoon McCormick® Coarse Grind Black Pepper
1 London Broil or top round steak (about 1-inch thick)

Directions:
Combine wine, olive oil and seasonings in a large self-closing plastic bag. Place steak in bag and seal. Turn bag gently to distribute marinade. Refrigerate 30 minutes or up to 3 hours for a stronger flavor. Turn bag occasionally.
Lightly grease grill rack. Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steak from marinade; reserving marinade. Grill 8-10 minutes per side or until desired doneness. Brush with reserved marinade after turning.  Discard leftover marinade. Cut into thin slices across the grain.
