Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (15 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, chopped
5 cups low-sodium chicken broth
4 cubes chicken bouillon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 cups chopped cooked chicken
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
3 tablespoons avocado oil
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
Optional Toppings:
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1 avocado, sliced (optional)
1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place diced tomatoes with chiles, pumpkin, fire-roasted tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and garlic into the bowl of a food processor and puree until texture is uniformly smooth, 1 to 3 minutes.
Pour pureed mixture into a 6-quart pot and add chicken broth, bouillon, cumin, coriander, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat and continue to boil, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat, cover, and let simmer, 45 to 60 minutes. Add chicken and simmer for 30 minutes more.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line half sheet baking pans with parchment paper.
Brush each tortilla with oil on each side, slice into 1/2-inch pieces, and spread onto the prepared baking sheets in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes.
Ladle soup into bowls, garnish with tortilla strips and Monterey Jack cheese. Top with sour cream, avocado, lime, jalapeno, and cilantro as desired.
