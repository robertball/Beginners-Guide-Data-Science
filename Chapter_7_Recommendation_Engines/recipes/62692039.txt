Ingredients:
1 pckg Kraft yellow american cheese grated
1/4 cup sharp cheddar (optional)
1 jar chopped pimentos, with oil (mash them up)
1 tsp yellow mustard
1 tsp grey poupon mustard
1 tsp vinegar
1 tbs sugar (or more to taste)
Dash of salt and pepper
Mayo to make it spreadable, it firms in the fridge so use more than you think is called for. And only use real mayo, the light or olive oil doesn't cut it.

Directions:
Mix together all ingredients up to a day ahead of time and refrigerate.
Preheat oven to 350
Grill or fry burgers as usual then place in oven proof dish and top with cheese. Put in oven for about ten to fifteen minutes until hot and bubbly. Place on buns. Aunt Kay serves these with a light bbq slaw that she layers on top of the pimento cheese spread that makes a good tangy contrast.
