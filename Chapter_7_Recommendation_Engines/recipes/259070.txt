Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons corn oil
2 pounds beef round steak, cut into serving-size pieces
3 cloves cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons sofrito
1 tablespoon salt
1 cube beef bouillon
3 bay leaves
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons Spanish olives
1 tablespoon tomato paste

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium to high heat and saute meat on all sides until brown, about 10 minutes. Crush garlic with pepper and oregano in a mortar.
Pour wine into skillet with beef. Add crushed garlic mixture, sofrito, salt, beef bouillon cube, and bay leaves; stir to combine and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until meat is tender, about 1 hour. If meat is not tender yet, add 1/2 cup of water and continue to cook until meat can easily be pierced with a fork.
Stir in potatoes, carrots, olives, and tomato paste. Cook on low heat until vegetables are done and sauce thickens, about 20 minutes.

This is one of Puerto Rico's favorites.  My family loves it when I make this, especially my husband.  I hope you enjoy it too! Because of the time it takes, this is good to make on the weekends. Buen Provecho!
