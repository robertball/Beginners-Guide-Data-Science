Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa
2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1-1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon  cinnamon
3/4 cup of soft butter
2 cups of sugar
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 cups of coarsely shredded zucchini
1/2 cup milk
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
For Glaze:
Mix together 2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Beat until smooth.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees  Grease and flour a bundt pan.
Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; set aside.
With mixer, beat together the butter and sugar until they are smoothly blended.  Add the eggs one at a time to the butter mixture beating well after each addition.  With spoon, stir in vanilla and zucchini.
Alternately stir the dry ingredients and the milk into the zucchini mixture including the nuts with the last addition, if you are using them.
Pour the batter into a greased and floured bundt pan.
Bake in the oven for about 50 minutes (test at 45) or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in a pan 15 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack to cool thoroughly.
Make glaze and drizzle over cake.

Description: 
Given to me by a Kerry T, this cake has become a favorite recipe for her family.  I'm going to make it for St. George's Episcopal Church's Chocolate Fest 2010. It's a little bit wicked, but the zucchini has to make it a little bit healthy, too, right? ;-)
