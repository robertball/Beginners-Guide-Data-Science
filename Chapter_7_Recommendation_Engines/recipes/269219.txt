Ingredients:
3 large lemons, zested and juiced
1/3 cup white sugar
4 large egg yolks
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons coconut oil, at room temperature

Directions:
Fill a medium saucepan with 1 inch of water and heat until barely simmering.
Whisk lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a glass bowl. Set the bowl over the simmering water. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd foams, then thickens, about 10 minutes.
Remove the bowl from the simmering water. Gradually whisk in coconut oil until melted and incorporated.
Strain the curd through a fine-mesh sieve; discard solids left in the strainer. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until set and chilled, at least 2 hours.

Description: 
I used coconut oil instead of butter to keep this lemon curd dairy free. Recipes for curd use different ratios of whole eggs to yolks, but I opted for yolks left over from making meringue. The texture was really light, almost like a mousse. Yum!
