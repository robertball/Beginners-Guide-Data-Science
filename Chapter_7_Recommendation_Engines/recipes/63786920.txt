Ingredients:
3 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
4 c vegetable stock
8 medium carrots, scrubbed & roughly chopped
2 medium onions, peeled & roughly chopped
5 small cloves of garlic, peeled and broken open
1/3 c low-sodium soy sauce
1/3 c peach jam
3 Tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 1/2 Tablespoons Adobo seasoning
1 Tablespoon powdered onion
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 bay leaves
4 cups prepared rice

Directions:
Place all ingredients except rice into a slow cooker set on "low" for 3 - 5 hours.  Chicken should be pull-apart tender.
Use a large fork or tongs to pull out all the chicken pieces and give them a rough chop into bite-sized pieces.
Also pull out the bay leaves, then use a stick blender to puree the vegetables and stock.
Put the chicken back into the soup and let heat for another 1/2 hour.
Serve by spooning a 1/2 cup of prepared rice into the bottom of a bowl then topping with soup.

I love hiding vegetables in richly-flavored dishes and using spices to make them even tastier. This recipe turned out so good I had to share it!
