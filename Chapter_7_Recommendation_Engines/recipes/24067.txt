Ingredients:
3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 1/2 teaspoons peppermint extract
4 cups confectioners' sugar
3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine condensed milk and peppermint extract.  Beat in enough confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, to form a stiff dough that is no longer sticky.  Form into 1 inch balls, then place on waxed paper and flatten with fingers to form patties.  Let patties dry at room temperature two hours, turning once.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate with shortening, stirring often.  Remove from heat.  Dip patties, one at a time, into chocolate by laying them on the tines of a fork and lowering the fork into the liquid.  Let cool on waxed paper until set.

PATTY STOCKTON
Description: 
I have made these every year as one of many Christmas treats. My family really loves them, it wouldn't be Christmas without them!  When you dip, tap the fork on the edge of the pan to shake off excess. Slide the patty onto waxed paper --  you can use the fork to make a little swirl on the top to make it pretty.
