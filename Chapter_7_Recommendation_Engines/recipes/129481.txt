1 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon dry mustard powder

1 1/2 cups Scotch whiskey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Set the ham with the flat side down in a large roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, cornstarch, mustard, cinnamon and Scotch. Brush some of the mixture onto the ham, reserve the rest for basting.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting every 20 minutes, for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand for 15 minutes before removing the foil and serving. This ham is delicious served warm, at room temperature or even cold.
