Ingredients:
6 ounces macaroni
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 small zucchini, peeled and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and transfer to a 2-quart casserole dish.
Heat oil in a large skillet; cook and stir onion and garlic until softened, 5 to 6 minutes. Add zucchini, sage, and thyme; cook and stir until zucchini is slightly tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir pumpkin, ricotta cheese, and white wine into zucchini mixture.
Pour pumpkin mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir in pumpkin sauce. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 25 minutes.
