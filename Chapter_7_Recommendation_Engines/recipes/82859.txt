Ingredients:
4 large cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
3/4 loaf SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread, cubed
1/4 cup ghee
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine garlic and oil in a small saucepan. Simmer until cloves are a light gold color, about 15 minutes.  Pour oil through a fine sieve, squeeze all juice from cloves, and then discard the solids.  Add ghee, and stir until melted. Set garlic oil aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet.
Place bread cubes in a large bowl. Drizzle cooled garlic oil over bread, gently tossing to coat. Only add enough oil to coat the bread cubes.  Arrange bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake, turning bread cubes periodically, until lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Turn out into basket lined with paper towels, and drain.
