Description: 
The name sounds horrible but it's quite good! It's a cream cheese, baked bean, and cheddar cheese dip made to eat with tortilla chips. Great for college students without much money or food in their pantries - all you need is a microwave! You can pretty much add any cheese and spice you want, just keep the top two ingredients intact. And in case you were wondering where the name came from... it looks like cat vomit!!!
