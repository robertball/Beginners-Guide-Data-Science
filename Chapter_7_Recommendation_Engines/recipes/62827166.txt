Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pastry shell OR a (9 inch) graham cracker crust
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/4 cup water
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry gelatin
4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
4-6 oz.Semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional)
Fruit Dip Topping:
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1 (7 oz) jar Jet-Puffed Marshmallow creme

Directions:
Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 8 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack.
OR melt chocolate chips in a glass bowl in microwave on 50% power for one minute intervals, stirring after each interval until chocolate is melted. Add a little milk as needed to thin out just enough so it can easily spread on the graham cracker pie crust. Place prepared crust in the fridge to set while preparing strawberries.
In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch and water until smooth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat; stir in gelatin until dissolved. Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes or until slightly cooled.
Meanwhile, arrange strawberries in the crust. Pour gelatin mixture over berries. Refrigerate until set (approx 2 hours).
Mix cream cheese and marshmallow creme together. Add a dollop to each slice of pie when serving.
