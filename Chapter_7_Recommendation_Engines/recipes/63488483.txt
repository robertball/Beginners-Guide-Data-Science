Ingredients:
4 baking potatoes
2/3 cup butter
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups skim milk
1 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
12 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
5 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 bar (4 oz) cream cheese

Directions:
Bake potatoes 1 hour in a 400 degree F (200 degree C) oven. Scoop out the inside of the potatoes and set aside. Reserve the skins for another recipe or discard.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium low heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux. Cook about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually pour in the milk while stirring until all the milk has been added. Bring heat to medium and keep stirring until the soup mixture starts to get thick.
Add cream cheese, green onions, ground black pepper, a handful of bacon and most of the cheese. Stir well and continue to heat for about 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. Add potatoes last. Serve immediately.
