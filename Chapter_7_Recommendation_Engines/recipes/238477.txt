Ingredients:
1 English cucumber
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 scallions, white and light green parts only, finely chopped
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/4 inch piece fresh ginger, finely chopped
1 tablespoon hot chile oil
1 tablespoon Korean chile powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon fish sauce

Directions:
Cut cucumber into 4-inch pieces and cut each piece into quarters. Place cucumber pieces in a bowl, add salt, and mix until coated. Let cucumbers stand at room temperature until liquid has been extracted, about 30 minutes; drain.
Combine scallions, vinegar, garlic, ginger, chile oil, Korean chile powder, sugar, and fish sauce in a non-reactive bowl.
Stir cucumbers into the vinegar mixture; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate cucumber mixture until chilled and flavors have blended, at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
Great dish. I had it while I was in Korea and had to bring it back with me; the recipe that is. The dish is ready after 30 minutes, but the cucumbers become infused with more flavor after 12 to 24 hours.
