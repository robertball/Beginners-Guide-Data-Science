Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
Pour milk into a saucepan, and bring to just a simmer. Be careful, if it starts to boil, it will quickly boil over.
Meanwhile, combine the shortening, margarine and sugar in a large bowl, and beat with an electric mixer until light. When the milk is heated, gradually drizzle in the hot milk, while continuing to whip until light and fluffy.
