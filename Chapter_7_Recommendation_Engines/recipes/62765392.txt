Ingredients:
1 cup margarine (I like Blue Bonnet)
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour (plus up to 2 TBSP additional, if needed)
2 tsp cream of tartar
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
2 TBSP sugar
1 TBSP cinnamon

Directions:
Cream together margarine and 1 1/2 cups sugar until light and fluffy.
Add in eggs one at a time, mixing completely after each.
In a separate bowl, combine 3 cups flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Add to creamed mixture and mix until well blended. Dough will be very stiff, but should not be crumbly. If dough seems wet, add additional flour 1 TBSP at a time (you may not need any extra.)
Cover and chill dough 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix together 2 TBSP sugar and cinnamon. Shape dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in cinnamon sugar mixture. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet (I use parcment paper) and bake 9-11 minutes until set. They should not appear wet on top. Cookies will spread only slightly and will be high and puffy. Cool two minutes on cookie sheet, then remove to wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a light, puffy, airy snickerdoodle cookie recipe. It tastes like a traditional snickerdoodle, but has an almost cakey interior. I adapted this recipe from the one I made in 7th grade Home Economics class. I won't say what year. ;)
