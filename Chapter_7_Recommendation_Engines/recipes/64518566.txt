Ingredients:
FILLING:
2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 Tbsp milk
BREAD:
3 cups sugar
1 can (15 ounces) solid-pack pumpkin
4 large eggs
1 cup canola oil
1 cup water
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 tsp baking soda
1-1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped dates
OPTIONAL TOPPINGS:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
2 to 3 Tbsp milk
Additional chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Grease and flour three 8x4-in. loaf pans. In a small bowl, beat filling ingredients until smooth.
In a large bowl, beat sugar, pumpkin, eggs, oil and water until well blended. In another bowl, whisk flour, pie spice, soda, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, nutmeg and cloves; gradually beat into pumpkin mixture. Stir in walnuts, raisins and dates.
Pour half of the batter into prepared pans, dividing evenly. Spoon filling over batter. Cover filling completely with remaining batter.
Bake 65-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in bread portion comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. Wrap in foil; refrigerate until serving.
Just before serving, if desired, in a small bowl, mix confectioners’ sugar, vanilla and enough milk to reach a drizzling consistency. Drizzle over bread; sprinkle with walnuts. Yield: 3 loaves (16 slices each).
