1 cup creamy peanut butter (I sometimes use chunky)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 teaspoons baking soda
2/3 teaspoon salt
2 cups baking chips (semi sweet, white choc, peanut butter, your taste, your choice)
optional- 1/2 cup to 1 cup dried cranberries or raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375o. Set rack to center.
Beat together sugars, butter, peanut butter, vanilla and eggs till creamy.
In separate bowl, mix flour, oats, baking soda & salt.
Work flour mixture into sugar/butter mixture, then add chocolate (or other flavored) chips and fruit (if using).
Drop by heaping Tablespoon ~ 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 375 about 10 minutes or till golden on edges.  Cool 4-5 minutes before removing from cookie sheet.

Description: 
from the book Death on the Drunkard's Path by Jean Hager.  I like it because it can be tailored to fit your ingredient preferences.  The ingredient list has been doubled already because the original recipe just didn't produce enough!
