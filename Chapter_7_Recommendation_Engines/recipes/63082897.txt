2 large chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces
2 large or 3 small leeks, chopped

Directions:
Cook fettucini until just tender.  Toss with a little olive oil and set aside.  Saute chicken and leeks in butter and oil until leeks are tender and chicken is opaque.  Add garlic and saute 1-2 more minutes.  Add chicken broth and cook 2-3 more minutes.  Add cream and simmer until thickened.  Add cheese and walnuts and heat until blended.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Toss with fettucini and top with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
