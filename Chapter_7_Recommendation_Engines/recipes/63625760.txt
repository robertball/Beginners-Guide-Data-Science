Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), undrained
1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed
1 teaspoon onion flakes (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat the egg in a mixing bowl, then add the ground beef, tomatoes, and crushed crackers. Season with onion flakes, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper. Mix until evenly combined. Pack into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
