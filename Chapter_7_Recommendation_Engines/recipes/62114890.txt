Ingredients:
4 c. all-purpose flour
5 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. cream of tartar
1 tsp. salt
1 stick butter, divided
2 eggs
1 1/3 c. buttermilk

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients in large bowl.  Mix together milk and eggs in a separate bowl.  Heat oven to 425, and place 1 tablespoon of butter in each of two 10" cast iron skillets; put in oven to melt butter.  Incorporate remaining 6 tablespoons of cold butter into the dry ingredients with your fingers until the mixture is uniform.  Stir in the wet ingredients, but do not over-stir.  Pat out onto lightly floured surface to approximately 1/2" thickness.  Cut biscuits to desired size and place in hot, buttered skillets.  Biscuits should be touching one another and fill up the pans (*about 12 medium size biscuits each).  Bake about 15-20 minutes depending on your oven and your desired doneness.  Tip:  If you like the bottoms softer, allow the skillets to cool some before placing dough in.
