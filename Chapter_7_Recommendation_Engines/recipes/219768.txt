Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
Â¼ cup minced sweet onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) can baby clams, drained with juices reserved (such as Bumble Bee(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon dry white wine
1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce (such as Classico(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still slightly firm, about 11 minutes. Drain well.
Heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until it begins to brown slightly. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion becomes lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the reserved clam juice and wine. Simmer until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Stir in the Alfredo sauce and clams; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Serve the clam sauce over the linguine, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.
