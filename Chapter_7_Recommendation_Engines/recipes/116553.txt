Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup slivered almonds, chopped
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) jar strawberry preserves

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in lemon peel. Combine 3 cups flour, almonds, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs (do not over mix).
Set aside 1 cup of dough. Press the remaining dough into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spread preserves to within 1/4 in. of edges. Combine the reserved dough with the remaining flour; sprinkle over preserves. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on wire rack. Cut into bars.

Warmer weather calls for a lighter dessert like these fruity bars. The recipe makes a big batch, so it's perfect for company.
