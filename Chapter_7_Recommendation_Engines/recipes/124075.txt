Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup lemon yogurt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 cup fresh or frozen raspberries
TOPPING:
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter or margarine

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Combine eggs, yogurt, oil and lemon peel; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in raspberries. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. For topping, combine sugar and flour. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; sprinkle about 1 tablespoon over each muffin. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Description: 
Fresh from the oven, these attractive, delicious muffins make a great accompaniment to any breakfast or brunch. I usually double the recipe because they seem to disappear the minute I set them out.
