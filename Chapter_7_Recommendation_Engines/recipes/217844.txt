Description: 
Radishes are typically forgotten as a snack food in the U.S., instead being relegated to being diced up for salads. I recently went to Mexico, where radishes (and peppers) are served as frequently as french fries are in the U.S., and I think it's a lovely food tradition. So here's to a radish revival!
