Ingredients:
3 cold boiled eggs - mashed up with a fork
3 tbs of light mayo
1-2 tbs of dijon mustard (pending your taste)
1 tbs of yellow mustard
1 green onion - chopped
1 celery stalk - finely chopped
1/2 tsp of paprika
1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of horseradish (pending your taste)

Directions:
1. Mash up the boiled eggs in a bowl (a bowl big enough to stir everything up in)
2. Add the celery and the green onion
3. Add the horseradish, mayo, dijon, and yellow mustard.  Start with the smaller recommended amounts of the dijon and horseradish.
4. Stir everything up
5. Now add the paprika
6. Taste the salad and if you want, this is when you add more dijon and/or horseradish.
As long as the eggs were cold when you mashed them up you can eat this right away.  Otherwise, you might want to refrigerate it for a little bit.  This is great on sandwiches.  Enjoy!
