Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.4 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, with liquid, quartered
2 tablespoons drained capers
2 bay leaves
1 pinch dried thyme leaves
1 1/2 teaspoons thinly sliced fresh sage leaves
1/2 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes, capers, bay leaves, and thyme leaves. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for 15 minutes. Stir in sage leaves, and simmer 10 minutes more.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and return to the pot off of the heat. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper, then pour over the pasta and toss to coat.

Description: 
A very fresh tasting comfort food! One day my boyfriend brought home some fresh sage from his mother's garden and I wasn't sure what to do with it. I came up with this wonderful dish that has so many variations!
