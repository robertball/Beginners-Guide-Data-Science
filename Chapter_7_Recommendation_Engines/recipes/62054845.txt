Description: 
My Mom always made THE BEST sugar cookies. They were huge and sky high and a favorite by all. As an adult I like making them because they don't require being rolled out and the taste is unlike any other sugar cookie I've had.  Plus a single batch makes a bunch of cookies but you're gonna need them once folks try a bite!
