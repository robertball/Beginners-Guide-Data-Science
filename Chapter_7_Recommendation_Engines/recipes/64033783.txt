Ingredients:
2 bunches of fresh kale

Directions:
Unwrap the bunches of kale and rinse well under cold water.
Dry with a dish cloth and place the kale onto a wooden cutting board.
De-stem the kale using a sharp knife and cut it into sizes of your choosing--I recommend either 2-3 slices per leaf OR just leaving them whole :)
In a large pot, add in about 2 cups of water--just enough to cover the bottom, but not enough to fill over your steamer.
Place the steamer over your water and add in the kale. At this point, you could choose to add in any spices you desire. I leave mine plain.
Turn the heat on high, just until the water comes to a boil. Then lower it to medium-low and cover your kale.
After a minute or two, mix your kale leaves so that the most vibrant greens are on the top (the ones that are the mushiest and most cooked) and the more raw ones are closer to the water. By now, they should look slightly wilted and fit better in the pot. Cover them again and allow to cook for an additional four minutes.
After the four minutes, taste a piece of the kale. In will most likely be very chewy and still slightly crunchy. If you want yours mushier, continue cooking. If you like the texture, turn the heat off and remove the pot from the burner. Enjoy immediately or wait for it too cook slightly and store in the refridgerator in an airtight container.

Simple Veggies #2! The best way to prepare kale! Some people say that kale is bland, but if you have a fresh, stiff bunch I think it tastes very distict! It almost reminds me of broccoli while cooking :)
