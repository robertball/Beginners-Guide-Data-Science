Ingredients:
12 large mushrooms
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
3 tablespoons chopped green onions
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons port wine
1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 dashes hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove stems from mushrooms. Set aside caps. Finely chop stems, discarding hard pieces.
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in mushroom caps, garlic and green onions. Cook and stir until soft, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool until easily handled.
In a medium bowl, mix together chopped mushroom stem pieces, cream cheese, port wine, Italian-style seasoning, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, ground black pepper and hot pepper sauce.
Stuff mushroom caps with the mushroom stem mixture. Arrange on a medium baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until lightly browned.

Description: 
I created this recipe for a vegetarian friend. It is based on my Italian sausage stuffed mushrooms, but this is more 'veggie' friendly! Enjoy it! If you don't have any garlic olive oil, just use regular olive oil and add an extra clove of garlic.
