Skim as needed.
Add vegetables to the soup.
Simmer for 2 hours.
Season with salt, pepper, and parsley.

Description: 
Traditionally, this would be made with the neck but the leg is readily available, inexpensive, and as close representation of a melt in-your-mouth-tender cut of beef, it will have broad appeal.  This also is somewhere between a saucy mixture and a stew compared to a broth.
