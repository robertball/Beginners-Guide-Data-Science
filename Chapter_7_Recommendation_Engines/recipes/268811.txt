Description: 
I created this delicious gluten-free Chex® mix recipe for Gluten-Free Living magazine, and it has been a family favorite for us. Don't let the seemingly long ingredient list dissuade you. This makes a party-sized batch that you can store in the fridge for up to a week. Pull it out and share it with last-minute guests - if you can control yourself! It's savory, buttery, salty, and has a little punch of tart flavor from the cranberries. Make a huge batch - it'll go fast!
