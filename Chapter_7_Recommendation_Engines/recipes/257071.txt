Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cubed French bread, crusts removed
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground sage
1/4 teaspoon sumac powder
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
3/4 cup vegetable stock
4 ounces ground sausage
2 tablespoons dried cranberries
2 tablespoons pecans, broken into small pieces
1 teaspoon diced fresh thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes on a baking sheet.
Toast bread in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix cinnamon, sage, sumac, white pepper, and cloves together in a small bowl.
Brush acorn squash halves with olive oil. Sprinkle 3/4 teaspoon of the cinnamon mixture evenly over both halves. Transfer to a baking sheet.
Bake acorn squash in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes. Scrape flesh with a fork to loosen slightly.
Combine toasted bread and vegetable stock in a pot over medium-low heat. Stir bread around to soak up the vegetable stock and warm up, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir into the bread in the bowl. Add remaining cinnamon mixture, cranberries, pecans, and thyme; stir until evenly mixed.
Divide bread mixture between the acorn squash halves.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
