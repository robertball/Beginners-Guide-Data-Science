Description: 
I came up with this recipe years ago by combining a couple of family favorites. Easy and versatile, it's great for potlucks. I can make the sauce ahead and use all wings or leg quarters when they're on sale. This is a welcome entree at senior citizen fellowship dinners. -Phyllis Minter, Wakefield, Kansas
