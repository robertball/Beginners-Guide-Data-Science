Ingredients:
4 cups cooked turkey meat (diced),
1 tbsp vegetable oil,
1/4 cup minced onion,
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder,
2-3 cups cooked leftover bread stuffing - crumbled,
2 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough (I prefer the larger biscuits),
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese,
1 can jellied cranberry sauce.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease 16 muffin cups.
In a large skillet or frying pan, sautee the minced onion in vegetable oil.  Add the cooked cubed turkey and sprinkle with garlic powder. Add the crumbled leftover bread stuffing and sautee over medium heat for 3-5 minutes until warm and lightly browned.
Put one biscuit in each muffin tin and push dough up the sides to create a cup shape. Repeat with remaining biscuits. Fill each almost to the top with the turkey/stuffing mixture; top with cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until biscuits are baked, cheese is melted and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Just before serving dollop a tbsp of cranberry sauce on each turkey cupcake.  Enjoy.
