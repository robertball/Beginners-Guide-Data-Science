Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 onions, chopped
1 1/2 cups frozen chopped spinach
20 large eggs
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 (14 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes, drained
1 1/2 cups crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat another pan over medium heat. Cook spinach until heated through, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined and foamy. Add the onions, spinach, tomatoes, and feta cheese and stir to combine. Pour egg mixture into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 30 to 35 minutes.

I came up with this when I was in the mood for a Greek omelet but wanted enough to feed a family without spending all evening in the kitchen. Make once and done! Perfect for those breakfast-for-dinner days.
