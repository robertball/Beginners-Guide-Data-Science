Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup buttermilk
3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups grated carrots

1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
1 tablespoon reserved pineapple juice
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar

1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.

Description: 
This rich, moist cake has all the flavor, without all the fat and calories. Because it is so full of carrots, pineapple, and nuts it is similar to a fruit bread. For the best flavor, bake the cake one day ahead.
