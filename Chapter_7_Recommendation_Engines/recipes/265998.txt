Description: 
Delicious, filling, convenient, and economical - what's not to love? I got this recipe from my good friend Harriet who got it from her daughter-in-law Marlo. It tastes like a light chili, and my children and husband are very fond of it. It makes a bunch, so I always have leftovers for school lunches.
