Ingredients:
3 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth
1 1/4 cups wild rice
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
2 cups red pearl onions (about 3/4 in. wide) or coarsely chopped red onions
8 (6 ounce) boned, skinned chicken breast halves
1 (5 ounce) package garlic-herb-flavor Boursin or Aloette cheese
3/4 cup orange marmalade
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives or green onions
Salt

Directions:
In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, bring broth, rice, and orange peel to a boil; cover, reduce heat, and simmer until rice is tender to bite, 50 to 60 minutes. As rice cooks, peel onions. Add onions (whole or chopped) to rice for the last 10 minutes of cooking.
Rinse chicken and pat dry. With a sharp knife, cut a horizontal slit about 2 inches long on the side of each breast, then wiggle knife back and forth to form a pocket as long and wide as possible without piercing the exterior of chicken. Spoon 1/8 of the cheese deep into each pocket.
Spoon rice mixture (including liquid) equally into 2 shallow casseroles (each 3 qt., about 9 by 13 in.). Lay 4 chicken breast halves, smooth side up, on rice in each casserole.
Bake, covered, in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.
In a bowl, mix marmalade and pepper. Uncover casseroles, brush chicken evenly with marmalade mixture, and continue to bake until chicken is no longer pink in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 20 minutes.
Sprinkle with chives. Spoon rice and chicken breasts onto plates. Add salt and pepper to taste.
