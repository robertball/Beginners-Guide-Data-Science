Description: 
I was cleaning out my fridge when the grand kids popped in unexpectedly - of course, they were starving, so I whipped up this soup using nothing but leftovers.  I was upset that I was out of celery, carrots, and onion, so the next day, I made a new batch to add to the leftovers (not that there were many).  Randy (who hates rice) had 3 bowls.
