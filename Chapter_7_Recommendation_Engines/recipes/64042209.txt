Ingredients:
1 1/4 Cup brown rice flour
1 1/4 Cup white rice flour
1 Cup tapioca flour
1 Cup sweet rice flour
2 teaspoons xantham gum

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients.  Store in an air tight container. Flour mixture will maintain quality best if stored in the freezer or refrigerator.  Keep out of sunlight and warm temperatures.
* Substitute this flour mixture CUP FOR CUP in your favorite recipes.  If the original recipe calls for xantham gum, omit it as it is already in the flour blend. This recipe has not been tested on yeast risen doughs.

Description: 
This GLUTEN FREE flour blend is the best that I have tried.  Muffins and cupcakes come out moist, tender and with a lightly browned and crisp top.  Highly recommend this blend to anybody who loves to bake and who bakes gluten free.
