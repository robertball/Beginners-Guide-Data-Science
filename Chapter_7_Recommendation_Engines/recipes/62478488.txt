Ingredients:
1 package (18-1/4 ounces) dark chocolate cake mix
1-1/3 cups strong brewed or instant coffee, at room temperature
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil or melted butter
1 container (16 ounces) vanilla frosting
2 tablespoons coffee liqueur
Additional coffee liqueur (optional)
Grated chocolate* (*Grate half of a 3- or 4-ounce milk, dark or espresso chocolate candy bar on the large holes of a grater.)
Chocolate-covered coffee beans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 24 standard (2-1/2-inch) muffin pan cups with foil or paper baking cups.
Beat cake mix, coffee, eggs and oil with electric mixer at low speed 30 seconds. Beat at medium speed 2 minutes.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling 2/3 full. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until toothpicks inserted into centers come out clean. Cool in pans on wire racks 10 minutes. Remove cupcakes to racks; cool completely. (At this point, cupcakes may be frozen up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before frosting.)
Combine frosting and 2 tablespoons liqueur in small bowl; mix well. Before frosting, poke about 10 holes in each cupcake with toothpick. Pour 1 to 2 teaspoons liqueur over top of each cupcake, if desired. Frost and sprinkle with grated chocolate. Garnish with chocolate-covered coffee beans, if desired.
