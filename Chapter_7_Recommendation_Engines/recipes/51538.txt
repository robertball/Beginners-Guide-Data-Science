Ingredients:
1 small head green cabbage, cored and shredded
1 carrot, peeled and shredded
1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 small onion, chopped
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 slices bacon

Directions:
In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, carrot, green pepper and onion. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar and salt. Pour over the cabbage mixture, and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight.
Place the bacon in a large deep skillet. Cook over medium heat until evenly browned, turning occasionally. Drain, cool and crumble. Toss crumbled bacon with salad just before serving.

Description: 
Cabbage, carrot and bell pepper are marinated in a light dressing, and tossed with fresh crumbled bacon just before serving. One of our favorite summer salads. To make it easy, I use a food processor for the shredding.
