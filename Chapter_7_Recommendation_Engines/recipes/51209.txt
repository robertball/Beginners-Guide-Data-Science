Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 teaspoons olive oil
5 fresh mushrooms
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 cup Verdelho wine
1/2 (13.5 ounce) can spinach, drained
3/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1 (12 ounce) can tuna, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
4 slices bread, toasted

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, and saute until tender. Season with paprika, chili powder, and oregano. Pour in the wine, and let simmer for 5 minutes.
Stir in the spinach, and simmer until heated through. Stir the spinach mixture into the drained macaroni. Mix in the tuna. Combine the condensed soup and milk; stir into the mixture until evenly coated. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Crumble toasted bread over the top.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is crispy and browned.
