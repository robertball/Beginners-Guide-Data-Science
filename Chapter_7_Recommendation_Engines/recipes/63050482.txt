Ingredients:
2 pounds of small red potatoes
3/4 cup water
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp fresh thyme
salt and pepper

Directions:
Adjust oven racks to top and bottom positions, and heat oven to 500 F.
Arrange potatoes on rimmed baking sheet. Pour 3/4 cup water onto baking sheet, and wrap tightly with aluminium foil.
Cook on bottom rack until paring knife slips in and out of potato easily (poke through foil to test, about 25-30 minutes).Remove foil and cool for 10 minutes. If any water remains on baking sheet, blot with paper towel.
Drizzle 3 tbsp of oil over potatoes, and roll to coat evenly. Space potatoes evenly on baking sheet, and place second baking sheet on top
Press down firmly on baking sheet, flattening potatoes until they are 1/3 to 1/2 of an inch thick.
Sprinkle with thyme, pepper, and salt to taste, and drizzle evenly with remaining 3 tbsp of oil.
Roast potatoes on top rack for 15 minutes, then transfer to bottom rack and continue to roast until well browned (25 to 30 minutes).
Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe is designed to work with potatoes 1 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter; do not use larger potatoes. It is important to thoroughly cook the potatoes so that they will smash easily. Remove potatoes from the baking sheet as soon as they are done browning - they will toughen if left too long. A potato masher can be used to smash the potatoes.
