Ingredients:
¾ cup panko bread crumbs
⅓ cup sriracha sauce
¼ cup diced water chestnuts, drained
1 small carrot, grated finely
¼ cup chopped cilantro
1  large egg, lightly beaten
1 pound lean ground chicken

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a rack and set it in a shallow baking pan.
In a large bowl, combine panko crumbs, sriracha, water chestnuts, carrot, cilantro, and egg. Add ground chicken; mix lightly but thoroughly.
Shape into 25 1-inch balls. Place on the prepared rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
These ground chicken meatballs are a fun and tasty way to enjoy the flavor of sriracha. They make great little party appetizers, meatball subs, or a filling main dish when served with steamed rice. If you like your meatballs extra spicy, you can always drizzle more sriracha on the finished meatballs.
