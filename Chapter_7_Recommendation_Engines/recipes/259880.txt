Ingredients:
2 heads bok choy, diced
1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots - drained, dried, and diced
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts - drained, dried, and diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 scallions, diced
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
4 small garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
3/4 cup olive oil, divided
1/2 (12 ounce) package firm tofu, diced
2 large portobello mushrooms, diced
1 (16 ounce) package potsticker wrappers

Directions:
Combine bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, cilantro, scallions, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a bowl.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add bok choy mixture; saute until softened, about 4 minutes. Place mixture back in the bowl.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet. Add tofu and mushrooms; saute until softened, about 5 minutes.
Spoon 1 teaspoon of bok choy mixture and 1 teaspoon tofu-mushroom mixture into the middle of each potsticker wrapper. Moisten edges of wrappers, fold over, and seal.
Heat remaining 1/2 cup oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add potstickers carefully; cook until bottoms are lightly browned and wrappers are heated through, 1 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
These potstickers are a fun twist on dish that was once an option only for omnivores. This is vegan friendly, and though it may take a while if one opts to use a knife as opposed to a CuisinartÂ® food processor, they are very worthwhile and delicious. Serve with soy sauce, a chile sauce, or a sweet teriyaki sauce.
