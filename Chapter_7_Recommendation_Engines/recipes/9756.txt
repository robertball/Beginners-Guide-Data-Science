Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup butter
3/4 cup chopped, unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To make Pastry:  Cream together 2/3 cup butter and brown sugar.  Stir in the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda until well blended.
Separate the eggs and beat in the yolks.  Add in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and mix well.
Press mixture into the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch pan.  Bake for 12 minutes or until golden brown.
To make the Topping:  In a medium bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, chopped peanuts, peanut butter, egg whites, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Melt 1/4 cup of butter or margarine and stir into mixture.
Turn off oven and remove pan.  Let cool for about 2 minutes.  Spread topping over pastry.  Sprinkle chocolate chips over topping and return to warm oven for 2 or 3 minutes.  Spread chocolate over topping, like a frosting.  Let cool before cutting.
