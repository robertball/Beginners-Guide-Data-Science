Cinnamon Swirl Protein Bars Recipe

Ingredients:
Cinnamon Sprinkle:
1/3 C Splenda no calorie sweetener
2 tsp. Cinnamon
Batter:
1 1/2 C oat flour
2 scoops Vanilla Ultimate Muscle Protein by Beverly International (or other protein powder, but I am always happiest with the way UMP cooks up)
1 T baking powder
1/2 t salt
1/2 C Splenda
1 egg
1 C nonfat milk
1/3 C of unsweetened applesauce

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 and Grease an 8"square baking pan.
In a small bowl, stir together the 1/3 C Splenda with the cinnamon and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the oat flour, UMP, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 C Splenda.
In a medium bowl, combine the egg, milk, and applesauce. Stir into the flour mixture.
Pour about 1/4 of this mixture into the pan (it will make a shallow layer), and spread evenly. Over this, heavily sprinkle about 2/3 of the cinnamon-Splenda mixture. Spread the rest of the batter over top, spreading gently to cover, and then sprinkle evenly with the remaining cinnamon-Splenda.
Draw a knife back and forth in a swirling motion to marble the cinnamon mixture into the batter, but don't over mix or else it will be too blended into the batter.
Bake 22-28 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then cut into 8 bars.

Description: 
This is a recipe I adapted off of one by fitness model Jamie Eason to use ingredients I had on hand. It's delicious- Especially considering that it's a lower fat and calorie, higher protein baked good.
