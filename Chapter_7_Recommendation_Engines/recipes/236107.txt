Ingredients:
1/3 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves
3 tablespoons honey
1 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon chopped shallot
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
3 pounds salmon fillets

Directions:
Make a shallow pan from a double layer of aluminum foil. Place foil pan in a large baking sheet.
Arrange salmon fillets in the prepared foil pan, skin-side down. Stir basil, honey, lemon, oil, soy sauce, shallot, Worcestershire sauce, and ginger together in a bowl; pour over salmon. Let salmon marinate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Preheat grill for medium-low heat.
Slide salmon in the foil pan off the baking sheet onto the preheated grill. Cover grill.
Cook until salmon is easily flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This marinade is great for grilled salmon. It works well with any cut of salmon. However, I typically use salmon fillets. I like king salmon best, but it works well on any type of fresh salmon. This marinade is enough for 3 pounds of salmon.
