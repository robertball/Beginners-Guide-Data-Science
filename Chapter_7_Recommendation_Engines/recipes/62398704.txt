https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/429649.jpg
Ingredients:
2 (16-ounce) packages frozen corn (no need to thaw)
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons water
4 slices American cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Use a 4 to 6 quart slow cooker.
Empty the corn packages into your slow cooker.
Unwrap the cream cheese and put the blocks on top.
Add sugar and water, and fold the American cheese slices a few times, then crumble it in on top.
Cover and cook on low until everything is all melty---about six hours on low in my 4-quart. If you're using a big cooker, it'll cook a bit faster---check after 4 hours on low.
Stir well before serving.
