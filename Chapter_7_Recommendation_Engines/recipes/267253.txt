Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds Roma tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/4 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
2 teaspoons dried rosemary
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
19 ounces ground hot Italian sausage
1/2 sweet onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss tomatoes, 4 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Place tomatoes cut-side up in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft and juicy, about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, Italian seasoning, rosemary, basil, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes evenly over the tomatoes. Drizzle tops of tomatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Return baking sheet to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Cook sausage and onion until sausage is no longer pink and onion softens, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Transfer roasted tomatoes and any juices to a food processor. Process to desired consistency. Add ricotta and Parmesan cheeses and pulse to combine. Pour tomato sauce into a bowl; mix in sausage-onion mixture.
