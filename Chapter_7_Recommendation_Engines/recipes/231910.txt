Ingredients:
1 pound scallops
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice or concentrate
1/4 cup Holland HouseÂ® Sherry Cooking Wine

1 cup thinly sliced carrots
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces sliced mushrooms
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (6 ounce) package frozen pea pods, thawed

Directions:
If scallops are large, slice them in half crosswise to make thin medallions. Combine scallops and lemon juice in a shallow baking dish; cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. When finished marinating, stir in sherry cooking wine and cornstarch.
Melt butter in a large skillet over high heat. Add carrots and garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and thyme; cook and stir about 3 minutes. Stir in scallop mixture; cook until scallops are opaque, about 4 minutes. Stir in pea pods and green onions; heat through. Serve over hot cooked rice.
