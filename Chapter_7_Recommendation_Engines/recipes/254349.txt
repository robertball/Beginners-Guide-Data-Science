Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 eggs
1 pinch finely grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini cupcake mold with butter and coat with sugar.
Mix condensed milk, shredded coconut, eggs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl until combined. Pour coconut mixture into prepared cupcake mold, filling each cup to 3/4 full.
Place cupcake mold into a roasting pan about 1 inch larger than the cupcake mold. Pour hot tap water into the roasting pan until it is halfway up the sides of the cupcake mold, about 1 inch.
Bake in the preheated oven until the coconut mixture is golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Cool on a wire rack until the custard can easily be removed from the mold. Place custards into mini paper muffin cup liners.
Refrigerate until chilled.

Description: 
I have not translated the name of this little Portuguese-Brazilian pastry because there is not an English equivalent, at least that I know. The translation would be 'good bite.' 
It is a dessert that brings up childhood memories; my mom would always make it! 
It's very easy and quick to make.
