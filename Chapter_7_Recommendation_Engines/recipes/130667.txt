Ingredients:
2 (8.5 ounce) packages corn muffin mix
2/3 cup heavy cream
2 eggs
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 strips bacon, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 1/2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a small square baking dish or spray it with cooking spray.
Mix together the muffin mix, cream, eggs, sugar, oil, vanilla, and poppy seeds to make a batter.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown and the top springs back when pressed lightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely; cut into small squares and transfer to a bowl.
Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned. Add the peppers and onions to the skillet; cook and stir until the vegetables are tender. Remove from heat and add to bowl with cornbread squares; season with marjoram, pour in the chicken broth; mix. Spoon mixture into the prepared baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Your grandma ain't got no shake on this! Join the click! I know...poppy seeds?! It does, however, make for a visually-stunning dish! You can make this easy stuffing up to four hours ahead; just cover and refrigerate until it's time to bake (just add about ten minutes to the baking time). Add toasted pecan pieces, dried sweet cranberries, or golden raisins for a twist!
