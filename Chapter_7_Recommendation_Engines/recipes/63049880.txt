Ingredients:
1 pound navy or great northern beans, sorted, soaked overnight (or according to directions on bag)
1 large onion, diced
3 ribs celery, diced
1 medium carrot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 large smoked ham hock or ham bone
Water
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 cup chopped ham
Sliced green onions for topping (optional)

Directions:
In the basin of a slow cooker, combine the beans, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaf, brown sugar and ham hock or bone.
Fill with water until just barely covering the beans.
Cook on high for 6-7 hours, or low for 8-9 hours until beans are soft and beginning to fall apart.
30 minutes before end of cooking time, remove the ham hock or bone, strip off any meat, chop and return to the slow cooker. Discard the bone. Stir in Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and remaining chopped ham.
Serve sprinkled with green onions.
