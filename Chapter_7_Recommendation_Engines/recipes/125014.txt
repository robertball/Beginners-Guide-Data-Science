Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans
maraschino cherry halves (optional)

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese. Add flour; mix well. Chill for 1 hour. Shape into 1-in. balls. Place in ungreased miniature muffin cups; press into the bottom and up the sides to form a shell.
For filling, melt chocolate chips and butter in a small saucepan. Remove from the heat; stir in sugar, egg and vanilla. Add the pecans if desired. Spoon into shells. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until brownies test done with a wooden pick. Cool 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Garnish with cherries if desired.
