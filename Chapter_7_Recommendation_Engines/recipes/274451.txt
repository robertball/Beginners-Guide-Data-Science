Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/4 pounds beef sirloin steak, cut into strips
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 cups low-sodium beef broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can no-salt-added tomato sauce
1 tablespoon no-salt-added tomato paste
1 pinch kosher salt
6 ounces ditalini pasta
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained
1 (8.75 ounce) can low-sodium corn, drained
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add onion and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Reduce heat to medium and add beef, chili powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, and pepper. Cook until beef is browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir beef broth, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and kosher salt into the pot. Bring mixture to a boil; add pasta. Reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer while stirring frequently, uncovered, until pasta is tender, about 8 minutes.
Stir kidney beans and corn into the pot. Cover and let simmer, 3 to 4 minutes more. Remove lid and sprinkle Cheddar cheese evenly over the top.
