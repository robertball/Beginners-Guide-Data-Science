Ingredients:
1 pound thin asparagus spears, trimmed and cut in half
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 pinch salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the asparagus in a large skillet and fill with about 1 inch of water. Cover the pan and set over high heat. When the water comes to a boil, cook for 2 minutes or until the asparagus is bright green and almost tender.
In a separate skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the tomato to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute or until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Add asparagus to the pan and cook for about 2 minutes, until hot.

Description: 
This is a delicious way to take advantage of early spring's flavorful asparagus. A great dish to accompany large, busy meals, as most of the work can be done ahead of time and the asparagus reheated with the tomatoes and garlic at the last minute while the roast (or whatever else) is resting. Also a delicious preparation for green beans in place of the asparagus.
