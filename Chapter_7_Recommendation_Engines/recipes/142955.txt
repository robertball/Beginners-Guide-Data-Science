Ingredients:
2 cups finely chopped fresh strawberries
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup regular rolled oats
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine the strawberries with 1/4 cup sugar in a medium bowl. Toss gently to blend, and set aside.
Combine the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Stir in the rolled oats and blend evenly; set aside.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in the large mixing bowl of an electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy. Add the egg, milk, and vanilla, and continue beating until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture, and mix well to blend. Combine the strawberries with the flour mixture, and stir to blend. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until slightly brown, about 8 minutes. Cool on baking sheets. Store in an airtight container.
