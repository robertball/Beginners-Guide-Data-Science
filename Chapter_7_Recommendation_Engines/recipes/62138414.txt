Take the butter spread and butter two slices of texas toast or bread of your choice and spread as much cheese mixture to one of the slices oposite of the buttered side. Grill in a hot skillet.

Description: 
This triple cheese sandwich is absolutely delicious!! The green chili is completely optional, but my family loves these sandwiches with the green chili added! I cover the  skillet with foil as I grill each side for even melting.
