Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients.  Mix remaining ingredients until well blended, then gradually add dry mixture. Stir until well blended.  Press out on a lightly greased and floured pizza pan.  (if you want to add chocolate chips, raisins, or nuts, press them into the dough once it is spread on the pan.)
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned.  Cool 10-15 minutes in the pan on a rack, then loosen carefully with a spatula.  You may leave the cookie in the pan, but if you plan to serve it whole (like a birthday cake), slide it out of the pan at this point and continue to cool on a rack.
