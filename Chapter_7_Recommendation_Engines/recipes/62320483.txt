Ingredients:
4 to 5 cups fresh corn kernels, white or yellow (from about 12 cobs), or two 16-ounce bags frozen white corn
1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint
Salt

Directions:
Chop the mint on a cutting board, set aside.
If using frozen corn, drain between layers of paper towels until thawed, about 30 minutes.
In a wide skillet, melt half the butter over high heat.
Add half the corn and cook, stirring often, until golden and browned (kernels may begin to pop), about 10 minutes.
Stir in half the mint and sprinkle with salt.
Transfer to a serving bowl.
Repeat with remaining corn, butter, mint and salt.
