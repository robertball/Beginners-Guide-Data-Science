Ingredients:
Simple Beef Mixture:
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion, or more to taste
1 clove garlic, minced
Tostada Shells:
6 corn tortillas
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Beans:
2 cups refried beans
Garnishes:
2 cups shredded lettuce, or as desired
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tomato, diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Keep warm while preparing tostada shells.
Brush oil over both sides of tortillas and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake tortillas in preheated oven until crisped on top, about 5 minutes. Flip tortillas and continue baking until other side crisps, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Heat refried beans in a saucepan over medium-low, stirring regularly until hot, about 5 minutes (see Cook's Note).
Divide refried beans between tostadas and spread over one side of each; spoon ground beef mixture over the beans. Top each tostada with lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and diced tomato.
