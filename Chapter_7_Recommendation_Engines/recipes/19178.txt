Ingredients:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
6 apples
2 cups water
2 cups white sugar
2 cups light corn syrup
1 tablespoon red food coloring
1 teaspoon cinnamon oil

Directions:
Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and sprinkle it with confectioners' sugar.
Remove stems from apples and rinse them thoroughly.  Spear each apple through the bottom with a rounded wooden craft stick.  Dry thoroughly and set aside.
In a large saucepan bring water, sugar and corn syrup to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-high.  Continue to boil, stirring so as not to burn, until mixture reaches 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).  Remove from heat, and while stirring, add food coloring and cinnamon oil.
Working quickly, dip each apple into the candy mixture, coating well.  Place apples on prepared cookie sheet to cool.  Refrigerate for 2 hours.
