Ingredients:
Ingredients:
6 to 8 medium yukon gold potatoes (my grandma insists on them), cut into bit size pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
2 or 3 cloves of garlic, cut into quarters
1 tsp. sweet paparika (approximately)
1 or 2 dry bay leaves
2 tbsp. olive oil (approximately)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Heat the oven to 400 F.
2. Place the cut up potatoes in a flat baking pan (i.e. like those rectangular Pyrex ones) and add all of the other ingredients. Mix well so that everything is evenly distributed and the potatoes are coated with olive oil.
3. Cover with tin foil and bake until done (20-30 minutes). Put the broiler on for the last 5 to 10 min so that the top of the potatoes become toasty
4. Tastes great with any kind of roast, or BBQ
