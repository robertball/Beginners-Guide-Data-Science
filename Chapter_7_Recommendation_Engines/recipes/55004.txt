Ingredients:
1 rack pork spareribs
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 (32 ounce) package sauerkraut, drained
3 tablespoons dried dill weed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Season the ribs with salt and pepper and place into a roasting pan that is slightly larger than the rack. In a medium bowl, stir together the sauerkraut, onion and dill; spread on top of the ribs and place around them in the roasting pan.
Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the rib meat easily pulls away from the bone.

Description: 
Try out this recipe for a baked rack of pork ribs with surprise ingredient, sauerkraut, which caramelizes beautifully. Easy and delicious. I get many raves when I make this for company.  The ribs just about fall off the bone because they are so tender.
