Ingredients:
1 Spaghetti Squash
Extra virgin Olive Oil
Salt and pepper
Ricotta Cheese (you can use light)

Directions:
Halve the spaghetti squash lengthwise and remove the seeds.
Place some water and a steamer basket (or a small metal strainer) in a large pot with a lid over med-high heat. Place the two halves of the squash, cut side down in the pot and steam until tender when pierced with a knife, about 30 minutes.
Using a fork, remove the flesh of the squash onto a serving plate or bowl. Top the steaming squash with a dollop of ricotta cheese, drizzle a flavorful extra-virgin olive oil on top and season with salt and pepper. Enjoy!
