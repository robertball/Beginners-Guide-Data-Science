Ingredients:
1   pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2   teaspoons chili powder, or to taste
1   8 oz. tomato sauce

Directions:
Brown and drain ground beef and onion.
Add seasonings and tomato sauce.
Simmer, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes.
Use for tacos, taco salad, Mexican pizza, nachos...Add your favorite toppings including diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, green onions, salsa, sour cream, lettuce, and of course, shredded cheese. (We like the Mexican four-cheese blend w/o the seasonings.)
When used for nachos, spread torilla chips on cookie sheet, put dollops of mixture on chips and top with cheese.  Broil for 8-10 minutes watching closely.
If making taco pizza, spread mixture on 2, 10 inch flour tortillas, top with cheese and bake for 12-15 minutes at 375 degrees.  Add toppings and enjoy.
