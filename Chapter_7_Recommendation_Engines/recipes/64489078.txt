Ingredients:
Three Large Sweet Potatoes
32 oz. (One Box) Chicken Broth
One Red Onion
Half of a Pepper (any color)
Eight Slices of Bacon
1 tsp Oregano
1 tsp Ground Coriander
1 tsp Fennel Seed
One Handful Baby Carrots
Salt to Taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400° Fahrenheit. Wash sweet potatoes in sink, poke holes in them with a fork (to let steam escape), place them on a foil-lined cookie sheet, and bake them for one hour.
Fry bacon until crispy, and drain on paper towels. Chop pepper and add to frying pan with bacon grease, and sauté it for five minutes. Remove the pepper pieces and drain on paper towel. Chop the onion, and sauté the pieces in the same pan for ten minutes.
Pour chicken broth into pot, and add a handful of baby carrots, along with oregano, coriander, and fennel seed. Boil them until the carrots are soft.
When the sauté is complete, add the contents of the pan to the pot and heat through. When the sweet potato is done, scoop out its insides and add to the pot.
Heat through, then pour into food processor, and puree until the mixture is smooth.
Once it is all pureed, scoop it out with a ladle, garnish with salt, chopped pepper, and chopped bacon; and serve.
