Ingredients:
1 pound baby Dutch yellow potatoes
2 tablespoons butter, divided
8 fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 medium onion, sliced
6 ounces sliced chanterelle mushrooms
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup dry white wine
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and let cool. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add sage leaves and cook until crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Add potatoes to the pot; stir in mustard, olive oil, and thyme. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt; cook until mushrooms begin to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add wine to deglaze skillet.
Add cooked potatoes to the skillet with the mushrooms and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a serving dish and top with crispy sage leaves.
