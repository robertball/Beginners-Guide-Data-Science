Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) bag corn puffs (such as O-Ke-DokeÂ®)
1 cup salted peanuts (optional)
1 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Combine corn puffs and peanuts in a large roasting pan.
Bring butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup to a boil in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in baking soda until mixture foams up. Pour over corn-peanut mixture and toss well using rubber spatulas.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes, until a cooled piece of corn is crunchy, about 45 minutes.
Spread on waxed paper to cool. Break apart and transfer to an airtight container.

Description: 
Puffed corn can be found in the potato chip aisle of your grocery store. This is a great caramel corn without hulls or unpopped kernels. Warning: you need to make a double batch of this because it doesn't last long, at least not in my house. Very addicting. Love it!
