Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups margarine, at room temperature
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
First frosting layer:
1/2 cup margarine, at room temperature
2 tablespoons instant vanilla pudding mix
3 tablespoons milk
2 cups confectioners' sugar
Second frosting layer:
3 tablespoons margarine, melted
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup milk, or more as needed
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 11x17 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, beat together 1 1/2 cups of margarine with sugar until light and fluffy; beat in the eggs, one at a time,fully incorporating each egg before adding the next. Mix in 1 cup of cocoa powder, the flour, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Stir in 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and the chopped walnuts, and scoop the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes; set on a rack to cool.
To make the first frosting layer, beat 1/2 cup of margarine until fluffy, add the instant pudding powder and 3 tablespoons milk and mix until smooth. Gradually beat in 2 cups of confectioners' sugar. Spread the frosting on the cooled brownies and set them aside to let the frosting firm up.
For the second frosting layer, mix together 3 tablespoons of melted margarine with 1/2 cup of cocoa powder; stir in 1/3 cups milk and gradually beat in 3 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar. Add more milk as necessary to make a smooth, spreadable frosting. Spread the second frosting on top of the first.
