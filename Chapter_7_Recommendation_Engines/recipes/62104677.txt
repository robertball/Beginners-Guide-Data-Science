Ingredients:
4 6oz. Salmon Fillets
1 tsp. rosemary
1 tsp. grated lemon peel
1 tsp. parsley
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. paprika
1/8 tsp. salt
non-stick cooking spray
Sauce:
1oz black pepper
2oz minced garlic
4oz tomato ketchup
2oz soy sauce
1oz teriyaki sauce
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3oz granulated sugar
1/4 cup white wine

Directions:
Be sure to carefully remove any bones from your salmon fillets.
Combine rosemary, lemon peel, parsley, garlic powder, paprika and salt.  Smooth spice mixture on a clean flat surface.  After giving Salmon a quick rinse, carefully coat each side with spice mixture and place into a frying pan coated with non-stick Cooking Spray.
Sear fish until slightly brown on each side (inside should be visibly raw from the sides).
In a separate sauce pan, combine sauce ingredients, stir until blended and bring to a boil.  Add to fish.
Cover and cook on medium heat for 25 minutes.
Sauce will thicken as it cooks.
