Ingredients:
250 grams curry and yoghurt marinated chicken
1 tomato
1/8 pc kabocha
40 grams Japanese curry roux
100 mL heavy cream
1 Tbsp butter

Directions:
Take out the marinated chicken from the fridge and leave it at room temperature for 20 minutes.
Slice the kabocha and tomato into small pieces. Crush/chop the curry roux into small pieces so it will melt easily and evenly. Same with the curry roux, slice the butter into smaller pieces.
Place the chicken, tomato, kabocha, butter and curry roux in a microwaveable bowl then mix. Cover with a kitchen wrap then microwave for 10 minutes using 600W.
Take the wrap then add 100 mL of heavy cream. Mix all the ingredients well.
Bring back the bowl in the microwave, this time without cover then cook for 3 minutes.
Mix the curry well then serve with rice.
