Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup cold, brewed coffee
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine and sift together 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda and baking powder.  In a small bowl, blend together eggs, oil, 1 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla; combine with dry ingredients.  Mix thoroughly and then stir in one cup cold coffee (may use instant coffee).  Batter will be very thin but it bakes into a rich, dark, moist cake.
Pour into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan.  Bake for about 40 minutes.
To Make Whipped Cream Frosting:  Combine 1/4 cup flour and 1 cup milk, adding milk slowly and beating until smooth.  Set over moderate heat and stir constantly until thickened.  Set aside to chill completely.  Combine 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2  cup shortening beating until light and fluffy; stir in well cooled flour-milk mixture and beat at high speed until thick and creamy.  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and beat until thoroughly combined. Spread frosting over cooled cake. Enjoy!
