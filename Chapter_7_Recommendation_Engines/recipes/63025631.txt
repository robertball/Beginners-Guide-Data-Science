1 8 oz can sliced mushrooms, drained
½ lb grated cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Butter the bottom and sides of a 3 quart casserole dish.
In the casserole dish layer the ham, bread, onion, mushroom and cheese.  Repeat until three layers deep which should bring the level near the top of the casserole dish.
In a medium bowl beat together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard and paprika.  Pour the liquid over the layered ingredients in the casserole dish.
Bake uncovered at 350°F for one hour.
