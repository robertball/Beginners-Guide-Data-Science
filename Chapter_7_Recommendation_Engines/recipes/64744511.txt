Ingredients:
2 cups egg whites
1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
1 cup red bell pepper, finely diced
1 cup fresh spinach, finely chopped
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Generously grease a 12 cup muffin pan.
2. Whisk together egg whites, Greek yogurt, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and cayenne (if using) until combined. Mixture will be lumpy at first--but continue whisking until smooth. Mix in red bell pepper, spinach, and cheese.
3. Divide egg mixture between the 12 muffin cups, filling until almost full. Bake in preheat oven until egg whites are fully cooked and the bites begin to brown, about 20-25 minutes. (The bites will substantially inflate over the tops of the tins while baking. This is normal.) Allow to cool 5 minutes in pan (bites will deflate substantially at this time). Run a knife around the edges and bottoms to loosen from cups, and remove from pan. Allow to cool to room temperature.
Note: Extras may be frozen, and reheated before serving.

Description: 
My husband actually calls these 'mini egg white pizzas,' because they puff up a lot in the oven, then deflate while cooling--and end up looking like little pizzas! No matter what you call them, they taste pretty good, and make for an easy grab-and-go snack!
