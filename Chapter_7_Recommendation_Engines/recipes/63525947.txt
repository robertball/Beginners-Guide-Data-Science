Ingredients:
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, crushed or to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/8 teaspoon of garlic/chili sauce
4 (6 ounce) mahi mahi fillets
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a shallow glass dish, stir together the honey, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, ginger, garlic and olive oil. Season fish fillets with salt and pepper, and place them into the dish. If the fillets have skin on them, place them skin side down. Cover, and refrigerate for 20 minutes to marinate.
Bake fish wrapped in foil.
Pour reserved marinade into the skillet, and heat over medium heat until the mixture reduces to a glaze consistently. Spoon glaze over fish, and serve immediately.
