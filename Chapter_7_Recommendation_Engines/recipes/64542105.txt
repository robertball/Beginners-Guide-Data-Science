2 slices lean turkey
1 roasted red bell pepper, cut into 4 segments
2 tablespoons garlic hummus
1 tablespoon olive tapenade

Lay the lettuce leaf flat and spread with 1 tablespoon of hummus. Place the turkey slices on the lettuce and spread with remaining hummus. Sprinkle the olive tapenade over the turkey and top with the roasted bell pepper.
Wrap the lettuce, use a tooth pick to hold it together.

Description: 
A savory and refreshing recipe that is the perfect meal to get you beach ready. I recommend roasting your own bell pepper, since most store bought roasted bell peppers are packaged in oil. To do so simply throw it on the grill until soft and then peel the skin after it cools.
