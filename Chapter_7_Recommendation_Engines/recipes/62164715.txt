Ingredients:
1 large or 6 small patty pan (scalloped) squash
3 pieces of bacon
½ onion, minced
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1 beef bullion cube
1 cup water
½ tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste)
¾ cup white cheddar cheese (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
4-6 pieces of bread, crusts removed

Directions:
Add squash to pot of boiling water (will float in water) and boil until squash can be pierced with a fork with little effort.  When cooked, cut top off of squash (cut off blossom side for a volcano effect or stem side for a scalloped bowl effect) and remove seeds.  Use a spoon to remove the meat inside the squash and set meat aside.  Leave enough meat so squash can maintain its shape.
Fry bacon until extra crispy then set on paper towel lined plate to dry.  Pour out all but about ¼ tsp of the bacon grease.  Sautee onion and garlic in bacon grease until clear.  Add beef bullion cube, water, squash meat (from cleaning squash) and cayenne pepper.  Reduce to about 2/3.  Add cheese and melt completely in broth.  Add bread until mixture is a wet stuffing consistency.  Stuff squash with mixture.
Bake stuffed squash for 30-45 minutes or until stuffing is crisp.
VEGETARIAN OPTION:  Substitute bacon with mushrooms and beef bullion with vegetable bullion.

Description: 
I was never sure what to do with the squash that looked like little jellyfish so I stuffed it with a mixture that reminds me of a summertime Thanksgiving meal.  Even my picky children and husband like this one and we eat it with cranberry sauce.
