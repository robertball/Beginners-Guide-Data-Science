Directions:
Chop all items into 1/4" sized pieces. Mix your dressing in a mixing cup and add the fresh dill. Don't use dried. Whisk until the oil and vinegar is blended well. Pour over chopped salad and toss. Allow to marinate at least one hour. Toss at party and let the guests help themselves. I had every party guest or couple ask me for the recipe. Enjoy..... mwa xoxo Chef Bevski
