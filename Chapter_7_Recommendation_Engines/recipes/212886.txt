Description: 
Quick and tasty Indian yogurt side dish that can help cool down any spicy meal. You can also add other veggies like onion, tomatoes, or bell peppers. I ate this almost every day growing up. The leftover cucumber seeds also taste great marinated in a little lemon juice with salt and pepper!
