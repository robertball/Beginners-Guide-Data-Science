3 Cups Homemade Meat Sauce (Recipe in Footnotes)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese
12 ounces Fresh Baby Spinach
2 Cups prepared pesto (See Recipe Below)
1 egg
1/2 cup grated Locatelli cheese
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

FOR PESTO
1 bunch of fresh basil (leaves only)

handful of raw pine nuts
3/4 cup Locatelli/Parmesan Cheese (Grated)
3 TBSP olive oil (Extra Virgin)
______________________________________________
GRANDMA'S QUICK MEAT SAUCE
1/2 cup olive oil (Not Extra Virgin-that’s for dressings)
2  Shallots, Minced
2 garlic cloves, Minced
¼ Cup of Pinot Noir (Or any red wine you like to drink)
2 (32-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
2 dried bay leaves
½ tsp Tomato paste
½ lb of Ground beef (85-15)
Handful of Fresh Parsley (finely chopped)
Add to taste: Salt, pepper, Oregano,

Directions:
Pesto, spinach and Grandma’s Meat sauce more than compensate for the reduced amount of cheese in these lasagna rolls.
Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions; drain.
Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread 2 cups of the tomato sauce in bottom of a greased 13x9-inch pan. Combine garlic, ricotta, spinach, pesto, egg, Parmesan, salt and pepper to taste in a bowl.
Place a lasagna noodle on a clean kitchen towel; spread 1/4 cup of the ricotta mixture on the noodle. Roll noodle up; place seam-side down in pan. Repeat with remaining noodles.
Pour remaining tomato sauce over noodles; sprinkle with mozzarella. Cover with foil; bake 20 minutes. Uncover; cook until cheese is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Makes 6 servings.
