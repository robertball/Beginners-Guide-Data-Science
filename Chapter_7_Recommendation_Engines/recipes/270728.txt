Ingredients:
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 bunch kale, chopped into bite-sized pieces
4 medium carrots, diced
1 medium onion, diced
9 cups water
1 1/3 cups lentils, rinsed
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/4 teaspoons garam masala (optional)
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned, about 5 minutes. Add kale stems, carrots, and onion; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Pour in water and lentils; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, garam masala, thyme, dill, tarragon, and salt into the pot. Return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Toss in kale leaves and let wilt, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
The original recipe is from the Nov 2011 'Taste of Home' magazine and called Lentil-Tomato soup. I doubled the size and tweaked the seasonings. I recommend cornbread as a side. Great for cold winter days.
