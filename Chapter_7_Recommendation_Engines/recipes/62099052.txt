Ingredients:
1 bottle of basic Italian dressing (no cheese) I use Kraft.
1/4 c. soy sauce
6-8 venison steaks
1 gallon ziploc bag

Directions:
Rinse meat well.  Place venison steaks into the ziploc bag.  Pour entire bottle of Italian dressing and the soy sauce over meat.  Seal bag well.  Lightly shake the bag to mix the dressing and soy.  Lay flat in refrigerator to marinade.  Turn over every couple of hours if possible.  Marinade at least 6 hours, overnight is better.
This recipe is also great with beef steaks and boneless chicken breasts!
