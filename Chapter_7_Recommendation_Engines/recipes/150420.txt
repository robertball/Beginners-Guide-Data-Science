Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/4 cups sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
Raspberry Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
3 tablespoons fresh OR frozen (thawed) raspberries
1/3 cup sugar
Raspberry Frosting:
3 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons raspberry jam
1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Pure Vanilla Extract
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Mix cream cheese, butter and sugar using an electric mixer.  Add eggs, milk and almond extract; mix thoroughly.  Stir in remaining cupcake ingredients.  Batter will be stiff.
Grease and flour muffin pans or line cups with paper liners.  Fill cups 1/2 full.  Batter will be fairly stiff.  Make an indentation in the center of each cupcake using the tip of a spoon.
Combine all filling ingredients in medium bowl and beat with mixer.  Add a dollop (about 1-1/2 to 2 teaspoons) to the center of each cupcake.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until done.  Let cool 10 minutes in pan.  Remove warm cakes from pan and finish cooling on wire rack.  Frost cupcakes when cool.  Refrigerate cupcakes until ready to serve.
Frosting:  Combine all ingredients except milk in medium bowl.  Beat with electric mixer, gradually adding milk, until frosting is creamy.
