Ingredients:
450g/1lb package of Extra Lean Ground Chicken
1 can of Low-Fat Refried Beans (approx. 400mL)
8 8? Flour Tortillas
1 1/2 cups Shredded Cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, or mixture)
1 Onion (chopped)
1 Tomato (chopped)
1/2 teaspoon of Cajun Seasoning
2 Cloves Garlic (minced)
1 teaspoon of hot sauce (optional)
1 tablespoon of lemon juice (optional)

Directions:
In a large saucepan on medium heat, brown the ground chicken for about 10 minutes or until no longer pink. Drain off the excess liquid from the pan
Add the chopped onion and garlic to the ground chicken, then sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning and cook for another 5 minutes until the onions are soft.
To the chicken mixture gradually add the refried beans, chopped tomato, hot sauce and lemon juice, blending well with a large spoon. Cook on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
While the chicken and bean mixture simmers, line a 9 x 13? baking pan with parchment paper (or just lightly oil a casserole dish).
Line the center of each soft tortilla with a large spoonful of the chicken-bean mixture. Carefully fold up the sides into a roll and place in the baking pan. Continue until each tortilla is filled and lined up next to each other.
Sprinkle cheese on top of the rolled-up burritos, and bake uncovered in the oven for 15 minutes, or until the cheese is nicely melted.
Serve with chopped lettuce, salsa and sour cream.

Description: 
I never made burritos this way before, but thought Iâ€™d give it a try one night and they came out tasting great. I tried to make this meal as healthy as I could by using extra-lean meat and fat-free refried beans.
