Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
32 large marshmallows
5 cups crisp rice cereal
8 ounces cream cheese
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
16 small strawberries, halved
1 banana, peeled and sliced
2 kiwis, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons apricot jam
1 1/2 teaspoons water
2 teaspoons heavy cream
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium saucepan combine the butter and marshmallows. Stir over low heat until melted. Remove pan from heat and stir in the crisp rice cereal. Prepare a pizza pan by lightly coating with vegetable oil spray. Press the cereal mixture evenly onto the pizza pan. Place into the refrigerator to cool.
To make the sauce, combine cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and cocoa in a small bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy. Spread evenly over the pizza crust. Arrange the strawberries, bananas, and kiwi slices over the crust to look like pizza toppings, or make a fancy design.
In a small cup, mix together the apricot jam with the water. Dab onto the fruit with a brush. This will keep the fruit from turning brown. Whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla until stiff, drop dabs of whipped cream onto the pizza. Slice like a pizza, but thinner. This is a very rich dessert.
