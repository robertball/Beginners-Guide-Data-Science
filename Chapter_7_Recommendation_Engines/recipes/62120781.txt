Ingredients:
SALT TO TASTE
PAPRIKA 1/2- 1 TABLESPOON
CHILI POWDER 2 TABLESPOONS
3 BAY LEAVES
CUMIN 1 1/2 TABLESPOON
1 1.12OZ PACK OF FAJITA SEASONING
1/2 1.12 OZ TACO SEASONING
1/2 CUP FINLY CHOPPED CILANTRO
2-3 CLOVES CRUSHED GARLIC
1 ONION DICED SMALL

1 15 OZ CAN MEXICAN BLACK BEANS DRAINED
2 LBS SHREDDED CHICKEN BREAST(3 IF YOU ARE FEEDING ALOT)
4 CUPS SOFT CORN TORTILLAS CUT INTO SQUARES AND TOASTED

Directions:
TOAST TORTILLA PEICES ON A COOKIE SHEET IN OVEN FOR 20 MIN AT 200.
PLACE A THIN LAYER ON COOKIE SHEET AND TOSS A FEW TIMES DURING BAKING SO THEY ARE NOT STUCK TOGETHER.
PUT ASIDE UNTIL THE END.
WHILE THESE ARE BAKING ADD ALL OTHER INGREDIENTS TO STOCK POT.
PLACE BREASTS IN WHOLE UNTIL COOKED. ONCE COOKED REMOVE AND COOL SO THEY ARE EASILY HANDLED AND SHRED. PLACE BAKE INTO POT.
COOK UNTIL BROTH LOOKS RICH WITH FLAVOR AND CHICKEN IS VERY TENDER. ABOUT 1 HOUR. BAY LEAVES SHOULD LOOK DARKER AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM SOGGY(THOUGH THEY ARE STILL FIRM).
YOU CAN EITHER PUT TORTILLA PEICES IN SOUP OR IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWLS.
TOP OFF WITH SOUR CREAM,AVACADO AND SHREDDED CHEESE(MONTERY JACK IS SUGGESTED)BUT YOU CAN WHATEVER CHEESE YOU LIKE.
