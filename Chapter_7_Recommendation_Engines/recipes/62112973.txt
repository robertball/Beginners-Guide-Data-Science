Ingredients:
2 (6oz.) cans skinless, boneless salmon (drained)
3/4 cup of quick oatmeal (not instant oatmeal)
1 egg, beaten
2-3 Tbs  finely chopped onion
2-3 Tbs canola oil
1 Tbs butter (tasty, but optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix salmon, oatmeal, beaten egg, and chopped onion with your hand. (If the salmon is well drained, you may need less oatmeal)
Form into patties.
Pan fry in oil and butter over medium heat, browning both sides. (You may want to press on the patty and flatten  when  frying.)
