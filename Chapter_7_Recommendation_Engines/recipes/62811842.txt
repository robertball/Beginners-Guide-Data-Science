Ingredients:
1 16oz pkg pork sausage blend, any heat variety
1 32oz pkg frozen Hashbrown potatoes w/onions & bell peppers
**1 tbsp vegetable oil**just in case needed
1 tbsp butter

2 tbsp milk
1/4 tsp salt
1/8 tsp black pepper

Directions:
In a non-stick skillet, over med-high heat, cook and crumble sausage until no longer pink. About 5 minutes. With a mesh strainer, scoop out crumbled sausage, leaving sausage grease in the pan. Let sausage strain for a moment into pan to save as much grease as possible. Then put sausage aside in a large bowl.
In the same pan, over medium heat add hashbrown mixture and cook until thawed, cook thoroughly and slightly golden. About 10 minutes or so.**In case off sticking in the beginning, 1 tbsp vegetable oil, just in case your sausage didn't produce enough in pan to coat the hashbrowns. If produced plenty of grease, don't add the extra oil. Cook thoroughly, remove from heat and add to the large bowl with the sausage that was reserved. Keep warm.
In a small bowl mix together, eggs, salt, black pepper & milk.
In a small skillet, melt butter over med-high heat, add egg mixture. Cook eggs until light and fluffy. About 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add to the bowl with the sausage and hashbrown mixture. Add salsa & shredded cheese. Mix well & keep warm.
On a flat pan, heat tortillas on both sides, remove and dopple sausage mixture onto the hot tortillas. Close or fold torilla & Serve immediately. Garnish with Sour Cream if preferred.

Description: 
I've been making this for years. Can't remember how it got developed. But it's breakfast comfort for a Sunday morning. But the title is all the same a messy breakfast burrito with all the ingredients combined and doppled on a hot tortilla.
