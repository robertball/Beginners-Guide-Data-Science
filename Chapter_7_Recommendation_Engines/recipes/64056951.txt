Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup butter
3 teaspoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1/2 cup  fat free half-and-half
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 pkg.(10 ounce each)chopped spinach, thawed, drained and squeezed dry.
4 oz. can sliced mushrooms, drained
2/3 cup bacon bits
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the chicken breast halves on a baking sheet; bake 20 to 30 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from heat, set aside. Cut into chunks.
Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly, mix in the garlic, lemon juice, cream of mushroom soup, Italian seasoning, half-and-half, and Parmesan cheese.
Mix the spinach with half the sauce mix. Pour into a 9x9 inch baking dish. Cover the spinach with the mushrooms. Mix the chicken breast chunks with the remaining sauce and pour over the spinach and mushrooms. Sprinkle with bacon bits, and top with mozzarella cheese.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven, until bubbly and lightly browned.
