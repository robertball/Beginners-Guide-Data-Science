Ingredients:
12 tbsp. butter - softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 tsp. almond extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/8 tsp. salt
1/4 to 1/2 cup jam
1/3 cup sliced almonds

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350.
Cream together butter and sugar on medium speed until very light in color then add almond extract and mix well.
Add dry ingredients to butter mixture and mix on low speed until thoroughly combined - about 40 seconds.
Measure out 1/2 cup of dough and place in freezer (this makes it easier to crumble).
Press remaining dough into a 9 or 9 1/2 inch tart pan.
Spread jam evenly over dough, leaving a border of about 1 inch around the edge.
Crumble reserved dough over the top of the tart and then sprinkle the almonds evenly over the top.
Bake for 40-50 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool completely before serving.
