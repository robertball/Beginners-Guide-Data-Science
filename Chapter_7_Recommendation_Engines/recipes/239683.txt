Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 (14.5 ounce) carton Campbell's® Creamy Herb & Garlic with Chicken Stock Soup
4 slices Swiss cheese
4 slices bacon, cut in half and cooked
4 Pepperidge Farm® Sesame Topped Hamburger Buns, split

Directions:
Mix the turkey and 1/4 cup soup in a large bowl.  Shape the turkey mixture firmly into 4 (1/2-inch thick) burgers.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the burgers and cook for 10 minutes or until well browned on both sides.  Pour off any fat.
Add the remaining soup to the skillet and heat to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and cook until the burgers are cooked through.  Top the burgers with the cheese and cook until the cheese is melted.
Top each burger with about 1 tablespoon soup and 2 pieces bacon.  Serve the burgers on the buns with the remaining soup.
