Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 mild Italian sausages
1/2 red onion, sliced
1/2 delicata squash - halved lenghwise, seeded, and cut into thin slices
1 cup frozen mixed mushrooms
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup quick-cooking farro
2 tablespoons hot water, or as needed (optional)
1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage, onion, and squash. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion and squash are softened slightly and sausages have browned on once side, about 5 minutes. Turn sausages and add frozen mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have thawed, about 3 minutes.
Stir in vegetable broth and farro; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until farro is tender and sausage is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes, adding hot water to the pan as needed to prevent the mixture from becoming too dry.
Lower heat and stir in Pecorino Romano cheese. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

Description: 
A quick, one-pan skillet supper with Italian sausage, farro, and vegetables. I like the savory flavor that mushrooms and winter squash lend to this dish, but you could use almost any vegetables here with great results!
