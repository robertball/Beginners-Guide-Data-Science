Ingredients:
3-4 lbs. chicken wings, tips removed
Garlic Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter
3/4 buffalo sauce (Franks Buffalo Style recommended)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Place wings on a baking pan lined with non-stick foil.  You may spray the sheet with Pam if you want to.  Sprinkle with garlic salt and pepper to taste.
Bake 60 minutes, turning wings half way through.
When you have about 10 min. of cooking time left, put the butter and buffalo sauce in a small pot.  Once the butter has melted turn to low.
Remove the wings from the oven and put in the sauce, a few at a time, turning to coat.  Remove to serving dish and pour any remaining sauce over top.

Description: 
Disappointed with take out wings in our area, I came up with this recipe for a healthier version of buffalo wings.  These taste just like the good wings we used to get!  These will be our Sunday football tradition from now on!
