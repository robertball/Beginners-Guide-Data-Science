Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 tbs milk
fine dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Put the warm water in a small mixing bowl and add the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar; stir to dissolve. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining sugar and the oil and mix until smooth. Add the salt, 1 cup of flour and the yeast mixture; stir well. Add the remaining 5 cups flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, supple and elastic; about 10 minutes. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl, place the dough in it and turn to coat the dough with oil. Cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place until the dough has doubled in volume; about 1 to 1.5 hours.
Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 3 equal pieces. Form each piece into a cylinder and roll out until the 'log' is 2.5 inches in diameter. Using a sharp knife, cut each 'log' into 1 inch pieces. Place the pieces, flat side down, onto two lightly greased baking sheets. Reshape and gently press each roll down to flatten slightly.
Make an egg wash with one egg and 1 tbs milk, brush lightly to the tops and then sprinkle liberally with fine bread crumbs.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cover the rolls with greased plastic and a dry cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until golden brown, about 16-18 minutes.
