Ingredients:
3 whole carrots chopped, 3 stalks celery chopped, 1/2 large onion cut into chucks, 1 can sweet peas, 1 pound cooked ground chicken, 1 teaspoon salt , 1 teaspoon onion powder, McCormick garlic pepper grinder, McCormick steakhouse grinder, 1 seasoning packet in Italian Countryside blend from Maggie So Juicy , 13 cups water , 13 broth cubes ( I used beef flavor but you could use chicken just as well, beef just happened to be what I had in the cupboard) and 1 cup uncooked rice.

Directions:
Heat about a tablespoon of oil in the bottom of a large pot and set temperature on stove burner to medium high. Add carrots, onions and celery to pot and cook until translucent. Open packet from Maggie So Juicy Itaian Contryside blend and stir into vegies. Add water and broth cubes to vegies and cook until cubes are dissolved. Stir in peas, cooked chicken, and rice to pot. Season with a few grinds from the McCormick garlic pepper grinder, McCormick steakhouse grinder and the teaspoon of salt and onion powder. That's it.. Lower heat and cook until heated through and rice is tender.  My family loves soup and I'm sure this will become a favorite especially on the cooler days of the year.
