Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 (3 pound) beef chuck steak, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
3 onions, thinly sliced
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 pinch white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Put flour into a large, sealable plastic bag; add beef cubes and seal bag. Shake bag to coat beef in flour; transfer beef to a large casserole dish.
Top beef with sliced onions.
Whisk water, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar together in a bowl; pour over the onion slices. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until the beef is tender enough to pull apart with a fork, about 3 hours.
