Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients
6 cups all-purpose flour (or 4 cups AP and 2 cups whole wheat flour)
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon salt

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients ahead of time & keep in a large jar or container.
When it's time to make pancakes put 1 cup of mix in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center.
Combine 1 egg and 1 cup milk in a 2-cup measuring cup. Blend well. Pour into well in dry ingredients. Blend with a whisk until everything is wet, no big dry clumps.
Pour onto hot griddle or pan in 1/4 cup measures and cook. Eat and enjoy.

Description: 
Make-ahead pancake mix to keep on hand, which is much less expensive than store-bought mixes and just as tasty. I don't like the slightly metallic flavor of baking soda so I don't use it and I don't miss it. This recipe is leavened plenty by the baking powder and egg.
