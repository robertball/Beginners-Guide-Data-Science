Ingredients:
12 to 14 large apples peeled,
different flavor types.
1/2 cup of water
1/8 cup maple sugar
1 tbs lemon juice
6 to 8 pint jars/ cleaned

Directions:
Peel and slice up all the apples into thin slices (toss out cores), the place them into a large pot. Add the water over the apples, lemon juice and the maple sugar. Place lid on the pot and cook on low for about 2 or 3 hours. Stir occasionally so bottom doesn't stick. Last 45 min cook with lid off. Apples are done when tender. Place in to your canning jars and water bath them for about 15 to 20 min. Let jars sit over night. Sit back and enjoy. Can also put over ice cream, pound cakes and other treats you enjoy. Holds up to 6 / 8 months.
