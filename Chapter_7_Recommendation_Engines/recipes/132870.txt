Ingredients:
20 Brussels sprouts, cleaned and trimmed
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Place the Brussels sprouts into a large saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to dry for a few minutes.
Place the Brussels sprouts into a serving dish and toss with melted butter to coat. Stir in the breadcrumbs gently until evenly distributed.

Description: 
Most people don't like Brussels sprouts (or at least think they don't). I have a cure for this problem.  This is a must-have at my Thanksgiving and my husband's new favorite vegetable dish.
