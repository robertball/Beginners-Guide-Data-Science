Ingredients:
2 cups all - purpose flour
2 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking soda
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
2 cups butter
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate
1 cup crushed almonds

Directions:
Combine flour 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, baking soda, eggs and 1 cup butter.After mixture is well combined fold in the chocolate chips.
Divide the dough into individual balls (about half the size of a golf ball)and put onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Then put in the freezer to chill for 10 min.
Meanwhile, in a medium size pan combine the unsweetened chocolate, remaining butter, remaining sugar on very low heat. When the mixture is melted tasteit . If its too thick it needsbutter, if its too bitter, it needs sugar.
When chocolate is finished take the cookie dough balls out of the freezer and remove them from the sheet. Take each individual ball and dip it in the chocolate so it is completely covered, then place it back on the sheet and place them back in the freezer for another 10 min. (if you used two cookie sheets, only take out one,and once the first ones are covered with chocolate,then take out the second ones. This is so your balls wont melt.)
Meanwhile, reheat your chocolate.
When the cookie balls are  frozen take them out, and once again, remove them from the sheet. Next dip the flat side of each ball in the chocolate and emediately press into the crushed almonds.when all are covered with nuts place them back in the freezer to chill until frozen.
