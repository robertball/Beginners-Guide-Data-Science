Ingredients:
1 Cup butter
2 1/2 Cup sugar
1 Egg
1 1/2 Tsp. Baking powder
3 Cup flour
3 Tsp. Vanilla extract
1/2 Tsp. Salt

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees. In a medium bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until blended. Place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Roll the dough into small size balls(like a tablespoon full) and roll the balls in 1/4 cup of sugar. Place dough 2 inches apart onto slightly grease(ungreased) cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 - 10 minutes until lightly brown around the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 3 minutes before placing them onto a wire rack to cool completely.
