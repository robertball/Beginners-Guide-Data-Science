Ingredients:
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 head bok choy, chopped
1 pound white and crimini mushrooms, cut into quarters
4 green onions, sliced
2 tablespoons minced garlic, or more to taste
8 slices fresh ginger, quartered
1/4 cup lime juice
7 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat butter in a stock pot over medium heat; add bok choy, mushrooms, green onions, garlic, and ginger. Sprinkle mushroom mixture with lime juice; cook and stir just until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, pour in chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Serve with cilantro.

Description: 
I thought of this healthy and delicious recipe when my wife was sick and craving a nice flavorful brothy soup to help make her feel better. It really did the trick! She's asked me to make it several times since then.
