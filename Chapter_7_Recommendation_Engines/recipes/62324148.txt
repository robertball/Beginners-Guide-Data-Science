Ingredients:
3 egg
3 small onion, chopped
1-1/2 cups dill pickle juice
2-1/4 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 slices bread, torn into small pieces
3 pounds lean ground beef
3/4 cup chopped dill pickles
3/4 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1-1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large 9x13 inch baking dish.
Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the onion, pickle juice, salt, and pepper. Stir in the bread until soggy, then mix in the ground beef until evenly combined. Form into a loaf and place into the prepared pan. Stir together the chopped pickles, ketchup, sugar, and Worcestershire sauce; pour over the meatloaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
