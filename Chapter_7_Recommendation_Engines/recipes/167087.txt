Ingredients:
1 slice multigrain bread
1 pound ground buffalo meat
1 onion, diced
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon mustard powder
3/4 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1/3 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Crumble the bread slice into crumbs and set aside.  Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.
Thoroughly mix ground buffalo meat, onion, egg, ground mustard, tomatoes, salt, pepper, and bread crumbs in a large bowl.
Form the meat mixture into a loaf shape about 8x4 inches and place into the middle of the baking dish.  Apply ketchup to the top and sides of the meatloaf.
Bake in preheated oven until meat is no longer pink and ketchup forms a glaze over the meatloaf, 1 1/2 hours.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
