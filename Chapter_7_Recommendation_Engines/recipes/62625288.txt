Ingredients:
1 (8.5 oz.) pkg. Flamin' Hot Cheetos
15 oz. vanilla almond bark coating (3/4 of a 20 oz. pkg.)

Directions:
Melt the almond bark either in the top of a double boiler on medium heat or in a medium sized bowl in the microwave at 50% power for 1 minute intervals until completely melted.
Once melted, mix in the entire bag of Cheetos until completely covered in almond bark.
Spread mixture onto a sheet of wax or parchment paper in an even layer to desired thickness and let it cool completely.
Cut into 1 1/2" squares once cooled and enjoy.
