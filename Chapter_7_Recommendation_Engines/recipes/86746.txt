Ingredients:
3 cups cooked rice
1 1/4 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1 cup canned or frozen corn
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped green onions

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the rice, 1 cup of the cheese, corn, milk, sour cream and green onions. Transfer to a 1 quart casserole dish, and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is melted and the dish is heated through.
