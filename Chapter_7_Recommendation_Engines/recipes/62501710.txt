Ingredients:
1 bunch basil (roughly 3 cups)
1/2 cup almonds
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup sun-dried tomato halves*, sliced
Sea salt, to taste
4 skin-on, bone-in chicken breast halves**

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 450°F and line a large baking sheet with foil. In a food processor, combine basil, almonds, garlic, salt, lemon juice and olive oil. Blend until smooth, then stir in sun-dried tomatoes.
2. With a small paring knife, cut a 1” long slit in the top chicken breast, then carefully slide knife inside to form a pocket. Repeat for all breasts.
3. Spoon pesto into the pockets. With a spoon, scoop out some plain pesto (without sun-dried tomatoes), then spread the top of the breasts with it.
4. Use toothpicks to close the slit ends of the breasts. Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes, until opaque and firm to the touch.
