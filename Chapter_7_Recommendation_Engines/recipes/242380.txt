Ingredients:
2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender Pork Spareribs, membrane removed
Handful hickory or apple wood chips for smoking, soaked in water and drained (optional)
Glaze:
1 cup peach jam
1/4 cup chili sauce
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon chipotle hot sauce
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 230 to 250 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using.
Place the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
Remove ribs from grill.  Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil.  Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender.  Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill.
Meanwhile, make the glaze.  Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove ribs from grill and unwrap.  Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with peach glaze.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the glaze is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more glaze.
