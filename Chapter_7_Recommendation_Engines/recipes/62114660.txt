Ingredients:
1 cup cooked short grain rice (Japanese sushi rice)
2 bananas
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon butter
2 egg yolks
3 tablespoon sugar
1 cup milk
pinch salt
1/2 cup whipping cream from spray can

Directions:
Slice half of one banana and sprinkle it with one tablespoon sugar.  Set aside.
Cut up the remaining bananas and put them in a skillet over medium heat.  No oil is needed.  Stir and mash as the chopped bananas warm until it becomes slightly browned and holds together into one ball.  The bananas should taste concentrated and be reduced in size.
Remove from pan.
Put 1 cup milk, 2 egg yolks, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup cooked rice in pan and stir until well blended.  Heat through over low heat until slightly thickened and steamy, stirring constantly.  (This doesn't take very long).
Stir in mashed bananas until well blended and heated through.  Put in fridge or set aside.
Whip cream until peaks hold up.  (I use spray whipped cream.  Its easier and takes less time.)
Stir whipped cream together with rice pudding until well blended.
Chill to serve cold or set aside to serve warm.
Just before serving, use a clean fry pan to caramelize the sugared banana slices over medium heat.  When banana slices are golden brown, lay on top of pudding.
Serve and enjoy!
