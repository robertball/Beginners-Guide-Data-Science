Ingredients:
Basil leaves - a small bunch, without stalks, around 1/2 ounce (14g)
Salt - a few pinches
Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 2 Tablespoons
Balsamic Vinegar - 1 teaspoon

Directions:
Best is to use a mortar and pestle.
Place the leaves in the mortar and sprinkle with a few pinches of salt - about 1/4 teaspoon.
Bash the leaves with the pestle until they break down and become a purée, a minute or 2.
Add 2 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.
Stir to mix evenly, and then it's ready to use.

Description: 
Simple to do, and a delight to add as a garnish to other dishes. My favourite is to swirl it into my Roasted Tomato soup just before serving.
