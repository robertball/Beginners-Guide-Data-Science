Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (DO NOT use white flour)
1/2 cup 100% pure pumpkin (DO NOT use pumpkin pie filling)
1 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup natural smooth peanut butter
1/4 cup water
2 Tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon allspice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325°F.  Lightly grease a baking sheet with baking spray.  (I used my large Pampered chef stoneware bar pan).
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, baking powder and allspice.
In a medium sized mixing bowl, stir the oil, pumpkin and peanut butter together until smooth.
Make a well in the flour and pour in the peanut butter mixture.  Mix on low speed to combine the wet and dry ingredients.
Slowly pour in the water and mix together on a medium speed until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface and kneed for approximately one minute until its no longer sticky.
Roll out the dough to ¼ inch thickness and cut into mini size shapes with your favorite cookie cutter.
Bake for 12 minutes at full heat, then turn the oven off and leave the cookies in the oven for a further 30 minutes.
Leave cookies in the baking tray for 10 minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
Store in an airtight container once completely cooled for up to 2 weeks.
