Ingredients:
3 cups confectioners' sugar
2/3 cup dark cocoa powder (such as Hershey'sÂ® Special Dark)
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 egg whites, or more as needed
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups chocolate chips (60% cacao)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.
Mix confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl. Beat egg whites and vanilla extract into the sugar mixture until thick and batter-like; add chocolate chips and stir.
Scoop batter by tablespoonful onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until the tops are glossy and lightly cracked, 12 to 14 minutes. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet and store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
