Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups buttermilk
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (minus 4 tablespoons)
2 teaspoons baking powder
4 Tablespoons corn starch
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Set out milk, butter, and eggs to become room temperature.
Measure 3 3/4 cups flour, remove 4 tablespoons full back into the flour bag, and sift remaining flour with corn starch 2-3 times until completely mixed and aerated.
Measure flour again by spooning it gently into measuring cup and level off with flat edge of a knife. Discard left-over flour or save for use later.
Sift in Baking Powder.
Preheat oven 350F.
Cream butter and sugar.
Mix in flour being careful not to overmix.
Mix in remaining ingredients being careful not to over-mix.
Grease baking pan and sprinkle with sugar.
Fill 2 9x13 pans or fill cupcake pan almost full. (note this cake does rise, but not as much as some cakes)
Bake 30-45 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Reduce time for cupcakes to 15-25 minutes.
Allow to cool before applying icing.

Description: 
This is the best recipe I've come up with after experimenting with several. This cake is perfect for wedding cakes and cupcakes. To make this cake decadently moist and dense, be sure to follow the sifting directions and measure the flour carefully. This recipe uses all-purpose flour and corn starch as a substitute for cake flour because, lets face it, who ever really has any cake flour handy?
