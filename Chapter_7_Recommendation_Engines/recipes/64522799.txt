Ingredients:
5 bags cranberries (340 grams each)
15 apples, peeled, cored and diced
3/4 cup apple juice (or as needed depending on how moist or dry the mixture is)
1 1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Place cranberries, apples, white and brown sugar and apple juice in a large pot and bring to a boil. Stir constantly so it doesn't burn.
Turn down heat to medium low and add vanilla and cinnamon.
Cook for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cranberries have popped and the apples are soft.
If mixture is too dry add a little bit more apple juice, if too wet cook uncovered a little bit longer.
Cool, uncovered in the fridge overnight to thicken.
Fills 12 kringles, bake 375 degrees for 45 minutes, rotating halfway through.
When cool, glaze with 1 cup icing sugar with a dash of vanilla and enough water to make pourable.
