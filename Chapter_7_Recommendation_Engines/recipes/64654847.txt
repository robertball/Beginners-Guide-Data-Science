Ingredients:
1 boneless, skinless Chicken Breast
1/4 cup Dill Pickle Brine
1 Egg
1/4 cup Milk
1/2 cup Flour
1 tablespoon powdered Sugar
1/2 teaspoon Paprika
1/2 teaspoon Salt
1/4 teaspoon Black Pepper
1/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder
1/4 teaspoon Celery Salt
1/4 teaspoon dried Basil

Directions:
1. Wrap the chicken loosely with plastic wrap and pound gently with the flat side of a meat tenderizer until about 1/2 inch thick all around.
2. Cut into two pieces, as even as possible.
3. Marinate in the pickle juice for 30 minutes to one hour (add the Tabasco sauce now for a spicy sandwich).
4. Beat the egg with the milk in a bowl.
5. Combine the flour, sugar, and spices in another bowl (add the Cayenne Pepper now for a spicy sandwich).
6. Dip the chicken pieces each into the egg on both sides, then coat in flour on both sides.
7. Heat the oil in a skillet (1/2 inch deep) to about 345-350.
8. Fry each cutlet for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through.
9. Blot on paper and serve on toasted buns with pickle slices.
