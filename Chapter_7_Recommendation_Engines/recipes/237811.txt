1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Place corn into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool corn. Cut kernels from cob.
Mix corn kernels, black beans, avocados, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and jalapeno pepper together in a bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lime zest, and lime juice together in a bowl; pour over corn mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is my favorite summer salad to take to picnics and makes the best of summer-time vegetables. Add chopped grilled chicken and take it from a hearty salad into an entree.
