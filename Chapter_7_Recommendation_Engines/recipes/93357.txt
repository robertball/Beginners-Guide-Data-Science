Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 eggs
2 tablespoons dried Italian seasoning
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
salt and pepper to taste
1 (32 ounce) package frozen white bread dough, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, Italian seasoning, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and spinach. Set aside.
Divide the bread dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece out to about an 8 inch circle. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the ricotta filling onto each circle, fold over and seal the edges. Place onto a greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until nicely browned on the tops and bottoms.

Description: 
Delicious, satisfying, and very easy to make. My kids will even eat spinach this way! We serve them with warmed spaghetti sauce to dip them in and a salad.  Yum!
