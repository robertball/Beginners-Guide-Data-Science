Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
8 slices bacon
4 lamb blade chops

Directions:
Preheat a grill for high heat.
While the grill warms up, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms; cook and stir until tender. Set aside.
Season the bacon slices with pepper, and place them on the grill. Cook bacon until crisp, turning once, then set aside. Season the lamb chops with seasoned salt, and place them on the grill. Cook to your desired degree of doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium.
Serve each chop with two slices of bacon over it, and top with the sliced mushrooms.
