Ingredients:
Brisket
Yellow Mustard
Smoked Paprika
Garlic Powder
Sea Salt, Grinder
Chili Powder

Directions:
-I use a Traeger pellet smoker.-
Set Traeger to "Smoke" which usually holds it between 180-200 degrees.
Lay brisket out and cover both sides with all of the listed seasonings/salt.
Slather both sides with yellow mustard, normal table - wet mustard, no dry seasoning.
Set on the Traeger grill directly with the fat side up.
After 3-4 hours, lift the brisket using a heat-resistant grill glove and set a large piece of foil (or a foil tub of some kind to catch the juices for the brisket to stay juicy in) and curve the foil upward on the edges. At this point is when I put the thermometer in which connects to the Traeger so I don't have to open it again until it's ready to pull. It's usually about 160 degrees at this point.
Set Traeger to 225-250, depending on how patient you are...remember, the slower the better!
Once the meat reaches 200 degrees, it's ready to be pulled from the grill. Wrap it in foil, usually takes two pieces. At this point, you can wrap it in a towel as well to hold in the heat and protect any surface you set the foiled brisket on. You can also put it in a cooler to maintain its heat. This process takes as long as you are willing to wait. I recommend a minimum of 30 minutes, but you can leave it for a solid 2 or 3 hours for an even better rest period.
If you wait the 3 hours for a resting, and cook it as low as possible until it hits 200 degrees, your brisket could take 15 hours from start to finish, so plan accordingly!
