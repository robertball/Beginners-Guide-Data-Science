Ingredients:
1/2 pound peppered bacon, diced
1 onion, chopped
2 pounds collard greens - rinsed, stemmed and torn into 3x6 inch pieces
1 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:
Place bacon in a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Cook until browned and most of the grease has been released. Stir in onion and cook until tender and glistening, about 4 minutes.
Place collards into the pot and stir to coat with the bacon drippings. Pour in the chicken stock. Season with cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Stir red wine vinegar into the pot. Continue cooking 15 minutes, until liquid is reduced by about 1/2.

Description: 
Spicy, tangy collard greens accented with black pepper bacon, cayenne pepper and vinegar are a big deal in Brazil.  Here is my recipe.  Since bacon fat is an essential part of this recipe don't drain it during any of the steps!  I say that if your veggies are fattening then eat a lighter main dish!
