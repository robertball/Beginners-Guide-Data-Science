Description: 
Everyone will wonder what you did differently this time around. The secret is cilantro. Cilantro is wonderful in guacamole but it takes on a whole different flavor in these delicious meatballs. Trust me, I've made these for many potlucks and everyone always loves them. Even people who swear they hate cilantro. Serve the meatballs and sauce over spaghetti.
