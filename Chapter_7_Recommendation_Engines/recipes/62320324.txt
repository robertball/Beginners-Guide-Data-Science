https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2-3 batches of fresh popped popcorn
Omit Kix
1 (10.5 ounce) bag extruded corn chips (e.g. Fritosâ„¢)
2 (2.25 ounce) packages blanched slivered almonds
2 cups thin pretzel sticks
1 pound vanilla flavored confectioners' coating

Directions:
Cover a large flat surface with waxed paper.  In a large bowl, stir together the popcorn, cereal, corn chips, almonds, and pretzels.
Melt the confectioners' coating in a glass bowl in the microwave for 1 minute. Continue to cook at 30 second intervals, stirring between each one, until the coating is smooth.
Pour melted coating over the cereal mixture. Divide between 2 bowls and pour 1 or 2 spoonfuls of chocolate at a time then mix with hands, wearing gloves, to ensure even distribution. (A second person can be useful here - one to pour, one to mix.) Once everything is coated, spread the mixture out onto waxed paper in a thin layer. Let stand for about 1/2 hour, or until coating is dry. Transfer to a bowl to serve, or store in an airtight container.
