Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
3 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
1 pinch ground cumin
salt and black pepper to taste
1 egg
1/2 cup minced celery
1/2 cup minced onion
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 cup dry bread crumbs
8 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the cranberry sauce, horseradish, lemon juice, and cumin together in a bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and set aside.
Mix the egg, celery, and onion in a bowl with your hand until the egg is smooth. Add the turkey, thyme, poultry seasoning, parsley, and bread crumbs; mix until evenly combined. Form the turkey mixture into 8 patties.
Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place onto the hamburger buns, and top with cranberry sauce to serve.

Description: 
This is my favorite recipe!  We had these at my niece's birthday party, and it was a hit. They are the moistest turkey burgers you will ever have. I usually make a double batch and form into patties and then freeze them.  Pull them out when you are ready to grill!  Delicious and moist!  Best burgers ever!
