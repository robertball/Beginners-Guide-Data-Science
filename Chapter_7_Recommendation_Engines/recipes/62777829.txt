Ingredients:
2 pounds ground extra lean turkey breast
1/2 cup Barbecue Sauce
1/2 cup light buttermilk ranch dressing
Nonstick cooking spray
1 (2.1 ounce) package fully cooked turkey bacon
6 slices Kraft reduced fat PepperJack cheese, each slice cut diagonally into 2 triangles
1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat hamburger buns, toasted
6 leaves green leaf lettuce
1 cup prepared Pico De Gallo
1 oz Dry Ranch Style Seasoning by BEC from this site.

Directions:
Mix ground turkey with ranch seasoning in a large bowl until well blended. Shape turkey into 6 patties. Whisk together barbecue sauce and dressing in small bowl; set aside.
Spray grate of outdoor grill and utensils with grilling spray. Preheat grill to medium heat. Grill patties 5 minutes on one side or until juices begin to appear on surface. Turn patties over; top each with 3 slices turkey bacon. Cook about 4 minutes longer; top each patty with 2 triangle pieces of cheese, overlapping to cover patty. Remove patties when cheese begins to melt.
Spread barbecue-dressing mixture on bottom of each roll. Add a lettuce leaf. Place cooked patty with bacon and cheese on lettuce. Spoon additional barbecue-dressing mixture over cheese. Serve immediately.
