Ingredients:
2 lbs Turkey Breast Tenderloin
2 large cans of Golden Hominy (32oz?)
2 jars of Salsa Verde (16oz)
1 can diced Jalapenos (4oz, optional)
1 can diced Green Chilis (8 oz)
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Spray the turkey tenderloins with non-stick cooking spray.
On the grill, cook the turkey tenderloins ~5-7 minutes each side on medium heat. (My grill says 475)
Slice the turkey into medallions about 1/2-3/4" thick.
Add the turkey, hominy, salsa verde, and peppers to a large pot.
Let simmer until YOU feel it is done. The longer it goes, the thicker it gets.
