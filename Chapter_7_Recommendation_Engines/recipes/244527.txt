Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup pesto
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir pesto and sour cream into ground beef until warmed; add macaroni and mix well.
