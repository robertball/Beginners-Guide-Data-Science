Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
3 plums, cut into small pieces
1 cup fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
1 cinnamon stick
1 large boneless duck breast
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add plums, strawberries, raspberries, honey, and cinnamon stick. Stir well and simmer until fruit is soft, about 7 minutes.
Score duck breast skin in a diamond pattern. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and cook duck until skin is browned, about 7 minutes. Turn over and cook until duck is medium rare, about 5 minutes more. Slice duck breast in half to check for doneness. Continue cooking, if necessary, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and breast is still pink in the center. Slice thinly and serve with the warm sauce ladled over top.
