Ingredients:
5 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch slices
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, cut into pieces
1/2 cup coarsely chopped cashews
1 cup miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place the sweet potatoes in a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until a fork easily pierces the potatoes, about 10 minutes. Drain, and cool.
Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in the cashews.
Arrange half the sweet potatoes over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with half the brown sugar mixture. Top with half the butter pieces. Repeat with a second layer of sweet potatoes, brown sugar mixture, and remaining butter pieces.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are glazed with the brown sugar mixture, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle mini marshmallows over the top, and return to the oven to bake until browned, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This dish has always been on our Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter menus. You can't go wrong with sweet potatoes that are cooked, sliced, and layered with brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cashews. The whole mixture is then baked and topped with mini marshmallows that brown at the end. Canned yams can be used instead of the sweet potatoes.
