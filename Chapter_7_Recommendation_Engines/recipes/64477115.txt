Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced onion
1 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
1 cup thinly sliced yellow bell pepper
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups unsalted crushed tomatoes
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons sherry vinegar
1 teaspoon paprika
Cooking spray
6 large eggs

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add oil; swirl to coat. Add onion, bell peppers, and garlic. Cook 10 minutes or until vegetables are very soft, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes and next 6 ingredients (through paprika); cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Divide mixture evenly among 6 (8-ounce) ramekins coated with cooking spray.

To heat: Remove ramekins from wrapping. Microwave 1 ramekin, covered loosely with a damp paper towel, at HIGH for 2 minutes. Â­Remove from microwave, and stir. Make a slight well in sauce. Add 1 large egg; pierce yolk with the tip of a sharp knife. Cover loosely with paper towel. Microwave an additional 2 1/2 minutes or to desired degree of doneness.
