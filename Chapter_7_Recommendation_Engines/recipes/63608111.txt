Ingredients:
1/2 cup tapioca flour
1/2 cup grounded flaxseed
1 tbs. extra virgin olive oil
1 large egg
water (1 tbs., as needed)
season to taste

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients first, then add liquids. Make sure you mix quickly the liquids (just as you'd do with bread) Add water as needed to make the dry ingredient stick (do NOT add too much water). Flatten out and roll into approximately 1/8 of an inch pieces. Cut into preferred size. Heat coconut oil and pan fry them until light brown. Enjoy! I used mine with guacamole, and they were a hit!
