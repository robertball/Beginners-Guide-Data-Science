Ingredients:
*   2 cups cubed rotisserie chicken breast, skin discarded
* One 1-pound bag frozen mixed vegetables, preferably peas, carrots and onions
* Two 10.75-ounce cans cream of potato soup
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt and pepper
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon (4 1/2 ounces) lard, frozen and cut into small pieces
* 1/4 cup ice water
* 1 egg, beaten

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, frozen vegetables, soup, milk, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; transfer to a 7-by-11-inch casserole dish.
2. Using a food processor, combine the flour and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add half of the lard and pulse until the mixture resembles sand. Add the remaining lard and pulse until only pea-size lumps remain. Add the ice water and pulse briefly until the dough holds together. Turn out onto a floured surface and gather the dough into a ball. Roll out the dough into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle. Drape the dough over the rolling pin to transfer to the casserole; crimp the edges. Cut 3 slits in the dough for vents and brush all over with the egg.
3. Bake the casserole until golden-brown and bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.

Maggie Lake has perfected a chicken potpie that is big on flavor but not fuss. She swapped the roasting, the roux and the rounds of chopping for cubed rotisserie chicken, a can of cream of potato soup and a bag of frozen veggies.
