Ingredients:
1 Acorn Squash
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1 sweet yellow pepper, diced
1 sweet orange pepper, diced
1 chicken breast cut into very small pieces
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp. white pepper
dash of salt
3 T butter
1/2 cup coconut juice
1 tsp cornstarch
1/2 cup bread crumbs
Shredded mozzarella as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Cut squash in half (vertically) and take out seeds. Sprinkle on salt and pepper to taste, and spray with cooking oil. Place in a microwave safe dish, flesh down. Cover and microwave for 15 minutes (or until flesh is soft)
In a medium skillet, melt butter and add onions, tomatoes, and peppers. Saute 5-7 minutes or until onions are clear.
Add chicken (the smaller the pieces, the better)and spices to the skillet and let the chicken cook, stirring throughout.
Add coconut juice and cornstarch to the skillet and let the mixture simmer until the liquids thicken
Put the squash into an oven safe dish, and spoon the chicken mixture into the squash (I use a slotted spoon so I don't get too much liquid).  Evenly distribute bread crumbs over the stuffed squash, and add cheese as desired.
Cook at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until cheese is bubbling.

Description: 
This is a GREAT main dish I accidentally made when I needed to use some veggies that were taking a turn to the dark side. Serve it with some asparagus and a roll to balance it out, and viola...dinner for two.
