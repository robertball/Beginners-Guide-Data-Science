Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen California mixed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots)
1 (16 ounce) bag frozen broccoli
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed

Directions:
Place the mixed vegetables and frozen broccoli into a large pot. Pour in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in the flour until smooth and cook for a few minutes until the color lightens slightly. Whisk in the milk and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cheese until melted; stir the cheese mixture into the simmering vegetables. Cook and stir until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This soup is so wonderful served with hot muffins on a cold winter day!  The different vegetables in a creamy, cheesy soup. If soup is not thick enough, stir in instant potato flakes to desired thickness.  This will make the soup thick (and a little grainy.)
