Scalloped Vegetables Recipe

Ingredients:
1 to 2 cans mushroom soup (depending on personal taste)
5 sliced potatoes
2 sliced onions
1 sliced zucchini
1 sliced sweet potato or yam
1/4 sliced cabbage
1 sliced carrot
salt/pepper to taste
topping:  Mix together...
1/4 cup parmesan cheese
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/8 cup butter

Directions:
Line a 9x13 pan with a little of the soup to cover the bottom.
Now layer your vegetables, starting and finishing with the potatoes.  Spread a little soup in between each layer as you go. Be sure to save enough soup to pour over the top at the end.
Spray or grease a piece of tinfoil large enough to cover the pan. Lightly lay it over the vegetable mixture and bake in a 350 oven until tender, about 40 minutes.  (this will vary depending on the types of vegetables you used and how thick you cut them).
When they are fork tender, remove the foil and sprinkle the topping over the potatoes.  Return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes until the topping is golden brown.
Tip:  Let sit on the counter for a few minutes to cool if you want it to keep its shape when lifted out.

Description: 
A great way to use of little bits of this and that in the fridge that the kids will even love!  Feel free to mix and match your vegetables with what you have in your fridge.  Be careful about mixing frozen and fresh as frozen will become soggy much faster.
