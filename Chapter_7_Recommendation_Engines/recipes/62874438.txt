Ingredients:
8 cups tomato juice (one cup reserved), preferable bottled, not canned
6 ripe roma tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped (peeled if you have oodles of time)
2 Cucumbers, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped
1 poblano or anaheim pepper (or green bell if you really have to), seeded and finely chopped
1/4 cup fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/2 tsp cumin
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
Salt, pepper and hot sauce (e.g. Tabasco) to taste
Extra virgin olive oil (optional)

Directions:
In a food processor, pulse about half of the tomatoes until just pureed.
In a glass or non-reactive bowl, combine the pureed and chopped tomatoes with 7 cups of tomato juice and the remainder of the ingredients up to the Worcestershire sauce.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
After the ingredients have been allowed to combine overnight, taste for seasoning and heat, and adjust with salt, pepper and hot sauce accordingly. If the Gazpacho is thicker than you would like, add reserved cup of tomato juice.
Serve chilled and lightly drizzled with olive oil, if desired.
