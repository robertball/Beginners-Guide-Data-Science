Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 dried red chile peppers, broken into pieces
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder
1 sprig fresh curry leaves
2 onions, chopped
2 green chile peppers, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
4 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
salt, to taste
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the red chile peppers, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle the asafoetida powder over the seeds and add the curry leaves. Stir the onions, green chile peppers, and turmeric powder into the mixture; cook and stir until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, red chili powder, sugar, and salt; continue cooking until the tomatoes are pulpy. Pour the water into the mixture; simmer until the curry begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Garnish with cilantro to serve.

Description: 
My mother used to make this curry when we were about to go on vacation or just returned from vacation and didn't have many vegetables in the house. This koora works really well with rice or with pooris.
