Ingredients:
For the Wings:
3 lbs. chicken wings, split at joint, tips removed
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
For the Sauce:
1 tsp. grated lime zest
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup tequila
1 T. agave nectar
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. adobo sauce
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Prepare the wings: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Season the wings with salt and pepper and arrange on a baking sheet in a single layer.
Cook until just brown and crisp, about 45 minutes.
Make the sauce: Combine the lime zest and juice, tequila, agave nectar, cumin, adobo sauce, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 T. pepper in a bowl.
Pour over the warm wings and let marinate at least 30 minutes.
Preheat grill to high. Grill the wings until marked, 10-15 minutes, turning as needed. Transfer the marinade to a saucepan and cook until slightly thick, about 8 minutes (you can do this on the grill as well). Drizzle the wings with the sauce and top with cilantro.
