Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
4 eggs
1 cup warm water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant butterscotch pudding mix

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Grease two 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pans.
Place yellow cake mix, eggs, warm water, vegetable oil, poppy seeds, and butterscotch pudding mix into a mixing bowl.
Beat with an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. If beating by hand, beat for 5 minutes.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven until cakes are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
Tip pans on their sides until cakes are cool, about 30 minutes. Invert pans to remove the loaves.
