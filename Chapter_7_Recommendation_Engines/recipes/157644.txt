salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
20  pitted kalamata olives
20  red seedless grapes

Directions:
Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Stir in the garlic, olives, and grapes; cook and stir 1 minute. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with feta cheese. Pour the wine into the pan and bring to a boil. Cover and cook until the cheese has melted and the sauce reduced by half, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
New Year's Eve, 9 p.m. and no idea what I'm going to cook for my husband and I for dinner. My husband was already suggesting Chinese delivery. I felt bad and thought it would be the good wife thing to end the year with a cooked meal. This is what I came up with:  chicken breast with red grapes and kalamata olives plated with wild brown rice and your favorite vegetable. Sherry may be substituted for the muscat wine.
