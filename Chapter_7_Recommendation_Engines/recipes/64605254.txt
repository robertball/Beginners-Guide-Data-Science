Ingredients:
12 slices of bacon
1 box of Cavatappi pasta (or other same sized pasta)
1 pint of cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
1 clove of garlic, minced
3 cups of mixed baby arugula and spinach
Salt and pepper to taste
Drizzle of olive oil
Fresh grated Parmesan
Croutons

Directions:
Bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon salt. Add the pasta and cook until just tender--about 11 minutes.  Or follow the instructions on the box.
Cook bacon in a non-stick pan until crispy (approximately 8 minutes per 4 slices of bacon).  Place the cooked bacon on paper towels to drain.  Reserve two tablespoon of the bacon grease and remove the extra with a towel.
In the same pan that the bacon was cooked in, heat tomatoes and minced garlic along with the reserved bacon grease until the tomatoes are tender (about 2 minutes).
Add the cooked pasta to the pan of sauted tomatoes and garlic.  Then add the cooked bacon and mixed greens and toss together.  Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with shredded Parmesan cheese and croutons.  Serve warm or cold.
