Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer, room temp
3 cups self-rising flour (or 3 cups flour, 1 T baking powder & 1 1/2 tsp salt)
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 stick melted butter
optional- mix in a handful of sharp cheddar or pepper jack cheese before adding beer

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the sugar and flour. Add beer and continue to mix using a wooden spoon.  Batter will be sticky. Pour into a 9 x 5 inch greased loaf pan.  Let sit for 1/2 hour to rise. Pour melted butter over top.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 50 for 60 minutes.  The top will be crunchy, and the insides will be soft.  Serve topped with butter or cheese spread.
