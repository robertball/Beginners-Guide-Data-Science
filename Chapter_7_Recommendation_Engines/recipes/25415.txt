Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) package frozen white bread dough
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 medium head cabbage, shredded
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese
salt and pepper to taste
vegetable oil

Directions:
Thaw out frozen bread dough; cut each roll into 3 pieces and set aside. Brown beef and cabbage in a large skillet, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out bread dough and cut into squares. Place a spoonful of the beef/cabbage mixture onto the center of each dough square. Sprinkle cheese on top, fold over and pinch sides to seal. Rub a bit of oil on the outside of each pastry.
Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, or until golden brown.

My mother-in-law introduced me to this and it kinda stuck. I am from Iowa, now in Kentucky, and the only way I can get this is by making it at home.
