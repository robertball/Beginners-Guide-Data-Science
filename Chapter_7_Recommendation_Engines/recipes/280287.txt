Description: 
This is a dairy-free, rich and hearty version of French toast that is vegan. It uses coconut milk instead of eggs and milk. This recipe may be found on my blog, Olives for Dinner. If you like sweet French toast, cover in 
Earth Balance®, powdered sugar, and pure maple syrup. If you like a more savory French toast, cover in Earth Balance®, a touch of powdered sugar, and some nutritional yeast.
