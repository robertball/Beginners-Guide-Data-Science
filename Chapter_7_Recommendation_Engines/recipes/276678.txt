Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons molasses
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
4 ounces sun-dried bananas, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 3 cookie sheets well.
Cream sugar and butter together in a medium bowl using an electric mixer until light and smooth. Mix in molasses, egg, and vanilla extract on high speed.
Sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl. Stir gradually into molasses mixture. Stir in sun-dried bananas using a wooden spoon.
Shape dough into walnut-sized balls and place onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly using a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
