Ingredients:
1/2 lb. deli ham (your choice of smoked, boiled, honey baked, etc.)
2 8 oz. bricks lite cream cheese
2 bunches green onions
1 pkg. 10" tortilla shells

Directions:
Rinse green onions, and slice off the wilted part of the tops, if needed.  Cut off root ends but leave as much of the white as possible.  Drain on paper towels.
Spread 3-4 tablespoons cream cheese on a tortilla shell, and lay 2 slices of ham to cover.  No need to measure the cream cheese, just eyeball it.
Lay 1 green onion (or 2 if they're small) near the edge of the tortilla shell, on top of the ham.
Roll up the tortilla starting with the edge nearest the onion.
Wrap in foil and refrigerate several hours to overnight.
Slice and serve on a tray with the cut ends upward.

Description: 
Every time I make these for a party, they're the first thing to go!  I've made quadruple-batches for kids' parties, BBQ's, you name it -- if I don't take a few for myself as soon as I uncover the plate, I don't get one!  :-)
