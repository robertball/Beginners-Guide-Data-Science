Ingredients:
5 cups milk, divided
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Blend 2 cups milk, sugar, pudding mix, rum-flavored extract, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger in a blender on medium-high speed until smooth; pour into a pitcher. Stir remaining 3 cups milk into mixture. Refrigerate eggnog until thickened, at least 1 hour. Stir well before serving.

Description: 
I developed this recipe because of my love for eggnog and my dislike of the thought of drinking raw eggs. I spent quite a long time and much trial and error before being confident enough to finalize this recipe. Tastes just like the real thing! Enjoy!
