Bring water and lentils to a boil in a saucepan; cook until lentils are tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain and transfer cooked lentils to a large bowl.

Description: 
Although 'creamy' tells us it probably isn't healthy, these combined healthy ingredients provide a creamy texture that I just can't resist. After wanting to recreate a lentil salad I had from a local market, I realized I had made a salad more delicious than I had intended and it was nothing like I had been attempting to make. This salad is great as a side dish, a main salad, served on top of brown rice, or on top of a bed of lettuce.
