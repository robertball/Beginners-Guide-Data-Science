Ingredients:
2 lbs. pork tenderloin
1 t. ground sage
1/2 t. salt
1/2 t. garlic powder
1/4 t. pepper
1/2 c. water
1/4 c. light brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 c. balsamic vinegar
1/2 c. water
2 T. soy sauce

Directions:
Mix together the sage, garlic powder, salt and pepper and rub it over the pork tenderloin.
Place 1/2 cup of water in your Crock Pot.  Place the rubbed pork in the Crock Pot and cook on high for 3 hours.
Mix together the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan: brown sugar, corn starch, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce. Heat the glaze over medium, stirring until mixture thickens, about 4 minutes.
Brush your roast 1-2 times with the glaze during the final hour of cooking. Serve sliced pork with remaining glaze on the side.

Description: 
Really easy glazed pork.  The pork would be good on its own even without the glaze.  The glaze is good on its own as well as a dip for fries or a condiment for sandwiches.
