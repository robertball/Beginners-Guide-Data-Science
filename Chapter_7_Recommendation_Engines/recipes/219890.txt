2 tablespoons barbeque sauce, or more as desired

1/2 cup prepared pulled pork
1/8 cup sliced onion
1/8 cup sliced red bell pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the pizza crust onto a baking sheet.
In a bowl, mix the barbeque sauce with chipotle chili powder; season with salt and black pepper.
Spread the sauce over the pizza crust.
Arrange pulled pork, sliced onion, and red bell pepper slices evenly over the pizza.
Bake in the preheated oven until the toppings are hot and the pizza crust is crisp on the bottom, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great way to use the leftovers from your slow cooker pulled pork. You can add any extra toppings to customize. When my husband and I first experimented with making this, we were so impressed that we had it at our Halloween party and it got rave reviews!
