Ingredients:
For the Sauce
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon (drained) horseradish
2 teaspoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
For the Pickles
peanut or vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Kosher salt
2 cups sliced dill pickles (drained)

Directions:
Make the sauce: Mix the mayonnaise, horseradish, ketchup and Cajun seasoning in a bowl; set aside.
Fry the pickles: Heat 1 inch peanut oil in a pot over medium-heat until a deep fry thermometer registers 375°. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl until smooth. Spread the pickles on paper towels and dry.
Add half of the pickles to the batter and toss to coat. Remove from the batter using a slotted spoon, letting the excess drip off, and add to the oil one at a time. Fry until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Return the oil to 375° and repeat with the remaining pickles and batter. Serve immediately with the prepared sauce.
