2 onions
several cloves of garlic
1 green pepper
Other vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, etc.
3 cans tomatoes (16 oz)

10 oz. red wine
about 2 c. water (add as needed)
ground fennel (1 T.?)
4-oz pesto or fresh or dried basil
garlic salt to taste
Cooked spaghetti

Directions:
Saute onions, garlic, and peppers for a few minutes, then add other veggies to saute for a few minutes more.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer for a few hours to blend flavors.  Or add vegetables at the end of cooking time so they will be a bit crispy.  Serve sauce over spaghetti.
