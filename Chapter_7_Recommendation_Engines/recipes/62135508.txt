Ingredients:
12 extra large egg whites
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 cup cake flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 heaping tsp. cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon
1 tablespoon cold water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 C).  Beat all ingredients except sugar and flour until stiff, gradually adding 1 c. sugar.  Sift together the flour and 1/2 a cup of sugar three times.  Gradually sift into egg whites, folding gently until flour is well mixed in.  Do not overdo, or you will lose the air that you have already put in.
Spoon into 10" tube or bundt pan rinsed in cold water.  Do not touch inside of pan, or the oil from your fingers will prevent the cake from sticking to the sides of the pan.  Using knife, cut through cake to get rid of large air pockets; level the surface, all the while making sure it sticks to the sides of the pan, and around the tube.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown and cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.  Open oven door carefully and only slightly when checking to keep cold air off of the cake.  Turn pan upside down and cool, completely, or cake will fall (and no loud noises or shaking of the floor).

This was my great aunt charity's recipe.  She had this cake down to a science!  I remember well how it would almost melt in my mouth.  It is definitely worth the time.
