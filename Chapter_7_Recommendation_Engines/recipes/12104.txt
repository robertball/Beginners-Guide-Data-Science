Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup water
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
2 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Combine 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, water, lemon peel and juice, and egg yolks in a saucepan.  Beat well.  Stir while cooking over medium heat until thick; it will thicken just as it starts to simmer.
Remove saucepan from heat.  Add cream cheese to lemon mixture, and stir until incorporated.
In a small bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add remaining 1/4 cup sugar.  Fold sweetened egg whites into lemon mixture.
Spoon filling into shell and chill.
