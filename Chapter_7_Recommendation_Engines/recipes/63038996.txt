Ingredients:
8 oz. Cream Cheese softened
1/2 cup cocktail seafood sauce
1/4 cup green olives
2 cups shredded sharp or old fort cheddar cheese
1 213 gram or 7.5 oz  canned red sock eye salmon, drained

Directions:
Mix everything but the salmon in the mixer until well incorporated. Add salmon and mix a little more to disperse throughout. Form into a ball and wrap with plastic wrap to chill for two hours. Roll in nuts, cracker crumbs or more cheese.
Serve with crackers or in a bowl as a vegetable dip. The mix would also work mixed with pasta for a pasta salad.
