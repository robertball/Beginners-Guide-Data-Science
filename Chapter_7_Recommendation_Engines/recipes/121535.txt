Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh or frozen cranberries, thawed
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, combine eggs, oil and orange peel; mix well. Add to dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk. Fold in cranberries, chocolate chips and walnuts. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf  pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. If glaze is desired, combine confectioners' sugar and orange juice until smooth; spread over cooled loaves.

Description: 
Tart berries, crunchy  nuts and sweet chocolate are simply scrumptious when mixed together in this easy quick bread. Sometimes I'll top it off with an orange-flavored glaze.
