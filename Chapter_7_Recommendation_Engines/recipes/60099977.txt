Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 2-inch pieces
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 Tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1  teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a bowl, stir together paprika, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle seasoning over chicken pieces. Dip pieces in egg, then dredge in bread crumbs. Arrange chicken pieces in a single layer on an aluminum foil-lined cookie sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stir together sugar, lemon juice, and curry powder, stirring until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.
Drizzle lemon sauce over chicken, return to oven, and bake 5 minutes more.
