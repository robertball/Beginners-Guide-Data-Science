Ingredients:
1/2 cup tapioca starch
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
cooking spray
Sauce:
4 ounces tomato sauce
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine tapioca starch, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken pieces through the mixture.
Line a baking sheet with a cooling rack and place chicken on rack to let excess dredge fall off. Lightly grease chicken with cooking spray and place in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.
Combine tomato sauce, gochujang sauce, honey, and soy sauce in a small bowl and drizzle over the chicken pieces.

Description: 
I'm lucky to live in an area with an abundance of Korean restaurants, and this is my take on a local restaurant's Korean fried chicken. Serve chicken with cooked rice if desired.
