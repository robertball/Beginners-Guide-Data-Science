Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice
6 cups boiling water
1 tablespoon salt
6 slices bacon
2 onions, chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Bring the rice, water, and salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
While the rice is cooking, cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Reserve about 1 tablespoon of bacon drippings in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Drain the bacon on a plate lined with paper towels; crumble the bacon once cooled enough to handle.
Cook and stir the onions in the reserved bacon drippings until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the crumbled bacon, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce; bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Spoon the cooked rice into the prepared baking dish and stir the tomato-bacon mixture into the rice until evenly combined.
Cover the dish and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes.
