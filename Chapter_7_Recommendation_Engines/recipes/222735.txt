Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups chocolate wafer crumbs
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin pie filling
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
2 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix chocolate wafer crumbs and melted butter in a bowl; press onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
Beat cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until just blended. Stir in pumpkin pie filling and cornstarch; pour over chocolate wafer crust.
Bake in preheated oven until center is just set, 50 to 55 minutes.
Spread sour cream over top of warm cheesecake; let cool.
Melt chocolate and oil in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave for 1 minute; stir until completely melted. Drizzle chocolate onto sour cream topping in a spiral pattern, starting from the center; draw a toothpick outward, from center to edges, through circles to form a web. Remove side of pan and serve.
