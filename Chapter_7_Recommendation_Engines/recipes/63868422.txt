Ingredients:
2 pounds cooked, shredded chicken or turkey
2 cups diced carrots
1/2 cup frozen green peas
1 cup diced celery
2 medium potatoes diced
2/3 cup butter
2/3 cup chopped onion
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 1/3 cup milk
4 chicken bouillon cubes
2 (9 inch)  unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
In a saucepan combine chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes and celery. Add enough water to cover vegetables and meat.  Cover with lid and boil for 15 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Remove from heat, strain and reserve 4 cups of broth.  Set aside meat mixture and broth.  Add bouillon to broth.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Remove from heat.  Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Return to heat and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thick.  Stir in meat mixture and remove from heat.
Pour filling into pie crusts or into individual 16 oz casserole dishes.  Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
