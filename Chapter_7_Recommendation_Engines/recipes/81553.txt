Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
4 hot dogs , cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 (15 ounce) can vegetarian baked beans
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 ounces Cheddar cheese, cubed
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
4 slices processed American cheese
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake empty pie shell for 10 minutes.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef until browned, stirring occasionally to crumble; drain fat. Stir in hot dogs, beans, ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, taco seasoning, and cheese cubes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Spread beef mixture into baked pie shell. Cut American cheese slices into strips, and make a lattice on top of pie.
Bake for 5 to 10 minute, or until cheese is slightly melted.

Description: 
My 12 year old daughter Deidra brought the basic recipe home from an after-school cooking class and I jazzed it up a bit! If you can't find a deep-dish pie crust, use 2 regular ones.
