Description: 
Tasty meatballs in a slightly spicy tangy bbq sauce sure to be a hit. The men love them they usually cluster around the crock pot at my parties and don't leave it until they're gone. Double or triple for parties. You can use frozen but definitely will not be the same but still good non the less.
