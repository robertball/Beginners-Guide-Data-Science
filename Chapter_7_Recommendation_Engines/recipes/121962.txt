Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
1 cup prepared Alfredo sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Pierce potatoes several times with a fork and place on a microwave-safe plate.  Microwave on high for 6 minutes or until tender.  Allow potatoes to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the Alfredo sauce, garlic powder, pepper and thyme.  Stir in 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese.  Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the pulp and add to the sauce mixture; mix well.  Spoon into potato shells.  Sprinkle with remaining cheddar cheese.  Microwave on high for 1 minute or until cheese is melted.
