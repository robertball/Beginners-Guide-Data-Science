Ingredients:
2 tbsp butter
6 eggs
1/4 c milk

Directions:
Place butter in a casserole or serving dish. Microwave on high (100%) until butter melts, about 30 seconds. Add eggs and milk and scramble with a fork. Microwave on high (100%) for about 1 1/2 minutes.
Eggs will start to set around the edge of the dish. Break up cooked portions with the fork; stir them to the center of the dish. Microwave another 1 1/2 minutes, stirring once or twice more from outside to center.
Stop cooking while eggs still look moist, soft and slightly underdone. If cooked until they are firm as you like, they will be overcooked and tough when served. Let stand 1 to 4 minutes. Stir again. If eggs are not firm enough, microwave a few seconds more.
