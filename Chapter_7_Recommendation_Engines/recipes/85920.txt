Ingredients:
5 medium-size potatoes, washed thoroughly
2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons garam masala
2 tablespoons coriander powder
2 tablespoons black pepper
10 cilantro leaves, chopped
6 tablespoons bread crumbs
oil for frying

Directions:
Place unpeeled potatoes in a large saucepan, fill with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are soft and tender. Drain, cool, and peel potatoes.
Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add salt, garam masala, coriander powder, pepper, and cilantro. Mash with a large fork or potato masher until there are no lumps. Shape potatoes into flat cutlets, about 2 or 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Coat each cutlet lightly in bread crumbs, and set aside.
Heat about 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry potato cutlets in batches until golden brown on both sides. Between batches, add oil as needed.
