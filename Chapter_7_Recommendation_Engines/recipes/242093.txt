Description: 
I really wanted to make some granola bars that I could bring to school (seeing that we weren't going to buy them) so I tested some things out and came up with this delicious snack! Stick them in lunches or have them for breakfast, it's a yummy treat for the whole family! You can add any nuts, seeds, and/or berries, if desired.
