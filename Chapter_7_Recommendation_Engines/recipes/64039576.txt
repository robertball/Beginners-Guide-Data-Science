Ingredients:
2 cups quick cooking oats
1 cup old fashioned oats
1.5 cups shredded coconut
3/4 cup raw almonds
1/2 cup walnut pieces
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup toasted wheat germ
1/2 cup pepitas (roasted pumpkin seeds)
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
1 tsp cinnamon
13x9 baking dish and parchment paper
3 baking sheets lined with foil
Small saucepan
Large bowl

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a 13x9 baking dish with parchment paper, leaving an inch or so sticking up on each side (functions as a handle to lift the granola out).  Spread oats, nuts and coconut on separate baking sheets, they require different times.  Bake the coconut for 5 minutes, nuts for 10 minutes (until fragrant), oats for 15 minutes.  Allow to cool on the baking sheets.
Bring butter, honey, brown sugar, vanilla and salt to a boil on medium heat in small saucepan.  Cook for 1-2 minutes, remove from heat.
Pour oats, nuts and coconut in a large bowl.  Add wheat germ and stir together.  Drizzle with butter mixture, toss to coat.  Add pepitas, cranberries, chocolate chips and cinnamon, mix until combined.
Press mixture into the baking dish and spread, evenly pressing into the corners.  Bake for 20-25 minutes (less time makes it more chewy, more makes it crunchy).  Allow to cool in the baking dish for 5 minutes, then remove and cool on a wire rack for 15-20 minutes.  Pour into individual bags, or into a storage container.  Lots of protein and loads of flavor.
Leftover Situation: Keep in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
