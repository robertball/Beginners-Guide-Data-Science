Description: 
I'm a fanatic bread maker who likes to tinker with recipes by altering weights and ingredients in order to achieve my goal of a great bread. As a big fan of King's Hawaiian® bread (and rolls), I tried all kinds of online recipes but did not find one that was close enough to the original. While King's does not use a roux (nor pineapple juice), if you want fluffy, pillowy texture that keeps for a few days, this technique is key! All my friends go nuts over this bread.
