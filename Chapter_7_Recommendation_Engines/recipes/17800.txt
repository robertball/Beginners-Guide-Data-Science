Ingredients:
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
3 cups white sugar
6 eggs, room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon orange extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. It should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla, orange and almond extracts. Blend in the flour mixture, alternating with the sour cream, until fully incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Allow cake to cool on rack before removing from pan to cool completely.
