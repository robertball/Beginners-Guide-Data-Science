Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
2 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
2 (16 ounce) containers ricotta cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pinch ground cinnamon, for garnish (optional)
1 pinch white sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, 1/2 cup sugar, shortening, 2 eggs, baking powder, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until dough comes together.
Press dough into a 9-inch pie dish, reserving about 1 tablespoon of dough for topping.
Beat ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth; pour cheese filling into prepared pie dish.
Divide reserved dough into 3 balls. Flatten balls and arrange atop pie filling.
Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of sugar over pie, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and filling begins to firm, about 75 minutes.
Chill pie in refrigerator until fully firm, about 3 hours.

Description: 
This is a creamy pie, not a dense cheesecake. For crust-challenged individuals (like myself), this is for you. The crust is cookie-like. Whenever I am invited to visit friends and ask if I can bring something, they always request this pie.
