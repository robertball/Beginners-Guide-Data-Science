Ingredients:
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry dough, thawed
2 teaspoons white sugar, or as needed for dusting

Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
You don't need to make your own dough when frozen puff pastry sheets work just fine. The key is keeping the dough flat when baking which we do by 'docking' it, or pricking all over with the tines of a fork. These crispy, buttery sheets are the first step in making your own Napoleons.
