Ingredients:
14 ounces rice noodles
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon black mustard seed
2 dried red chile peppers, chopped
3 tablespoons brown lentils
4 tablespoons roasted peanuts
3/4 cup shredded or flaked coconut
1/4 cup water
fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Place noodles in a medium size pot and add water, just to cover. Add salt and bring to a boil. After boiling 1 to 2 minutes, transfer noodles to a colander and let cold water run through it for about 3 seconds. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in a wok; when warm add mustard seed, chile peppers and lentils. Stir-fry until lentils start getting light brown, then add peanuts and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Stir in coconut and fry it until light brown; add cooked noodles and 1/4 cup water. Keep stirring all together over heat until well mixed, 10 to 20 seconds. Garnish with cilantro and serve.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite easy-to-make Indian recipes. Although I try to make it the best as I can, my grandma is THE BEST at this... the smell of which reminds me of my school days! Please watch out for measurements.. may not be wholly American!
