Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup pine nuts
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the prosciutto, garlic, and pine nuts in the melted butter until the garlic is fragrant and the nuts begin to turn brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice.
Bring a pot filled with lightly salted water to boil. Gently boil the asparagus until the bright green and barely tender, about 3 minutes; drain. Add the asparagus to the prosciutto mixture and toss to mix evenly. Season with salt and pepper; serve hot.
