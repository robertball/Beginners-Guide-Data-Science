Ingredients:
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
5 small onions, thinly sliced
Spices for the Pan:
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
For the Bhaji Mix:
5 tablespoons chickpea flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon tomato puree
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle in chili powder and mix. Add turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon coriander, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger. Stir well and remove from heat.
Combine chickpea flour,  1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon coriander, and salt in a bowl and mix well. Mix in the onions and tomato puree; add a little water until mixture is wet and easy to stir.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil onto the prepared baking sheet. Place 2 tablespoons of the onion mixture onto the baking sheet for each bhaji; flatten slightly with the back of a spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Drizzle remaining oil over the bhajis and continue baking until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
