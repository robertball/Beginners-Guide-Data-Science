Description: 
This casserole has so many interesting crispy components that it leaves your mouth so satisfied. You can add or subtract as desired but this recipe includes my favorites. I like to cook a well-seasoned whole chicken (cut-up) and debone and cut it up it for the most flavorful chicken, and then I use the broth for the dish. If you like celery and mushroom, they also work with this recipe.
