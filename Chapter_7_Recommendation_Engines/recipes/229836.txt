Ingredients:
12 medium new potatoes, unpeeled and cut into quarters
3 cups fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into desired length
5 tablespoons olive oil
6 hard-boiled (cooked) eggs, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with cold salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until tender, about 10 minutes, adding beans in the last 4 or 5 minutes of cooking. When vegetables are tender, drain. Place in a large bowl; toss with 2 tbsp olive oil. Add eggs.
Combine remaining 3 tbsp olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt and pepper. Drizzle vinaigrette over vegetables and eggs; toss gently to combine. Adjust seasonings, if necessary.
Serve warm.
