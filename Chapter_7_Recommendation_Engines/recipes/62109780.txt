Description: 
There is no octopus in this soup! I've made this for so long, I don't even remember which family member gave it to me, but this is a fun dish your kids will love to eat. Half the fun is the name and the other half is the great way it looks. Best of all, it's made with things kids love to eat...hot dogs and noodles!!!
