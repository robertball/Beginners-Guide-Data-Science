Ingredients:
1 head cabbage, or more to taste, quartered and cored
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 cloves garlic, crushed, or to taste
1/4 cup olive oil, or to taste
1/4 cup water (optional)

Directions:
Center a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Slice each cabbage quarter into 1/2-inch or 1/4-inch wedges. Spread half of the cabbage in a large roasting pan. Season lightly with salt and black pepper; scatter 4 garlic cloves on top. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over cabbage; do not mix. Layer remaining cabbage on top. Season with salt and black pepper; scatter remaining garlic cloves on top. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil on top.
Roast cabbage in the preheated oven until slightly softened, about 20 minutes. Add water if cabbage looks dry. Continue roasting until wilted, about 20 minutes more.

Description: 
If you're tired of the old boiled cabbage and like roasted veggies this will bring you back to one of our favorites. This is particularly good with ribs. Use crushed garlic to taste. I also like it a little burnt. Also watch out with those vegans because if you like leftovers you might have to make two pans at a time!
