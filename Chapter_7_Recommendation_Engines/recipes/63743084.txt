Description: 
We were supposed to go a local pub that serves their homemade house chips loaded with the works- melted cheese, sour cream, bacon etc.  Everything you should only have once in a great while.  As things worked out we weren't able to go out. Since I was still craving that sinful appetizer and my homemade chips aren't always scrumptious, it dawned on me why not use store bought kettle cooked chips and top them! This was the perfect way to indulge in my loaded chip craving.
