Description: 
A simple, basic, yet very tasty pasta sauce. I like to cook My Turkey Italian Meatballs (from this site) or other meats in it to add another layer of flavor. Add any herbs you like, as well. You can add tomatoes whole if you like a real chunky sauce, or blend them in a blender first to make a smooth sauce.
