Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold butter (no substitutes)
2 eggs
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup coarsely chopped blanched almonds
1 cup halved candied cherries

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In another bowl, beat eggs, milk and vanilla until blended; stir into dry ingredients until blended. Stir in almonds and cherries (the dough will be crumbly). Divide dough in half; shape each half into a ball. On an ungreased baking sheet, roll each ball into a 10-in. x 2-1/2-in. rectangle. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully remove to wire racks; cool for 20 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board; cut diagonally with a sharp knife into 3/4-in. slices. Place cut side down on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 15 minutes or until firm. Remove to wire racks to cool. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
I love baking all kinds of cookies, but since I'm Italian, biscotti is my all-time favorite. I remember nibbling on these as a child each Christmas.
