Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chocolate syrup (such as Hershey'sÂ®)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup amaretto liqueur
3 drops almond extract
1 cup chocolate chips
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 baking pan.
Mix chocolate syrup, flour, white sugar, 1/2 cup butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until smooth; spread into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool completely.
Beat confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup butter, amaretto liqueur, and almond extract in a bowl until smooth; spread over cooled brownies.
Stir chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons butter together in a saucepan over low heat until melted and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly and drizzle over frosted brownies.
