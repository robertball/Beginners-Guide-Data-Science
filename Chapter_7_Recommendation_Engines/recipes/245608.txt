Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup shortening (such as Crisco®), melted and cooled slightly
2 tablespoons shortening (such as Crisco®), melted and cooled slightly
1 tablespoon anise seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Directions:
Preheat pizzelle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix flour and baking powder together in a bowl.
Combine eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and beat on medium speed until well-blended. Add 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening and beat until blended. Add flour mixture and mix on medium speed until incorporated. Fold anise seeds and vanilla extract into batter with a spatula.
Drop a teaspoon of batter onto the preheated iron. Bake until golden, 30 to 40 seconds, or a few seconds longer for darker pizzelle.
