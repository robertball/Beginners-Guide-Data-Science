Description: 
Ever since my friend Sonja made this and brought it into work, it is my signature appetizer dish to take to parties!  I tweaked it a little to my taste.  It is the first appetizer to go and everyone will be asking for the recipe!  Serve with crackers or sliced bread.  Absolutely delicious!
