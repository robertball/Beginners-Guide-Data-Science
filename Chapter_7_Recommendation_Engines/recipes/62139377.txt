Ingredients:
2 unbaked deep dish pie shells
2 cups Karo dark corn syrup
1 1/2 cup sugar
6 eggs, beaten
1 stick butter, melted
2 Tablespoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup chocolate syrup
1 cup Kahlua or Kahlua-flavored coffee syrup
1 1/2 cups chocolate chips
2 cups pecan halves

Directions:
Preheat over to 350 degrees.
In each of two pie shells add 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of pecan halves and spread easily across the bottom.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, add the corn syrup and eggs and whisk together until well blended.
Add the sugar, melted butter and vanilla extract and blend well with whisk.
Stir in the chocolate syrup and Kahlua.
Pour the filling into each of the two pie shells, being careful to distribute evenly and not disturb the nuts and chocolate chips.
Fill any holes on top with pecans.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned and the filling is puffy and appears set.
Cool on wire rack.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
Kahlua, pecan & chocolate pie that is the perfect autumn desert.  The chocolate chips don't make it too sweet while adding just the right texture to a pecan pie.  The Kahlua tastes better if you let the pie sit for a day or two ;).  This is not just your typical pecan pie.
