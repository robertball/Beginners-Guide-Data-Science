Ingredients:
32 frozen potato rounds (such as Ore-Ida® Crispy Crowns®)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
8 ounces ground beef (85% lean)
1/4 pinch kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
4 slices American cheese
1 tablespoon ketchup, or to taste
1 tablespoon mustard, or to taste
16 pickled gherkins, drained
16 toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Toss tots with oil on a 10x15-inch baking pan, then spread into a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until browned and crisp, 15 to 18 minutes.
Meanwhile, put ground beef on a sheet of waxed paper. Top with another sheet and press beef into a 4x6-inch rectangle. Remove top sheet. Sprinkle beef with salt and pepper, then cut into sixteen 1x1 1/2-inch rectangles.
Break each cheese slice into quarters; fold quarters over to make 16 pieces of double-layered cheese.
Cook beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn burgers over, top with cheese; cook, covered, until beef is no longer pink in centers and cheese has melted, about 3 minutes.
Top 1 tot with a cheeseburger, ketchup, mustard, pickle, and another tot; spear stack with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

Description: 
If you didn't think sliders could get any smaller--or cuter--then you haven't tried swapping coin-shaped tots for buns! This dish is one of the times where it tastes as good as it looks.
