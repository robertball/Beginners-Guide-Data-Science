Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
4 pork chops
4 dashes onion powder
4 dashes garlic powder
8 slices Cheddar cheese
12 slices bacon

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add pork chops; season with onion and garlic powder. Cook until pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side.
Transfer pork chops to a plate; top each one with 2 slices of Cheddar cheese. Place a bowl over the plate to trap in heat.
Place bacon into the skillet; cook until crisp and no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Wrap 3 slices of bacon around each pork chop.

Description: 
This is comfort food. I'm a bit of a wild chef, so you'll love this. Give it a try! How wrong can you go with cheese and bacon on top of a pork chop? Easy to make, but you got to be fast.
