Ingredients:
8 Black Mission Figs
Crumbled goat cheese
3 slices Prosciutto-cut into pieces, trim fat
Honey

Directions:
Rinse and dry the figs.  Cut the stems off and slice each fig in half.  Lay the fig halves on a baking sheet.  Put enough crumbled goat cheese on each fig half to almost cover.  Take the prosciutto pieces and lay them on top of the goat cheese.  Put the baking sheet under the broiler on high for 5-6 minutes.  The prosciutto should start to crisp, keep your eye on them!  Remove from the oven, place on a serving plate and drizzle the warm figs with honey.

Description: 
When I lived in Caliornia, I couldn't wait until the farmer's markets had figs...big, juicy, amazing to eat!  They are hard to find in Colorado, and are less flavorful than the ones in CA.  So, I came up with this little appetizers to showcase some of my favorite ingredients.
