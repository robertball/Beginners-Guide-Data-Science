Ingredients:
Pie:
1 pastry for a 9-inch pie crust
2 cups mashed sweet potatoes
3 egg yolks
1 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup toasted shredded coconut
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Meringue:
3 egg whites
6 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with prepared pie pastry.
Beat sweet potatoes and egg yolks together in a bowl until smooth. Mix milk, 1/2 cup white sugar, coconut, melted butter, salt, nutmeg, and vanilla extract into sweet potato mixture; pour into prepared pie pastry.
Bake in the preheated oven until pie is set, 35 to 40 minutes.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add 6 tablespoons sugar, beating until meringue is glossy and stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over hot pie. Bake in the oven until meringue is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes more.
