Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 t minced garlic
green onion, finely chopped
1 packet taco seasoning
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained

Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef with the garlic, 1/2 taco seasoning and onion; drain.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat mixture, remainder taco seasoning, black beans, corn, sour cream and salsa. Stir until well blended.
Into a 9x13 inch baking dish, spoon 1/2 beef mixture. Arrange half of the crushed tortilla chips on top of the meat mixture and layer with 1 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese. Spoon remaining meat mixture on top of the cheese layer, cover with remaining chips and layer with remaining cheese. Top with diced tomato and green onions, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A delicious southwestern recipe that includes black beans. I use mild salsa, but if you like it spicy, use hot salsa. This is one of my favorite recipes.Modified from: Southwestern Bake
