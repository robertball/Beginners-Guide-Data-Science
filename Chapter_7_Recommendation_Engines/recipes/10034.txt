Description: 
This recipe  is from my great grandmother.  I entered these in our County Fair.  There were over 60 entries in the drop cookie category.  I received 2nd place. Pretty darn good, huh? My great grandmother would have been so proud. You can make sour milk by combining 1/2 cup of milk with 1 teaspoon vinegar and allow to set 10 minutes.
