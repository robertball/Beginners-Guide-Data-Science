Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 cup grated carrot
1 cup grated zucchini
1/2 cup honey
Frosting:
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1 cup crushed pineapple, well drained
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans.
Mix sugar, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda in a bowl.
Combine oil, eggs, carrots, and zucchini in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on low speed until well blended. Beat in honey. Stir in sugar mixture gradually; beat on medium speed until batter is smooth, about 3 minutes.
Divide batter evenly among prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack; allow to cool completely, about 25 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, pineapple, cream cheese, walnuts, butter, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat until frosting is smooth. Spread over cooled cakes and stack.
