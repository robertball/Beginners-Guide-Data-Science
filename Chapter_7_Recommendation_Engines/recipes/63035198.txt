Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup wine vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 (3 ounce) packages raman noodles (without flavor packets), lightly crushed
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1 cup sesame seeds
1 head napa cabbage, chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk together vegetable oil, sugar, wine vinegar, and soy sauce until the sugar has dissolved. Refrigerate the dressing while preparing the salad.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the broken ramen noodles, almonds, and sesame seeds onto a baking sheet.
Bake the ramen noodle mixture until lightly browned, about 15 minutes, stirring often. Watch carefully to prevent burning. Allow mixture to cool.
Just before serving, mix together the napa cabbage and green onions with toasted ramen mixture in a salad bowl until thoroughly combined; toss with the dressing.
