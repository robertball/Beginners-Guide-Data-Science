Ingredients:
2 Boxes of rice check cereal (approx. 9 to 11 oz. box)
1 16 oz. jar of creamy peanut butter
1 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips
1 32 oz. bag of powdered sugar

Directions:
Put peanut butter and chocolate chips in a large microwavable bowl.
Microwave for 1 minute and stir.
Continue to microwave in 30 sec. increments, stirring each time, until the mixture is smooth.
Dump 1 box of cereal into a 2 GALLON zipper bag.
Pour in about 1/2 of the chocolate/peanut butter mixture.  Be careful to avoid zipper area - it must seal tightly.
Add the 2nd box of cereal and the rest of the chocolate/peanut butter mixture.
Seal bag tightly, gently toss and tumble for about 3-5 minutes. Be sure all cereal is thoroughly coated.
Pour in about 3/4 of the powdered sugar, reseal zipper bag, and tumble for another 3-5 minutes.  You may need more or less powdered sugar to coat everything evenly.
Transfer Puppy Chow to another clean zipper bag to serve.
