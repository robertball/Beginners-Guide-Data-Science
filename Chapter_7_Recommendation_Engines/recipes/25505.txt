Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup honey
¼ cup molasses
2 tablespoons chile sauce
1 teaspoon ground ginger

Place chicken in a shallow, medium dish.
In a medium bowl, mix soy sauce, honey, molasses, chile sauce, ground ginger and garlic. Pour the mixture over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate approximately 1 hour, turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large baking dish, arrange chicken in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven approximately 50 minutes, brushing with remaining soy sauce mixture often and turning once, until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear.
