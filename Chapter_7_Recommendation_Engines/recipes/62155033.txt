https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 (8 oz) container of Cool Whip (thawed)
2 (8 oz) cans of crushed pineapple (drained)
3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, sliced
3 lg Snickers candy bars, cubed
1/2 cup peanuts, chopped

Directions:
Combine Cool Whip and pineapple in a large bowl
Fold chopped apples, candy bars, and peanuts into the Cool Whip mixture
*I usually double this recipe and when I do I just round the sizes of the containers...it keeps it easier then measuring things out.  I also use the chopped nuts ice cream topping because it is already chopped and I typically use an entire bag (minus what I eat first!) of the snack size Snickers.  I chop them in quarters and throw them all in the dish.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my consultant said USED to be from Pampered Chef.  However, no one I knows has ever heard of it.  They all love it though!
