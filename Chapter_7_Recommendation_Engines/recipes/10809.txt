Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups raisins
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
For cookies, cream margarine with peanut butter. Mix in sugar, then beat in eggs and milk.  Stir in baking soda, oats, and flour.
To Make Filling:  Combine raisins, water, and lemon juice.  Heat until nearly boiling.  Mix sugar with cornstarch; add enough (cold) water to make a paste.  Stir into raisin mixture and heat until clear.
Shape dough into walnut-sized balls.  Place on a greased cookie sheet. Using your thumb, indent the center of each ball, making a fairly good-sized hollow spot.  Fill with about a teaspoon of filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 10-12 minutes.

Description: 
These were a favorite cookie in my family when I was growing up, and we loved to help Mom make the thumbprints in each cookie, where the sweet raisin filling was placed before baking.
