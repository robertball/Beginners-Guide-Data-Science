Ingredients:
juice of 8 limes
1/2 cup chopped cilantro (about 1/2 bunch, leaves only)
4 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
1 packet "Sazon, with cilantro and annato" (available in most Latino food sections)
1 tablespoon McCormick Fajita Seasoning
1/2 cup canola oil
2 red bell peppers
2 green bell peppers
2 onions
3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts (or equivalent of thigh meat)
12 8-in. flour tortillas
2 cups sour cream (optional)
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Marinade:  In a large bowl, combine lime juice, cilantro, garlic, Sazon, fajita seasoning and canola oil.  Add 1/4 cup minced red pepper, 1/4 cup minced green pepper and 1/4 cup minced onion.
Add chicken, cut in 1/2 in. strips (slice across the breast, not lengthwise) and remaining peppers and onions, sliced.
Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour or up to a day.
Grill in a grill basket or perforated grilltop pan.  Avoid crowding - grill in a few batches if necessary.  Serve on a warm tortilla with a dollop of sour cream and/or some shredded cheddar.

Description: 
I concocted this randomly for a cookout years ago and they were shockingly delicious!  We freeze them to take on camping trips.  Even my kids like them.
