Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 1/2 pounds chicken pieces
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
1 cup coarsely chopped apple
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 1/8 cups BAKER'S ANGEL FLAKE Coconut, divided
1 clove chopped garlic
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees F.
Mix 1/4 cup of the flour, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Coat chicken pieces with flour mixture. Place chicken, skin sides up, in single layer in shallow baking pan. Dot with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until chicken begins to brown.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan on medium-high heat. Add apple, onion, 2 tablespoons of the coconut, garlic and curry powder. Cook and stir until onion is tender but not browned. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon flour and chicken broth; bring to boil. Remove from heat.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Pour sauce over chicken pieces.  Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup coconut. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Place chicken and sauce on serving platter. Serve over rice, if desired.
