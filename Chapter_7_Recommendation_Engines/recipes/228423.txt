Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Mix crumbs, butter, and sugar in a bowl. Press mixture into a 9-inch pie plate. Use a spoon to press the crumbs up the side of the plate and the side of your hand to press down on the top.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour before filling.

Description: 
A no-bake recipe using softened butter instead of melted butter. I find this produces a better consistency for the crust.
