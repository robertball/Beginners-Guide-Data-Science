Ingredients:
Grits
1 cup	      regular grits (not instant!)
2 1/4 cup     2% milk
2 cup	      water
2 tsp 	      chicken bouillon base/paste
1/2 c	      grated sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 c	      grated parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp       smoked salt (ok to use regular salt too)
*************
Shrimp
1/2 	jalapeno, seeded, extra finely minced
3/4 cup diced green bell pepper
3/4 cup diced yellow onion
3/4 cup diced celery (about 2 large stalks)
1/2 tsp minced garlic (about 2 large cloves)
1 tsp 	cajun seasoning
1 	bay leaf
3 TBS 	flour
14 oz can fire roasted diced/chopped tomatoes
1 cup 	dry white wine
1/2 lb 	andouille sausage, sliced into 1/4 pieces
1 lb 	large shrimp, peeled (ok to leave the last little bit of the tail on)

Directions:
For the Sauce:  brown sausage in a skillet with 2 TBS oil.  Remove sausage and set aside.  Next, saute the peppers, onion, celery in the same skillet for about 10 minutes (or longer until tender and translucent).  Add the garlic and cajun seasoning, cook for 1 minute, then add the flour and stir until flour is completely absorbed.  Slowly add the tomatoes and then the white wine using the liquid to make a roux.  Next, add the bay leaf and simmer for 5 minutes (adding water or wine as needed to keep consistency from getting too thick).  You may add salt and pepper to taste.
For the grits: bring water, milk, smoked salt, and bouillon base to a boil in a medium saucepan (stirring to keep milk from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan), slowly whisk in the grits, and then reduce heat to simmer, cover the pan, and cook for about 20 minutes….stirring occasionally.  You can add a little milk or water if the grits get too thick.
About 5-10 minutes before the grits are done, add the shrimp and the reserved sausage to the skillet and turn the heat back up to medium.  Cook for about 5-8 minutes or until shrimp are done and sausage is heated.  Remove and discard the bay leaf.
Just before serving: mix the cheeses into the grits until melted.
For each serving, spoon grits on the plate and top with the shrimp/sausage sauce…you may also sprinkle some diced chives or green onions on top for presentation.
