Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or to taste
1 pound turkey sausage
2 cups fresh spinach
12 egg whites
1/4 cup almond milk
3/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1 pinch ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups peeled and grated sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in turkey sausage and spinach. Cook and stir until sausage is browned and spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.
Combine egg whites and almond milk in a large bowl; stir well. Add sage, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, basil, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
Layer grated sweet potatoes evenly on the bottom of the baking dish. Add turkey and spinach on top. Pour egg mixture over casserole. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Cut into 6 pieces.
