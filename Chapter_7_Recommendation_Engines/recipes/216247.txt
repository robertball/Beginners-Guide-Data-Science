Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 yams, peeled and cut into wedges
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
5 tablespoons fat-free sour cream
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon taco seasoning
1/8 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the olive oil over a baking sheet.
Arrange the yams on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer; season with the seasoned salt.
Bake the yams in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes.
While the yams bake, stir the sour cream, mayonnaise, taco seasoning, and paprika together in a small bowl. Serve as a dip for the yams.
