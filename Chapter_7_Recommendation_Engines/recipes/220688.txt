Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup uncooked quinoa
2 cups vegetable broth
3/4 pound salmon fillets
1 cup white wine
1/2 cup water, or more as needed to cover
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch Swiss chard, stems and tough ribs removed, leaves cut into 1/2-inch-wide ribbons
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Stir quinoa into onion mixture until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.
Pour vegetable broth into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat salmon, white wine, and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Simmer until salmon is cooked through and easily flaked with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes; drain.
Transfer salmon to a plate and flake fish meat; discard skin and set salmon aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir 2 cloves garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir Swiss chard and lemon juice into garlic until Swiss chard begins to soften, about 2 minutes; remove from heat.
Gently fold flaked salmon and chard into the cooked quinoa. Season with salt and black pepper.
