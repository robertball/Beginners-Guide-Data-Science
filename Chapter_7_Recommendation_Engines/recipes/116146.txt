1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange peel

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy; beat in the eggs, orange peel and extracts. Combine flour and baking powder; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk.
Pour into a greased and floured 6-cup fluted tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool. For glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and juice until smooth. Spoon over cake.

This recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law, who got it from her mother-in-law. Although Grandma Tucker has been gone for years now, her wonderful cake brings back sweet memories. -Melissa Tucker, Ozark, Arkansas
