Ingredients:
• 2 slices pancetta
• 1 tablespoon butter
• 1 tablespoons Olive Oil or Coconut Oil
• 1 teaspoon coconut flour
• 1 cup low sodium chicken or vegetable stock
• 6 spring onions , trimmed, outer leaves discarded, and finely chopped
• 14 ounces fresh peas (you can use frozen but fresh work best)
• 1/4  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
• 1 teaspoon sea salt
• 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
• 1 lemon, juiced
• Olive Oil to drizzle

Directions:
Special Equipment
Take out your large sauté pan that has a cover! You will need to cover when simmering the peas! If you do not have a cover then use foil.
Directions
Heat your sauté pan and add 1/2 teaspoon of coconut or olive oil. Cut your pancetta into small cubes. Cook until crispy. Put in a bowl to the side.
In the same sauté pan add the butter and remainder of oil. Then add coconut flour and stir around (I like to use a small whisk). Slowly add the stock.
Add the spring onions and peas season with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.
Put the lid on and simmer for 5 minutes or until tender. Taste for any additional seasoning, add lemon juice and just when you are about to serve drizzle with a little olive oil.
