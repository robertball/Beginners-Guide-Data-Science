Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cups extra crunch peanut butter (10 ounces)
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup old-fashioned oatmeal
18 fun size Butterfingers (12 ounces)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In the bowl of a food processor combine the flour, oatmeal, baking soda, and salt.  Process until mixture is a fine texture.  Set aside.
In a large bowl cream together shortening, butter, brown sugar, white sugar, and peanut butter until smooth.
Beat in the eggs one at a time until well blended.  Add vanilla and mix well.
Stir the flour/oatmeal mixture into the creamed mixture.  Add the chopped Butterfingers and stir until well combined.
Using a one inch melon baller, scoop a rounded mound of cookie dough and place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Do not flatten cookies.
Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated oven, or until just light brown.  Cool and store in an airtight container.  Makes 38 large cookies.
