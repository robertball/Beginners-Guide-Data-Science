Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup heavy cream, or more if needed
1 (16-ounce) box confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup chopped nuts, optional

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in brown sugar and cream.
Bring to a boil, and transfer to a mixing bowl.
Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla.
Beat with a handheld electric mixer until it reaches a spreading consistency.
At this time it may be necessary to add a tablespoon of heavy cream, or more, if frosting gets too thick. Just be sure to add cream in small amounts because you can always "add to", but you can't take away. Frost cake and sprinkle top with chopped nuts, if desired.
