Description: 
Nothing is more soothing than a hot cup of spiced orange cider on a cold winter's night. I've enjoyed this recipe for years. Bring this mix to work, as it's a sure-fire drink your co-workers will L-O-V-E. It's also a cute, easy, inexpensive holiday gift that's fun for the kiddos (looks like sand art). Enjoy!
