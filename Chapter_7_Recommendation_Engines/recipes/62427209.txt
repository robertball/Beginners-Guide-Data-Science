Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 egg, beaten
1 small yellow onion, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup brown sugar
2 cups water
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons corn starch
1 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
Sesame Seeds (optional)
1/2 teaspoon dried chili flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F (180 C).
In a small frying pan over medium heat saute onions and ginger in olive oil.
When onions are translucent add garlic and continue to saute for an additional  minute.
Remove pan from heat and allow to cool.
In a large bowl combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, onion mixture, salt and pepper.
Use your hands to combine all the ingredients and form 1 inch meatballs. Recipe should yield approximately 40 meatballs.
Place meatballs on an oiled baking sheet and bake in oven for 35 minutes, turning at the halfway point.
While the meatballs are cooking make the sauce by combining sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, 1 1/2 cups of water and chili flakes in a medium sized pot.
Over medium-high heat bring mixture to a boil, stirring to combine.
Make a cornstarch slurry by combining the cornstarch with 1/2 cup of cold water.
Whisk the slurry into the boiling sauce and keep whisking until the sauce returns to a boil. Once boiled the sauce will have thickened.
Keep the sauce warm.
Once the meatballs are cooked add them to the pot of sauce and stir to coat.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.
