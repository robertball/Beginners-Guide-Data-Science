Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup margarine
1 egg
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup halved candied cherries
1/4 cup candied citron peel
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
In a saucepan, heat milk, water, and butter or margarine until warm.
In large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, yeast, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, mace, and cloves; mix well.   Stir in warm milk mixture and  egg.  Blend with an electric mixer at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed.  By hand, stir in raisins, cherries, citron, nuts, and enough remaining flour to make a firm dough.
Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover.   Let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down.  Shape into a round loaf, and place in a greased 2 quart casserole.  Cover, and let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Brush top of loaf with melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with 1 teaspoon sugar.
Bake at 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes, until deep golden brown.  If too dark, cover loosely with foil last 5 to 10 minutes of baking.  Cool.
