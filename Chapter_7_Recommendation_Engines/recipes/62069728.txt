Ingredients:
1-llb box of tri colored "twisty" pasta fully cooked, rinsed, drained and cooled.
1 head broccoli cut into bite size "flowerettes" uncooked
1 head cauliflower cut into bite sized "flowerettes" uncooked
1 small red onion chopped
1 large can, large black pitted olives sliced
1-16oz block mozerella cheese sliced and then cut into small cubes
1 stick peperoni medium sliced, then cut into quarters
1-2 tsb minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
olive oil to taste
red wine vinigar to taste
Dash of Italian Seasoning (optional)

Directions:
Making sure the pasta is fully cooked, rinsed, drained and cooled combine everything together except the oil and vinigar. Mix thoroughly. Add your italian seasoning if you wish. Add oil and vinigar a little at a time until you get the flavor consistancy you are looking for. You may want to add a little extra, as the pasta and the rest of the ingredients sometimes absorb the liquid overnight. Mix well and refrigerate overnight, as it always tastes best the day after it is made.
**NOTE** If your pasta salad is a little dry the next day, go ahead and add a little more oil, vinigar or both. This can happen if the pasta is not cooked all the way, or not enough was added at the begining.
