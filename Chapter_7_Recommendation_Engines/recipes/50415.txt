Ingredients:
5 pounds self-rising flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 cup lard, melted
2 quarts buttermilk
1 cup 2% milk
1/4 cup bacon drippings

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the self-rising flour and baking powder. Pour in the melted lard and mix until blended. Stir in the buttermilk and milk just until the dough comes together.
Pat the dough out on a lightly floured surface and roll to 3/4 inch thickness. Cut into biscuits using a biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter. Place on baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Brush the tops with bacon drippings.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bottoms and tops are lightly browned.
