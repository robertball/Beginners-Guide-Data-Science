Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 ounces baby spinach
Salt and pepper
8 ounces cream cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon garlic powder
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 large eggs, beaten
2 cups panko breadcrumbs
Â¼ cup canola oil, for frying

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the spinach, season liberally with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until spinach is wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
In a medium bowl, combine the cooked spinach, cream cheese, mozzarella, and garlic powder, and stir to combine.
Flatten chicken breasts. Take a heaping spoonful of the spinach dip and pack it onto the chicken. Pinch the edges of the chicken closed and stick with a toothpick.
Place the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs in three separate bowls. Take 1  chicken roll and roll it in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the floured chicken in the eggs, then dredge in the breadcrumbs, making sure to coat all sides evenly. Repeat to bread the remaining chicken.
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Fry the chicken until the breadcrumbs are golden brown, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and drain.
Place rolls on a oven dish and bake for another 10 min. on 350F
Serve!
