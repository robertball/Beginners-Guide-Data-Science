Ingredients:
1 large onion, minced
6-7 cloves garlic, minced
2 colored bell peppers, chopped
1 chipotle chili, chopped (seeded if you’re worried about heat; I seed mine)
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 heaping cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth (1 can)
5 cups low-fat milk
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2-3 small red potatoes, chopped
1 small can corn, drained
1 can black beans, drained
2 cups chopped, cooked chicken (I used leftover chicken from this recipe)
Adobo sauce from chipotle chilies to taste (we used 2-3 teaspoons)
Chipotle Tabasco sauce
Shredded sharp cheddar or pepper jack cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet. Saute the onion, garlic, bell peppers, and chipotle chili until the veggies are tender. Add the flour and cook 2-3 minutes. Add the broth and cook until the flour is smooth and the broth is starting to thicken. Add the milk and bring to a low simmer. Add the potatoes and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure the milk isn’t burning. Add the chicken, corn, black beans and a small amount of adobo sauce at a time, and any additional salt to taste. Serve with chipotle Tabasco sauce and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.
