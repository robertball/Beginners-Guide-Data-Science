Ingredients:
2 large russet potato
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
8 oz of sour cream
1 slice of crispy bacon, pieces (optional)

Directions:
Scrub the potato, and prick several times with a fork.
Place on a plate.
Cook on full power in the microwave for 5 minutes. Turn over, and continue to cook for 5 more minutes. When the potato is soft, remove from the microwave, and cut in half lengthwise. Season with salt and pepper, and mash up the inside a little using a fork. Top the open sides with butter and 2 tablespoons of cheese. Return to the microwave, and cook for about 1 minute to melt the cheese.
Top with remaining cheese, sour cream, bacon (optional) and serve.

Description: 
I don't have much use for a microwave, but one thing it does do good is cook a potato. If you don't have time to make a oven baked potato this is the way to go.
