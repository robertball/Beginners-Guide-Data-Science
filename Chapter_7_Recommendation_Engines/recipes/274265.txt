Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup minced shallots
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 bay leaves
1 dried Thai chile pepper
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 cup lime juice
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt as needed
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 pounds mussels, cleaned

Directions:
Heat butter in a sauce pan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garam masala, turmeric, bay leaves, and chile pepper and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.
Add ginger and tomato paste to the saucepan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Pour in coconut milk and lime juice. Mix in sugar and black pepper; stir well. Bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt.
Add mussels to the saucepan and simmer until all shells open, about 5 minutes. Discard any shells that do not open. Place in a bowl and sprinkle with cilantro.
