Ingredients:
4 cups quick oats
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 Tbs brown sugar
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup maple syrup
1 cup pecans (raw)
1/2 cup pumpkin puree (canned or baked, soft)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees and spray two large sheet pans.
Toss the oats, seasonings, brown sugar, and salt in one bowl.
Melt the coconut oil and mix with pumpkin, maple syrup, and pecans.
Combine the wet and dry ingredients, divide in halves, and spread evenly on the two sheet pans.
Bake for 20 minutes and then turn the oats until they are mixed well.  Return to the oven for another 15-20 minutes until browned and crispy.
Let the granola cool completely on the sheet pan and make sure the batches are dry before storing in bags or containers.
