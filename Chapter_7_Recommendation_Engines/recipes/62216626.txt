Ingredients:
4 Pork Chops, 1/2" thick
1 Cup Buttermilk
1/2 Cup Flour or Rice Flour
1 Cup Panko crumbs w/ seasoning of choice
1 T. Oil

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 400
Place pork chops in a resealable storage bag - pour buttermilk over the pork chops and let marinate in the refrigerator.
Dip the pork chops into the seasoned flour, back into the buttermilk and then into seasoned Panko crumbs.
Heat an oven proof skillet (cast iron works well) with about 1 Tablespoon of oil.
When the skillet is hot, place chops into skillet and sear without moving the meat.  Spray the top side with cooking spray  and flip the chops over.  Sear for just a minute or two.
Place the whole pan in preheated oven for about 15 - 20 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops. Internal temperature should be 145.
Remove from oven and let stand for about 10 minutes before serving.
