Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups NESTLE速 TOLL HOUSE速 Dark Chocolate & Mint Morsels
1/3 cup coarsely chopped oven-roasted or toasted almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line small baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.
Pour morsels onto prepared baking sheet. Arrange morsels so they are touching each other in a single layer (roughly an 11 x 9-inch rectangle).
Bake for 1 to 3 minutes or until morsels are shiny. Remove from oven to wire rack. With tip of butter knife or wooden pick, immediately swirl morsels to create a swirled pattern.
Sprinkle with nuts. Hold baking sheet 3 inches above counter and drop to settle nuts into melted morsels. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until firm. Break into pieces. Store in airtight container in refrigerator.
