Ingredients:
24oz tub of sour cream or lite sour cream
1 envelope Fiesta Ranch salad dressing mix
1 envelope Good Seasons Cheese Garlic salad dressing mix
1 to 2 bundles of fresh cilantro (cut off base of stems about 2 inches)
1 to 2 fresh jalapenos (remove stems and seeds or leave in seeds for hotter dip)
splash of lime juice (about a tablespoon)

Directions:
In a food processor, add cilantro and jalapenos and blend until finely minced. Then add all remaining ingredients. Blend on high for 2 to 3 minutes (until creamy and thoroughly blended together). Pour and serve with veggies, Ruffles, etc. You can add it to any dish you would normally put sour cream on, it's great on fajitas, tacos, grilled chicken, potatoes, etc. Store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I can't show up to a potluck without this dip or people get upset. It's so good on just about everything, as a dip for veggies, chips, put it on chicken, tacos, fajitas, wraps, etc. I can't stand sour cream, but I love this dip. Try it, you'll love it!!!
