Ingredients:
24 frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater TotsÂ®)
cooking spray
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes, or to taste
10 slices cooked bacon, chopped
12 eggs
1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread potato nuggets onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until nuggets are half-cooked, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool until easily handled. Cut each nugget in half.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper, spinach, green onions, and sun-dried tomatoes for 5 minutes. Drain excess liquid and stir in chopped bacon.
Beat eggs, cream, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper together in a large bowl.
Spoon bacon mixture into the prepared muffin cups and top each with Monterey Jack cheese. Pour egg mixture over cheese layer until each cup is nearly full. Place 4 potato nugget halves into each.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle, 20 to 25 minutes.
