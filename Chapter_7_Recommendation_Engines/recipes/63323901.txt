Ingredients:
- 1 2/3 c. evaporated milk
- 2/3 c. chopped onion
- 1/4 c. fine, dry bread crumbs
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. all spice
- dash of pepper
- 1 lb. ground round
- 2 tsp. butter
- 2 beef bouillon cubes
- 1 c. boiling water
- 1/2 c. cold water
- 2 tbsp. all purpose flour
- 1 tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Combine 2/3 c. evaporated milk, onion, crumbs, salt, all spice, and pepper.  Add meat.  Mix well, chill.  Shape meat mixture into one inch balls.  In large skillet, brown meatballs in butter.  Dissolve bouillon cubes in boiling water, pour over meatballs and bring to boil over medium heat.  Cover.  Simmer for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, blend together cold water and flour.  Remove meatballs from skillet.  Skim fat from pan juices and reserve juices.  Stir 1 c. evaporated milk and flour mixture into pan juices in skillet.  Cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring until sauce thickens.
Return meatballs to skillet.  Stir in lemon juice.
* After I make my noodles (however many I need), I cover them with the meatballs and sauce and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 - 15 minutes to get sauce infused in the noodles.
