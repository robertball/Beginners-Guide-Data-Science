Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 onion, minced
6 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 eggplant, peeled and cubed
10 leaves fresh basil, chopped
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add eggplant, basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper to onion mixture; cook and stir, mashing occasionally with a wooden spoon, until eggplant is cooked through but still holds shape, about 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and cool mixture to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as Silpat(R)).
Mix Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs into eggplant mixture; shape into 15 to 18 "meatballs". Arrange "meatballs" on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 30 minutes.
