Ingredients:
2 tablespoon butter
2 TBL. chopped green onions
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 (10.75 ounce) can  cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup milk
1/4 tsp. cumin
2 tsp.  chopped fresh cilantro
2 chopped jarred jalepino  slices
3 cups shredded cooked chicken breast meat
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
2 cups shredded monteray jack cheese
10 (12 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and saute the green onion until tender (about 3 to 4 minutes). Add the garlic powder, then stir in the green chiles, cream of mushroom soup and sour cream. Mix well. Reserve 3/4 of this sauce and set aside. To the remaining 1/4 of the sauce in the saucepan, add the chicken and 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Stir together.
Fill each flour tortilla with the chicken mixture and roll up. Place seam side down in the prepared baking dish.
In a small bowl combine the reserved 3/4 of the sauce with the milk. Spoon this mixture over the rolled tortillas and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly.
