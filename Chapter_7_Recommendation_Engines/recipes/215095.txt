Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
4 tilapia fillets
2/3 cup chopped mango
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons orange juice
4 teaspoons minced jalapeno pepper
4 teaspoons minced red onion
2 teaspoons minced red bell pepper
2 teaspoons minced green bell pepper
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Stir the olive oil, garlic, basil, black pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Put the tilapia fillets in a resealable plastic bag; pour the olive oil mixture over the fillets and seal the bag. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Make the salsa by stirring the mango, lime juice, orange juice, jalapeno pepper, red onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, parsley, and black pepper together in a bowl. Refrigerate for 1 hour to allow the flavors to blend.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the tilapia from the marinade, shaking off any excess oil, and wrap each fillet in a piece of aluminum foil.
Cook the tilapia on the preheated grill until the flesh easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Spoon the salsa over the tilapia to serve.

Description: 
This is my boyfriend's absolute favourite meal. It is very easy to prepare, and goes great on top of lemon basmati rice. I like to present it by placing the tilapia on top of lemon basmati rice, with the mango salsa spread over top of the fish.
