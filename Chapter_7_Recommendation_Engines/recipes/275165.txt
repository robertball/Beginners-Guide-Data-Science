Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package yolk-free egg noodles (such as No Yolks速)
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup frozen peas and carrots
1 cup skim milk
1 (6 ounce) can tuna packed in water, drained
1/4 cup light processed cheese food (such as Velveeta速)
1/4 cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance速)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and pour into the bottom of a casserole dish.
Mix mushroom soup, peas and carrots, skim milk, tuna, processed cheese, buttery spread, and black pepper together in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat and stir until cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour sauce over noodles in the casserole dish; mix well. Top with bread crumbs. Cover with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden, about 30 minutes.
