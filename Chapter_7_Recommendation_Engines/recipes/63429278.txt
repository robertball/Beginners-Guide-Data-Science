Ingredients:
2 pound bonless beef chuck roast
2 cans diced green chilies with the juice
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup chopped onion
4 cloves of crushed garlic
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup water
flour tortillas
sour cream
shredded cheese
chopped olives
sliced avocado
chopped tomato

Directions:
Cut roast in to 1 inch cubes place all ingredients in slow cooker, cover and cook on high 4-5 hours, or low 6-8 hours. If the beef is "soupy" when it is time to eat, leave the cover off and turn to high until water evaporated. Mash the beef (we use a potato masher) assemble and enjoy.
