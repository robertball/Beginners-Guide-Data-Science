Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, cut into wedges
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, toss potato wedges and olive oil until the potatoes are coated. Spread the wedges out on a large baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turn over, and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Serve plain, with vinegar, or dip in ketchup.

Description: 
My former college roommate came from England and we would love the English Baked Potatoes she made for us. It's fast, it's easy, and it's delicious! Eaten as a side dish or with plain ketchup.
