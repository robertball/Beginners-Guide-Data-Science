Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (16 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin

1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch loaf pans.
Mix white sugar, brown sugar, and eggs in a large bowl; stir in pumpkin and mix well. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, cloves, and allspice in a bowl; add alternately with water to pumpkin mixture. Pour into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
