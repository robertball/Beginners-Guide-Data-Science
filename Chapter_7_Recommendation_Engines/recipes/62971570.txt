Ingredients:
1 tbs Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/2 cup Onion, chopped
1/4 cup Celery, chopped
2 medium Zucchini's quartered and sliced
5 cloves of Garlic, minced
1 can Cannelloni Beans
1 can Red Kidney Beans
1 can Diced Tomatoes in Garlic, Basil and Oregano
32 oz Beef Broth
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper
1/2 cup Ditalini Pasta
Garnish with..
Fresh Chopped Basil
Freshly grated Parmesan Cheese
Garlic Croutons

Directions:
Add all vegetables (see optional step 2 first), oil, garlic, canned items, broth and spices to the slow cooker and turn on LOW for 3 hours.
Optionally you can saute the onions and garlic first in 1 tbs olive oil adding the garlic in the last minute before adding to the crock pot.
Add the pasta after cooking on LOW for 3 hours.  Cook on LOW for another hour or longer if the pasta is not thoroughly cooked.
Garnish with chopped basil, grated Parmesan cheese and garlic croutons.
***Do not skip the red pepper.  It adds depth to the dish and it is missing something without it.  You can reduce to 1/4 tsp for people who do not like spicy foods.

Description: 
This is a great low-fat, rustic pasta fagioli that is made in the slow cooker.  It's a very hearty soup so it can stand alone as the main event when paired with crusty Italian bread or it can be a nice upscale first course to a more elaborate dinner.
