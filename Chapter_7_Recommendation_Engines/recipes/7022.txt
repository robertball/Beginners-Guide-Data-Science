Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
6 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix by hand sour milk or buttermilk, corn syrup, sugar, soda, cardamom, and flour until mixture becomes a soft pliable dough.
Divide the dough into 12 or so pieces. Roll out each piece until about 1/8 inch thick.
Bake on a lightly floured griddle over very low heat for 12 to 15 minutes per side. Serve warm with your favorite cheese or jam.

Description: 
My grandmother used to serve this with cheese as a pre-dinner snack while we waited for the turkey. She used a heavy cast iron griddle, lightly floured. I use a 1 1/2 inch wood dowel to roll out nice and thin.
