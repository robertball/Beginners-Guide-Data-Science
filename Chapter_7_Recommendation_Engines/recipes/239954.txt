Ingredients:
2 pounds unsalted butter
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat until butter starts to foam and boil, about 10 minutes. Push the foam to the side, without stirring, to see if butter is clear, bright, and golden.
Remove skillet from heat and add salt; cool for about 2 minutes.
Pour butter through a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth to remove foam and particles into a glass container. Ghee will thicken and turn slightly translucent. Store in refrigerator.
