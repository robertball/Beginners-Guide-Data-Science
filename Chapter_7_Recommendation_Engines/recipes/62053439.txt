Ingredients:
1 pkg basmati and wild rice (Safeway brand)
4 cups vegetable or chicken stock
2 carrots, sliced
1 medium green zucchini, sliced
1 medium yellow zucchini, sliced
1 cup sliced mushrooms -OR-
1 Portobello mushroom, sliced
4 shallots, diced
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp olive oil
garlic powder
salt
pepper

Directions:
Bring the stock to a boil in a 4 quart stock pot, and add rice.  Cook as per box directions.
In a medium skillet, heat olive oil and add shallots to hot pan.  Cook until just tender, and add mushrooms.  Stir until completely saturated.  Turn down heat to medium, and add carrots.  Cover and let cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in butter and zucchini.  Cook for about 3 minutes, and add entire mixture to pot of almost cooked rice.  There should still be about two cups of broth in the pot.  Stir, and add garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  Finish cooking until rice is tender.
Serve with a green salad to round it out.

Description: 
A quick and easy soup that is easily adapted to whatever veggies you have on hand.  To change it to vegan, remove the butter.  To add meat, I recommend leftover turkey or chicken, chopped.  About 1 cup.  This is great to pre-prepare and just keep the veggies in the fridge until you need them.
