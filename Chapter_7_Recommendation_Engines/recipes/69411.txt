Ingredients:
2 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded
4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (2 1/4 inch thick) center-cut, bone-in pork chops
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
In a small bowl, combine the cheese, bacon, parsley, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.
Lay the chop flat on cutting board, and with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the pork, going all the way to the bone, but leaving the sides intact. Stuff cheese mixture into pocket, and close with a wooden toothpick. Brush meat with oil, and season with salt and more black pepper.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill over medium heat for 5 to 8 minutes on each side, or until pork is done. Careful not to overcook!

Description: 
Easy and elegant enough for the in-laws. Be sure, when filling the chops, not to stuff it too full, or the meat will be done cooking before the cheese has had a chance to melt.
