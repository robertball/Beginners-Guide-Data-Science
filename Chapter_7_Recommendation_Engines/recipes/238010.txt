Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups hot water
3 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
2 tablespoons quick-rise yeast
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed

Directions:
Beat water, olive oil, yeast, sugar, and salt together with an electric mixer until evenly combined, about 2 minutes. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring with a wooden spoon after each addition, until dough almost comes away from the sides of the bowl.
Knead the dough with your hands until soft and smooth. Lightly oil a bowl and place dough in the bowl, flipping to coat all of the dough. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
