Ingredients:
2-1/4 c whole wheat flour
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp baking soda
3 very ripe bananas
1/3 c applesauce
1/3 c golden raisins
1/3 c chopped pecans or walnuts
1/3 c Greek vanilla yogurt
1/3 c coconut oil (other oil may be substituted)
2 eggs
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp allspice
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare 2 loaf pans by spraying with Baker's Joy or coating with shortening and flour.  Mix the flour, salt & baking soda in a separate bowl. Use a fork to mash the bananas in a mixing bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well with a mixer.  Fold in the flour mix being careful not to overwork it.  Pour in pans and bake about 40 min or until an inserted knife comes out clean.  Immediately turn each baked loaf out on a piece of tin foil.  Allow to partially cool before wrapping.

Description: 
Only 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 cup of honey, but additional sweetness comes from the bananas, applesauce, raisins, Greek vanilla yogurt and cinnamon.  Although it only has 1/3 c oil, it is very moist, due to the applesauce and yogurt.  This recipe came from 100 Days of Real Food blog, but has been slightly modified to add moistness and flavor.
