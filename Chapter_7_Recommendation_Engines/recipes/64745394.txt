Ingredients:
1/2 cup hulled millet
2 Tbsp shaved almonds
2 Tbsp pepitas
1 Tbsp flax seeds
2 Tbsp shredded, unsweetened coconut
1.5 cup unsweetened almond milk
3 medjool dates, pitted and diced
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk

Directions:
Pulse the millet in a blender or food processor until it resembles course ground coffee. Set aside.
Heat a non-stick saucepan over medium-high, toast the shaved almonds. Wait two minutes, stirring the almonds then add the pepitas. Stir and continue toasting for another three minutes. Add the coconut and flax seeds. Continue stirring until everything is toasted. About five minutes. Pour into a bowl and set aside.
In the same saucepan, add the ground millet and toast until fragrant, about three minutes. Add the almond milk and stir to ensure there are no lumps. Bring to a boil then add the chopped dates. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally. Remove two tbsp of the toasted seed mixture and add to the rest to the porridge. Sprinkle in the cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir well. Cook until thickened.
Pour into two bowls. Evenly distribute the remaining seed mixture and almond milk over the two bowls and serve.
