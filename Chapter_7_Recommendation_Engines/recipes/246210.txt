Ingredients:
1/2 cup steak seasoning sauce (such as Dale's Steak Seasoning®)
1/2 cup brown sugar, divided
2 tablespoons bourbon (such as Jim Beam®), or more to taste
3 scallions, chopped
1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, cut into 2-inch cubes
1/2 pound bacon strips, cut in half
15 toothpicks, or as needed

Directions:
Mix steak seasoning sauce, 6 tablespoons brown sugar, bourbon, and scallions together in a large bowl to make marinade.
Toss salmon cubes in marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in the refrigerator, 4 to 6 hours.
Wrap each salmon cube with bacon; use a toothpick to hold bacon in place. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar on top.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill bacon-wrapped salmon, turning frequently, until bacon begins to crisp, about 5 minutes.
