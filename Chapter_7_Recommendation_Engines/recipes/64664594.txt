Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups couscous
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chicken stock
3/4 cup apple juice
1 mango, diced small
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and diced small
1 small red pepper, diced small
1 small yellow pepper, diced small
4 spring onions, thinly sliced including green tops
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped toasted macadamia nuts
1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley and more for garnish, if desired
For dressing:
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup mango vinegar or mango vinaigrette
1 tablespoon honey
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place couscous and salt in a stainless steel or glass mixing bowl. Place chicken stock and apple juice in a small saucepan and heat to a rolling boil. Alternately, place chicken stock and apple juice in a microwave safe container and microwave on high until boiling rapidly. Pour boiling liquid over couscous. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let stand 5 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed. Remove plastic wrap and fluff couscous with two forks. Spread couscous on a baking sheet and place in refrigerator to cool completely.
Combine remaining salad ingredients. Taste and season with salt and pepper. When couscous is cold, combine with mixed salad ingredients. Add dressing and toss to coat thoroughly
