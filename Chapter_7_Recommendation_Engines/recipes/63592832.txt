Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
olive oil
fresh ground black pepper
salt
red pepper flakes to taste
1 package grape tomatoes
1 medium garlic clove
Â¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
9 oz package of refrigerated tortellini pasta
1 cup heavy cream
6-8 fresh basil leaves
4 strips of bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled

Directions:
Rub chicken with olive oil, garlic, coarse ground pepper, some red pepper flakes, and salt. Grill and slice into strips. Set aside.
Fill pasta pot with water and start heating.
Cut the tomatoes in fourths. Peel & chop garlic. Put olive oil in skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Saute until garlic is sizzling. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper and cook until all the liquid from the tomatoes has evaporated, 10-12 minutes.
Once the tomatoes are ready, water in pasta pot should be at a boil, add and cook according to package directions.
While pasta is cooking, add the chicken to the pan with tomatoes. Season with salt and add the cream. Coarsely chop basil and add to pan. Cook until cream has thickened and reduced by about one-third. 2-3 minutes.
When pasta is done, drain well and toss with sauce. Top with bacon crumbles.
Serve with salad and bread!

Description: 
My son LOVES tortellini. A lot! He asks to make it every week when I am creating the menu. We are always looking for new ways to cook it, because we would otherwise be pretty tired of the tortellini and red sauce we grab from the refrigerated section. This pasta & chicken dish is super easy and fast to make. Oh, and yummy too!Modified from: Orecchiette with Shrimp
