Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups cake flour
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 large egg
2 egg yolks
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, or the bowl of an electric mixer, sift together flour, sugar, baking soda and salt.
Cut butter into 4 or 5 chunks and drop into the bowl with the flour mixture. Blend on low speed until mixture looks sandy and no large chunks of butter remain, 1-2 minutes.
In a large measuring cup, combine egg, egg yolks, buttermilk and vanilla and almond extracts. Beat lightly with a fork until combined.
With the mixer on low, pour 1 cup of the buttermilk mixture into the bowl. Turn speed up to medium and beat for 1 1/2 minutes. Reduce speed back to low and pour in the rest of the buttermilk mixture. Continue to beat at low speed for an additional 30 seconds, until liquid is fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat for a few more seconds, if necessary.
Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake for 40-45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, and the cake has begun to pull slightly away from the sides of the pan.
Turn cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely and peel off parchment paper before frosting.
