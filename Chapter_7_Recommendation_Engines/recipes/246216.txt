Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1 cup chopped nuts
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 (3 ounce) package cook-and-serve vanilla pudding (not instant)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Cut bread dough into 32 equal slices. Place slices in a single layer in baking dish.
Combine nuts, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla pudding mix, and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over dough slices. Cut 1/2 cup butter into slices, distribute on dough. Let rolls rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until sugar is brown and bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the baking dish for 5 minutes before carefully invert baking dish onto a work surface and gently tap bottom to release rolls.

Description: 
Frozen bread dough and vanilla pudding make these caramel rolls a snap to make. Gooey and delicious! You can make other flavored rolls by substituting the vanilla pudding with flavored gelatin packets (such as Jell-OÂ®).
