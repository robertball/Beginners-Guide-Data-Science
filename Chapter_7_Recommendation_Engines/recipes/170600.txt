Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
1 red onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
12 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the orzo pasta; cook and stir until the orzo has lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook until the onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add 1 clove of garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the vegetable broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and cover; simmer until the orzo is tender yet still a little firm to the bite, 12 to 14 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, combine cherry tomatoes, 1/2 of the fresh basil, garlic, and remaining olive oil.
Spoon the cooked orzo into a serving bowl. Top with tomato mixture, and sprinkle with Gorgonzola and remaining basil.
