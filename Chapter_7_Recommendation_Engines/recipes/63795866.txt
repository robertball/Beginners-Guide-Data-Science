Ingredients:
Salt
Olive Oil
20 oz. package fresh ravioli (small size)
1 shallot, finely chopped
10 sage leaves, chopped into strips
3 tbsp butter
1 cup canned pumpkin
Pinch of nutmeg
1 1/4 cups light cream
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
Freshly ground black pepper
Fresh chopped parsley (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil with a dash of salt and olive oil.  Add the ravioli and cook as the label directs.  Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water, then drain the pasta.
While pasta is cooking, melt butter in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the shallot and sage leaves, cooking until shallots are cooked and no longer purplish colored.  Stir in the pumpkin and nutmeg, stirring for another minute.  Stir in the cream and bring to a low boil.  Reduce heat to medium low, simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the parmesan cheese and cook until thick, about 1 more minute.  Season with salt and pepper and extra nutmeg (if needed).
Add the ravioli to the skillet and toss with the sauce, adding some of the pasta water to loosen, if needed.  Divide among bowls and top with additional parmesan cheese.  Can also top with more ground pepper and parsley.
