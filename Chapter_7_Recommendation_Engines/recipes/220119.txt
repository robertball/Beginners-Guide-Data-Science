Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package dry crab boil (such as Zatarain's® Crab & Shrimp Boil)
5 small lobster tails
1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust (such as Pillsbury®)
5 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced celery
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1/2 cup diced potato

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bring water and crab boil bag to a boil in a large saucepan.
Stir in lobster tails and boil until they turn bright red and the meat becomes opaque, 5 to 8 minutes.
Drain and cool lobster tails. Remove shells, and dice lobster meat. Transfer to a bowl.
Place a pie crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan and set aside.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat.
Cook and stir onion and celery in butter until tender, 5 to 8 minutes.
Stir flour into onion and celery mixture until vegetables are coated with flour.
Combine chicken broth and milk in a bowl.
Slowly stir broth and milk into onion, celery, and flour mixture until thickened.
Stir seafood seasoning, garlic powder, and ground black pepper into thickened sauce.
Mix thawed vegetables, diced potato, and cooked lobster meat into the sauce; simmer until potato is tender, about 8 minutes.
Pour lobster filling into the prepared pie crust.
Cover with remaining pie crust ,and seal by crimping the edges of the two crusts together.
Cut an 'X' into top of pie crust with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape during baking.
Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
Remove from oven and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.
