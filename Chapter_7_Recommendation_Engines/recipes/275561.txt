Ingredients:
10 medium plums, pitted and chopped, or more to taste
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons white vinegar

Directions:
Mix plums and sugar together in a heavy-bottomed stockpot. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture turns to liquid, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir salt, ginger, chili powder, cloves, and cinnamon into the mixture. Cook over low heat until desired consistency is reached, stirring often to prevent chutney from sticking, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust spices if needed.
Mix vinegar into the pot and cook over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent burning, for 5 minutes more. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate and use within 3 to 4 weeks.
