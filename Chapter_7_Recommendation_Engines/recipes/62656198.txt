Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil
4 cup(s) sugar snap peas, trimmed
1 clove(s) (medium) garlic clove(s), minced
1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1/4 cup(s) canned chicken broth
1/4 tsp table salt
1/8 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Stir in sugar snap peas and garlic; increase heat to medium-high and stir in red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until peas are crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
Add broth, salt and pepper to skillet. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until broth is reduced to a glaze that just coats peas, and peas are cooked to preferred degree of tenderness, about 3 to 5 minutes. Yields about 1 cup per serving.
