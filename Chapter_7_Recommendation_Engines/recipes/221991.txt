Ingredients:
2 cups finely diced potatoes
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
¼ cup butter
5  bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
½ cup water, or as needed
½ cup butter
½ cup all-purpose flour
4 cups half-and-half
4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) package cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails

Directions:
Place potatoes, onion, celery, 1/4 cup butter, bay leaves, and thyme in a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter over medium-low heat. Whisk flour into melted butter for 2 minutes; slowly whisk half-and-half into flour mixture and season with Cajun seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Whisk continuously to prevent boiling until mixture is thickened. Stir in potato mixture and crawfish tails; cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
