Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) bottle Ranch-style salad dressing
1/3 cup coarsely ground black pepper
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons minced garlic
4 pounds rib eye roast

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the dressing, pepper, vinegar, oregano and garlic. Mix well, add the roast, seal bag tightly and refrigerate overnight, turning roast several times.
Preheat a charcoal grill and lightly oil grate. When hot, push coals to the sides of the grill, leaving room in the center for the roast.
Place roast on grill and cook for about 25 minutes per pound or until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Note: This can also be done in a 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven.
