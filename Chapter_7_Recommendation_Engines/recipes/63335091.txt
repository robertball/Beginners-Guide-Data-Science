Description: 
I asked for this family recipe after having it for the first time at my friend's home after a summer lunch. I didn't think I could fit dessert after a wonderful, filling meal, but this was so light and just enough sweet that I had to have the recipe! So easy to make, yet looks fancy. Enjoy!
