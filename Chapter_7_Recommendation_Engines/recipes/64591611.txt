Ingredients:
1 large whole chicken (about 4 1/2 pounds), deboned (ask the butcher to do it for you)
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Salt the chicken, by rubbing the salt into the chicken really well, and by well I mean get it in every crevasse, with 1 teaspoon of salt 1 to 3 hours prior to cooking and reserve in the refrigerator until 10 minutes before cooking.
Preheat the broiler. Put the chicken, skin-side up, on a rimmed sheet pan and place it under the broiler, about 3 inches from the heat, to brown and crisp the skin, about 10 minutes, rotating the pan a few times for even browning. Turn the oven temperature down to 250°F and cook for 25 minutes.
Remove the chicken, and wait. No, you can't eat the skin, yet. Let it rest for a few minutes.
Cut the chicken into entrée-size pieces, transfer to a platter.
