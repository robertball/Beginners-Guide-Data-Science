1 egg

Preheat the oven to 400*F.
Mix the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, lemon zest, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until crumbly.
Mix the cream cheese and egg in a bowl until smooth. Add the milk gradually, stirring constantly. Stir into the flour mixture until the mixture forms a ball and leaves the side of the bowl.
Drop by spoonfuls about 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Brush with lemon juice and sprinkle with sugar.
