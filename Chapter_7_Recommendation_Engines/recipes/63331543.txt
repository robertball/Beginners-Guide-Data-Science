Ingredients:
3 cups whole cranberries, fresh or frozen
3 cups red wine (I used a Shiraz)
1 cup water
3 jalapenos, seeded

1 2-oz. pkg liquid pectin

Directions:
Prepare 5 pint or 10 half pint canning jars as per manufacturer's instructions.
Coarsely chop cranberries in food processor.  Place in large stainless steel pan; add wine and water.  Bring to a boil and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Strain through a mesh strainer; discard pulp.
Return liquid to pan and add jalapenos.  Bring to a boil and add sugar all at once. Stirring frequently, boil for 10 minutes.  Add pectin and boil one minute exactly.  Remove from heat and ladle into hot jars.  Cover.
Process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Let stand overnight or until set.
