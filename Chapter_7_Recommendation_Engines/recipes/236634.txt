Ingredients:
12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved lengthwise
6 ounces smoked salmon
6 ounces low-fat cottage cheese
2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 pinch paprika, or as needed

Directions:
Scoop the yolks out of eggs and discard or save for another use. Run egg whites under cool water to remove any remaining yolk. Arrange whites on a serving platter.
Blend salmon, cottage cheese, chives, seafood seasoning, dill, and lemon juice in a food processor until just combined. Pour salmon filling into a plastic bag and snip off 1 corner. Pipe filling into each egg and sprinkle paprika over filling. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
