Ingredients:
3/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons dill pickle relish
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 pound cod fillets, cut into 1x3-inch sticks
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Combine mayonnaise, relish, and seafood seasoning in a large bowl. Add fish and gently stir to coat.
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place bread crumbs on a plate. Coat each fish stick in bread crumbs 1 at a time.
Place fish sticks in a single layer in the basket of the air fryer, making sure none are touching. Cook for 12 minutes. Remove the basket and let rest for 1 minute before transferring fish sticks to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining fish sticks.

Description: 
Homemade crispy fish sticks in an air fryer. Unlike most air fryer recipes, this one does not require cooking spray or flipping halfway through cook time. An added bonus is that you don't need dipping sauce, because it is already in the batter.
