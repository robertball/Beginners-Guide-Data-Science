Honduran Tamales Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) package masa harina (such as MasecaÂ®), divided
1 large tomato, chopped
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup ground cumin
2 cubes chicken bouillon
salt
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 cups vegetable oil, or to taste
30 banana leaves
3 1/2 pounds cubed cooked pork
3 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cups cooked white rice
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
kitchen twine

Directions:
Pour about 3/4 the masa harina into a large pot. Add water in batches, mixing until a moderately thin batter forms.
Combine tomato, green bell pepper, onion, cilantro, cumin, and bouillon in a blender. Blend until smooth. Pour into the large pot with the batter and season with salt. Pour about 5 cups of this combined mixture into a smaller pot; add tomato paste and stir until it is an even red color.
Pour 2 cups oil into the large pot of batter; pour remaining 1 cup oil into the smaller pot of red batter. Bring both pots to a boil, stirring continuously to prevent burning. Cook until flavors set, 3 to 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Cut banana leaves into 12x15-inch rectangles. Spoon 1 cup regular batter and 1/4 cup red batter into the center of each leaf. Add small amounts of pork, potatoes, rice, and peas. Fold leaf over the filling several times; fold sides in. Wrap twine around tamale to hold in place.
Place tamales in a large pot; cover halfway with water. Cover and cook over medium heat until filling has thickened, about 1 hour.

My fiance is Honduran and no Christmas is complete without tamales. These aren't your regular Mexican tamales, there's more to 'em.
