Description: 
This recipe has been tested for soundness with dogs of all sizes and ages. So many dog food recipes are missing important components such as calcium, omega fatty acids, high quality protein. Dogs are not humans and have different nutritional requirements. This is an overall, complete foundational diet.  Maybe it's time to give up the dog foods that keep getting recalled!
