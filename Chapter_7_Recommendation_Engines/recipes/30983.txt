Ingredients:
4 pounds veal shoulder roast
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
4 carrots, halved
1 pound small potatoes
1/2 pound small white onions
1/2 pound mushrooms
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10 ounce) package frozen green peas
2 egg yolks

Directions:
In an 8 quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat, brown roast on all sides. Add thyme and 2 cups of water. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 30 minutes.
To the pot, add carrots, potatoes and onions. Cover, and simmer 30 minutes. Toss in mushrooms. Cover, and simmer 15 minutes, or until vegetables and veal are tender. Remove roast and vegetables, and keep warm.
In a cup, stir flour and 2 tablespoons water until blended with no lumps. Gradually stir into liquid in Dutch oven. Cook, stirring constantly, until gravy is slightly thickened. Stir in peas, and heat through.
In a small bowl, beat egg yolks. Stir in a small amount of hot gravy. Slowly pour egg yolk mixture back into gravy, whisking until thickened. DO NOT BOIL! To serve, pour some gravy over the veal and vegetables. Serve remaining gravy in a gravy boat.

Description: 
This is a mouthwatering tender roast with vegetables and a great gravy that gives a fantastic presentation for a dinner party, or for a family New Year's Eve dinner. It slow cooks once browned, so you can be straightening up the house while it simmers. You can get the boneless shoulder roast and roll it very tightly yourself and tie it several times with butcher string. Sometimes if you explain to the butcher, they will do it for you. Great served with fresh steamed asparagus or green bean spears.
