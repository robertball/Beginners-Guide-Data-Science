Ingredients:
1/2 medium lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 large eggs
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine lemon juice and oil in a small serving bowl; whisk to combine.
Add water and vinegar to a medium saute pan or small saucepan and bring to a slow boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Crack 1 egg into a small bowl, being careful not to break the yolk. Gently slip egg into the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water. Repeat with the remaining egg. Cook eggs until the whites are firm and the yolks are lightly cooked outside, but liquid inside, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon, and place into a serving bowl.
Break the yolks with a fork and drizzle with lemon juice mixture. Stir yolks twice; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
I learned this no-fail poached egg recipe from a Greek chef I worked with who grew up in Mytilene. He ate this for breakfast just about every morning and it reminds him of his mother to this day. 

I make it for breakfast pretty frequently and it always gives me a good start to my day. I recommend it for you and your family. It can be served with potatoes, toast, milk, juice, etc. to complete a good breakfast.
