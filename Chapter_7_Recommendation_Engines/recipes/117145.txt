Description: 
'We love green beans at our house and enjoy them at least once a week. I'm always experimenting with new ways to fix them,' pens Sue Haviland of Lake Mills, Wisconsin. 'Garlic cloves and mushrooms lend them delicious flavor in this quick-and-easy dish. I like to steam the beans so they keep most of their nutrients.'
