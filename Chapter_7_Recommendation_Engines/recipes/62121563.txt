Ingredients:
All ingredianets for your favorite pie crust recipe
1 Hefty One Zip ZipLock bag
Plastic Wrap

Directions:
When mixing the dry ingrediants of your pie crust recipe, instead of putting them into a bowl put them into the zip lock bag, seal and shake to mix them.
Add you're butter or shortening into the bag and kneed untill the mixture begins to form loose crumbles.
Add water untill the mixture is the proper texture according to your recipe.
Chill if your recipe requires it.
When you're ready to roll the crust flat, place crust onto a piece of plastic wrap, a little longer than your pie plate is round, place a second piece of plastic wrap over the crust and roll it flat with a rolling pin.
When you are finished rolling take off the top piece of plastic wrap and place the pie plate on top of the crust. Turn the whole thing over and press the crust into the pie plate.
Remove the last piece of plastic and trim any excess crust.
Fill your pie and bake as usual.

Description: 
I've always enjoyed making pies from scratch, but I have always dreaded the clean up afterwards. I thought up this little techninique to reduce the mess when I make pie crusts.
 Special thanks to RICK who inspired this little method with his comment on the Best Ever Pie Crust.
