Description: 
This is my take on the classic English clotted cream. It is perfect as a fruit dip or for scones.  It even makes a delicious topping for strawberry shortcake. My favorite thing to dip into this fabulous cream is fresh pineapple. This recipe holds up well so it can be made the night before. Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my family does.
