Ingredients:
1 16-oz box jumbo pasta shells
32 ozs. whole or part-skim ricotta cheese
8 ozs. whole or part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup grated or parmesan cheese, divided
1 large egg
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 large jar spaghetti sauce or your favorite homemade

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook shells about 10 minutes, to al dente.  They will finish cooking in the oven.
Drain and let cool enough to handle.  Do not rinse.
Place a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9 x 13 x 2 inch pan....just enough to cover bottom.
In a large bowl, place ricotta, mozzarella, 1/2 cup parmesan, egg, parsley, salt and pepper and mix well.
Stuff each shell with heaping tablespoon of cheese mixture and place side-by-side tightly in pan.
Spoon sauce over shells very lightly.  Too much sauce will cause "soggy" shells.  Only a thin drizzle over each row of shells.
Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan over top.
Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour.
Remove from oven, keep covered, and let sit for 15 minutes before serving.  This helps the cheese set.

Description: 
My mother gave this recipe to me after receiving it from my little Italian aunts.  I swear, those sweet women only came up to my shoulder, and I'm not tall!  They made the BEST sauce and meatballs to accompany this dish.  With three cheeses, how can you not love it?
