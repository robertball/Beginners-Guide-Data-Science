Ingredients:
1 (8 oz) block cream cheese
1/4 lb butter, creamed
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 boxes confectionary sugar
12 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips
Pastel multi-colored candy sprinkles to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix cream cheese, butter and vanilla together until evenly blended. Stir in the confectionary sugar. Cover mixture and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Using a little at a time, roll the mixture into small-to-medium eggs. Place back into refrigerator for additional 2 hours.
In a double-boiler, melt down chocolate chips. Using a fork or wooden toothpick, dip and roll "eggs" in chocolate, coating evenly.
Lay each dipped "egg" on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper and garnish with candy sprinkles before chocolate hardens.
Once chocolate is solid, place "eggs" into paper cupcake or candy cups (depending on size) and store at a cool temperature.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make these every year at Easter. They taste very similar to the Mary Sue butter cream Easter eggs that they used to sell during Eastertime when I was a kid.
