Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon coarse-ground black pepper

Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sprouts in hot skillet until bright green and beginning to brown on edges, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a simple preparation that lets the sprouts speak for themselves instead of masking with another flavor. You may be surprised, but if you listen you'll hear them saying 'I am yummy!' 

Makes a great side with turkey or tempeh.
