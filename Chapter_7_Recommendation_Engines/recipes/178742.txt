Description: 
This dish always reminds me of cold winter nights in our flat in Ballymun, where my ex-wife used to make this traditional Dublin winter stew. It relies heavily on Irish sausage and bacon, so try and use these, if you can. If not, use a low-fat bacon, such as Canadian bacon, and a plain uncooked breakfast sausage. Because of the milk, this is sometimes referred to as a white stew.
