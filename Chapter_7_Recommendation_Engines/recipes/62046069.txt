Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs (and/or legs)
oil (vegetable or canola)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, finely chopped
3 Tbs. minced or grated fresh ginger
1 cup peas (fresh or frozen)
2 Tbs. ground cumin
2 Tbs. ground coriander
1 tsp ground turmeric
4-6 green cardamom pods
6 whole cloves
6 whole peppercorns
2 bay leaves
2 inch piece cinnamon stick (about the diameter of a drinking straw)
1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg
1 14 oz can diced tomatoes or use 3 fresh tomatoes, chopped
salt to taste
pepper to taste

Directions:
Remove the skin from the chicken. Heat the oil in a heavy bottom pan. Saute the onion, garlic and ginger in the oil until the onion is translucent.  Add the chicken and brown on all sides.  Turn frequently to avoid burning.  Remove the chicken pieces and set aside.  Add the whole spices (cardamom, clove, peppercorn, cinnamon, bay leaf) and fry them until the cardamom pods are puffy.  Add the ground spices and fry for 1-2 minutes.  Now add the chicken and turn the pieces to coat them with the spices.  Fry 2-3 minutes more.  Add the tomatoes and the peas.  Add 1 cup of water.  Bring to a boil and then immediately lower the heat to low. Simmer for one-two hours until the oil separates from the tomato.

Description: 
Chicken pieces simmer in a wonderfully spiced tomato sauce laced with peas.  This can be made without the peas, also.  Serve with basmati rice, naan and cucumber raita.  If you like your food hot, add a few green chiles to the whole spices.
