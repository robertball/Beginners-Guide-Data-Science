Ingredients:
¼ cup crumbled blue cheese
½ cup Ranch-style salad dressing
3 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
salt and pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoons butter
¼ cup Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 tablespoon salad seasoning mix (such as McCormick(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Salad Supreme Seasoning)
2 heads romaine lettuce, chopped

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine crumbled blue cheese and Ranch-style dressing; set aside. Season cubed chicken with salt and pepper.
Heat a large skillet over high heat, and pour in the vegetable oil.  Just before the oil starts to smoke, add the chicken.  Cook to brown evenly, about 3 minutes.  Reduce heat to low, and add butter, hot sauce, and salad seasoning mix.  Simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Toss together the lettuce and Ranch-style dressing mixture in a large bowl.  Top salad with chicken, and serve.
