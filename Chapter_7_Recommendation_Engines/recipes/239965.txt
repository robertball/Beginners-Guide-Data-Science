Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 1/2 sleeves buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®), crushed
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced kale
1 yellow onion, chopped
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
2 eggs
1/4 cup whole-grain mustard
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
6 cherry tomatoes, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix turkey, cracker crumbs, kale, onion, Cheddar cheese, barbeque sauce, eggs, mustard, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt together in a large bowl using your hands. Pat 1/2 of the turkey mixture into a loaf pan. Insert tomatoes into turkey mixture and top with the remaining turkey mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
