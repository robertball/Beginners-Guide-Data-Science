Ingredients:
1 prepared low-fat graham cracker pie crust
14 oz fat-free sweetened condensed milk
8 oz fat-free egg substitute
1/4-1/2 cup fresh lime juice, from “key” or regular limes (about 2-3 limes), depending on desired tartness
1-2 tsp freshly grated lime zest
Fat Free Whipped Cream for topping, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325ºF. Place graham cracker crust on a baking sheet; set aside.
Whisk together condensed milk, egg substitute and lime juice. Add lime zest and pour mixture into crust.
Bake until center looks set but still slightly quivery, like gelatin, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
Transfer to refrigerator and chill completely, about 1 to 2 hours.
