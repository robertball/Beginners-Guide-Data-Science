Ingredients:
3 1/2 lbs    whole chicken, cut-up
2 5-oz pkts  chicken fry coating; e.g. Dixie Fry
2 Tbsp       salt-free chicken seasoning, divided; e.g. McCormick Grill Mates
Canola oil, for frying
2 12-oz jars roasted chicken gravy ; e.g. Franco American or Heinz
1 tsp        crushed garlic

Directions:
Cut away excess skin and fat from chicken pieces. Rinse with cold water and set aside; do not pat dry.
In a shallow bowl, stir together fry coating and 1 tablespoon chicken seasoning. Dredge chicken pieces in coating mixture; set aside.
In a large straight-sided pan, heat 1/2-inch oil over medium-high heat. Oil is ready for frying when a drop of water splatters when dropped in.
Fry coated chicken until golden brown, about 8 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pan and drain oil.
In a medium bowl, stir together gravy, remaining chicken seasoning, and crushed garlic; set aside.
Return chicken to pan over medium heat. Cover with gravy. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes or until completely done (no pink near the bone).
Serve hot.
