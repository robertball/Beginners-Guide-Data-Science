Ingredients:
1/10 of a 17.3 oz package of frozen puff pastry sheets
2 cups of blueberries, divided
1/4 cup of peeled, grated zucchini
2 Tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp lemon juice
2 and 1/2 tsp quick-cooking tapioca
1/8 tsp salt

Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2.  Set a frozen sheet of puff pastry on the counter to thaw for 40 minutes.
3.  Meanwhile, place one cup of blueberries in a small saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring and mashing the blueberries to release their juices, until the blueberries and their juices reduce to about 1/2 cup (about 5 minutes).
4.  Place grated zucchini in a clean kitchen towel and ring dry.  Move the dried zucchini to a medium mixing bowl and combine with sugar, lemon juice, tapioca, and salt.  Stir in the cooked berries and the uncooked berries.
5.  Pour berry mixture into a 5" ramekin.
6.  Unfold puff pastry sheet.  On a lightly floured surface, roll sheet out into a 12" x 16" rectangle.  From this sheet, cut out a 7" circle.  Use a rolling pin to carefully lift the pastry dough and set on top of the tart.  Gently press crust onto the sides of the ramekin, creating a rustic look.  Cut holes or slits on the crust for venting.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Reduce temperature to 325 degrees and bake for another 20 minutes or until the juices are bubbling.  Cool on a wire rack for four hours.
