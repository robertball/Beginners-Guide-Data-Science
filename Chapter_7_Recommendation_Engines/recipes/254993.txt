Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1 zucchini, cubed
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
2 cups chopped lacinato kale
2 cups chopped Italian parsley
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, oregano, chili powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add butternut squash and zucchini; toss until coated. Place butternut squash and zucchini onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, tossing once half way through, until soft, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven; cool.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and cool.
Combine remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, butternut squash, zucchini, quinoa, kale, parsley, raisins, red onion, apple cider vinegar, and honey in a bowl; toss until salad is combined.

Description: 
This is a go-to type of recipe I use a lot. The seasonings are pretty great and can be used for sweet potato fries and a fish marinade too. You can vary this recipe by adding your favorite grain, or bean! You can also use whichever herb you enjoy.
