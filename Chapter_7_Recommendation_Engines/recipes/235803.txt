Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
3/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups mild chunky salsa
Garnish:
6 fresh parsley leaves, or to taste
2 pinches paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Blend cannellini beans, olive oil, and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth; add pumpkin puree, parsley, paprika, garlic, chipotle pepper, salt, and pepper. Continue to process until just blended; spoon into a mixing bowl. Gently fold salsa through the bean mixture, avoiding crushing the vegetables.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to allow flavors to blend, at least 4 hours. Stir dip and garnish with parsley leaves and paprika before serving.

Description: 
The milder flavor and smooth texture of whipped cannellini beans well complement the flavor and texture of canned pumpkin puree, creating a versatile base for both a spicy bean dip and, with added liquid, a tasty bean soup (serve hot or chilled). Include fresh herbs such as parsley or cilantro to complete this quick and easy appetizer or aromatic side dish. Serve with plain pita crisps, crackers, or tortilla chips.
