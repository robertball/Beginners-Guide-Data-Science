Ingredients:
8 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon chipotle pepper powder (optional)
1 seedless watermelon, cut crosswise into 2-inch thick slices
1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log, cut into 8 slices
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
4 sprigs fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 430 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Season shrimp all over with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, smoked paprika, and chipotle pepper powder. Set shrimp into a baking dish.
Bake shrimp in the preheated oven until bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 8 minutes.
Use a ring mold (slightly larger in diameter than the diameter of the goat cheese slices) to cut watermelon into circle shapes. Cut circle shapes into twelve 1/4-inch thick slices.
Place a slice of watermelon on a plate. Top with 1 slice cheese, 1 slice watermelon, 1 slice cheese, 1 slice watermelon, 2 shrimp, respectively, to form a salad stack. Repeat with remaining watermelon slices, cheese, and shrimp. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over each stack and garnish with basil.
