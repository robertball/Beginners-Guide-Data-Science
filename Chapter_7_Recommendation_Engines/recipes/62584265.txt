Ingredients:
4-5 cups flour
2 cups butter
1 cup sifted confectioner's sugar (powdered)
2 egg yolks
1 tsp. baking powder
1 shot of good brandy, preferably Greek
2 tsps vanilla extract
3/4 cup sliced almonds
2 tbsp whole cloves (optional)
1 lb. confectioner's sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cream butter with sugar in a large bowl until fully combined and smooth.
Add egg yolks, brandy, and vanilla. Mix well.
In a seperate bowl combine flour and baking powder, then add to butter mixture.
Knead well by hand to form stiff dough, adding more flour if necessary.
If the dough seems a little dry then add more brandy.
Roll dough out onto lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into circles with cookie cutter, or shape into ovals or crescents if preferred.
If using cloves, insert a clove into each cookie.
Place cookies onto a lightly greased cookie sheet, or one lined with parchment paper.
Bake for about 10 minutes or until lightly golden.(cookies will remain on the pale side)
Remove carefully and cool.
After cookies have cooled place them on a platter or plate and sift desired amount of powdered sugar all over the cookies. Traditionally a lot of powdered sugar is used for this.

Description: 
I am Greek and have been making these since I was a little girl. Buttery, flaky, slightly sweet, and very addictive! I recently made these for some relatives visiting from Lemnos, Greece and they said that they tasted like they came straight from any grandmother's kitchen in Greece.
