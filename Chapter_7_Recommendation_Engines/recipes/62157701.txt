Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 celery stalks, peeled and finely chopped
3 carrots, peeled and finely chopped
5 tbl flour
2 cans (6 oz) chopped clams with juice
1 can (10 oz) whole clams with juice
2 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup clam juice
1 1/2 cups fat-free half and half
2 bay leaves
1 lb. potatoes, cut into small cubes
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan, fry bacon over medium-high heat until crispy.  Remove bacon but do not drain grease.
Reduce heat to medium and saute onions, celery, and carrots in bacon grease until onions are about clear, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the flour until well combined.
Add juice from clams (reserving clams), clam juice, stock, half-and-half, bay leaves and potatoes, stir to combine.
Bring to a simmer stirring constantly (mixture will thicken).
Reduce heat to medium-low and cook 20-30 minutes or until potatoes are tender, stirring often to avoid scalding.
Add clams and salt and pepper, cook just until clams are firm, about 2-3 minutes.
