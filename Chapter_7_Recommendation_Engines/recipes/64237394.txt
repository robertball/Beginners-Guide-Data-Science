Ingredients:
8 Lg. Sweet Potatoes
1/4 C. Dark Karo Syrup
1/4 C. Honey or Agave Syrup
1/4 C. Brown Sugar
2 Tbs. Maple Syrup
2 Tbs. Molasses

2 Tbs. Chopped Parsley
4 Tbs. Butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 Degrees.
In a casserole/baking dish, melt 1 tbs. butter and grease bottoms & sides of dish.
Wash Sweet Potatoes. Cover in a large pot of salted water (1 tsp./quart of water); Bring to a boil. Boil potatoes until fork tender (about 45 mins.) After potatoes are cooked, allow to cool only enough to handle and peel while still hot.
Quarter potatoes and arrange in dish. Melt butter with remaining ingredients and pour over potatoes, stirring to coat.
Bake in preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until potatoes are tender, basting and turning occasionally to keep from drying out. Remove potatoes from oven & cover with foil for 15 mins. or until ready to serve.
