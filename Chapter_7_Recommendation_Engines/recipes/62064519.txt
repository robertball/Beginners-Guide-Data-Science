Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
5-6 RIPE tomoatoes, peeled and diced (*to easily peel tomatoes, cut a small x in the bottom and briefly dunk in boiling water)
2-3 Tbsp. fresh basil, chopped
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp ground pepper
1 pinch sugar
1 Tbsp. tomato paste (optional)

Directions:
1. Heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook until onions are translucent.
3. Add tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until sauce reduces slightly. If you desire a thicker sauce, stir in the tomato paste. Serve over pasta!

Description: 
This is my variation of a recipe served by the lovely Scottish woman who hosted my wedding. Fresh ingredients are key to this simple recipe--the tomato and basil flavors really come through. If you like a thicker sauce, add the tomato paste at the end.
