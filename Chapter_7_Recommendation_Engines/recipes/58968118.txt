Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) filet mignon steaks
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper to taste
salt to taste
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup dry red wine
chopped garlic and onions (or used dry minced)
2 Tablespoons brown sugar
2 Tablespoons butter

Directions:
Sprinkle freshly ground pepper over both sides of each room-temperature steak, and sprinkle with salt to taste.  Do *not* pierce steaks with forks.
Mix wine, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and onions together in bowl. Let it sit for a couple of minutes.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Place steaks in hot pan, and cook for 1 minute on each side, or until browned. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add wine/vinegar mix. Cover, and cook for 4 minutes on each side, basting with sauce when you turn the meat over.
Remove steaks to two warmed plates.  Add the brown sugar and butter to the sauce still in the pan and cook until reduced by about a third. This produces the glaze.
Spoon one tablespoon of glaze over each steak and serve immediately.
