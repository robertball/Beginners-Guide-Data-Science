Ingredients:
1 pie crust for bottom and lattice top
1/2 cup	butter (salted)
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1/2 cup	white sugar
1/2 cup	packed brown sugar
1/4 cup	water
8 apples, peeled and thinly sliced

Directions:
In a saucepan, melt butter. Stir in flour to form paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar, and water, bring to boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes.
Place bottom crust in a 9-inch pie plate, fill with apples, mounding slightly. Cover with latticework crust. Carefully pour sauce over the crust.
Bake 15 minutes in a 425°F oven. Reduce temperature to 350°F and bake for 35–45 minutes. If the pie is getting too dark, cover with foil and continue baking.

Description: 
It wasn't until I met my husband's family that I met people who don't like cinnamon, something I just couldn't wrap my head around until I found this recipe for what I've been told is the best apple pie they've ever eaten! The secret is in a buttery caramel sauce you pour over the lattice topping.
