Description: 
The base of this recipe came from our area, the German community of a small town in Delhi, Ontario Canada. I've tweaked it a bit over time. My family loves this, and it's a good way to spend a cold afternoon. I serve this with whipped potatoes and a vegetable - tonight we had beets in Harvard sauce.
