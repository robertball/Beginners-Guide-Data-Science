Ingredients:
2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
1/4 cup chopped lemongrass
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 (16 ounce) package tofu, cubed
6 cups water
2 cups chicken stock
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup fish sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 cups shredded bok choy
14 ounces dried rice noodles
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add lemongrass, lime juice, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon peanut oil and tofu; stir-fry until tofu is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Combine water, chicken stock, coconut milk, soy sauce, fish sauce, and brown sugar in a large pot; bring to a boil. Pour in lemongrass mixture. Simmer over low heat until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Add bok choy and rice noodles; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
