1/2 cup finley chopped pecans
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
3 egg yolks
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
3/8 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the graham cracker & ginger snap crumbs, ground pecans, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and the melted butter mix well.  Firmly press mixture into one 9 inch springform pan. Combine 3/4 cup of the white sugar, the pumpkin, 3 egg yolks, ground cinnamon, ground mace, ground ginger and salt in a medium bowl. Mix well, and set aside.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar and mix well.  Add the whole egg, remaining egg yolk and the whipping cream, beating well.  Add cornstarch and vanilla and  beat batter until smooth.  Add pumpkin mixture and mix well.  Pour batter into the prepared pan.

Description: 
This is a very old recipe and it seems like there are a lot of ingredients, but it is worth the effort.  I use the extra whipping cream to decorate the top of the cheesecake. Originally submitted to CakeRecipe.com.Modified from: Pumpkin Cheesecake II
