Ingredients:
As many chicken wings as you can fit in your oven.
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
Blue cheese dressing
Celery ribs

Directions:
I have a 1200W halogen - you may need to adjust cooking times with your wattage.
Prepare your wing sauce - mix butter, wing sauce, garlic powder, cayenne, salt and pepper in a sauce pan. Bring to a lower simmer and then remove from heat.
Place chicken wings on upper and lower racks. Cook at 350 for 10 minutes. Swap the upper rack chicken with the lower rack chicken and cook at 350 for another 10 minutes. Remove wings and toss with sauce in a large mixing bowl. Reserve extra sauce. Cook wings for another 4 minutes at 350. Remove and toss in remaining sauce. Cook for another 4 minutes at 350. Serve with celery ribs and blue cheese dressing.
