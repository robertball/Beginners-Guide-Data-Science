Ingredients:
6 slices smoked bacon, 2-inch wide strips
1 large onion, sliced
1 carrot, chopped
2 lbs sauerkraut, rinsed and drained
2 cups dry white wine
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 Tbsp caraway seed
4 juniper berries or 1 Tbsp gin (optional)
1 1/1/2 lbs kielbasa, 3-inch lengths

Directions:
Heat oven to 300 degrees
Place bacon, onion and carrot in heavy large ovenproof Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Saute until onion is tender but not brown, about 5 minutes.  Squeeze as much liquid as possible from sauerkraut.  Add sauerkraut, wine, stock, caraway seeds and juniper berries to Dutch oven.
Bring to simmer.  Cover tightly, place in oven and bake 1 hour.
Add kielbasa to Dutch oven, pushing into sauerkraut.  Cover and bake 1 hour.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
(Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm over medium heat, stirring frequently).
