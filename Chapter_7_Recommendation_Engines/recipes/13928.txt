Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 (8 ounce) package tempeh, crumbled
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a medium bowl, combine the beans, garlic, onion, chile peppers, jalapeno pepper, and tempeh. Pour enchilada sauce into a shallow bowl.
Dip three tortillas in the enchilada sauce, and place them in the prepared baking dish. Be sure to cover the bottom of the dish as completely as possible. Place 1/2 of the bean mixture on top of the tortillas, and repeat. Drizzle the remaining sauce over the casserole, and sprinkle with olives and shredded cheese.
Cover, and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover, and continue baking for an additional 15 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbling and the cheese is melted.

Description: 
The inclusion of tempeh adds a good measure of protein to this spicy enchilada casserole. You can replace the Cheddar cheese with Monterey Jack if you like. Serve with sour cream and salsa!
