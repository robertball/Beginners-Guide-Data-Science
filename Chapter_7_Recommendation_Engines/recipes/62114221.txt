Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 10-oz cans black beans, drained
1 10-oz can corn, drained
3 cups tomatoes, diced
1 cup red onion, diced
1 large red bell pepper, diced
3 green onions (with tops), chopped
1/4 cup jalapenos, chopped
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
16 ounces nonfat plain yogurt
2 envelopes Ranch dressing mix
salt and pepper to taste
lime juice, to taste

Directions:
Mix together the yogurt and the Ranch mix. Add all other ingredients and chill so flavors can blend.
You can use bottled Ranch dressing, but I find the yogurt to be better (and healthier). You can also add diced avocado to this dish.
Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!
