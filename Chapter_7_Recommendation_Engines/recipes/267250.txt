Ingredients:
1 cup beer
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) package fresh green beans, trimmed
parchment paper cut to the size of the air fryer basket
Dipping Sauce:
1 cup ranch dressing
2 teaspoons sriracha sauce
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish, or to taste

Directions:
Mix beer, flour, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat beans with the batter in small batches and shake off excess.
Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturers' instructions.
Place the parchment paper on the bottom of the air fryer basket. Place a single layer of the battered beans in the air fryer. Cook until golden brown and crispy on the outside, 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining battered beans.
Mix ranch dressing, sriracha sauce, and horseradish in a bowl. Serve with the green beans.
