Pretzels Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/3 cup warm water
1 tsp sugar
2 tbsp yeast
3 1/2 cup flour
1 tsp salt
1 egg
1 tbsp water
course salt
*Optional*
Add 1/2 cup chopped black or green olives, 3 tbsp jalepenos, and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese or any other ingredients (herbs and spices) you may like

Directions:
1. In a small bowl, mix together warm water, sugar and yeast.  Let rise for 10 min.
2. In a large mixing bowl, add flour, salt and yeast mixture.  Mix together well  (Works best when using a mixing machine (i.e. Kitchen Aid) however it can also be done by hand). If adding optional ingredients, they should be added now.  May need to add 1/2 cup extra flour if dough is too wet.  Dough should be moderately sticky (but dry enough to handly and knead).
3. Shape dough into a log.  Divide into 8 equal portions.  Roll each portion into long cylinders (approx. 1/2" inch thick and 30" long).  Shape into a pretzel and place onto a greased cookie sheet (I use two cookie sheets to fit all 8 pretzels; 1 large and 1 small so they will fit in the oven on the same rack at the same time.
4. Mix together the egg and 1 tbsp water.  Brush the egg mixture onto the pretzels.  Sprinkle the pretzels with the course salt.  Let rise for 20 min (I also cover the pretzels with a towel and place on the stove with the oven preheating so that they will rise better). **Optional: after rising, sprinkle pretzels with shredded cheddar cheese**
5. Bake pretzels at 425 F for 15 - 20 min.
Enjoy!!!
