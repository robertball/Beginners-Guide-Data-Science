Ingredients:
sauce:
1 15oz can tomato puree
1 jalapeno, minced, de-seeded
3/4 t. cumin
3/4 t. smoked paprika
filling:
1 T. olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium white onion, diced
1 medium red pepper, diced
1 medium zucchini, diced
1 lb ground bison (or beef)
1 cup tomatillo sauce
additional:
1 1/2 cups shredded mexican cheese
small bunch of green onions, chopped
12 6" corn tortillas

Directions:
mix the jalapeno, tomato puree, cumin, and smoked paprika into a small sauce pan.  add about 1/4 cup water.  let simmer until needed.  add more water if it gets too thick.
add the olive oil, garlic, and onion to a fry pan (on medium heat); stir fry for about two minutes.  add zucchini and red pepper; continue to cook an additional two to three minutes.  crumble in the ground bison and break up with a spoon, letting it cook all the way through.  when the bison is browned, add the tomatillo sauce and let simmer about 5 minutes.
(i like to heat up the corn tortillas on a small skillet before i use them - it softens them up and makes them more malleable.)
add a small amount (1 teaspoon) of the sauce in the middle of each tortilla.  spoon in a good amount of the filling.  sprinkle with just a touch of the shredded cheese.  roll up and put lay in rows in a 9"x13" pan.  when all 12 are done, spoon over the remaining sauce, top with more cheese, green onions, and put into the oven.  bake for about 20 minutes.
voila.
