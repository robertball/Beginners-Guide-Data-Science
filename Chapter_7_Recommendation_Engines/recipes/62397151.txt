Ingredients:
1 tablespoon  butter
1 tablespoon  oil
1 cup  all-purpose flour
1 cup  cornmeal
2 tablespoons  sugar
1 tablespoon  baking powder
1/2 teaspoon  black pepper -- cracked
1/2 teaspoon  salt
1 cup  milk
1/4 cup  cooking oil or shortening (melted)
2 each  eggs -- slightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil in a large ovenproof or cast-iron skillet. Preheat in oven for 5 minutes; do not heat longer or mixture may burn.
In a medium mixing bowl stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of the cracked black pepper, and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry mixture; set aside.
In another bowl blend together the milk, the 1/4 cup cooking oil or melted shortening, and the eggs. Add egg mixture all at once to dry mixture. Stir just until moistened. (The batter will be slightly lumpy.)
Spoon batter into the prepared pan and spread with spoon. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper. Bake 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
Meanwhile, if desired, in a medium bowl beat the 1/2 cup softened butter with an electric mixer for 30 seconds on medium speed. Add honey; beat on high speed for 1 minute more or until fluffy.
To serve, immediately place a dollop of honey butter in the center of the hot corn bread; pass remaining honey butter.
