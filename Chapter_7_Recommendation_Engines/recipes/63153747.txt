20 chicken wings

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine the olive oil, garlic, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large, resealable bag; seal and shake to combine. Add the chicken wings; reseal and shake to coat. Marinade for 1 hour or overnight, if possible.
After marinading is complete, arrange the chicken wings on a baking sheet.
