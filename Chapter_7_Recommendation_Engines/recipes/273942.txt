Ingredients:
¼ cup jerk seasoning, divided
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 small lemon, juiced
1 small lime, juiced
1 small orange, juiced
1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts

Directions:
Combine 3 tablespoons jerk seasoning, oil, lemon juice, lime juice, and orange juice in a resealable plastic bag.
Place chicken on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open book.
Sprinkle butterflied chicken breasts with remaining 1 tablespoon jerk seasoning and add chicken to marinade. Seal and refrigerate about 1 hour. Remove from fridge about 10 minutes before grilling.
Heat a gas grill to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Add chicken and grill until chicken no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.

Description: 
I'm a Floridian so I embraced my roots when creating this jerk chicken which is decidedly a mix of Floridian and Jamaican cuisine. I use jerk seasoning from the Savory Spice Shop(<sup>&reg;</sup>), or you can use your preferred brand or homemade jerk seasoning. Serve with additional jerk seasoning sprinkled on top if desired.
