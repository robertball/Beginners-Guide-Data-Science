Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 to 1 lb smoked sausage, sliced.
Canned tomatoes with juice. Diced, stewed, Italian style; whatever floats your boat. Mine came with garlic. If yours don't have garlic, you will probably want to add some.
1-2 cups of chicken broth
1 can of garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed.
1 bunch of kale, washed, stemmed and torn into manageable pieces.

Directions:
Brown your sausage. (add onions and garlic now if using).
Deglaze the pan with white wine now if you like.
Add the mountain of kale to the pan even if it looks like it couldn't possibly fit. It will...eventually.
Add the tomatoes, beans, broth and any spices you like to the pan and cover.
Simmer for about 5 minutes. By this time your kale should have wilted down a bit. Give it a stir and replace the lid. Simmer for another 25 minutes or until the kale is tender, stirring occasionally.
