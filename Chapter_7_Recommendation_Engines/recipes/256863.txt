Ingredients:
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon sriracha chile paste
1 tablespoon grated onion
1 tablespoon grated jalapeno pepper
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried cilantro
1 splash lime juice
2 (4 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Mix honey, sriracha sauce, sriracha paste, onion, jalapeno pepper, soy sauce, cilantro, and lime juice together in a bowl.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Brush salmon fillets with olive oil; place skin-side up on the lined baking sheet.
Broil salmon in the preheated oven until skin is crisp, about 5 minutes. Flip and spread honey mixture over salmon. Continue cooking until salmon flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a slightly American take on the sriracha craze sweeping the nation. The honey and soy sauce give a twist to what would be hoisin sauce. The jalapeno and onion go nicely with the sriracha flavor. This dish is some what similar to the flavors that would be added to a bowl of pho. It's inexpensive and easy.
