Ingredients:
cooking spray
16 whole frozen yeast dinner rolls (such as RhodesÂ®)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 pound mild Italian sausage
1 1/2 cups marinara sauce, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder, divided
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk ricotta cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup sliced pepperoni

Directions:
Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place frozen rolls on top to thaw. Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel and let thaw and rise, 3 to 5 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Uncover rolls.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add sausage. Cook, breaking up as you stir occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup marinara sauce, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Cook until heated through, about 4 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
Pour remaining marinara sauce into a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave until heated through, about 1 minute.
Combine remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper in another microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 2 minutes and stir. Continue to microwave until completely heated through, about 2 minutes more. Stir in parsley.
Slice rolls in half and place on a plate. Serve with the bowls of sausage mixture, marinara sauce, cheese mixture, and the pepperoni, layering as you please.
