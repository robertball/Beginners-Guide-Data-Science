Ingredients:
1/2 pound boneless salmon fillet
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon pepper seasoning
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay salmon fillet skin-side down on a wide piece of aluminum foil.
Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over salmon. Sprinkle lemon pepper, lemon juice, and salt on top. Fold foil up and over the fillet, tenting it at the top. Roll top down to seal salmon in foil. Transfer to a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is an easy, no-mess, no-cleanup recipe that tastes delicious! If I don't feel like scrubbing a lot of pans after dinner, I just throw this in the oven next to some rice and vegetables, or just throw it over some lettuce and tomatoes for a nice salad, and my husband thinks I was cooking for hours! People will think you put a ton of effort into this fancy entree.
