Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons rice flour
4 teaspoons cayenne pepper
4 teaspoons paprika
4 teaspoons ground cumin
4 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
4 teaspoons kosher salt
For the Sauce:
1/2 cup seasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons thinly sliced red onion
1 tablespoon thinly sliced ginger
1/2 tablespoon minced fresh chives
2 teaspoons sambal chili paste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 pounds chicken wings
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
For the Ginger Oil:
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine cornstarch and rice flour in a bowl. Add cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, and salt. Whisk the spicy chicken coating until nicely blended. Set aside.
Pour rice vinegar into another bowl. Add red onion and sliced ginger. Toss in chives, sambal, and red pepper flakes. Stir the vinegar sauce until well combined.
Add wings to the spice coating in batches. Flip bowl repeatedly to toss the wings until thoroughly coated. Transfer wings onto nonstick baking sheets. Drizzle vegetable oil on top.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix grated ginger and 2 tablespoons oil together. Turn wings over and brush the ginger oil on top.
Continue baking until dry and browned, 15 to 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Flip wings over into the oils and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape a fork over the wings to test for crunchiness.
To enjoy the wings 'wet,' place a portion of the wings into a bowl and spoon in some of the vinegar sauce. Toss until coated. For 'dry'-style, plate the dry wings and simply dip into the sauce.

Description: 
A football snack from the land of cricket, these gluten-free spicy wings are inspired by one of my favorite Indian restaurants. As usual, feel free to alter the spice amounts as you see fit, but as I said in the video, do not skip the rice vinegar sauce.
