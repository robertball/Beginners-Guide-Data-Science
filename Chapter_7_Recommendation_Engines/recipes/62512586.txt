1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp. salt
2 Tbsp. yeast
1 cup water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 egg
sugar
cinnamon

1/2 cup butter/margarine
1 cup brown sugar
4 Tbsp. corn syrup
Icing:
2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp. vanilla
1-2 Tbsp. milk

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a bowl and blend well. Set aside. heat water, milk and butter just until butter melts (don't get it too hot). Add to flour mixture, beat slightly and then add egg. Beat on high for 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining flour to make a nice dough (not too stiff or too sticky). Knead for 10 minutes on low. Roll out and sprinkle with slightly melted butter, sugar and cinnamon. Make cinnamon rolls (may cut with thread or floss).
Before putting the rolls in the pan, heat 1/2 cup butter in microwave just until it melts. Stir in brown sugar and corn syrup. Spread in pan. Put rolls on top of caramel, slightly apart. Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes. Mix icing well and drizzle over hot cinnamon rolls.
