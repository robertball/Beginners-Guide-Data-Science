Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 tablespoon beef base
1 (7 pound) beef prime rib roast, at room temperature
2 cups wood chips, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Mix olive oil, garlic, pepper, rosemary, salt, and beef base together in a bowl. Cover beef roast completely with the rub.
Heat a charcoal smoker to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on indirect heat. Place the roast directly on the grill grate with a drip pan underneath. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions.
Smoke until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the roast reads at least 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a very good recipe for grilling beef rib roast. I have used this for both bone-in and boneless roasts with great results on each. Make sure to remove the roast from the fridge about 1 to 2 hours before cooking.
