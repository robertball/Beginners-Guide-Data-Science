Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried cherries
1 egg
3/4 cup buttermilk
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons real maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon maple flavored extract
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 egg white
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a heavy duty baking sheet with parchment paper. To prepare fruit, cover with boiling water and let stand 5 minutes. Drain and dry with paper toweling.
In a two cup measure, stir together the egg, buttermilk and vanilla, maple syrup and maple extract.
In a food processor bowl, place the flour, oatmeal, corn starch, baking powder, soda, salt and sugar. Process briefly to blend ingredients. Drop in chunks of butter and pulse to cut in. Stop when you have a coarse, grainy mixture. Alternately you can do this by had with a pastry blender or two knives.
Remove mixture to a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center. Stir in buttermilk/egg mixture. Blend in dried cherries. Stir with a fork to make a soft dough.
Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead only to get a slightly cohesive dough. Divide the dough into 3 equal size pieces. Pat each piece into an 8 to 10 inch circle, 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Cut each circle into eight wedges. Place on baking sheet. Paint tops with beaten egg white and garnish with about 1 teaspoon of the sugar.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
