Ingredients:
1 onion, sliced into 1/4" rings
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
ground cayenne pepper to taste
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
2 cups chicken or beef broth

Directions:
Mix together spices in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the onion rings in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.
Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat approximately halfway if possible. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. Strain cooking liquid and use as needed to moisten the meat.  Moisten meat well before freezing leftovers.

Description: 
Carnitas means 'little meats' and is traditionally fried then braised. This recipe is made much easier using the slow cooker but the results are just as tasty. This makes a great filling for tamales, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. This filling is also great combined with your favorite barbecue sauce and served on buns.Modified from: Slow Cooker Carnitas
