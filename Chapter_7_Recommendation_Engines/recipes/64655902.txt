Ingredients:
150 g (approximately 1 and 3/4 cups) gluten free cookies (shortbread, butter cookies, animal crackers, or graham crackers for example)
7 Tbsp melted coconut oil, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 175Â°C
In a food processor or blender, pulse the cookies to fine crumbs. If doing by hand, add cookies to a large zip top baggie and secure. Use a rolling pin to crush into fine crumbs.
Put the crumbs in a bowl and drizzle with 5 Tbsp of melted coconut oil. Mix well with a fork. The mixture should begin to hold together. If this doesn't happen, drizzle one more tablespoon of oil. Put the mixture into a pie pan and press it evenly throughout the pan to create the crust. Drizzle one tablespoon oil over the top. You may only need 6 tablespoons in total.
Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes until slightly browned. Cool before using. If using for a pie that needs to be baked, pre-bake this crust making sure it is only lightly browned or it may burn when re-baking.
This also works with real butter if desired.
