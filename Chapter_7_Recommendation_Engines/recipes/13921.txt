Ingredients:
1 pound firm tofu
1/4 cup brown miso
1/3 cup roasted tahini
2 tablespoons minced onion
3 tablespoons minced carrot (optional)
3 tablespoons unsalted sunflower seeds

Directions:
Press tofu to remove excess water:  Place tofu on a flat surface.  Cover with a cutting board, and place an iron skillet or a similarly heavy object on top.  Allow it to sit for about 30 minutes.
Crumble tofu into a medium bowl.  Mix in miso and tahini.  If desired, stir in onion, carrot, and seeds. Refrigerate.

Description: 
Tofu Miso Tahini is a delectable vegan sandwich filling. You can replace the sunflower seeds with sesame seeds if you prefer. You'll never want tuna or chicken salad again!!! Try TMT on an open-faced, toasted bagel with ripe tomato slices, on a seed-laden, whole wheat bread with lettuce and sweet onion, or on rye crackers as an hors d'oeurve, garnished with fine slices of vegetables.
