Ingredients:
1 pound ground venison
1 egg
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, finely crushed
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon steak seasoning
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 slices bacon
3/4 cup barbecue sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix the venison, egg, cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup barbecue sauce, onion, sage, steak seasoning, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl with your hands until evenly combined. Pack into a 3x7-inch loaf pan, and lay the bacon strips over top.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the bacon is crispy, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Meanwhile, stir 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce in a sauce pan over medium heat. Simmer 5 minutes, whisking constantly. Pour the sauce over the cooked meatloaf, and let rest 5 minutes before serving.
