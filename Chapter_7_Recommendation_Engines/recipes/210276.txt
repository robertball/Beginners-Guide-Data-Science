Salt and pepper

3 tablespoons prepared thick barbecue sauce

Mix blackberry jam, barbecue sauce and seasoning in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH 30 to 40 seconds; stir to blend.
Grill pork, turning occasionally, 16 to 20 minutes, until thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Baste liberally with 1/4 cup blackberry barbecue sauce during last 5 minutes of cooking.
