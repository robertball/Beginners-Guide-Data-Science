Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas
2 4oz. containers of unsweetened applesauce
1 tablespoon of peanut butter

Directions:
Put all ingredients in a container and use an immersion blender to mix and ensure a smooth pureed consistency.  You can also use a food processor or blender, but might need to add a tablespoon or two of water so it blends smoothly.
Pour or spoon into a standard ice cube tray and freeze for four hours.  After the cubes are frozen, transfer them to a zip-top freezer bag.
