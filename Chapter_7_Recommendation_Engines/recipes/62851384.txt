Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange marmalade
2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1 Tbsp. Olive oil
1/4 tsp. dry sage
1 Tbsp. chopped chives
1 large garlic bulb minced
2 Tbsp. red wine
1/8 tsp. garlic salt
1/8 tsp. kosher salt
1 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil
Chicken breast cubed
cut vegetables such as Peppers, red onion, mushrooms, and pineapple chunks.

Directions:
Put all your marinade ingredients in a bowl and mix them together. Add a little to one bag for the vegetables (all but pineapple), add veggies. The majority of the marinade will go into a bag for the chicken to marinade in. Marinade all day or at least 2 hours. Assemble kababs with the chicken, vegetables and pineapple chunks alternating them. I grill them or you can  broil them.
I serve with a rice pilaf of brown rice and wild rice.
