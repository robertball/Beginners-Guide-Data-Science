Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
4 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
6 eggs
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
16 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped
1 1/2 cups apples - peeled, cored and diced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease one 10 inch tube or bundt pan.
Unwrap and cut each caramel into 8 pieces.
In a large mixer bowl cream the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each one.
Gradually add the flour, ground cinnamon and ground allspice to the egg mixture. Blend at low speed until thoroughly combined. By hand stir in the caramel pieces and the chopped apples. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

If desired top slices with ice cream and caramel sauce. Alternately bake in a 9x13 inch cake pan for 75 to 80 minutes.
