Ingredients:
5 chorizo sausages
5 medium potatoes cut into chunks
3 medium onions cut into chunks
1 bottle red wine (rioja or similar full bodied)
1 bay leaf
Ground pepper and salt

Directions:
Put all the ingredients into a lidded casserole, stir to coat and bake at 375 for a minimum of one hour, until potatoes are done.  Potatoes will take on a red color and lots more flavor if braised more slowly (2 hours at 325, 3 hours at 275, etc).
