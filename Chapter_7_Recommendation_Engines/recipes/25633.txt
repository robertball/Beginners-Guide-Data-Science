Ingredients:
1 cup ground almonds
1 cup whole wheat flour
2/3 cup vegan margarine
2 (12 ounce) packages firm tofu
1 1/2 cups demerara sugar
7 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup sunflower seed oil
1/2 cup soy milk
1/4 cup dark rum
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C.) In a medium bowl, combine ground almonds and whole wheat flour. Cut in margarine until a dough is formed. Press dough into the bottom and half-way up the sides of a 9 inch springform pan.
In a blender or food processor, crumble the tofu. Add sugar, cocoa, oil, soy milk, rum and vanilla. Process until smooth and creamy. Pour filling into crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 75 minutes, or until filling is set. Allow to cool on a rack and then chill thoroughly in refrigerator before attempting to remove from the pan.

Description: 
This vegan cheesecake tastes wonderful just as it is without any decoration, but you may wish to arrange halved strawberries or other fruits around the rim and sprinkle chopped nuts in the center.
