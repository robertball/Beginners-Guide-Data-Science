Ingredients:
2 cups yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®)
6 eggs
10 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn, thawed
12 ounces cooked shrimp, coarsely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
1 cup minced yellow onion
2 large jalapeno peppers, minced
2 tablespoons shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 325 degrees (165 degrees C)). Grease a 9-inch baking dish.
Combine cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and Creole seasoning in a bowl. Add eggs and butter; mix until smooth. Fold corn, shrimp, 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, onion, and jalapeno peppers into the batter. Spread in the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese on top; continue baking until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
