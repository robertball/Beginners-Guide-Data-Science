Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
3  onions, chopped
10 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
2 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
4 quarts water
2 (2 to 3 pound) whole chickens, cut into pieces
5  bay leaves
2 sprigs epazote
16 ounces tomato paste
1  red bell peppers, julienned
1 cup green bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
2  carrots, sliced thin
2 cups thinly sliced celery
3 cups zucchini, diced
3  potatoes
1 pound spinach, rinsed and chopped
2  avocados - peeled, pitted and diced
1 ½ pounds shredded Monterey Jack cheese
3 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1/2 inch strips
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in large skillet and saute onions and garlic over low heat until they are translucent and soft, about 8-10 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, oregano, cumin, and black pepper, and cook over low heat, partially covered, another 10-12 minutes. Let cool, then blend in a processor until smooth. Set aside.
Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add chicken, bay leaves, and epazote. Water should cover chicken by an inch or so. Skim off foam and fat that surface in first 5 minutes. Add reserved puree and tomato paste and cook; partially covered, with liquid at rolling simmer, for another 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter. When cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones, then shred.
Add peppers, carrots, and celery to broth and cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Add zucchini and cook an additional 5 minutes. Remove vegetables from broth with slotted spoon. Salt broth to taste.
Peel and parboil potatoes. Then dice and saute in a little olive oil until brown.
Place a scoop of vegetables and a heaping tablespoon of potatoes in a large soup bowl. Next, add tortilla strips, spinach, shredded chicken, avocado, and cheese. Pour piping-hot broth over everything and serve immediately.
