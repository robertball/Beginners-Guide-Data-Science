Ingredients:
3 cups reduced sugar instant oatmeal packets (apple cinnamon, for example)
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups peanut flour
5 whole organic eggs
6 oz butter, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup flax seeds
Almond milk
1.5 tsp baking powder
1.5 tsp salt
1 tsp cinnamon
2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 F.
Blend all dry ingredients in a large bowl.
In a separate bowl, combine the butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs. Add to the dry ingredients and stir to incorporate. Add enough almond milk to make the mixture moist, but not too moist. You can do this in 1/4 cup increments. I used approximately 1/2 a cup. Spoon onto a greased baking sheet and bake 8-10 minutes until light brown. Cool on a wire rack, store in an air tight container, and enjoy.
