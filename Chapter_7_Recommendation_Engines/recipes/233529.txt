Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
¼ cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed
¾ cup reduced-fat vanilla yogurt
1  egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Add butter and mix with fingers until coarse crumbs form. Gently mix yogurt, egg, and vanilla extract into flour mixture until dough is just combined.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, for five or six turns. Pat or roll the dough out into a 1-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedges and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Brush each wedge with milk and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or cool completely and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
Flaky and light, these scones are perfect for snacking or for breakfast. Made from ingredients you probably have on hand, they can be a special treat any time and are one of my favorite breakfast recipes to have with tea or coffee.
