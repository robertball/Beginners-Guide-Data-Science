Ingredients:
1 cup pure pumpkin puree
2/3 cup water
2 eggs, beaten
1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix
1 (6 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat pumpkin puree, water, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Stir cake mix into the pumpkin mixture until you get a smooth batter. Gently fold chocolate chips through the batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make these around the holidays. They are a big hit at office parties and with kids! They are very quick and easy. If you want icing, I recommend whipped cream cheese icing, but they are very good without it.
