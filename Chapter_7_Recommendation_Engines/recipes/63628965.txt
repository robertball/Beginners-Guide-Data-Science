Ingredients:
2 zucchini, 2 yellow squash, 1 shallot, 1/2 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup shredded cheese (Mexican blend preferred), 6 buttery crackers, 1 tablespoon cornmeal, 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Slice the zucchini and squash into thin circles about  1/4 of an inch thick.  Next thinly slice the shallot.  Heat the olive oil in a pan and add the shallot.  Cook for about 5 minutes on medium heat.  Add the zucchini and squash.  Cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes adding salt and pepper to your liking.  While that cooks put the buttery crackers and the cornmeal in a sandwich bag and seal.  Pound the crackers until a fine crumb mixture is made.  After the zucchini and squash have cooked for about 10 minutes add the milk and butter.  Cook for another 2-3 minutes on medium high heat.  Then add the cracker crumb mixture to the pan and the cheese.  Stir and turn off heat.  Once everything is mixed spread evenly in 8 x 8 pan and place in the oven for 15 minutes at 425 degrees, uncovered.  After 15 minutes raise heat to 450 and cook for another 10 minutes or until light brown.
