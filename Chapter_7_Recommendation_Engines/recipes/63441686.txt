Description: 
I wanted to make potatoes for dinner but wanted something different so I decided on roasting some of the garlic purchased at the local farmers marked and seasoned it with fried pork belly. The smell in the kitchen was amazing so at the last minute I decided to add mini potatoes to the mix. What a treat it turned out to be.
