Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
4 large eggs, separated
1/4 cup white sugar
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 1/3 cups cake flour
1 3/4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Whisk buttermilk, pumpkin puree, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until blended. Whisk in melted butter.
Whisk cake flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and whisk to combine.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into buttermilk-flour mixture to form pancake batter.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form on top, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
