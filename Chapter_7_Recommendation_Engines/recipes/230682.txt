Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ cup diced onion
¼ cup diced carrot
¼ cup diced celery
¼ cup diced green bell pepper
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
½ cup quinoa
1 cup chicken broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, carrot, celery, bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir chicken and parsley into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add quinoa to the chicken mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until quinoa is toasted, about 2 minutes.
Pour chicken broth over the quinoa mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Place a cover on the saucepan and cook mixture at a simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Turn heat completely off and allow mixture to sit covered another 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Fluff with a fork to serve.

Description: 
If chicken soup and pilaf had a kid, I think it would be chicken quinoa. Quinoa is a very healthy ancient grain from South America; it's very filling! I think it's delicious. I used leftover roasted chicken to make this come together faster, but any kind of lean cooked meat can be used in this recipe. To make a vegetarian version, omit the meat and use vegetable stock instead of chicken.
