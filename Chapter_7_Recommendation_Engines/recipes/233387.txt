Ingredients:
Salad:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
3 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped (reserve marinade)
1/2 cup diced celery
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup diced fully cooked ham
1/2 cup diced cooked shrimp
1/2 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1/2 cup small Cheddar cheese cubes
1/2 cup small Monterey Jack cheese cubes
1/3 cup diced dill pickle
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
Dressing:
1 cup sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon mustard
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water until completely cooled; drain.
Mix pasta, eggs, artichoke hearts, celery, bell pepper, onion, ham, shrimp, peas, Cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, pickle, and olive together in a large bowl.
Whisk sour cream, mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, sugar, ranch dressing mix, mustard, and hot pepper sauce together in a separate bowl; season with salt and black pepper.
Drizzle dressing over salad and toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator 3 hours to overnight. Stir enough of the reserved artichoke marinade into the salad so it is just moistened before serving.

Description: 
At the last minute, I was told to bring something for a potluck at work. Not having the time to go shopping, I used whatever I had on hand and used a dressing my mother always used on her potato salad. The salad was a hit at work. Takes a little time to make but is well worth the effort.
