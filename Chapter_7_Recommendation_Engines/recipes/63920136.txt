2 medium garlic cloves, minced
9 oz  frozen chopped onions
16 oz canned, sliced mushrooms, well-drained
24 oz chili sauce
1/2 cup fat-free beef broth
1/2 cup dry red wine

1 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp unpacked brown sugar
3 lbs raw lean flank steak, cut into six equal pieces
1 head cauliflower

Directions:
in a large bowl, stir together all ingredients, except steak.  Place steak in a 5 quart slow cooker and pour garlic mixture over top; stir briefly so steak pieces aren't pressed firmly together.
Cover slow cooker and cook on high heat for 4 hours.  Remove steak from low cooker and let sit for 2 minutes; slice steak on the diagonal against the grain.
