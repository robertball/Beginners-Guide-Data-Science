Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/3 cup Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon harissa paste
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 pinches smoked paprika, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place eggs in a large saucepan. Cover with cool water by 1 inch. Cover with a lid and bring water to a boil. Cook until yolks are set, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer eggs to an ice bath.
Cut cooled eggs in half lengthwise and carefully remove yolks to a large bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; add yogurt, harissa, garlic salt, cumin, 1 pinch paprika, and pepper. Stir until fully combined and smooth.
Place yolk mixture into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Pipe mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle some paprika on top. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
