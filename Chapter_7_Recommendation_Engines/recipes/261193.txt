Ingredients:
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
¾ pound fresh green beans, trimmed
4  red potatoes, quartered
½ (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
6 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts in the middle of a rimmed sheet pan. Add green beans on one side and potatoes on the other. Pour melted butter over everything and sprinkle with Italian dressing mix. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Super easy and so yummy. Chicken breast, red potatoes, and fresh green beans go in one pan and everything cooks together. De-li-cious! Adjust green bean and potato amount to your liking.
