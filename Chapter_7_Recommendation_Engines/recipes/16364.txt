Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic
1/3 cup pine nuts
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and diced
1 bunch green onion, chopped
5 ounces provolone cheese, shredded
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
3/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 tablespoons shortening
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a small sauce pan, cover the unpeeled garlic cloves with water. Bring to a boil and cook garlic cloves  for 15 minutes; drain, cool, mash and set aside.
Place the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden, about 10 minutes; cool and set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes, green onions, shredded Provolone, rosemary, black pepper and toasted pine nuts.
In a medium mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and the sugar. Mix in the eggs, mashed garlic, reserved oil from the tomatoes and buttermilk.
Add the shortening/buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely.
