Ingredients:
5 large potatoes
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 large yellow onion chopped
4 cups cubed prime rib
2 cloves minced garlic
2 tsp sage
1 tsp cayenne
salt and pepper to taste
3/4 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Precook potatoes.  I prefer baking them the night before and cutting them into chunks right before I need them, but you could also cut and boil them.
In a 5 quart skillet heat vegetable oil on med heat
Add potatoes and cook turning occasionally for 10 min.
Add onions and continue cooking and turning for another 10 min.
Add prime rib, garlic. sage. cayenne, salt and pepper.
Continue cooking and turning for another 10 min.
Add heavy cream and mix well
Turn heat up to high and flatten hash as much as possible.  Turn in sections every few minutes until desired crispness is reached.  Usually 10 to 20 minutes.
