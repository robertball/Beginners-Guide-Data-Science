Ingredients:
1 (8.8 ounce) package UNCLE BEN'S速 READY RICE速 Whole Grain Brown
1 (8.8 ounce) package UNCLE BEN'S速 READY RICE速 Spanish Style
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1 1/2 (1.25 ounce) packages reduced-sodium taco seasoning mix
6 large red bell peppers, tops cut off and seeds removed
6 tablespoons Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1 small avocado, diced

Directions:
Place oven rack in middle of oven and set oven to broil. Prepare rice in the microwave or skillet according to package instructions, about 90 seconds.
Heat a large skillet to medium-high and add ground beef. Cook until brown, about 5 minutes, stirring to crumble. Sprinkle with taco seasoning; cook 1 minute. Stir in rice. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, place bell peppers cut-side down on a baking sheet and place in oven set to broil. Cook until slightly tender and browned on bottoms, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool slightly, and stuff each pepper evenly with rice and beef mixture.
Top each pepper with cheese and return to oven. Broil 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese bubbles slightly and starts to brown. Remove from oven and top with avocado.
