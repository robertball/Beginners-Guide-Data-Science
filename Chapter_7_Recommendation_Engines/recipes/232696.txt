Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine
3 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup chopped nuts
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups.
Mix 1 cup and 2 tablespoons flour, margarine, and cream cheese in a bowl using a fork. Form dough into 24 small balls. Press and shape each ball to form a shell in the prepared muffin cups.
Mix brown sugar, nuts, butter, egg, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl. Spoon mixture into the prepared dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until keufels are lightly browned and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes.
