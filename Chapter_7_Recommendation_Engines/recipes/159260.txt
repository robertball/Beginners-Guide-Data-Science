Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) whole rockfish, dressed
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 green onion, thinly sliced diagonally
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchstick strips
1/2 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Fill a large pot 1/2 full with water and place a bamboo steamer with lid on top of the pot. Bring to a rolling boil. Scrub the scales off of the fish and rinse with cold water. Place the fish onto a small metal plate, belly side down.
Place into the steamer and cover. Cook until the fish is no longer opaque and flakes easily, 10 to 12 minutes. Try not to take the lid off the pot until it is done steaming; this will ensure a fully-cooked and tender fish.
While the fish is steaming, combine the vegetable oil, green onions, and ginger in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the ginger bubbles. Carefully pour the hot oil over the steamed fish. Drizzle with soy sauce to serve.
