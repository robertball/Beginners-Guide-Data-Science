Ingredients:
3/4 lb shrimp, peeled, deveined and finely chopped
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3 oz Daiya cream cheese
2 T coconut milk
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 t salt
1/4 t ground black pepper
Grated zest of 2 limes (or 1 t kaffir lime powder)
1/4 t cayenne pepper (or more to taste)
1-2/3 c bread crumbs (I use tapioca bread)
1 c green onions, chopped
1/2 c fresh cilantro, chopped
Vegetable oil for shallow frying
Nonstick cooking spray
Sweet Chili Sauce (in my recipe box)

Directions:
Combine shrimp, eggs, cream cheese, coconut milk, garlic, salt, pepper & lime zest until well mixed. Mix in bread crumbs, green onion, and cilantro.
Line a baking sheet with wax paper. To form each cake, firmly pack some of the mixture into a 1/4 cup measure that has been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Turn upside down and tap until the formed cake comes out onto the paper-line sheet. Repeat with remaining mixture. Using the back side of a spatula, gently press on each cake to flatten slightly. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to one hour.
Heat 1/4-inch of oil n a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the cakes in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Once cooked, the shrimp cakes can be kept warm in a 300-degree oven for up to 30 minutes.  Serve with Sweet Chili Sauce (in recipe box) for dipping.
