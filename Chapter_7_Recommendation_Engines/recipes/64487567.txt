Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried pinto beans
1/2 cup dried black beans
1 cup dried kidney beans
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 lb beef steak or roast, cut into bite-sized cubes
2 links Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage, casings removed
1/2 of a sweet onion
4 cups (or 32 oz) plain tomatoes in juice (diced, whole, crushed- whatever you have)
12oz canned tomato paste
5 cups water
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons Chipotle Smoked Tabasco Sauce
3 tablespoons cumin
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 cup cornmeal

Directions:
Soak beans overnight then rinse and strain.  Set aside.
Heat oil in the soup pot and brown beef and sausage.  Remove meat and set aside.
Saute onion in remaining oil until starting to brown.
Add water to deglaze the meat and onion bits off the bottom, then add all ingredients except cornmeal into pot and simmer on low for 3 hours until beans are cooked through.
Add cornmeal, whisking gently to remove any clumps, and cook for another 30 minutes.

Description: 
A fancier version of this sweet/rich chili was given to me by my friend Lindsey using 4 lbs of mixed meats and a few fresh vegetables.   I've pared it down for economical reasons and found the flavor is nearly equal to the fancy version.  The cornmeal is a trick I learned from an old old recipe and the simple ingredient really makes it a super rib-sticking meal.  70oz canned beans equals the dried qty if that's what you have.  Enjoy!
