Ingredients:
Four Boneless Chicken Cutlets
Enough Balsamic Vinegar to glaze the frying pan
Three Shallots, minced
4 Tbsp Olive Oil
1/3 Cup Sun-Dried Tomatoes (in oil)
10 Basil Leaves
¼ Cup Parmesan Cheese, grated
Additional Balsamic Vinegar for garnish (optional)
¼ Cup Heavy Cream (optionalt)
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Mince the shallots and put them in a sauté pan with olive oil (don’t turn the heat on yet). Use the tenderizer to pound the chicken cutlets, add them to the pan, and then sauté until the cutlets are brown and shallots are soft. Use tongs to flip the cutlet as necessary.
Remove the cutlets and shallots, deglaze the pan with balsamic vinegar, and then return the cutlets and shallots, this time with sun-dried tomatoes and basil.
Sauté until the chicken is cooked through, then place the mixture on the serving plate along with shallots.
If desired, mix heavy cream into the remaining glaze and use it as a sauce.
Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, additional balsamic vinegar (if desired), salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately.

Description: 
This was actually my first time cooking chicken cutlets, and I think it turned out well. As it says on my site, chicken cutlets are deglazed in balsamic vinegar and served with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan to create this gourmet entrée.
