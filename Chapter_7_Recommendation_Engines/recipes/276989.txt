Ingredients:

8 shallots, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons red curry paste, or more to taste
2 tablespoons hot curry powder
1 tablespoon ground red chile pepper
2 1/2 pounds chicken thighs
1 lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces

2 kaffir lime leaves, or to taste
3 tablespoons fish sauce
water to cover
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk

Directions:
Melt butter in a wok over medium heat. Add shallots and fry until golden, about 10 minutes. Remove shallots and set aside. Add curry paste to the wok and toast until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in curry powder and ground chile. Add chicken and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemongrass, chiles peppers, coriander, and lime leaves.
Pour in fish sauce and enough water to cover chicken. Add coconut milk; cook for 10 minutes. Toss in tomatoes and cook until starting to soften, about 10 minutes more. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, 2 to 3 hours.
Remove lemongrass and lime leaves. Garnish curry with the fried shallots and cilantro.
