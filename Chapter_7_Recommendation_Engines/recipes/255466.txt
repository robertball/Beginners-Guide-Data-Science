Ingredients:
4 large onions, finely chopped, or more to taste
3  lemons, juiced
½ cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1  habanero pepper, chopped
2  bay leaves
5  skin-on chicken breast halves, cut in half
¼ cup oil, or to taste
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 cube beef bouillon
½ cup hot water
1 cup pitted green olives
¾  ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix onions, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, habanero pepper, and bay leaves together in a large pot. Add chicken; cover and marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Transfer chicken to the grill, reserving onions and marinade in the pot. Grill until browned, 5 to 10 minutes per side.
Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Add onions to the hot oil with a slotted spoon. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour in marinade; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken.
Crumble chicken bouillon cubes and beef bouillon cube into hot water in a small bowl. Pour into the skillet. Cover and simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes. Stir in olives and black pepper.
