Ingredients:
1 gallon boiling water
2 pounds dry great Northern beans
2 onions, chopped
6 cups chopped ham
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
8 ounces processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta), sliced

Directions:
Add beans to boiling water and cook on high. Beans will soak up some water, so you will need to add more water later.
As soon as beans can be mashed with fork, add ham and onions, let cook until beans and ham are done.
Turn down to medium heat and add soup and cheese. Stir frequently while soup and cheese are mixed into the beans. When cheese is melted turn off heat and serve. Leftovers may be frozen.

Description: 
This soup freezes well and many people who don't like ham and beans like this soup. It serves 20, depending on the appetites of people eating this delicious soup. Note: I usually soak beans overnight and then they will cook faster. Also only mash a few beans to check them for softness, don't mash them all.
