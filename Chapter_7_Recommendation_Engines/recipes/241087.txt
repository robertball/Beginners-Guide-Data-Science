Ingredients:
20 (3 inch) unbaked tart shells
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 cup golden corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tart shells on a baking sheet.
Beat brown sugar and butter together with an electric mixer until creamy; beat in eggs, corn syrup, vanilla extract, lemon juice, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.
Divide raisins evenly into the bottom of tart shells; pour about 2 tablespoons syrup mixture into each tart shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden and filling is set, about 20 minutes; remove to cool on a wire rack.
