Ingredients:
3 cups water, or as needed
1 1/2 cups walnuts
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 pinch sea salt
1 teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese
freshly ground black pepper to taste
sea salt to taste
1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta
1/2 bunch fresh chives, finely chopped

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add walnuts and cook until they have softened slightly, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Combine garlic and 1 pinch sea salt in the bowl of a mortar and pestle. Grind to create a thick paste. Add walnuts, marjoram, thyme, and oregano. Grind until combined and slightly creamy, but still coarse.
Transfer the walnut mixture to a large bowl. Slowly whisk in olive oil to form a thick emulsion. Add heavy cream and Pecorino Romano cheese, whisk until combined. Season with black pepper and sea salt to taste.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Toss walnut sauce with pasta. Garnish with fresh chives.

Description: 
A local chef in Cinque Terre prepared this dish for us using the herbs we'd picked only moments before. 15 years after trying the dish for the first time, we still make it at home often.
