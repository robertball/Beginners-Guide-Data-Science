Ingredients:
1 (2 lb.) rolled boneless pork loin roast
1/4 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp. pepper
1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 tbsp. lemon juice
1/4 c. butter, melted
1/4 c. butter
1/4 c. all-purpose flour
1 3/4 c. milk
1/4 lb. ground cooked ham
1 c. (4 oz.) shredded Swiss cheese
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
Sprinkle roast with salt and pepper; place roast on a rack in a roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer into thickest part of roast, making sure it does not touch fat. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until thermometer registers 160 degrees. Remove roast from pan, reserving pan drippings. Slice roast; transfer slices to an 11 x 7 x 2 inch baking dish. Cover; keep warm.
Combine mushrooms and lemon juice; toss gently. Saute mushroom mixture in 1/4 cup melted butter in a skillet until tender; set aside. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat; add flour, stirring until smooth. Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly. Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened and bubbly. Add pan drippings, mushroom mixture, ham and cheese; stir well. Pour sauce over roast. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Serve with rice.
