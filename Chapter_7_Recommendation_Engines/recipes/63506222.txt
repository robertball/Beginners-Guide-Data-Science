Ingredients:
1/3 cup Morton Kosher Salt
1/2 cup White Sugar
1 quart Water

Directions:
Brine in glass or plastic, but not any type of metal.   Oven and turkey bags work well in kettles or coolers.
In large bowl, mix 1/3 cup salt, 1/2 cup sugar and 1 quart of water per pound of meat, but not to exceed 2 gallons of brine.
Refrigerate or pack with ice packs to keep the temperature at around 40 degrees.
Brine for 1 hour per pound, but not less than 30 minutes and for not more than 8 hours.
After brining, rinse in water and then set on a rack (set on a plate to catch drips) in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, but up to 24 hours.   This allows the skin to dry out resulting in a crisper, rather than mushy skin.
