Ingredients:
1 Bottle of Rancho Ponte Muscat Canelli
1/2 to 3/4 of Ginger Ale
2 oz. of Rancho Ponte Renegade Port
6-12 peaches (or a small bag of frozen peaches or also can use Peach Schnapps to add another kick)

Directions:
Add everything (except peaches) in a pitcher several hours before use.  If using fresh peaches, slice first, soak in the Sangria mixture for several hours in the refrigerator, then freeze the peaches overnight.  Keep Sangria in refrigerator until use.  When ready, drop the peaches (either fresh ones that have been frozen or just open the bag of frozen peaches and drop them in) and serve. I have a special pitcher that can be frozen first and it helps to keep the mixture cool.
