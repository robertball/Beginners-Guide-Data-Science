Brown Rice Pudding Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cups cooked brown rice (I try to cook with a little extra water to make sure it isn't dry, and a little salt.  This is about 1.5 cups dry rice)
4 cups milk (I used 2%, but any kind should be fine)
2/3 cup sugar (I used 1/3 white and 1/3 brown)
2.5 tbsp butter (a little more or less will be fine - don't worry about measuring exactly)
1.25 tsp vanilla extract
Dash of cinnamon, to taste
Dash of nutmeg, to taste (optional)
Zest of 1 lemon, or lemon zest to taste (optional)

Directions:
In a large saucepan, combine rice, milk, butter, sugar, and vanilla.  Heat on high to boiling, then reduce to low and simmer until almost thickened to desired pudding consistency.  Stir very regularly and scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to prevent the milk from burning.  Remove from heat when it is still slightly more liquid than you would like, because it will thicken more as it cools down.
Once pudding is nearly fully cooked, add desired cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon zest.  Be careful not to add too much nutmeg, only a little bit will do!
Serve warm or cold.  Garnish with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon.

Description: 
A good, egg-free rice pudding recipe.  Easy to make, but takes a while at the stove because you have to stir it regularly.  Adapted from Tyler Florence's recipe foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/rockin-rice-pudding-recipe.html.
