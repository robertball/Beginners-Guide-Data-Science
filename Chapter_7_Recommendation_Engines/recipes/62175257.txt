Ingredients:
1 (3-4 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
salt, black pepper, and paprika to taste
1/4 cup butter, divided
1 rib celery, leaves removed
1/2 medium onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Mix desired amount of salt, pepper, and paprika in a small bowl. Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season inside and out with salt, pepper and paprika mixture. Rub 2 tablespoons butter around in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity. Cut the half onion into quarters and place inside the chicken cavity.
Bake uncovered 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350 degrees and continue cooking for about another hour, until the chicken has a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving. (optional)
