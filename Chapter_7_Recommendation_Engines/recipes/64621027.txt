Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon kosher salt
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 chipotle chile en adobo, coarsely chopped, with 2 tablespoon sauce
1 pound ground turkey or 12 ounces soy crumbles
One 12-ounce IPA style based
One 15 1/2-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
One 14 1/2-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, with their juice

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the onion, garlic, salt, chili powder, and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the tomato paste and the chipotle chile and sauce; cook 1 minute more.
Add the turkey, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and cook until the meat loses its raw color, about 3 minutes.
Add the beer and simmer until reduced by about half, about 8 minutes.
Add the tomatoes--crushing them through your fingers into the skillet--along with their juices and the beans; bring to a boil.
Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 10 minutes.
Ladle the chili into bowls and serve with the garnishes of your choice.
