Description: 
We have made this recipe a Thanksgiving Day tradition in our family since my son was in kindergarten. Open the container and -- voila! -- you have homemade butter. Pour off the buttermilk (or drink it if you like)and place the butter in a serving dish. Great on dinner rolls. The little ones will be proud to have helped prepare the meal.
