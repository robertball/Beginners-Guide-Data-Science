Ingredients:
3/4 cup of butter softened
3/4 cup of brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tso vanilla extract
1 1/2 c flour
2 tsp baking  soda
2 tsp cornstarch
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp  salt
1/2 bag of chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 (325 for chewier  cookies)
Cream the butter and sugars together either with a wooden spoon or a hand mixer.
Add the vanilla and egg to the butter mixture and stir until combined.
Sift all of the dry ingredients in a seperate bowl then slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Add the chocolate chips. Stir until combined and the cookie dough has formed.
At this point I like to scoop cookie dough by the teaspoon and plop all of my unbaked cookies in the freezer for about  10-15 minutes prior to baking. You can also refrigerate the dough then scoop out cookie rounds and bake.
To bake cookies place rounds on parchment paper about 2 inches apart and bake in the preheated oven for about 8 minutes or until golden brown.
Tip: for  a  chewier  cookie bake just until edges are golden.
Tip: once cookie balls are formed I like to freeze mine for the rest of the week and bake them whenever I need a sweet fix.

Description: 
It took me 7 years and countless  batches of cookies to get this recipe just right  if you like your cookies made for dunking this is the recipe for you. These cookies  are crispy and thin. The cornstarch makes them round the cinnamon is optional but adds a flavor that I think makes them super special.
