Ingredients:
cooking spray
5 large Roma tomatoes, halved lengthwise
1/4 large white onion
1 jalapeno pepper, stem removed
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, juiced
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic salt, or to taste

Directions:
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high.
Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish with cooking spray. Arrange tomatoes in the prepared dish with cut sides down. Add onion and jalapeno.
Broil until tomato skins are blackened and blistered, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove onion and jalapeno halfway through cooking time, once skins are slightly softened.
Combine broiled vegetables in a blender; add cilantro, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon garlic salt. Pulse until smooth. Taste and season with remaining garlic salt as desired.

Description: 
It has taken me years to perfect this recipe. Los Cucos is my favorite TexMex restaurant in Houston, and I used to eat there every 2 weeks, just so I would order a pint of red salsa to go to take home with me. I was addicted to the stuff, it's the best salsa in the world. I finally mastered my own version, which tastes nearly identical to Los Cucos's red salsa.
