Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups white sugar
2 cups butter, at room temperature
2/3 cup milk
5 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
6 snack-size chocolate-covered wafer candy bars (such as Kit Kat速), coarsely chopped, or more to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
Frosting:
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup evaporated milk
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Combine 4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups softened butter, milk, eggs, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract to flour mixture; lightly stir with a spatula to moisten ingredients. Mix on low speed until batter is evenly combined, about 3 minutes.
Toss candy bar pieces with remaining 1 tablespoon flour in a bowl until coated; fold into batter. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out moist with crumbs clinging, about 1 hour. Cool in pan for 25 minutes; remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.
Combine 1/4 cup white sugar, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup butter, chocolate chips, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer until frosting is thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour frosting over cake.

Description: 
I always have tons of Halloween candy from my kids and this is a great way to use up Kit Kats速. I served this at Thanksgiving for those who didn't want pie. Everybody loved this cake. Frosting will be like a syrup but will thicken as it cools.
