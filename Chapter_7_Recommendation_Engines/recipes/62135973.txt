Chipotle Sauce/Dip Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain yogurt, or sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 Teaspoon Cumin
1/2 Teaspoon dried minced onion
1/2 Teaspoon liquid smoke (or to taste)
1 Tablespoon pureed chipotle
peppers in adobo sauce
Note: I usually take two or more 7oz cans of the peppers and puree them in the blender. I spoon the pureed pepper into plastic ice cube trays.  After they are frozen, put them into a freezer bag and use them as you need to. Each cube of pepper is about 1 Tablespoon and works perfectly in this recipe.
This is a great way to keep lemon and lime juice too. That way you can always have them available. Defrost a cube in the microwave for about 20 seconds and you have fresh juice.

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle peppers until smooth. Add other ingredients and stir to blend. Chill before serving. If using the dried onion allow time for it to soften, about an hour or so.

Description: 
This sauce is a wonderful blend of flavors with Chipotle Peppers and liquid smoke. A taste of this starts out mild but builds to a nice, slightly hot pepper flavor. A spoonful of this sauce tastes great on almost any kind of food.  I use it on meat, chicken, pork, salmon patties and Mexican dishes as well. It also works great as a dip for chips and vegetables.
