Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups sugar
2 eggs
3 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled
2-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup ground cinnamon
Icing:
1/4 cup butter, softened
3 to 4 cups icing sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 to 4 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in eggs and melted and cooled semisweet chocolate.  Combine flour and cinnamon; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.  Wrap dough in plastic wrap; refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface; roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness.  Cut with a floured 2-in. star-shaped cookie cutter.  Place 1 in. apart on un-greased baking sheets.  Chill and re-roll scraps if desired
Bake at 350 degrees for 9-11 minutes or until edges are firm; remove to wire racks.  In a large bowl, butter, icing sugar, vanilla and enough milk to reach spreading consistency.  Ice cooled cookies and immediately decorate with sprinkles; store in the refrigerator. Yield: about 5 dozen
