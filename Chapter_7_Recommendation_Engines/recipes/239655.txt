Ingredients:
PAM® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
2 pounds ground round beef (85% lean)
2 (8 ounce) cans Hunt's® Tomato Sauce-No Salt Added
1/2 cup Egg Beaters® Original
1 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup Hunt's® Tomato Ketchup
1 (1 ounce) stick part-skim mozzarella string cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line shallow baking pan with aluminum foil; spray foil with cooking spray.
Mix beef, tomato sauce, Egg Beaters, oats and soup mix in large bowl until well blended. Shape into 8 oval-shaped meatloaves, about 5x3 inches; place in prepared pan. Spread ketchup evenly over tops of meatloaves.
Bake 25 minutes or until meatloaves are cooked through (160 degrees F). Cut cheese stick into thin strips. Cut strips into 8 long pieces and 32 short pieces. Place 1 long piece and 4 short pieces on each meatloaf to resemble 'laces' on a football.
