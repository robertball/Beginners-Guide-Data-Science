Ingredients:
1 Cup Finely Chopped Dates
8 oz. Hot Water or Light Tea
1 tsp. Baking Soda
6 T. Butter
3/4 Cup Sugar
2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
4 Eggs
1-1/4 Cups Flour
2 tsp. Baking Powder
1 tsp. Mixed Spice (opt.) (1/2t. Cinnamon; 1/8t. of each Allspice, Cloves, Nutmeg, Ginger, & a pinch of Cardamom) Using this will taste more like a spice cake, not using it will taste more like dates. Both ways are great.
1/2 Cup Butter

3/4 to 1 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream

Directions:
Finely chop dates.
Add dates and baking soda to boiling water/tea for 10 minutes to soften dates.

Line the bottom of a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and grease and flour the sides. Pour batter into pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Cake is done when a toothpick come out clean.
While cake is cooking, in a saucepan, melt 1/2 c. butter and brown sugar together. Stirring till sugar is dissolved. Slowly stir in whipping cream until well blended.
While cake is still warm, gently poke holes all over with a fork. Pour sauce slowly all over cake.
Broil cake for a few minutes, till hot and bubbly. Serve warm with or without vanilla ice cream.
