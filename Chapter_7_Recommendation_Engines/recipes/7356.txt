Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 3/4 cups white sugar
5 eggs
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a large bowl, blend together the butter or margarine and the sugar.  Separate 3 of the eggs; add the yolks and the 2 remaining whole eggs to the butter mixture.  Stir in the vanilla and water.
In another bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour.  Add these dry ingredients to the creamed  mixture.
Whip 3 egg whites until they are foamy.  Add 1 tablespoon sugar.  Continue to whip the whites until they are stiff, but not dry. Fold whipped whites into batter.
Pour the batter into a greased 10 x 4 inch tube pan.  Wrap a large coin in foil, and place the coin in the batter.  Press the coin down; it should be completely hidden.  Sprinkle the nuts and seeds on top of the batter.
Bake the cake for about 70 minutes, or until done.  Cool on a wire rack.
