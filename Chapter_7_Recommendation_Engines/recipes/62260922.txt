Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup milk
Oil for deep-fat frying
Powder sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in applesauce and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk (the batter will be thick). In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F. Drop 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of batter a few at a time into hot oil. Turn with a slotted spoon and fry until golden, about 1 minute on each side. Drain on paper towels; roll in powder sugar after they are cool.
