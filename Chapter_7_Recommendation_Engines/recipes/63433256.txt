Ingredients:
4 Tablespoons vegetable oil
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas - cut into 1 inch strips
6 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper to taste
2 Tablespoons butter
1/2 onion-finely chopped
1/2 green bell pepper-finely chopped
1/2 jalapeno pepper-seeds removed (if desired)-finely minced
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (optional)
1/2 cup salsa or pico de gallo (optional)
1 cup shredded cheese (Mexican cheddar-jack blend or your choice)

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry tortilla strips in the skillet, stirring constantly, until they are crisp.  Remove and drain.  Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the oil out, and add 2 tablespoons of butter to melt.  Put the chopped vegetables into the skillet and saute until softened, about 7 min.  Lower the heat under the pan to low, and when the skillet has cooled a few minutes pour the eggs into the skillet with the vegetables.  Put salsa (if desired) and the tortilla strips on top of the egg mixture, and fold it all together gently until the eggs are almost set - about 5 min.  Turn the heat off and sprinkle cheese over top.  Fold mixture gently together one last time.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately with warm flour tortillas.

Description: 
This dish is a favorite for breakfast/brunch here in the Austin area.  I always thought it had queso - the creamy warm chili-cheese dip mixed into it, but the softened tortillas actually make it creamy.  I am so glad I figured out how to make it!!!Modified from: Migas II
