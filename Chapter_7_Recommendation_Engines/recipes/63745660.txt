Ingredients:
Pork chops:
Olive oil to coat frying pan
8 pork chops
2 cups coconut flour
1 cup milled flax seed
Seasonings (I use onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, sea salt, pepper, parsley, Italian seasoning, basil)
½ cup parmesan cheese
6 eggs
½ cup milk (I use almond milk)
Tomato Salad:
Tomatoes- I picked 3 kinds fresh from the garden…cluster tomatoes, roma tomatoes, and sunburst tomatoes.
Fresh basil leaves- from the garden (if you don’t have fresh you can use dry)
Fresh Oregano- from the garden (if you don’t have fresh you can use dry)
Wishbone Red Wine Vinaigrette
1/8 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Pork Chops:Prepare a frying pan by coating it with oil and heating on medium.
Mix eggs, milk, seasonings, and ½ of parmesan cheese.
Coat pork chops with coconut flour, and then put it into the egg mixture.
Next, mix remaining flour (there should be at least 1 cup), flax seed, seasonings, and the rest of the parmesan cheese.
Next bread pork chops in mixture.
Carefully place into hot frying pan.
After about 5 or 6 minutes carefully flip over.
Cook for about another 5 or 6 minutes, or until meat is cooked and coating is golden brown.
