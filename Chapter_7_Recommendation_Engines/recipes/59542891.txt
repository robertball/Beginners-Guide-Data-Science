Ingredients:
1 cup chopped fresh tomato
1/3 cup red wine vinegar
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ketchup
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil or dried.
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme or dried

Directions:
Place tomato, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, mustard, basil, and thyme in a small bowl. Mix thoroughly, cover, and refrigerate until serving.Remember if using fresh herbs they are stronger(I would cut back to a tsp. on the thyme if using fresh. Also best tasting if made in am or day before you plan to use it. Makes a great cole slaw dressing by adding Splenda to sweeten. Amount would vary accourding to your taste
