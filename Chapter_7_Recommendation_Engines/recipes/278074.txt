Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1 pint fresh raspberries
3/4 cup almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Cream sugar and butter together with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition, then add almond extract.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in another bowl. Whisk milk and sour cream together in a third bowl. Alternately add the dry ingredients and milk mixture to the batter, beginning and ending with the dry. Gently stir in raspberries and almonds. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 1 hour.
