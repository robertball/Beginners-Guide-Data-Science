Ingredients:
12 Black Mission figs, halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
6 ounces Burrata cheese, thickly sliced
6 (1/2 inch thick) slices Italian bread, toasted
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Place figs, skin-side down, on grill. Cook until figs start to swell and bubble, 2 to 4 minutes.
Whisk together balsamic vinegar and olive oil until completely combined, about 1 minute.
Place Burrata cheese on top of each piece of toast. Spread figs around bread and drizzle with balsamic vinegar mixture. Season with sea salt and black pepper to taste.
