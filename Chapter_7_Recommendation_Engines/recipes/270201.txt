Ingredients:
12  fresh chicken wing drumettes
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon butter
¼ cup honey
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).
Place chicken wings in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and garlic powder, tossing to coat.
Place wings in the air fryer basket. Set timer for 25 minutes and cook wings, shaking basket every 7 to 8 minutes. When timer ends, turn air fryer off and let wings stand in the basket for 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk honey, rice vinegar, and sriracha sauce into butter and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer sauce over medium-low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, whisking occasionally. Turn off heat and set aside; sauce will thicken as it cools.
Toss cooked wings and sauce together in a bowl. Reserve extra sauce to serve alongside wings.

Description: 
The perfect combination of spicy and sweet in every bite, with the ease of using an air fryer. Add more sriracha to suit your tastes. I like to serve the extra sauce on the side for dipping.
