Ingredients:
1 small head red cabbage (shredded)
5 scallions (diced)
1 pkg. Top Romen noodles, crumbled (Orential Flavor)
1/4 cup oil (little more)
4 Tlbs. seasoned rice vinegar
3 Tlbs. sugar
small pkg. slivered almonds (toasted)

Directions:
Put shredded cabbage in large bowl. Add the crumbled Top Romen noodles, and the seasoning mix that comes with the noodles. Add all other ingredients and mix well. Cover and refridgerate overnight so all flavors combine. I put it in a large covered container and give it a good shake, mixing it a  couple times when I am passing by the fridge.
