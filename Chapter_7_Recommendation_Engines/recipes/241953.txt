Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into large chunks
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 red bell pepper, chopped small
2 shallots, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
3/4 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 lemons, zested and juiced
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
20 Kalamata olives, pitted and sliced

Directions:
Process cauliflower in batches by pulsing in a food processor until it has the consistency of rice.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute red bell pepper in hot oil until hot, about 2 minutes; add shallots and garlic and saute until soft, about 2 minutes. Stir cauliflower with the vegetables in the skillet; cook and stir until the cauliflower is hot, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour chicken broth over the cauliflower mixture; season with salt and thyme. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Stir lemon zest and lemon juice into the mixture; continue cooking until the lemon flavor penetrates the cauliflower, about 2 minutes more.
Remove skillet from heat, add olives and parsley, and toss to mix.

I discovered this recipe when my husband and I decided to decided to begin living a more paleo lifestyle. This recipe replaces rice in all of my newly adapted recipes and is a phenomenal stand alone recipe!
