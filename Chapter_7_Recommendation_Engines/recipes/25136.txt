Description: 
This is the fast and easy chop suey recipe that my mother always made, and we love it 'as is',  but you could substitute a can of Chinese mixed vegetables for the bean sprouts if you like more color and texture. Serve over hot rice, topped with chow mein noodles and soy sauce, if desired.
