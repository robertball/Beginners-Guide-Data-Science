zest of one lemon

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
In a blender, blend all the ingredients and pour into a prepared caramelized pudding mold and bake it in a Water-bath for 60 minutes or until flan has set.  Let it cool completely before turning it over into a plate or platter.  Serve chilled.
