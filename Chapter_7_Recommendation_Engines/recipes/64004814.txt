Simple hot fudge Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips or finely chopped semisweet chocolate
1 cup heavy whipping cream(I used milk)

Directions:
Place all the ingredients in a medium, microwave-proof bowl.  Microwave on high for 2 minutes, stopping to stir every 30 seconds.  At first, it seems like the cream and chocolate will not combine completely, but if you keep melting and stirring, it will come together into a thick, creamy sauce!  If you do not have a microwave,  you can just place all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and heat on medium-low heat until it combines, whisking constantly.
