Ingredients:
1 cup flour
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups panko breadcrumbs
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves,
Salt and freshly ground pepper
½ cup olive oil
6 Tablespoons butter
2 Tablespoons capers
2 Tablespoons lemon juice + A few slices of lemon
1 tablespoon chopped parsley

Directions:
1. Place the flour, eggs, and panko in three separate shallow bowls.
2. Butterfly the chicken so each piece is half as thick as it was to begin with. Lay the chicken out on a cutting board, cover with wax paper, then use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound it to a ¼ inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3. Heat half of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dredge the chicken breasts in flour, shake off the excess, then dip in the eggs, and coat with breadcrumbs. Add half the dredged chicken breasts to the skillet and fry for 3-5 minutes or a side or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove to a plate.
Add the other half of the oil to the skillet and repeat with remaining chicken breast.
4. When the chicken has been removed, add the butter to the skillet and use a spatula to scrape up any brown bits (that's where the flavor is!). Let the butter cook until sizzling and just starting to brown. Stir in the capers, lemon juice, and lemon slices.
5. To serve, plate the chicken then spoon the lemon butter sauce over top. Top with lemon slices and fresh parsley.
