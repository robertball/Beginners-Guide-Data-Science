Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes
1 onion
1 green pepper
salt to taste
pepper to taste
2 tsp garlic powder
Butter or margarine
Aluminum foil

Directions:
Wash and sliced your potatoes fairly thick.  Do not peel.  Cut up your onion.  You can either dice it or slice, your preference.  Slice pepper into long strips. (also your preference) Take a piece of foil about 18 inches in length and smear about 1/2 tbs of butter or margarine on the dull side.  You can also use cooking spray if you would rather.  Add 2 of your sliced potatoes, 1/3 or the onion and pepper, salt & pepper to taste and 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Close your foil, making it into a leak proof pouch (almost leak proof that is).  Now place on grill and allow to cook for around 20-30 minutes.  Potatoes will come out just right with great seasoning.  This recipe will make 3 potato pouches which should feed 6 people.
