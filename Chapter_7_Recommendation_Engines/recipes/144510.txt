Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
1/4 cup lime juice
1/2 cup tequila
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and cayenne pepper into a mixing bowl. Whisk in the liquid smoke, lime juice, tequila, vegetable oil, and cilantro until evenly blended.
To use the marinade, pour into a resealable plastic bag, and add 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of meat. Squeeze out the excess air, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours before cooking as desired. Grilling over charcoal is best, but a gas grill will do fine as well.
