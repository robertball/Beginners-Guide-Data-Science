Ingredients:
3 Lemons
4 oranges
8 cups of cold water (divided)
Stevia to taste
Water to boil with
Stevia may be replaced with regular sugar (Directions in notes)

Directions:
In a large pot, bring enough water that will cover the oranges and lemon to a boil. (About five minutes)
Continue to boil for five additional minutes)
Turn off the fire and allow to sit for five minutes. (Boiling it allows you to get more juice out of the fruit.)
Prepare your pitcher with four cups of cold water.
Remove one at a time, carefully. And cut in half and squeeze the juice out of all of them into the pitcher. (Do not remove all of them at a time as you are cutting them. You want them to sit in the hot water as you squeeze the one you have out)
Add three to four more cups of cold water and sweeten to taste. If you are diabetic, I recommend Stevia. Other artificial sweeteners are not recommended while you are pregnant or sick since they contain aspartame. If you are not diabetic and would prefer sugar, read the "Notes" section for directions
Add ice or refrigerate.
Sip to alleviate nausea.
This will keep in a refrigerator for about 5 day's.

Description: 
If you are pregnant, have a stomach virus that is making you hug the porcelain throne, or have little ones who feel yucky, this is the best anti-nausea drink you will ever come across. I am currently pregnant and diabetic, and this has helped me so much!
