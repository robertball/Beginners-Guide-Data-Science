Ingredients:
2 cups cooked chopped chicken
2 cans refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 regular can cream of chicken soup
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups reduced fat milk (more of less if needed)
pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Unroll the crescent roll dough into individual triangles. Place 2 tablespoons chicken and a pinch of cheddar cheese in each triangle and fold up edges to form a pocket or ball.
Place the pockets in an ungreased 9 by 13 inch baking dish.
Bake pockets uncovered in preheated oven for about 8 minutes or just until they start to get golden on the top.
Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the soup, milk, and remaining cheese over medium low until all cheese is melted and sauce is creamy.
Add more milk if sauce is too thick.
Once the pockets have slightly browned, pull out of oven and top with sauce.
Return to oven for another 10-15 minutes or until bubbly.
Allow to cool for 2-4 minutes before serving.
