Description: 
I was forced to create these when my favorite brand stopped making their lamb meatballs, which were a staple in my little food-obsessed world. They're even more scrumptious with a small side of plain yogurt with some mint and cumin stirred into it. Add rice or couscous and a green salad and you have a tasty, easy, somewhat elegant dinner! This recipe can also be used to make meatballs for frying, if you prefer.
