Description: 
These are so moist and chocolaty. A recipe passed down from my mother-in-law who passed away 10 years ago.  The first time I made these my husband and I cried as he said, 'This is my mom!' So to honor a special woman whose 5 food groups were chocolate chip cookies, chocolate cake, brownies, chocolate candy, and chocolate ice cream, I give you the ultimate brownie recipe!
