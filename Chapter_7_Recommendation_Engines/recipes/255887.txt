Ingredients:
3/4 cup pecan halves
1 teaspoon butter
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup, or more to taste
2 pinches salt

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat; add pecans and lower heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly, until pecans are lightly crisp and turn a darker brown, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from stove and slightly cool pecans.
Mix butter into warm pecans and toss to coat. Turn heat to medium; add maple syrup and stir pecans with a heat-proof or wooden spoon until syrup begins to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat down to low and continue stirring pecans until syrup begins to caramelize onto the pecans, about 5 minutes more. Remove skillet from heat, sprinkle salt over pecans, and stir.
