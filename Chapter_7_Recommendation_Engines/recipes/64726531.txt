Description: 
Not overly sweet, and big on flavor.  Lots of tart cranberries and sweet orange juice/zest kick the flavor up.  Best when made with fresh cranberries, fresh orange juice and lots of pulp!  My family loves them without the glaze, but some of my sweet -toothed friends prefer it with, as the muffins are only slightly sweet on their own.
