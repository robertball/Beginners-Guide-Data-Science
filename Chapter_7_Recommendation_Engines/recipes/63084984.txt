Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage
1 cup quick-cooking rice, cooked and cooled
1 pound lean ground beef (90% lean)
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed tomato soup, undiluted, divided
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Cook cabbage in boiling water only until leaves fall off head. Reserve 14-16 large leaves for rolls and set aside remaining cabbage.
In a bowl, combine rice, beef, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and 1/4 cup soup. Put 2 to 3 tablespoons meat mixture on each cabbage leaf. Fold in sides, starting at an unfolded edge, roll up leaf completely to enclose meat. Repeat with remaining meat and leaves.
Line a Dutch oven or large poy with leftover cabbage. Combine remaining soup and water; pour over cabbage. Stack cabbage rolls on top of sauce. Cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer on low for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until rolls are tender.
Remove rolls and cabbage. If desired, sauce may be thickened by boiling over high heat. Spoon sauce over rolls and cabbage and serve immediately.
