Description: 
These delicious, easy-to-make bars are sweet and tangy with an oatmeal crust and crumble. I prefer a thicker crust, using 3/4 of the oatmeal mixture for the crust and 1/4 for the crumbles. Feel free to make a thinner crust, using 1/2 of the oatmeal mixture for the crust and the other 1/2 for the crumble.
