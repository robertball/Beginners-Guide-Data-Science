Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white rice
3 cups water
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
5 tablespoons peanut butter
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
2 teaspoons ground ginger, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir coconut milk and peanut butter together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the peanut butter melts and the mixture is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chickpeas, ginger, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the chickpeas are tender, about 10 minutes. Add tomatoes; continue cooking until the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Serve with the rice.

Description: 
Quick to make and very filling! This is vegan-friendly and can be also be made gluten-free. I love the combination of peanut butter and coconut milk. You can easily double this recipe to make a larger quantity. For potlucks, I spread the cooked rice in a casserole dish and layer the curry on top.
