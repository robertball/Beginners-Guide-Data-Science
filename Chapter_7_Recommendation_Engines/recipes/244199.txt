Description: 
I wondered what would happen if I did a skewer-less kebab using the same ingredients that would typically go into a hotdog. This meaty mash-up came about thanks to some lamb kebab experiments. The firm texture of the kebab reminded me of a hot dog's 'snap.' The taste is actually closer to a bratwurst.
