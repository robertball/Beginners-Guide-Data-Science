Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) beef brisket
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup beef broth
1 cup ketchup
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup cider vinegar
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup cold water
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Sprinkle brisket with seasoned salt and black pepper.
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear brisket in hot oil until browned on both sides. Transfer brisket to a large plate. Cook and stir onions and garlic in the Dutch oven until vegetables are softened, about 6 minutes. Return brisket to the Dutch oven.
Whisk beef broth, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, chili powder, bay leaves, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; drizzle broth mixture over brisket.
Bring beef mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer until beef is very tender and easily falls apart when pulled with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove and discard bay leaves. Transfer beef to a platter, reserving liquid in the Dutch oven. Slice beef.
Whisk water and flour together in a small bowl; stir into the Dutch oven and bring to a boil until sauce is thickened. Serve sauce over sliced brisket.
