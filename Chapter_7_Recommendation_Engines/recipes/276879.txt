Ingredients:
8 tablespoons goose fat
2 small onions, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups goose giblets
2 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
salt to taste
3/4 cup beef stock
7 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste
7 tablespoons heavy cream

Directions:
Heat goose fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in the hot fat until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle giblets with paprika, caraway, and salt; add to the saucepan. Fry until giblets are browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour in stock and reduce heat to low. Simmer until giblets are soft, about 20 minutes more. Stir in sour cream and heavy cream; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
