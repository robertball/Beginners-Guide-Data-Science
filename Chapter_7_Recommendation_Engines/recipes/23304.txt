Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons dried basil
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried tarragon
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1 cup shredded provolone cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 green bell peppers
1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a saucepan bring 2 cups water to a boil.  Add rice and stir.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute onions, garlic, celery, salt, pepper, parsley, basil, oregano and tarragon until onions are tender.  Stir in cooked rice and tomatoes.  Transfer to a medium bowl.
In a small bowl combine Provolone and parmesan cheeses.  Stir 3/4 of cheese mixture into rice mixture.
Slice tops off of peppers and remove the seeds.  Fill peppers with rice mixture and place in a shallow baking dish.  Pour tomato sauce over peppers and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.  Remove foil and bake until cheese is golden and bubbly.
