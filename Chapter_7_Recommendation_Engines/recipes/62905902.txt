Ingredients:
2T butter
1/4 cup of whatever your "of" is, finely chopped
1/4 cup flour
1/2 cup stock or broth, chicken, veg, beef,  (whatever     works best with the soup type you're making)
1/2 cup milk(lowfat is okay)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In small saucepan, put butter and the "of" ingredient and cook until soft, not just tender.(if using chicken, just make sure it's cooked through)
Add flour and stir together.
Slowly add stock while stirring or whisking to avoid lumps.
Bring to a boil and cook a few minutes until thickened.
Add milk and salt and pepper and stir until combined and thick. Add more broth if soup is too thick for your recipe.
