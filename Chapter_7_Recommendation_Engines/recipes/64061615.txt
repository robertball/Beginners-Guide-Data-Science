Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 ounces egg noodles
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 cup crumbled buttery round crackers
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Poach chicken in a large pot of simmering water. Cook until no longer pink in center, about 12 minutes. Remove from pot and set aside. Bring chicken cooking water to a boil and cook pasta in it. Drain. Cut chicken into small pieces, and mix with noodles.
In a separate bowl, mix together mushroom soup, chicken soup, and sour cream.  Season with salt and pepper. Gently stir together cream soup mixture with the chicken mixture. Place in a 2 quart baking dish.
Melt butter in a small saucepan, and remove from heat. Stir in crumbled crackers. Top casserole with the buttery crackers.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, until heated through and browned on top.
**MY CHANGES:  I sauteed 1/2 chopped onion, 2 stalks chopped celery, 1 tsp chopped garlic in butter, and sprinkled liberally (1/2-3/4 tsp?) poultry seasoning and 1/4 tsp celery salt. Only other change was to add about 1/4 Cup milk to soup/sour cream mixture and used rotisserie chicken. Hubby loved it and so did I!**
