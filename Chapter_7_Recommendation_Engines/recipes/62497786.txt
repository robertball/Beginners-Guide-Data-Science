Ingredients:
For the meatballs
1 Lb very lean ground beef
1 T Kosher salt
1 T Onion powder
1 T Garlic powder
1 tsp. oregano (preferably Mexican Oregano)
1/2 tsp Cumin
1 T Flour
1/4 Cup White Rice
1 Egg
For the soup:
4 cans beef broth (total 58 oz)
2 quarts water
2 cans tomato sauce - 8 oz each
3 carrots - peeled and sliced
2 zucchini - halved and sliced
3 - 5 red or white potatoes - diced - skins on
2 stalks celery - diced
1 small cabbage - cut into large pieces

Directions:
In a mixing bowl combine hamburger, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, flour, rice and egg.  Mix throughly.
Roll into small balls, about 1/2 inch in the palms of your hands and set aside.
Bring broth and water to a boil.  Add meatballs and reduce heat to a medium simmer.  Simmer meatball for 15 minutes.
Skim off any fat that has surfaced - if you used very lean meat this won't be needed.
Add tomato sauce and sliced carrots and potatoes. Simmer 15 minutes
Add sliced zucchini and celery & cook for 15 minutes.
Add cabbage - continue to cook for 30 - 45 minutes.
