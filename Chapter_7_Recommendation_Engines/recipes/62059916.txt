Put cheese and milk in the top of a double boiler over hot but not boiling water.  Melt the cheese gradually, don't let the water come to a boil, stir often, until the cheese is melted and blended with the milk.
Thoroughly drain the spinach before using.
Stir the spinach, red pepper, onions and tomatoes into the cheese.  Stir well.  If you are adding peppers, now is the time.
Cook with a cover on for about 15 minutes.  Make sure the water remains at a simmer not a boil.

Buen Provecho!

Description: 
This creamy dip is excellent with fresh vegetables or with freshly made flour tortilla chips.  If you have a taste for something a bit spicier add some finely minced jalapeno, serrano or habanero chilis.  Delicious!
