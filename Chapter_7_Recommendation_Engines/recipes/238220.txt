1 (3 pound) beef brisket, trimmed

3 bay leaves, or more to taste
24 ounces chicken stock
1 head cabbage, cored and cut into 8 wedges

Place brisket in the crock of a slow cooker. Pour beef stock over brisket.
Place pickling spices, garlic, and bay leaves into a cheesecloth bag, tie the bag, and submerge it into the stock.
Cook on Low for 8 hours.
Remove brisket to a cutting board; cut into small pieces.
Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard spices and any strained pieces.
Combine brisket, chicken stock, strained beef stock, and cabbage in the slow cooker crock.
Cook on Low until cabbage is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.

Description: 
This recipe requires a bit of time, but it is worth the effort. Serve with marbled rye bread. Adding peeled whole red potatoes adds an additional texture and flavor. The stock combination will be a little salty; adding water can reduce this.
