Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) vegan pie crust
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, diced
1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, diced
4 cups chopped kale
1 medium red onion, diced
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, diced
3 tablespoons dry vegan egg replacer
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, kale, and onion; saute until leaves are wilted and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Combine tofu, egg replacer, Dijon mustard, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, onion powder, garlic powder, turmeric, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl and fold in kale mixture.
Pour mixture into the pie crust and level the top with a spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is firm and top is golden, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
