Ingredients:
1 box of pasta, any type you enjoy
1 package frozen broccoli (or any frozen veggies you like)
2 tbsp butter
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded thin if desired
1 tbsp coarse seasoned salt
1 can Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup
1/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup shredded Italian cheese blend (or any blend of cheese you enjoy)
1 tbsp minced garlic (about 3 fresh cloves)
1/4 tsp dried oregano
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
In a pot, boil the water for the pasta. Cook the pasta, adding two minutes to the cook time. In the last 6 minutes add the broccoli, turning the burner to high to make sure it comes to a boil.
Meanwhile, rinse and dry your raw chicken. Dice and coat with seasoned salt. Let sit for a few minutes. Heat the butter in a big fry pan. Cook your chicken in the butter. Add the rest of the ingredients to the fry pan and bring to a simmer. Drain your pasta and broccoli well, and add to the fry pan. Stir, and serve with crusty bread.

Description: 
This is an easy, tastey version of an alfredo sauce. It started out as the original Campbell's recipe, but I added several things, and lessened the amount of others. I think it's great because it uses things that people normally have around the house, without having to go out and buy things like heavy cream and a ton of parm cheese.
