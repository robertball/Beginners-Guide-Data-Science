Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Directions:
Season chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sear until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain most of the excess grease from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons behind.
Arrange chicken thighs skin-side down in the pan. Place crushed garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, vinegar, and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until sauce reduces down and thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes.
