Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 to 2 cups chicken broth
1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
Salt to taste
OPTIONAL TOPPINGS
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut√©, stirring occasionally for about 3 minutes until onion softens. Increase heat to medium-high, add ground turkey and stir, breaking up large pieces with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the chili power, black pepper, and cumin; stir and continue to break up the meat to incorporate the spices. Allow mixture to cook for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the black beans, pinto beans, tomatoes, 1 cup of chicken broth, and corn. Taste and add salt if needed. Continue to cook for 5 to 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more broth if the chili is too thick. To serve, ladle chili into bowls. If desired, top with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese.

Description: 
from Family Fun magazine, tried & true. Using ground turkey instead of the traditional beef allows for much less cooking time, so instead of hours on the stove you are ready to go in under 30 minutes. Tip: This version is a bit mild. If you want a little more kick, just add some extra chili powder.
