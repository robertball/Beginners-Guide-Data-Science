Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, cleaned and cut into florets (5-6 cups florets)
1/4 cup whole sage leaves
1/4 cup pine nuts
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons honey, warmed slightly
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400ยบ F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the cauliflower florets, sage leaves, and the pine nuts in a large bowl. Set aside.
In a small container, whisk together the olive oil and the honey. Stir in the minced garlic and the salt. Pour the mixed dressing over the cauliflower and toss to coat the florets, pine nuts, and the safe leaves evenly.
Spread the cauliflower mixture onto the parchment-lined baking sheet in a single, even layer. Bake for 30-35 minutes, stirring once about 20 minutes in.
Remove the pan from the oven and serve immediately.
