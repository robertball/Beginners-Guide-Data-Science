Ingredients:
2 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken), cut into 3-inch segments
4 cups water
6 tablespoons soy sauce
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, sliced
1 tablespoon rice wine
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 carrots, cut into chunks
2 small potatoes, cut into chunks
1/2 cup fresh shiitake mushrooms, sliced
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
6 chestnuts, peeled (optional)
6 dates, pitted (optional)
sliced green onion

Directions:
Cover the ribs with cold water, refrigerate, and soak for 1 hour. Drain the ribs, place in a saucepan with 4 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Cook the ribs for 10 minutes, drain, and reserve 2 cups of liquid. Place the ribs and the reserved liquid in a large pot.
Mix together the soy sauce, garlic, onion, rice wine, and brown sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ribs and broth. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours.
Mix in the carrots, potatoes, shiitake mushrooms, corn syrup, sesame oil, chestnuts, and dates, and simmer until the meat and vegetables are very tender, about 1 more hour.
Remove the beef and vegetables to a serving dish, and reduce the liquid in the pot to make a thickened gravy. Pour the sauce over the ribs and vegetables, sprinkle with sliced green onion, and serve.

Description: 
This is the ultimate Korean comfort food. Sugar, corn syrup, and soy sauce can be adjusted to taste. The trick to tender ribs is a looong cooking time. Feel free to let it stew longer. Some versions in Korea also add chestnuts or dates to the stew.
