Ingredients:
12 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil , divided
3 pounds cherry tomatoes, halved
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 slices day old Italian bread, grated
1 1/4 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
1 bunch fresh basil, torn into small pieces
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drizzle a baking sheet with 3 tablespoons olive oil.
Arrange cherry tomatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle with 4 tablespoons olive oil.
Combine grated bread, Pecorino Romano cheese, basil, parsley, garlic, and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Distribute mixture on top of the cherry tomatoes in the baking sheet and drizzle with remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are soft and topping is lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Divide pasta between 4 plates and top with cherry tomato and toasted bread crumb mixture.
