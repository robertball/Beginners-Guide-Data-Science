Ingredients:
2 1/4 pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces
1 pound cubed beef stew meat
2 onions
3 leeks, chopped
1 pinch sea salt and ground white pepper to taste

Directions:
Wash oxtails to remove any bone fragments and place in a large bowl. Cover oxtails with cold water and weigh down with a plate to keep them submerged. Place in the refrigerator for 12 hours, changing the water 3 or 4 times. Drain.
Combine drained oxtails and stew meat in a large pot with fresh water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse meat. Return parboiled meat to the large pot and add onions and water to cover, approximately 3 times the volume of meat. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 hours. Reduce to a low simmer and cook 3 hours more.
Skim fat and onions from the top of the soup. Place soup in the refrigerator to cool until you can skim additional fat from the surface, about 2 hours.
Reheat soup over medium heat until hot, about 5 minutes. Season soup with leeks, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
Many Korean people believe oxtails have lots of calcium and are very good for improving our physical strength.
 Oxtail soup doesn't need many side dishes, so many Korean moms prefer to cook oxtail soup before going on a long trip.
 When I was a child, oxtail soup was a special dish.
