Ingredients:
10 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/4 cup prepared mustard
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup grated onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water
10 pineapple rings

Directions:
Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, flour, oregano, 2 teaspoons salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat; dredge chicken in bread crumb mixture and brown in skillet, about 3 to 4 minutes each side. Layer chicken in 2 lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dishes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large saucepan over low heat, combine the brown sugar, mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion, 1/2 teaspoon salt and water. Bring to a boil, and pour over chicken. Cover baking dishes with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Top each piece with a pineapple ring, and serve.
