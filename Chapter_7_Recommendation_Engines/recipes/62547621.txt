Ingredients:
Peanut butter of choice (I prefer creamy)
Ritz-type snack crackers
Almond bark (I prefer chocolate) OR
Butterscotch chips

Directions:
Assemble cracker "sandwiches" with a peanut butter filling.  If a truly sweet cracker is desired, add a little confectioners sugar to the peanut butter (I don't add the sugar).  When the desired number of "sandwiches" have been put together, melt a small amount (3-4 cubes) of almond bark in the microwave.  Dip the sandwiches in the melted almond bard to cover, then place on waxed paper to dry.  Butterscotch chips may also be used.
