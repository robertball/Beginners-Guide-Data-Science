Ingredients:
2x habaneros - no veins, no seeds
6x jalepenos - no veins, no seeds
2 lbs strawberries
1 yellow bell pepper
1 orange bell pepper
1 red bell pepper
1 lemon's worth of lemon juice
3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tsp cayenne pepper powder  (optional)
4 tbps (1/8 cup) balsamic vinegar  (optional)
1 cup fresh pineapple  (optional)
1/2 jar (~7 tbps, 2.3 oz) Ball Realfruit instant pectin powder or Sure-Jell pectin powder
7 cups sugar

Directions:
Yields just over 4 pints, 4 16 oz ball jars or 8 8 oz ball jars.
***Use gloves when dealing with hot peppers***
***Read last step first***  ;)
Combine all ingredients except the pectin and sugar in food processor or blender.  You might have to do half at a time.  Blend until smooth.
Put that mixture into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce to simmer for 10 minutes.
At this point, try the mixture with a spoon.  Test for heat.  Add more cayenne if you want it hotter.  Some jalepenos are hotter than others.  Keep in mind, you're about to dilute the heat factor by 7 cups of sugar so use your best judgement.
Slowly stir in dry pectin and boil for 1-2 minutes.  This will activate the pectin.  Be sure to do this step before you add sugar!  When using the liquid pectin, add sugar first.  The two pectins activate differently.
Add sugar.  Bring back to boil then to a simmer for 2 minutes while stirring to ensure sugar is dissolved.
Pour jam into preheated mason jars to prevent cracking.  I've never preheated and haven't had a problem, but it is suggest to use the prehead method.  Leave about 1/4 inch from the top and wipe any jam from side of rim before sealing jars.
To ensure long shelf life, place the hot sealed jars into a large pot of boiling water and boil for 10 minutes.  You want water to rise to just below the rim of the jars.  Beforehand, you can place the jars into a pot and begin filling up to check for water displacement so you know you have the right amount of water.
