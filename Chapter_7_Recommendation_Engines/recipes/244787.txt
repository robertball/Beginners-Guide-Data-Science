6 large marshmallows, or more to taste
1 (1.2 ounce) package chocolate candy bar, broken into pieces

Arrange marshmallows in a small non-stick pan, adding more if needed to cover the bottom. Layer chocolate pieces on top of marshmallows.
Cover pan and place over medium heat on the camp stove; cook until melted, trying not to stir the mixture. Scoop onto a graham cracker half and top with another graham cracker.

Description: 
We always have s'mores when camping...even when there is a burn ban. Using our camping stove and a small pan with a lid, we melt the marshmallows (we use a vegan brand that work well) and chocolate, and then scoop the results onto the graham crackers.
