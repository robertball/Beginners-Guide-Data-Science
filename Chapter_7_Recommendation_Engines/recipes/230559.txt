Ingredients:
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 (16 ounce) jar peanut butter
1 cup crispy rice cereal (such as Rice KrispiesÂ®)
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (6 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips, or as needed
2 tablespoons vegetable shortening
50 toothpicks

Directions:
Mix confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, rice cereal, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using your hands until dough is firm. Roll dough into balls about 3/4 inch in diameter. Arrange on a plate and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
Melt chocolate chips and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.
Place a toothpick into each peanut butter ball; dip 3/4 of each peanut butter ball into the melted chocolate. Return the buckeyes to the plate and refrigerate until chocolate has hardened, 1 hour.

Description: 
A peanut butter candy with a chocolate coating. They look like buckeyes! This is a fun recipe to make with the kids. They love to mix it up and get their hands in the peanut butter, rolling the balls, and especially dipping it into the chocolate!
