Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-cup Bundt pan.

Measure 1 1/2 cups Lactaid(R) milk in a 2-cup measuring cup. Stir in lemon juice and cream of tartar.
Mix cottage cheese, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and 1/3 cup brown sugar together in a stand mixer. Whip until mixture is smooth and creamy. Add non-dairy butter or margarine and whip until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well before adding the next one. Mix in vanilla and maple extracts and salt. Mix in 2 cups flour.
Pour milk mixture into the mixer; mix well. Add remaining 2 cups flour and baking powder; blend well.
Pour 1/3 of batter in prepared Bundt pan. Top with 1/2 of the swirl mixture.
Pour another 1/3 of the batter over the filling. Top with remaining swirl mixture. Evenly pour in remaining batter.
Gently swirl the batter with a knife being careful not to overdo the swirl. Top the batter with the cinnamon topping.
