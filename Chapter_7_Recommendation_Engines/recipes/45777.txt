Ingredients:
1 quart oil for frying
4 teaspoons mayonnaise
4 slices white bread
4 slices Cheddar cheese
1 cup milk
2 eggs
2 cups dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Spread one teaspoon of mayonnaise onto each slice of bread. Place 2 pieces of cheese onto one slice of bread, then top with the other side of bread. The mayonnaise should be on the inside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Place the bread crumbs into another dish. Dip each sandwich into the egg mixture, then coat with bread crumbs.
One at a time, immerse the sandwiches in the preheated oil. Fry until the cheese is melted, and the crust is golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat with the other sandwich. Place on paper towel to absorb excess oil before serving.
