Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken, bell pepper, spinach, and green onion and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Not having eaten kelp noodles before, I basically followed one of the recipes on the back of the package of noodles, but before it was nearly complete, I gave it a taste and found it to be bland. I quickly decided to change the flavor direction of the dish, from Japanese, to Southeast Asian, by incorporating a few additional spices. What resulted turned out to be a bold success!
