Ingredients:
1/2 cup Peanut Butter
1 Tbsp Honey, Maple Syrup, OR 1 packet Sweetener
1 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 pinch Salt
1 Tbsp Coconut Flour
1-2 Tbsp Chocolate Chips

Directions:
Mix the peanut butter, honey, vanilla and salt together until smooth. Next, add the coconut flour and stir. Roll into bite size balls and then roll them into the chocolate chips (do this so you can use less chocolate chips and still see them on the outside). Place in a airtight container in the freezer for up to a month.

Description: 
I eat these when I have cravings because the peanut butter and chocolate really are very satisfying, plus these are much healthier than storebought energy bars!
