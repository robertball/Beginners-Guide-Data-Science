Ingredients:
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
6 links pork sausage (such as Isernio'sÂ®)
2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick half-rounds
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 orange bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips
1 medium zucchini, sliced 1/4-inch thick
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook sausage in the hot oil until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Set aside.
Place potatoes, onion, bell peppers, zucchini, and oregano in a large bowl. Drizzle generously with remaining 5 tablespoons oil and season well with salt and pepper. Mix well. Place browned sausages and vegetable mixture on a large rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan, uncovered.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned, about 50 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper.
