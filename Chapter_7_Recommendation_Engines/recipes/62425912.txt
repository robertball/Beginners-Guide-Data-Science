Ingredients:
12 oz bottle of your favorite Lager warmed but not hot.
3 1/2 to 5 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon yeast
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place all ingredients into the bread machine as per your manufacturers directions but RESERVE 1 and 1/2 cups of the flour.
Choose dough setting.
Allow dough to mix and add the reserved flour a little at a time if needed.  Dough is just right when it begins to pull away from sides of pan and mixes with ease.  You might not need all of the remaining flour.
Once dough is ready, place on lightly oiled work surface.
Knead dough to deflate.
Divide dough in half.
Shape 2 loaves by rolling each piece into an 8x 10 rectangle.  Roll at long end tightly.  Repeat with second piece of dough.
Place dough on parchment lined baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal.
Let rise until doubled in a warm, draft free place.  Approximately 30 to 45 minutes.
Just prior to baking, slice open the dough across the surface so the dough can expand while baking.
Bake in a 400 degree oven for 25 to 35 minutes.  Until dough is well browned and the dough sounds hollow when tapped.  Internal temperature should reach 200 degrees.
Cool on wire rack before slicing.
