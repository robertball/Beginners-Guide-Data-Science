Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 1/2 cups half-and-half cream
1 cup heavy whipping cream
4 cups cubed cooked chicken
3 (4 ounce) cans mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 (4 ounce) jar sliced pimentos, drained
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook spaghetti according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, melt butter. Stir in flour, salt and pepper until smooth. Gradually add the broth, half-and-half and whipping cream. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat. Stir in the chicken, mushrooms and pimientos. Drain spaghetti; add to the chicken mixture and toss to coat.
Transfer to two greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dishes.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover and freeze one casserole for up to 2 months. Bake the second casserole, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until heated through.
