Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups rolled oats
3 cups chopped mixed nuts
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup peanut butter chips
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup honey
1 cup natural peanut butter
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper and grease.
Place 3/4 cup oats in a blender; blend to make oat flour. Combine oat flour, remaining oats, nuts, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl.
Mix honey, peanut butter, butter, water, and olive oil together in a separate bowl; stir into oat mixture until well coated. Press firmly across the baking sheet and into the corners.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature before cutting into bars.

Description: 
Almost a dessert but not quite and loaded with nutrients and protein. Use organic honey, butter, etc. and you have an amazing natural treat. My favorite is to heat in a bowl and add milk like a super decadent pudding cake.
