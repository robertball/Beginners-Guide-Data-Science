Ingredients:
1 10" pie crust, prebaked in springform pan
4 eggs
2 cups milk
2 T cornstarch
1 cup potatoes, peeled and chopped
4 cups mushrooms, sliced and microwaved to separate from its juices.
Mushroom juice retained in a cup
10 cloves garlic, any style, or caramelized together with the 1 large yellow onion, below.
1 large yellow onion, caramelized
4 cups fresh spinach, chopped
2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
3/4 cup diced aged extra sharp white cheddar
1 tsp White pepper, ground
1/2 tsp ground mustard powder

Directions:
Spread out potato pieces onto bottom of pre-baked pie shell.
Toss spinach with nutmeg and spread out on top of potato layer.
Layer mushrooms over spinach, and top with onions and garlic.
Whisk together eggs, 2 cups milk, 2 T cornstarch, pepper, mustard powder and mushroom liquid.
Pour over onion/garlic layer, evenly throughout the quiche.
Evenly distribute cheese over the top of the quiche.
**** Custard mixture will  not cover cheese on top. Cheese will melt downward through quiche some, and the custard mixture will rise a little to touch the top-most ingredients on top of the quiche.  It comes together.  This quiche will look beautiful as a result.
Bake at 390Â°F for 40-50 minutes, until mixture is almost firm, wetness is gone and cheese is lightly toasted on top.
Enjoy!

Description: 
Wonderful quiche that does not taste eggy.  Mushroom juices join the custard-like mixture, and the vegetables themselves bring home-taste to the table.
