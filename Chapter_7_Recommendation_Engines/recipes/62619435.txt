Ingredients:
1# ground beef, very lean
1 T shortening
2t salt, just enough to cover bottom of skillet
1 onion, finely chopped
1T yellow mustard
1T vinegar
1T sugar
water to cover
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt shortening with salt. Add beef, breaking apart to form small crumbles when cooked. Add onion while browning meat. Drain off fat. Add mustard, vinegar, sugar, and enough water to just barely cover meat. Cook until water has evaporated, about 15-20 min. Steam or toast buns and add meat with lots of dill pickles and additional yellow mustard.

Description: 
Make as suggested before making substitutions. This is the traditional loose meat recipe. Tried this recipe and didn't think it had enough flavor. Thought better when using beef or chicken broth instead of water. Also too sweet; omit sugar.
