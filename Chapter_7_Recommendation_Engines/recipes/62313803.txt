Ingredients:
2 tsp peanut oil
2 cup(s) onion(s), chopped (about 1 large onion)
2 cup(s) bok choy, chopped
2 cup(s) carrot(s), chopped (about 2 medium carrots)
1 medium green pepper(s), chopped
1 medium sweet red pepper(s), chopped
8 oz mushroom(s), thinly sliced
2 cup(s) broccoli, florets
2 cup(s) asparagus, cut into 2-inch peices (about 1/2 pound asparagus)
1/4 cup(s) low-sodium soy sauce
2 tsp cornstarch
1/4 cup(s) canned chicken broth, reduced-sodium
8 Tbsp peanuts, dry roasted, chopped
4 cup(s) cooked brown rice, kept hot

Directions:
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add onion, bok choy, carrots, peppers, mushrooms, broccoli and asparagus; cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add soy sauce and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes more.
Whisk cornstarch into broth in a small cup and add to pan; simmer until sauce thickens, about 1 minute.
Spoon stir-fry onto rice on individual plates and top each serving with peanuts. Yields about 1 1/2 cups of vegetables, 1 tablespoon of peanuts and 1/2 cup of rice per serving.
This dish will last in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You may add additional protein by stir-frying skinless, boneless chicken, peeled shrimp and/or firm, cubed tofu with the vegetables.
Consider adding extra flavor with fresh ginger and minced garlic.
