Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 teaspoons lime juice
4 tablespoons jalapeno pepper jelly
8 pork loin chops (3/4 inch thick), trimmed
salt to taste
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, rosemary, lime juice, and jalapeno jelly in a bowl, and whisk together. Place the pork chops and marinade in a resealable plastic bag. Remove the air from the bag, and seal; refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
Preheat your grill  for high heat, or preheat broiler.
Remove the chops from the marinade, and season with salt and pepper. Place the chops 2 to 3 inches above the white coals, or under the broiler. Cook the meat on both sides until done, turning frequently so the marinade doesn't burn.
