Ingredients:
1/2 cup Sriracha chile sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
8 chicken thighs, or more to taste
cooking spray
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
8 lime wedges

Directions:
Whisk Sriracha chile sauce, soy sauce, mirin, lime juice, butter, brown sugar, and ginger together in a bowl.
Put chicken thighs into a large, resealable plastic bag. Pour the chile sauce mixture into the bag. Squeeze excess air from bag and seal; marinate at least 1 hour to overnight.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Remove chicken thighs from marinade and shake to remove excess moisture; arrange onto prepared baking sheet.
Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer marinade for 10 minutes.
Roast chicken thighs in preheated oven for 20 minutes, brush with the reserved marinade, and continue roasting until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
