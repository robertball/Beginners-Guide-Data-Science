Potstickers Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 cup shredded green onions
2 cloves garlic, pressed
2 green onions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon hoisin
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 teaspoons sesame oil or peanut oil
1 teaspoon Sriracha*, or more, to taste
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
36 2-inch round won ton wrappers (produce section)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Soy sauce + Mongolian Fire Oil for serving

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine pork, cabbage, garlic, green onions, hoisin, ginger, sesame oil, Sriracha and white pepper. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.
To assemble the dumplings, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potstickers in a single layer and cook until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Serve immediately with soy sauce, if desired.

Description: 
Great potsticker recipe. Yes, they can cook in only 5-6 minutes. You can steam first and quick brown, if you like a soft wrapper.  You can also add a teaspoon for red pepper flakes to a kick. Also, you don't have to marinate mixture, but it is more flavorful.
