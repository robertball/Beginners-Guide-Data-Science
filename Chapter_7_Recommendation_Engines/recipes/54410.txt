Ingredients:
5 pounds bulk Italian sausage
2 (8 ounce) cans water chestnuts, drained and chopped
2 bunches green onion, chopped
1/2 cup soy sauce
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 1/2 cups fine dry bread crumbs
Sweet and Sour Sauce
1 1/4 cups white sugar
6 tablespoons cornstarch
2 cups white vinegar
1 cup pineapple juice
1 cup ketchup
soy sauce to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the sausage in a large bowl and mix in the chestnuts, green onion, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, eggs, garlic powder, and breadcrumbs. Roll the mixture into 1 to 1 1/2 inch balls and place on a broiler pan.  Bake in the oven for 1 hour.  When done, place the meatballs in a slow cooker.
While meatballs are cooking, prepare the sweet and sour sauce by stirring together the sugar and cornstarch in a large saucepan.  Pour in vinegar, pineapple juice, ketchup, and soy sauce to taste.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened.  Pour sauce over meatballs, and keep warm in the slow cooker.
