Description: 
This is an unusual dish due to the range of flavors, but it is very flavorful and unique. The listed quantities are a guideline; adjust according to how spicy or sweet you like, and it's fantastic. One night we had leftover hamburger but no one wanted burgers/meatloaf, and I was pining for honey mustard chicken strips. After a little pantry digging, I scraped the recipe together and it was a hit. Been making it ever since. This can be a stand-alone meal or served over rice. During the cooking phase, taste the mixture to determine if it is too spicy or sweet. If too spicy, add honey by the teaspoon until it's to your liking. If too sweet, add extra ground beef to dilute the honey. Of you want to make it heartier, add 2 cups chopped mushrooms to the onions and 1/2 cup peas.
