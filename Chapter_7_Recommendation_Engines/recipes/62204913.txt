Lemon Bars Cockaigne Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
Pinch of salt (for crust)
1 stick of cold unsalted butter
2 large eggs
1 cup granulated white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Pinch of salt (for filling)
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
2-3 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
Additional confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Set rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch baking pan.
To make the crust: Combine the flour, confectioners' sugar, and salt in a medium sized bowl. Cut in the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the greased pan, and build up 1/2 inch edges. (This keeps the filling from sticking to the sides of the pan later on). Bake crust for 15-20 minutes, or until golden. Remove from oven to let cool.
To make the filling: In a medium bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, flour, and salt.  Whisk in the lemon juice and lemon zest until well combined. Pour the lemon filling over the crust (it is okay if the crust is still hot). Bake filling until just set, 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into 2 inch squares. Dust with remaining confectioners'sugar if desired.

Description: 
These lemon bars are delicious. The lemon filling is sweet and tart, and the shortbread crust buttery. Certainly my favorite lemon bar recipe!
