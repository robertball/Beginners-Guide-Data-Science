Description: 
This is a wonderful and quick dinner.  I have never not been asked for the recipe when I serve it to friends.  Don't be discouraged by the number of ingredients... you can add or delete any items you wish. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top, toss with olive oil and serve with French bread, if desired.  Toss in some artichoke hearts if you'd like.
