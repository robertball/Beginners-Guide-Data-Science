Description: 
Chile Rellenos without all the mess, but all the flavor. Good for company!  Excellent for a buffet table!  Variations include adding small chopped cooked shrimp or chopped cooked crab to the filling for an excellent brunch dish. Monterey jack cheese may be used instead of Mexican-style cheese.
