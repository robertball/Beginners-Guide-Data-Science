Ingredients:
1/2 pound baby carrots
1 teaspoon butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
1/8 teaspoon dried mint, crushed

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the carrots, recover, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on thickness. Drain carrots.
Heat the butter in a skillet over low heat. Stir in the carrots, brown sugar, honey, and mint. Continue to cook and stir until the sugar is dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
The sweet, minty sauce makes these carrots just a bit different.  Even my husband, who says he doesn't like carrots, came back for seconds!
