Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
3/4 cup any flavor fruit jam

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Cream the butter and sugar together. Add the almond extract and the salt. Stir in the flour and mix well.
Shape tablespoonfuls of the dough into walnut-sized balls then roll the balls in sesame seeds to cover completely. Place balls on ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly. With your thumb, indent the center of each cookie. Fill indentations with jam or preserves.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove cookies from baking sheets and let cool on a rack. Store cooled cookies in an air-tight container.
