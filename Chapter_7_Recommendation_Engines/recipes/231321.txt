Description: 
An amazing smoothie to perk up your morning in place of coffee. Particularly good for a little 'morning after' help. Best with a high-power blender/juicer. I'm a foodie, but not a health-foodie. First and foremost, this thing is crazy delicious. It also happens to be a good way to get more fresh veggies into your day. Bonus!
