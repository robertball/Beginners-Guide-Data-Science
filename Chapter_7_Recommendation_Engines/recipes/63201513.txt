Ingredients:
1 lb. cheddar cheese, coarse grate
1 lb. Monterey Jack cheese, coarse grate
(Don’t buy these cheeses already grated.  Grate
the cheese yourself as it has to be coarsely grated)
2 cans Rotel Tomatoes (medium heat) 10 ounces each, drain, saving juice for another use(Rotel is canned tomatoes with diced green chilies)
4 large eggs, separated
1 T. flour
½ t. salt
1/8 t. pepper
2/3 cup canned evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
Lightly spray the bottom of a large 9x13 baking pan on the bottom with non-stick spray.
In a large bowl, combine the two cheeses by hand. Place cheese in a 13x9 cake pan.
In a small bowl beat the 4 egg whites until stiff.
In a large bowl, beat yolks.  Add salt, pepper, flour, milk and Rotel tomatoes to beaten egg yolks.
Fold the stiff egg whites into the egg yolk mixture.
Pour egg mixture over cheese in the pan.  With a fork work the egg mixture down into the cheese.
Bake at 325 for 30 minutes or until starting to brown.  Remove from oven, let stand for a few minutes before serving to let set before cutting to serve.

Description: 
This is a great breakfast casserole to serve your visiting company or to a large group.  
It sounds like a lot of cheese, but its not.  The light texture is nice and puffy.       
I got this recipe while in a park in Woodland Park, Colorado from a nice lady I didn't even know but had struck up a conversation with.  
You can make it as spicy or as mild as you like by using either mild, medium or extra hot canned tomatoes with green chilies.
