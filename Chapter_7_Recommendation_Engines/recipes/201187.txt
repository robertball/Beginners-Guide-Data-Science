Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 sweet onion, diced
4 medium carrots, cut into bite size pieces
1/2 head cauliflower, chopped into bite size pieces
6 spears asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
1 cup 2% reduced fat milk
1 eggs
1/3 cup bread crumbs
1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef until browned, adding the onions the last few minutes of cooking. Drain the fat, then stir in the carrots, cauliflower, and asparagus. Mix the milk, egg, bread crumbs, and seasoning blend in a small bowl. Stir in the beef and vegetable mixture, then pour into the prepared baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and return to the oven. Continue baking for 15 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is modified from one of my comfort foods my mom made growing up. I changed a few things so we get more veggies and less fat.  My husband loves it.
