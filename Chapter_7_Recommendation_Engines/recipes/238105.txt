Ingredients:
1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham
2 cups mango nectar, divided, or more as needed
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup mango preserves
1/2 cup white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Score the top of the ham in a diamond pattern with serrated knife. Place ham on a roasting rack in a roasting pan. Pour 1 1/2 cups mango nectar over ham.
Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the ham is 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Stir brown sugar, Dijon mustard, ginger root, cinnamon, and cloves together in a small bowl.
Combine mango preserves, white wine, and remaining 1/2 cup mango nectar together in a saucepan; bring to a boil, stir in brown sugar mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer until glaze thickens, 2 to 4 minutes.
Brush ham all over with glaze. Continue baking until glaze is bubbling, about 10 minutes more. Remove ham from oven and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving.
