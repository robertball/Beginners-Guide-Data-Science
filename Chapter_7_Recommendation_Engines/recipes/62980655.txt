Ingredients:
1/4 low fat cup milk
1/4 cup dried bread crumbs
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 cup white wine
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup low fat or fat free half and half
2 cloves minced fresh garlic
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 oz. Penne pasta cooked and drained
crusty bread

Directions:
Boil water for pasta and cook per box instructions. Meanwhile pound chicken to 1/4 inch.
Place milk and bread crumbs in separate, shallow bowls. In skillet, heat butter or margarine to medium heat. Dip chicken in milk, then coat with crumbs.  Cook in butter or margarine, on both sides, until juices run clear (about 10 minutes). Remove and keep warm.
Deglaze the pan with wine. Add broth to skillet. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and stir to loosen browned bits from pan. Stir in cream and garlic; boil and stir for 1 minute. Reduce heat.
Add Parmesan cheese, basil and pepper. Stir sauce and cook until heated through. Pour mixture over chicken and pasta and serve with crusty bread.
