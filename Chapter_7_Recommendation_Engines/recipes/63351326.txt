Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 large russet potatoes, cut into abt 1 inch chunks
2-3 tblsp olive oil
1 tsp dried dill
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp black pepper
2 tblsp grated parmesan cheese
2 tblsp kosher salt

Directions:
Drizzle olive oil over cut potatoes and toss to coat.  Measure remaining ingredients into a small bowl, stir to mix and add to potatoes. Toss to coat thoroughly.
Spray bottom of a 9x13 pan with cooking spray.  Pour potatoes into the pan, spread out into one layer  Bake at 425 degrees F for 30-40 minutes, or until fork tender.
Note:  Using the cooking spray makes them not stick.  You'd think the olive oil would do that, but no.  They stick badly unless you coat the bottom of the pan with cooking spray.  Or you could use parchment paper, too.
