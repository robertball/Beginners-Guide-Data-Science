Description: 
This is the best recipe for taste, presentation and easy for decorating, borders, cupcakes, cakes and such!  This yields A LOT!! This works very well with KitchenAids mixers that really make a difference in outcome of frosting!  If needed, add a little milk or water to thin out but KA's help, really don't need it. Very stable and can withstand room temp!!
