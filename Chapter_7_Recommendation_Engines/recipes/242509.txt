Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1 (3 ounce) package lemon-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O®)
3 egg whites
1/3 cup canola oil
Filling:
2 cups milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package cheesecake-flavored pudding mix (such as Jell-O®)
Frosting:
7 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix white cake mix, water, lemon-flavored gelatin mix, egg whites, and canola oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Turn speed to medium and beat batter for 2 minutes. Fill muffin cups about 1/2-full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool cupcakes completely, at least 30 minutes.
Beat milk and cheesecake-flavored pudding mix together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes. Transfer pudding to a pastry bag fitted with an icing tip. Break an opening into each cupcake using the icing tip and gently squeeze pudding into cupcake until it begins to swell.
Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, and lemonade concentrate together in a bowl using an electric mixer until frosting is smooth and thickened; spread onto cupcakes.
