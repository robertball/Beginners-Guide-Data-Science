Ingredients:
1 1/2# sugar pumpkin or butternut squash
1 T. butter or oil
1 T. maple syrup
1 1/2 tsp. cider vinegar
1/2 tsp. each salt and pepper, or to taste
pinch of cayenne
1 T. olive oil
2 large leeks, cleaned and chopped (white and light green parts)
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 tsp. chopped fresh rosemary
1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 c. veggie broth
3 cups thinly sliced kale
1/4 c. grated parmesan, optional
1/4 c. dried cranberries, roughly chopped

Directions:
Peel, trim, and halve squash. Cut into 1-inch cubes. Spread in baking sheet.
Combine butter, syrup, 1/2 tsp. vinegar, salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper and cayenne in a small saucepan. When butter melts, pour mix over squash. Roast at 425 for about 30 minutes, turning occasionally, till squash is tender and cartelized.
In a large skillet, saute leeks, garlic, rosemary, and a generous pinch of salt till leeks are very soft but not brown, about 15 minutes. Add beans and broth and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir in kale and cheese. Simmer about 10 minutes till kale is tender. Stir in squash and chopped cranberries; season with remaining vinegar and pepper.
