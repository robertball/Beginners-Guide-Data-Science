Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 cup quinoa
2 cups water
2 tablespoons vegetarian chicken-flavored bouillon granules
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
1 carrot, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 cup baby spinach
1 can black beans 14.5 oz.
1-2 lbs ground turkey

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a sauce pan over medium heat; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat, stir in quinoa, and toast, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in the water, bouillon granules, black pepper, and thyme; raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.
Stir in the carrots. Cover and simmer until all water is absorbed, about 10 more minutes. Turn off the heat, add the tomatoes and spinach, and stir until the spinach is wilted and the tomatoes have given off their moisture, about 2 minutes.
Optional:  Brown ground turyey in 2 Tbls of olive oil.  Add black beans and heat through on medium low heat.  Add prepared recipe from above and heat through (about 5 minutes).
