Ingredients:
200g halloumi
2 Tbsp pomegranate vinegar
1 Tbsp honey
1.5 tsp harissa, or more to taste
3 Tbsp olive oil
Pinch fresh ground black pepper
1 cup cooked kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup cooked white beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
1/3 cup chopped red onion
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander

Directions:
Heat a large non-stick saut√© pan or griddle to medium-high heat. Cut the halloumi into one-inch slabs. Cook each slab on all four sides. Set aside and allow to cool slightly. Once the cheese is warm to the touch, cut into 1/4 inch cubes.
While the cheese is cooking, make the vinaigrette. In a dressing container, whisk together the pomegranate vinegar, honey, harissa, olive oil, and black pepper. Set aside.
In a large bowl, add the three beans, onion, mint, and coriander. Toss with a spoon. Add the halloumi. Drizzle the vinaigrette all over the salad and toss to coat. Cover and allow to sit at room temperature for at least 15 minutes.
