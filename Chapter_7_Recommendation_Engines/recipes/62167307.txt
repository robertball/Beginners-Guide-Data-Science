Description: 
I despise the taste of regular buttercream so after many trials, errors and alterations I came up with this. This recipe will cover a 12, 10, and 8 inch cake including frosting between layers. Its very sturdy easy to pipe. This will dry out rather fast so cover with a warm towel or beat in some extra milk.
