Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch sticks (straight or ruffle cut)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon seasoning (ideas below), or more to taste

Directions:
Cover potatoes with water and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Drizzle with oil; toss to coat.
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Arrange potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket. Cook, tossing every 5 minutes, until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and desired seasoning.
