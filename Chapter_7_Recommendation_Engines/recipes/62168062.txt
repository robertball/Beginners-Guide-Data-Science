2 quart bags of frozen corn (or 3-4 cans)
2 bricks of cream cheese
1 stick real butter
3-7 fresh chopped jalapenos (to taste)
2 Tbsp garlic salt
1 Tbsp black pepper
(if you are cooking any kind of meat, use a few Tbsp of pan drippings into your mix)

Directions:
Cut cream cheese and butter into 1 in cubes/slices and turn crock pot to high.  The butter will melt first entirely and the cream cheese will cream but not completely melt.  (about 15-25min)
Then mix in everything else and stir to mix well.
Cook in crock pot for 3-5 hours on low, stirring twice if possible.
Salt and pepper to taste, if more is desired.
