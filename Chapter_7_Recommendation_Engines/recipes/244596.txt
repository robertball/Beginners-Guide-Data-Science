Ingredients:
5 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish
2 tablespoons lemon juice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (15 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon dried basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange swai fish on an 8x11-inch baking dish. Pour lemon juice over fish and season with parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over fish and top with fire-roasted tomatoes and basil.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
In Northern New York we like our sharp Cheddar cheese. Other cheeses may work well too. This is great served with a pasta side dish or steamed veggies and a dinner roll.
