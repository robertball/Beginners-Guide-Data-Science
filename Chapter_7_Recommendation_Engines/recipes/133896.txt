Description: 
These awesome scrambled eggs have bacon, cheese and onion in. Wow! My whole dish tastes like bacon plus goodness! Also, for the record, when I cook these, I normally eye out the ingredients. I just tried to narrow it down for this here website! But yeah, try different combinations and stuff; add more of whatever. Remember: too much cheese can make them too good, but milk - you don't want much milk.
