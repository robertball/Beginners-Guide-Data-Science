Ingredients:
1.75 quart container of Frozen Pineapple Sherbert (not a bright yellow sherbert, you want one that is almost white)
Two 10 oz. containers of Frozen Strawberries in Syrup
2-liter bottle of Ginger Ale, well chilled

Directions:
Puree the frozen strawberries in a blender or food processor until smooth. Set aside. Empty sherbert carton into punch bowl and pour 1/2- 3/4 of the strawberry puree over the top. Add 1/2 bottle of ginger ale.  With a potato masher "punch" the ingredients down, breaking up the frozen chunks and blending.  Add rest of ginger ale and continue to blend. If you want the color to be a deeper pink, then add more of the remaining strawberry puree.
