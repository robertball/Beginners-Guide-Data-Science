Description: 
I like to cook this asparagus side dish on an indoor iron grill to get grill marks, but feel free to cook the asparagus any way you like. The key to this dish is the simple soy sauce and sesame oil marinade. This recipe comes from my sister Kaitlin. Sometimes I add a pinch of salt or pepper but don't tell her :)
