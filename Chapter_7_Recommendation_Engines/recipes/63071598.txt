Ingredients:
1 pound trout filets, or other whitefish such as perch
lemon pepper & salt to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup white wine such as Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest (do NOT use the white pith!)
1/4 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons capers, drained
3 tablespoons butter
Parsley to garnish

Directions:
Preheat over to 200 degrees F. Place a serving platter into the oven to warm
Mix together the flour, lemon pepper & salt. Dredge the fish in the mixture, shaking off any excess. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet. Pan fry the fish until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Do not crowd the skillet. Place the cooked fish onto the warmed platter in the oven.
With only a thin coating of oil in the skillet, sautee the garlic until cooked, about 20 seconds.
Pour the wine into the pan to deglaze. Stir in the grated lemon zest and bring the mixture to a boil. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces to about 2/3 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.
Add the lemon juice and capers; simmer until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes more.
Add the butter in the skillet and whisk it into the sauce to incorporate. Add the fish back into the skillet, turning to coat.
Remove to platter. Garnish with parsley and serve.
