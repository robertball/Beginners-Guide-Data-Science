Ingredients:
12 medium baby bella mushrooms (each about 2 inches wide)
One 10-oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/2 cup crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese
Spices: garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick spray and set aside.
Remove mushroom stems and set aside. Place mushroom caps on the baking sheet, rounded sides down. Bake in the oven until slightly softened, 12 - 14 minutes. Leave oven on.
Meanwhile, chop mushroom stems. Bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat on the stove. Add stems and cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes.
Place cooked stems in a medium bowl. Add spinach, cheese, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Mix thoroughly.
Pat mushroom caps with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Evenly distribute spinach mixture among the caps, about 2 tablespoons each. Bake in the oven until filling is hot, 8 - 10 minutes. Enjoy
