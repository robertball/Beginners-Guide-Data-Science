Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 small yellow onions, chopped
4 1/2 cups chopped cooked turkey

1 (15 ounce) can diced potatoes, drained
6 cups water

1 cup hickory-flavored barbecue sauce
1/4 cup vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the turkey, tomatoes, potatoes, water, ketchup, barbecue sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper. Bring stew to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add corn and cook another 30 minutes.

Description: 
A delicious and easy way to use your leftover Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey.  I use leftover fried turkey breast with skin and dark meat, quick prep time if using a food processor.  My version of Brunswick stew has become a family favorite!
