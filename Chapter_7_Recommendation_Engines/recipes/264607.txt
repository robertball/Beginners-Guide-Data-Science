Ingredients:
7/8 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for baking dish
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
6 eggs
7/8 cup white sugar
3 teaspoons vanilla sugar
3/4 cup dry white wine
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon (optional)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups ground hazelnuts
3/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) generously with butter and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Turn pan so bread crumbs are evenly distributed. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter using an electric mixer on high speed for a few minutes until foamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add sugar and vanilla sugar in batches. Beat batter for a few minutes until mixture is light and foamy. Mix in white wine.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Mix flour mixture into egg mixture quickly on low speed. Fold in hazelnuts and chocolate chips. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan and level with the back of a spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
You can bake this delicious nut cake from Tyrol in a fluted tube pan (such as BundtÂ®) or loaf pan. It is moist and will last a few days (if you can keep the family away from it). Hazelnuts are my favorite, but you can use walnuts as well.
