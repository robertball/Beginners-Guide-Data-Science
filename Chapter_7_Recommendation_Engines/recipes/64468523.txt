Ingredients:
1 tbsp salted butter
1 tbsp granulated sugar
1 tbsp light brown sugar, packed
2 tsp milk
pinch of salt
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tbsp butterscotch chips
1 tbsp milk chocolate chips

Directions:
Melt butter in microwave, 25-30 seconds.  Whisk in sugar and brown sugar.  Add milk and salt, whisk until smooth. Add flour one tbsp at a time, blending thoroughly between additions.  Stir in chips.  Cook in microwave 50 seconds.
The fluffy bites will look slightly raw on removal. THIS IS OKAY! Don’t add any extra time. Top with vanilla ice cream and enjoy your sweet success.
