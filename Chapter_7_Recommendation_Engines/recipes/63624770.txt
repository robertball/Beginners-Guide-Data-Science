Ingredients:
alad
1.5 cups of uncooked quinoa (cooked according to the package's directions - I cooked mine in 3 cups of water)
1 red pepper, diced
1 orange pepper, diced
1 avocado, in generous chunks
1 big handful of cilantro, coarsely chopped
1 can of low-sodium black beans, rinsed
1 hunk of feta, crumbled (like how technical my measurements are?)
1/2 a can of corn
1/8 of a medium red onion, very finely chopped
Dressing
juice of 1 lime
3 or 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove minced
1 tablespoon(ish) of fresh cilantro, very finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix up the salad, mix up the dressing, then combine.
If eating later, cut up avocado when ready to eat to avoid browning
