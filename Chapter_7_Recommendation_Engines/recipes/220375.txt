Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
1 (15 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 (4 ounce) can chopped mild green chiles, drained
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan.
Whisk together cornmeal, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl.
Stir in milk and vegetable oil until well blended.
Beat in egg and cream-style corn until well mixed.
Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan, then sprinkle with half of the green chilies and half of the Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I grew up eating this with chili on cold Colorado nights! This is a great alternative for plain old cornbread as a side!
