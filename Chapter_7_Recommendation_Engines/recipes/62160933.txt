Ingredients:
1 box white mix
1 Tbsp vegitable oil
3 egg whites
1 3oz box watermelon jell-o or any fruit gelatin
1 cup watermelon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Grease and flower 2 8" or 9" cake pans.
In large mixing bowl, add cake mix, jell-o, eggs, oil and watermelon.
Beat on medium speed long enough to mix ingredients but leaving some visiable watermelon pieces.
Divide batter into prepared cake pans.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Cool on wire rack for 10 minutes before inverting onto wire rack.
Let cakes cool completlely.
Cut cakes in half.
Put frosting between each layer to make layers stick together.
Place cut side down on cake board.
Frost outside of cake with green icing ( I like to use a crusting buttercream)
Let sit for 20 minutes, smooth out icing.
I then go back and using a color gel to make darker stripes on cake.
On each end, frost with red icing.
I use black icing to look like seeds.
