2)When the freezer time is up, heat one or two inches of oil in a large deep skillet. While the oil is heating, mix together the cornmeal, flour, egg white, milk, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Dip the frozen corn nuggets into the batter. Quickly fry in hot oil until golden brown. Remove, place on paper towels to drain.
