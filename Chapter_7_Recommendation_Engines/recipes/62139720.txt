Ingredients:
Before starting to cook: Grease and flour two 1.5 -inch deep by 8 inches in diameter baking pans. Heat up the oven to 350 °F (175 °C). Mix the flour and baking powder and sift together. Put aside.
~Dominican Cake
* 1/4 lb (110 grams) of creamed butter
* 1/4 lb (110 grams) of margarine
* 1 pinch of grated lime peel
* 1 cup of orange juice
* 1/2 lb (220 grams) of all-purpose flour
* 1/2 lb (220 grams) of sugar
* 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons of baking powder
* 3 eggs
~ For the meringue
* 5 egg whites
* 1/2 cup of sugar (for the caramel)
* 2 1/2 lb (1 kg) of powdered sugar, sifted (for the merengue)
* 1/2 cup of water
* 1/4 teaspoon of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar (optional)
~ For the filling
* 4 cups of pineapple, cut into cubes
* 1 cup of water
* 1 cup of sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

Directions:
1. To prepare the filling: Mix all the ingredients together and simmer covered over very low heat until the pineapple is tender and you obtain the consistency of marmalade. Stir often to avoid scorching. Cool to room temperature. Reserve.
2. To prepare the cake batter: Beat together the margarine, butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy and has a very light yellow color (about 4 mins). One by one add the eggs and continue beating about a minute after adding each new egg. Slowly add the lime peel, and vanilla. Add one third of the juice, when it is well mixed add one third of the flour. Repeat adding the flour and juice in thirds and keep whisking until all is well-mixed before adding the next third. As soon as you've stopped mixing the last batch of flour turn off the mixer, you should have obtained a fluffy batter with a smooth and even consistency.
3. Pour half the pineapple filling on each baking pan. Make sure you do not disturb the cover of butter and flour. Pour in half the batter in each one. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean (about 30 mins). While the cake is baking prepare the meringue.
4. To make the meringue: Prepare the caramel by boiling sugar and water over very low heat until it reduces to a quarter of the original quantity. Make sure it doesn’t burn. In the meantime whisk the egg whites in a glass or stainless steel bowl until it forms peaks. Slowly add the sugar until it is completely mixed. Add the salt and cream tartar while still whisking. Very slowly pour the caramel into the mixture while beating at high speed until all is well mixed.
5. Cool down cakes to room temperature. Cut any crust that might have formed. Join both cakes filling-side in. To decorate the cake spread the meringue on top and around the cake, add decoration according to your taste and skills.
(I substitute the vanilla extract with the vanilla beans and this recipe comes out OUTSTANDING. Also, if made with a professional mixer, this cake comes out light and fluffy. Too much work for me to do it with a hand mixer. Enjoy!)
