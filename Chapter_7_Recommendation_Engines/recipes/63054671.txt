Ingredients:
1 box of jumbo pasta shells, 1 lb. mild Italian sausage, 1/2 lb. Havarti cheese, 1/2 lb. Mozzarella cheese, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 1 jar spicy marinara sauce, salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Boil jumbo pasta shells just short of al dente, about 8 minutes. While pasta is cooking, brown Italian sausage and drain. Grate the cheese, mix together, and set a handful aside for later. Mix the remaining cheese together with 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of the breadcrumbs. Spread a thin layer of sauce and crumbled Italian sausage on the bottom of a baking dish. Begin to stuff each shell with a spoonful of the cheese mixture (roll them up slightly to keep the cheese from spilling out) and place in the baking dish. Continue until the shells fill the dish. Cover the shells with the remaining Italian sausage and spicy marinara. Top the dish with the remaining cheese and breadcrumbs. Bake covered with aluminum foil at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 15-20 minutes, until hot and bubbly.
