Ingredients:
3 tablespoons chopped onion
3 tablespoons butter
1 ¾ cups shredded, cooked chicken meat
3 tablespoons chicken stock
¼ teaspoon garlic salt
¼ teaspoon poultry seasoning
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, diced
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon paprika
1 cup butter, chilled
5 tablespoons cold water

Directions:
In a large skillet saute the onion in the butter until tender. Stir in the chicken, chicken broth, garlic salt, poultry seasoning, pepper and cream cheese. Remove from heat and set aside.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl mix together the flour, salt and paprika; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until a ball forms.
On a floured surface roll out the pastry to 1/16 inch thick. Cut with a 2 1/2 inch round cookie or biscuit cutter. Reroll scraps and cut more circles until the pastry is used up.
Mound a heaping teaspoon of filling on half of each circle. Moisten edges with water and fold pastry over filling to make a half moon shape. Press edges with a fork to seal. Prick tops with a fork for steam vents.
Place turnovers on a baking sheet and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.
