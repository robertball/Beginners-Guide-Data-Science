Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into long French fries
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon steak seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Place sweet potato fries into a large bowl, drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil, and toss to coat. Mix steak seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, salt, and paprika in a separate small bowl until thoroughly combined. Use your left hand to toss fries with olive oil as you sprinkle the seasoning mixture over them with your right hand.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and place sweet potato pieces into the hot oil. Cover skillet, pan-fry for 5 minutes; uncover and turn fries. Place cover back over fries and cook 5 more minutes; continue turning fries and covering until sweet potatoes are tender, about 10 more minutes.

Description: 
A tangy way to enjoy sweet potatoes outside of Thanksgiving dinner. Sweet potato fries do not crisp as well as regular potato fries do, so if you do not like softer fries, this is not the recipe for you!
