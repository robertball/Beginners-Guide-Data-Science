Ingredients:
1 side of salmon (3 lbs.)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 5.5oz bag kettle cooked potato chips
zest 1/2 lime
1/3 cup chopped fresh dill
olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Lay the salmon, skin side down, in the center of the baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper.
Crush the potato chips, lime zest and dill together in a bowl until the chips resemble coarse crumbs. mix 2 TBS. of oil until incorporated.
Coat salmon with a thin, even layer of potato chip crumbs. Pat them on the fish gently to stay put.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chip coating is nicely browned. use 2 spatulas to transfer the salmon to a serving platter, putting one at either end and lifting them up together so the salmon stays in one piece.
