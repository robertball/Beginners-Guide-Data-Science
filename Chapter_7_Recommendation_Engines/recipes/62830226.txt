4-5 large potatoes: peeled, cubed (approx size:1-1/2in x 1-1/2in), boiled and drained
2 (16oz)cans cream of potatoe
1-2 (16oz)cans chicken broth (according to desired thickness of soup)

1/4-1/2c dried chives (to taste)
1/4-1/2c dried onion (to taste)
dash of parsley flakes
dash of oregano
3/4-whole pkg bacon (pork or turkey)(cook to desired texture)
sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Simply put:  Combine all ingredients into large pot (except sour cream and bacon) and bring to boil. Cover and cook on stove-top for approx. 45 mins, stirring occasionally so it doesn't stick to bottom of pot.
Approx 15 mins before done, add bacon. Once done, cool and add a dollop of sour cream to individual bowls if desired.
If your trying to impress your dinner companions, add a little shredded cheese and parsley to the top of each bowl for added decoration.
***My husband is Completely against turkey bacon, can't stand the taste. However, when cooked into the soup, he can't tell the difference!

Description: 
My mom was the cook in our house, growing up. She loved potatoes. My dad loved soups, or anything with a gravy. So, what better way to get the best of both sides, but a delicious potatoe soup?! Not just any soup, a Loaded Potatoe Soup! 
Let's just leave it at this: any time our church has a function that requires food, I'm asked to bring this dish (all throughout the year). I've even had people say that they 'Hate' potatoe soup...but, when they try mine, they Love it!!! I hope you enjoy it as much!
