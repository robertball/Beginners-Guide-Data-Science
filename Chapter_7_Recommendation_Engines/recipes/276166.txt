Ingredients:
2 large heads cauliflower, chopped into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup cooked and crumbled bacon
2 teaspoons crushed garlic
1 teaspoon Hungarian paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 1/2 cups French-fried onions
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place cauliflower into a 9x12-inch microwave-safe casserole dish or large bowl with water. Cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap and microwave on high power until half-steamed, about 5 minutes. Remove and pour out excess water but do not drain in a colander.
Sprinkle cauliflower with mozzarella cheese, bacon, garlic, paprika, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes; toss to evenly distribute. Stir in mushroom soup until cauliflower is coated; spread mixture evenly in the dish. Top with French-fried onions, followed by Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
