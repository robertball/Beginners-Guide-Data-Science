Ingredients:
Cookies:
2 c sugar
1 cup butter (softened)
2 eggs
5 cups flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup buttermilk (or 1 cup milk mixed with 1 Tbsp lemon juice OR white vinegar)
Frosting:
6 cups powdered sugar
6 Tbsp butter (softened)
3 Tbsp (appx) of milk or until desired consistency
1 tsp vanilla
Beat all ingredients well until smooth and creamy.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Cream sugar, butter and eggs together. Add flour and dry ingredients together, pour into creamed mixture. Add milk and vanilla and beat well. Place dough in refrigerator for 1 hour.  (The batter will be too sticky if you skip this part.)  Roll dough into balls (heaping tablespoon size) and place 6 to a sheet to allow spreading. Bake for 15 mins. When done, keep on baking sheet for 1 min so they are easier to take off. Transfer to cooking rack until ready to frost and decorate!
Frosting: Beat 6 Tbsp softened butter (warmed in microwave for 30 seconds), 6 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and appx 3 Tbsp of milk or until desired consistency.  When cookies are completely cool, add frosting with a knife, like so. (You may color your frosting by adding food coloring.) Add sprinkles to your liking!
