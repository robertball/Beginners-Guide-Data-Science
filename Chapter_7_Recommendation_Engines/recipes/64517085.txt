Ingredients:
2 1/2 lbs. of chicken wings
Dry Rub
1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt
1/2 Tablespoon Ground Pepper
1/2 Tablespoon Cajun Seasoning
Sauce
2/3 Cup of Frank's RedHot Sauce
1 Stick of Unsalted Butter
1 1/2 Tablespoons White Vinegar
1/2 Teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce
1/8 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
Salt toTaste

Directions:
Mix up dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Sprinkle dry rub over each chicken wing. Then smoke at 225 degrees for 1 hour-1 hour, 15 minutes.  I like to use hickory wood, but you can use whatever you have.  While the wings are smoking, prepare sauce.
In a small sauce pan, combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook over low heat stirring often until butter is melted.  Remove from heat and set aside.
Once the wings are done smoking, put them in a large bowl and stir in approximately 1/2 off the sauce, making sure that each wing is well coated.  Then grill for approximately 4-5 minutes over medium to high heat.  Then flip each wings another 4-5 minutes. Wings are done once wings are well caramelized and skin is starting to get crispy.
Once the wings are finished from the grill, place wings in a large bowl and stir in the remaining sauce.  Stir until wings are well coated.
Serve with Celery Sticks and Blue Cheese Dressing. Enjoy!
