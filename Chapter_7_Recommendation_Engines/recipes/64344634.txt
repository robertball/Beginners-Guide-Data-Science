Ingredients:
1/2 cup sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds
1 cup hazelnuts
1 cup sprouted whole buckwheat groats
3 cups oatmeal
1 ripe mashed banana
4 tablespoons coconut oil
6 tablespoons agave syrup
2 teaspoon cinnamon
A pinch of salt

Directions:
Rinse the buckwheat groats under running water.
Let them soak in a jar covered with 2-3 times as much fresh water for about an hour.
Rinse them well in a colander and let them stand for 2 days, rinsing 2-3 times per day.
After one day of sprouting, put the pumpkin seeds and hazelnuts in a jar covered with water and let them soak for 8 hours until the sprouts are ready.
Rinse the buckwheat, the pumpkin seeds and the hazelnuts and let them dry as much as possible.
Chop the hazelnuts roughly and put all of the ingredients in a bowl.
Stir well.
Spread the mixture in a thin, even layer on a baking sheet.
Dry them in a dehydrator or at the lowest temperature in the oven 105F for 10-12 hours or until crunchy.

Description: 
Since I started doing my own granola IÂ´m never going to eat store bought again. This is so much better. It has much more nutrition, less sugar and it tastes even better.
 I use it on yogurt, with fruits and berries, by itself when I feel like a snack or as a great, healthy travelsnack.
