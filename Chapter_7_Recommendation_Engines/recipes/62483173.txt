Ingredients:
8 large apples, peeled, cored and sliced in 1/4 inch thick slices.
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 tsp almond extract
1/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup amaretto liquor
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Put amaretto, butter, sugars, spices, extracts in a large sauce pan - one that will accommodate the apples later.  Bring mixture to a boil and reduce heat.
Simmer 5 minutes or until sugar is dissolved.
Add apples and cook over low heat until tender and still a bit crisp.  About 10 minutes.
Mix orange juice and cornstarch in a desperate little bowl.  Stir until incorporated.  Add to apple mixture and stir well. *** you can repeat this if you want a thicker sauce.  Sometimes I have had fresher apples that released more juices when cooked so I needed to add a bit more of the cornstarch.  Older apples are drier.
Remove from heat. Serve warm.

Description: 
My rendition of Famous Dave's side dish.  A little naughty and a lot nice! Makes a great topping for over vanilla ice cream too!
