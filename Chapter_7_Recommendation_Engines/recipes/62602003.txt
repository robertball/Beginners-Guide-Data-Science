Ingredients:
1 lb Spaghetti, cooked according to pkg directions
1 lb lean ground beef
1 large jar prepared spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup water
1 pint sour cream
1/4 cup milk
1 & 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Place cooked spaghetti in the bottom of a 9 X 13 casserole.  Cook ground beef until browned.  Drain grease.  Stir in spaghetti sauce & water and simmer for 10 minutes.  Mix together sour cream and parmesan and mix in 1/4 cup milk  (so that the sour cream/cheese mixture is spreadable).  Spread this directly over the spaghetti noodles.  Ladle the meat sauce on top.  Sprinkle cheese on top.  Cover tightly with foil and bake @ 350 for 40 minutes.  Remove foil & cook for additional 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious cheesy baked spaghetti.  Even better the 2nd day.  This is one of my family's favorites! I usually make my own homemade spaghetti sauce, but for some reason, this recipe seems to do better with the jar sauce.
