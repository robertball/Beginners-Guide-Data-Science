Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons salted butter
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 can (24 ounce) crushed san marzano tomatoes
kosher salt and black pepper
1 cup whole milk
1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped
1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped

Directions:
To make the cream sauce. Heat the butter and oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook for 5 minutes, until fragrant. Add the garlic and cook another minute. Stir in the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Stir and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened slightly. Stir in the milk, parmesan, parsley, and basil, and cook another 10 minutes, until warmed through.

Description: 
The sauce is really very simple, just a little garlic, tomato, basil, parmesan, and a quick simmer on the stove. I didnâ€™t want the sauce to outshine the ravioli, so I kept things simple. Simple but perfect, as I like to say. And very creamy and delicious too.
