Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Duffy salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 1/4 pound extra-lean ground beef
1 1/4 pound ground pork
3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled
7 buttery round crackers, crushed
1 egg, lightly beaten
3 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided
3 tablespoons ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tbls molasses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, mix the onion and garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce. Gradually stir in the milk 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.
Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce, brown sugar, molasses, and ketchup. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe that I found on this site, I just modified it.  My family really likes this dinner, I usually serve it with mashed potatoes, beef gravy, and corn (I use Birdseye baby white and yellow frozen corn it is very close to off the cob).Modified from: The Best Meatloaf I've Ever Made
