Ingredients:
1 chicken (small roaster)
2 stalks of celery
1 large onion
2 bay leaves
1-1/2 tsp. Thyme
chicken bouillon-one cube, or 1 TBSP.
2 eggs (large)
1-1/2 C. Flour (approx)
1 tsp. baking powder
2 tsp. salt
1-2 tsp. water (if needed)

Directions:
Place chicken in large stock pot, cut celery into 2 or 3 parts, cut onion in half. Place vegetables in pot with Chicken, add spices. Fill pot with water (enough to cover chicken). Bring to boil, boil for approx. 2 hours (until done). Take chicken out of pot, and de-bone. Toss vegetables out. Make sure you have 2 quarts of stock (if not, add chicken broth-low sodium). Bring stock to boiling, and add chicken bouillon.
Beat eggs and add flour, baking powder, and salt. It will be very dry. Place dough on silpat/or pasty mat. Try to push together (you may have small crumbs. Get a small amount of water on your hands to combine the dough. DO NOT GET THE DOUGH TOO WET. The dough should be very dry, sometimes you need water to get those last little crumbs. Work the dough into a ball with your hands. Roll out as thin as you can (sometimes this can be an arm workout), it is well worth it! Roll dough up like a jelly roll. Take a knife and cut about 1/4 inch think. Unroll, and slice each strip in two (if you like longer noodles, don't slice in two). Put noodles into boiling stock. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chicken back to pot, and enjoy!
