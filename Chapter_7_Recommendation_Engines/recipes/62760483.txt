Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1-1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup chilled butter
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/2 cup raisins or currants (optional)
2 tablespoons turbinado sugar for topping (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400° F (200° C).
In a mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda and salt.
With a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in center of dry mixture; set aside.
In another bowl combine starter, pumpkin and egg. Add egg mixture all at once to dry mixture. Using a fork, stir just until moistened. Knead in raisins or currants.
Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface. Shape into 4” x 12” rectangle. Cut rectangle into quarters (4” x 3”) and cut each piece on the diagonal to form 8 wedges.
Place wedges 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheet. Top with turbinado sugar if desired.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden.
Serve warm with berry butter (Find it in My Recipe Box.)
ENJOY!
