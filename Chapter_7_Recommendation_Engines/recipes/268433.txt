Ingredients:
Cake:
3 eggs
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup powdered sugar
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan.
Place eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Beat on high speed until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Gradually add sugar, beating well. Stir in pumpkin and lemon juice.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a separate bowl. Fold into the egg mixture. Spoon batter into the prepared pan, spreading evenly into the corners.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Take care not to overbake.
Invert cake onto a clean dish towel. Sprinkle 1/4 cup powdered sugar on top. Lift up one long edge carefully and roll the cake into a log, wrapped in the towel. Set aside until cool, at least 15 minutes.
Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, margarine, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy. Unroll the cake and spread filling on top. Roll cake up again and refrigerate, seam-side down, until set.
