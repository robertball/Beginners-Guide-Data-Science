Ingredients:
Soft shell crabs
flour
garlic powder
dried parsley flakes
pepper
butter
oil

Directions:
Some people like using bread crumbs but I find it to be much to heavy as it covers up the taste of the crab.
In a zip lok bag fill with about 2 cups of flour. Add as much garlic powder as you desire. Do the same with the pepper and parsley flakes. Shake bag to combine and add the crabs one at a time to coat well. In a frying pan add some butter and a little oil. Saute about five mins. on each side and serve.   Remember, you can be as creative as you want and add any one of your personal favorite spices or herbs. If you'd like a little heat, just add some cayenne pepper. We make these every summer and my kids actually fight over the last crab!
