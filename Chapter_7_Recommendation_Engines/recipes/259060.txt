Ingredients:
6 chicken legs, skinned
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 hot chile pepper, seeded and minced
1/3 red bell pepper, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups chicken stock
2 pounds name root, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 ears fresh corn, cut in thirds
2 stalks celery, sliced
2 carrots, sliced
2 tablespoons recaito (such as Goya®)
2 tablespoons sofrito (such as Goya®)
4 cilantro leaves, minced
1/2 cup orzo pasta
1 teaspoon oregano leaves

Directions:
Place chicken legs in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, green bell pepper, hot chile pepper, red bell pepper, and garlic; cover pot and cook until soft, about 30 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the saucepan and bring to a boil; simmer until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, at least 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Add name root, corn, celery, carrots, recaito, sofrito, and cilantro. Cook soup until vegetables soft, at least 30 minutes more.
Stir orzo and oregano into the soup; cook until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.
