Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless ham
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple slices, canned in syrup
10 whole cloves
2 cups water
1 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Prick the ham with a fork. Place the pineapple slices on the ham, securing with toothpicks. Press the cloves into the ham. Place the ham in a baking dish with the water.
In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, and mix in the syrup, brown sugar, and honey until heated through. Pour 1/2 the mixture over the ham.
Bake the ham 1 hour and 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste frequently with the remaining butter and syrup mixture.
Remove the ham from heat, and drain pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until thickened, and serve with the ham.
