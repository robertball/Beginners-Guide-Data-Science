Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds salmon fillets, cut into 1 inch cubes
1/3 cup pesto
2 tablespoons butter
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
2 1/2 cups fish stock
2/3 cup dry white wine

Directions:
In a medium bowl, toss salmon fillets in pesto to coat.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, and saute shallots until tender. Stir in rice, fish stock, and wine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.
Without stirring rice, place salmon in the saucepan. Cover, and continue cooking 25 to 30 minutes, until rice is tender and salmon is easily flaked with a fork.

Description: 
This is a very unique recipe. The salmon in this recipe gets steamed by the water in the rice.  I was leery that this would never work, but it did, and everyone wanted it again!
