Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more if needed
1/2 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup Mexican-style hot tomato sauce (such as El Pato Salsa de Chile Fresco®)
1/2 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons mustard
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in hot oil until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease from the skillet. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker.
Stir Mexican-style hot tomato sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, cider vinegar, and chili powder into the beef mixture.
Cook on Low for 2 hours (or on High for 1 hour).

Description: 
I grew up a Manwich® kid, thinking they were the same as sloppy joes. I was dead wrong. This is the real deal. Messy, yummy, kid-friendly perfection especially on a cold night.
