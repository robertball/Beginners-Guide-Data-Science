Place chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and cook on high 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until mostly melted.

Description: 
This is a great hot fudge sauce to use for almost any chocolate dessert.  My mom gave me this recipe with a note that said, 'Use this sauce over brownies and vanilla ice cream to make 'Eskimo Pie Delight'. It was a favorite of mine from college.
