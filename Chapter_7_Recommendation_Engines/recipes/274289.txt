Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/2 cups diced strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 drop red food coloring, or as desired (optional)
1/4 cup water
Frosting:
2 cups heavy cream
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Combine strawberries and sugar in a bowl; stir well. Place in a refrigerator until a light syrup forms, about 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 cupcake cups or line with paper liners.
Combine cake mix, oil, eggs, and food coloring in a large bowl. Add strawberry compote and mix well. Pour in water slowly and mix until batter is blended.
Divide batter evenly between the prepared cupcake cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes.
Beat heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Fold in cream cheese until smooth. Frost completely cooled cupcakes.
