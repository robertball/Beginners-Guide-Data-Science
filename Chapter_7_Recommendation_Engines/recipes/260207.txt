Ingredients:
2 large onions, cut in 1/2 inch wedges
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 2-inch chunks
3/4 cup beef broth
1/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried oregano, crushed
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
16 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup thinly sliced radishes
1 cup pico de gallo
1/2 cup cilantro leaves
Lime wedges

Directions:
In a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker, place onions. Place beef on top of onions.
In a bowl, whisk together the beef broth, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, tomato paste, garlic, oregano, cayenne pepper, and salt until well combined. Pour over beef.
Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or high for 4 to 5 hours.
Using a slotted spoon, remove beef and onions from cooker. Coarsely shred beef with two forks, leaving some larger pieces intact. Skim fat from cooking liquid. Add enough of the cooking liquid to the beef mixture to moisten.
Fill warmed tortillas with beef mixture. Top each with some of the shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, pico de gallo, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.
