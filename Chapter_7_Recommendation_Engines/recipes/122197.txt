Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped*
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
3/4 cup halved, sliced sweet onion
4 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup fresh orange sections
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
8 lamb loin chops (1-inch thick)

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine orange juice, jalapeno, cumin, salt if desired and pepper.  Cook over medium-high heat until mixture begins to simmer.  Stir in onion.
Combine cornstarch and water until smooth; add to the sauce.  Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minute or until thickened and bubbly.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in oranges and cilantro; keep warm.
Grill the lamb chops, covered, over medium-hot heat for 12-14 minutes, turning once, or until a meat thermometer reads 140 degrees F rare; 160 degrees F, medium-well; or 170 degrees F, well done.  Serve with orange sauce.
