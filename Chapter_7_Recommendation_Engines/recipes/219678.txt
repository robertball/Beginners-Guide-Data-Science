Peach Pasta Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1/2 cup uncooked shell pasta
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon dried thyme
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup canola oil
4 peaches, peeled and cut into chunks
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup sliced celery
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
6 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, crumble the bacon and set aside.
Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in the shell pasta and return to a boil; cook the pasta uncovered over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still slightly firm, about 13 minutes.
Rinse pasta thoroughly in cold water several times to chill, and drain well.
Place the vinegar, sugar, basil, thyme, garlic, salt, curry powder, and black pepper into the pitcher of a blender; blend on high speed until smooth. Reduce blender speed to low and slowly pour the canola oil into the blender to make a creamy dressing.
Place the bacon, cooked pasta, peaches, parsley, celery, red bell pepper, and green onions into a large salad bowl and toss to combine.
Pour the dressing over the salad and toss again to coat with dressing.
Refrigerate salad for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I have been making for years. It was always a favorite of my kids, and now the grandkids love it as well. Goes great at any summer barbecue. I sometimes use mangos instead of the peach. If fresh basil and thyme are available, the recipe is even better.
