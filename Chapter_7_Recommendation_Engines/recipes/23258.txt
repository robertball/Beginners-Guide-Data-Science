Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda

3 teaspoons ground nutmeg
5 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 10 inch regular or fluted tube pan.
In a large bowl, beat together oil, eggs, pumpkin and vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Fold flour mixture into pumpkin mixture.  Pour into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake 15 minutes more, until cake springs back when lightly touched in center.  Let cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
To make the Honey Glaze:  Warm honey in microwave or small saucepan until runny.  Place confectioners sugar in small bowl and pour runny honey and lemon juice over sugar.  Mix well and brush onto cooled cake.
