Directions:
Steam the Cauliflower seasoned with more salt, replaced the lid, and steamed everything until it was soft (~10 minutes). You won’t overcook it — trust me.
Once the florets were done,place in food processor and added some fresh cracked pepper, microplaned nutmeg, and the butter. processes everything until smooth.
Chicken and Spinach in one pan
I crisped the seasoned thighs in my cast iron skillet with some coconut nut oil.…I poured out all but a tablespoon or two of grease from the pan and I tossed in a diced shallot. Once they were softened, I put in a pound of prewashed baby spinach and seasoned with salt and pepper.
