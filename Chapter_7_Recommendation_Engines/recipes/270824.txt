Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 onion, chopped
1/2 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAMÂ®), diced
6 ounces macaroni and Parmesan cheese mix
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
1 tablespoon heavy cream, or more to taste
1 avocado, diced
1 tomato, diced

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a frying pan. Stir in onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cooked luncheon meat; cook until crispy and browned, about 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
Stir in butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese packet included with pasta box into the pasta until cheese dissolves. Mix in meat and onion. Stir in diced avocado and tomato. Serve.
