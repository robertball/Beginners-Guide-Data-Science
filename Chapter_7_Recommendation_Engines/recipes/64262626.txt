2 Tbsp yeast
1 tsp sugar
1-1/2 cups warm water
1/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
4 cups flour
Cornmeal (optional)
Egg white (optional)

Directions:
In large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tsp sugar in warm water and let proof.
Add 1/4 cup sugar, 2 cups flour and eggs.  Beat until well mixed.  Add remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead for 8-10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, cover, and let rise until double.
Punch down and divide in half until you have 32 pieces.  Shape each piece into a ball and punch finger through center to make a bagel shape.  Let rise until double in size.
Boil water in a large pot.  Boil each bagel for 3 minutes, turning once after 1st minute.
Grease baking sheet and coat with cornmeal.  Place boiled bagels on baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes.  (Top with egg white if desired before baking.)
