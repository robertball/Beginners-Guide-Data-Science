Ingredients:
2 cups shortening
2 cups butter, softened
4 cups white sugar
4 cups packed light brown sugar
9 eggs
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
8 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
4 teaspoons baking soda
8 cups rolled oats
2 cups chopped pecans
2 cups shredded coconut
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups candy-coated milk chocolate pieces

Directions:
In a very large mixing bowl, cream together the shortening, the butter or margarine, the sugars, the eggs, and the vanilla.
Add to the mixing bowl the flour, the leavenings, the oats, the nuts, the coconut, the chocolate chips, and the M & M candies.
Drop dough by spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.  To make extra large cookies, drop by ice cream scoopfuls.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes, longer for large cookies.  Remove, and cool on wire racks.
