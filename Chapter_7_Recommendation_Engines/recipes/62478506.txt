Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
2 cups sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 large eggs
2 cups softened, not melted, butter
1/2 cup 2% milk
2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Combine all of your dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.  Add butter, milk, and vanilla to the dry ingredients.  Stir until just mixed then mix at medium speed for about 4 minutes.  Scrape bowl.
Add eggs one at a time and mix on low speed for 30 seconds after each egg.  Once all eggs are in the batter, mix at medium speed for 1 minute.  Batter will be thick and fluffy.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spoon batter into cupcake liners until 1/2 full.  If you fill them any more, you risk having a mess in your oven.
Bake your cupcakes for 20 minutes or until a cake tester, or toothpick, inserted into the center of the cupcakes comes out clean.
Cool your pound cake cupcakes completely in the cupcake pans.  Store in an airtight container.
