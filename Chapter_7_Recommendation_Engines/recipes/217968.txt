Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 pounds ground chicken
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup hot buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank'sÂ® REDHOT Buffalo Wing Sauce), or to taste
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
6 ounces Neufchatel cheese, softened
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
8 hamburger buns, split
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground chicken. Cook and stir until the chicken is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Stir in the onion, garlic, salt and black pepper; cook until the onion has softened, about 7 to 8 minutes.
Combine chicken stock, Buffalo wing sauce, red wine vinegar, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a bowl. Pour into the skillet with the chicken and add the Neufchatel and Cheddar cheese; simmer and stir until the cheeses have melted and everything is well combined. Serve on buns, and top with crumbled blue cheese.

Description: 
Guaranteed to be an instant comfort food favorite. Inspired by a Rachel Ray recipe, I have modified it by adding a creamy and cheesy kick to it.  You'll be dreaming about this dish. Feel free to play with the recipe. I put in the cream cheese and Cheddar to make it creamier.  I am a huge fan of Buffalo Chicken Dip and wanted this dish to be similar.
