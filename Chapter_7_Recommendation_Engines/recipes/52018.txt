Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup milk
3 cups finely chopped rhubarb
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch pan.
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Dissolve 1 cup sugar in boiling water, then add 3 tablespoons butter. Remove from heat, and set syrup aside to cool.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in 1/2 cup butter.  Stir in milk; mix lightly.  Roll out on a floured surface into a rectangle shape about 12 inches long.
In another bowl, combine rhubarb, cinnamon, and 1 cup sugar.  Spread evenly over roll, leaving a 1/2 inch edge.  Roll dough tightly lengthwise, and seal the seam.  Cut into twelve 1 inch sections.  Arrange rolls in prepared pan. Pour syrup over rolls.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until lightly browned.
