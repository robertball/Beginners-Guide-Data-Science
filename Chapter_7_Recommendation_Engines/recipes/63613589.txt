Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. salt
4 1/2 tsp. baking powder
6 T. granulated sugar
12 fluid oz. beer, room temperature
4 T. Herdez Tomatillo Verde Cooking Sauce
1/4 cup salted butter, melted
For Jelly:
3/4 cup apple jelly
6 tsp. Herdez Tomatillo Verde Cooking Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Spray a 9 x 5 loaf pan with cooking spray (or lightly grease it).
In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, sugar, beer, and Herdez sauce.
Mix just until blended. Do not over mix.
Pour mixture into prepared pan.
Pour melted butter on top.
Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 45 - 60 minutes, until browned and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
After bread cools in pan for 10 minutes, turn it out onto a wire rack to finish cooling.
While bread is cooling, mix together the jelly and the Herdez Cooking sauce, adding more or less according to the amount of heat you want.

Description: 
Beer Bread has always been a favorite of mine. With this recipe, I've added a little Mexican sizzle to it. I'm a wimp, so you may want to add more of the cooking sauce to amp up the heat factor. The bread can stand on its own with your favorite Mexican dinner, or you can toast it and add the jelly for a breakfast that will wake you up and have you shouting, Ole!
