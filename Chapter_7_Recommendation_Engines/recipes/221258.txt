Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix with pudding
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
2 eggs
1 (12 ounce) package whipped cream cheese
1/4 cup strawberry preserves
1 (16 ounce) container whipped cream cheese frosting
12 strawberries, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Stir chocolate cake mix, sour cream, vegetable oil, water, and eggs together in a large bowl.
Pour cake batter evenly into prepared muffin cups.
Place a small spoonful of whipped cream cheese in each muffin cup.
Stir strawberry preserves in a bowl until smooth; spoon about 1/4 teaspoon per cupcake over cream cheese.
Gently press strawberry preserves and cream cheese into the cake batter with a spoon.
Bake in preheated oven until cupcake tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes.
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Spread cream cheese frosting over completely cooled cupcakes and garnish with strawberry slices.
