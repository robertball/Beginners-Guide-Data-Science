Ingredients:
1 lb hamburger (20-25% fat)
1 teaspoon salt
pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons flour
a little milk

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients and shape into meatballs.  Brown in a large frying pan. Put the browned meatballs in a casserole dish and place in an oven heated to 350 degrees.  Make gravy from the remaining juices in the frying pan, using flour, water, salt & pepper to taste. I sometimes add a little sugar to the gravy, too.

Description: 
My great-aunt Simonne would make these (Forsberg family recipe)Authentic Swedish meatballs served with fresh cooked green beans and boiled potatoes whenever we visited Middleboro, MA when I was a little girl.  She made them especially for me because she knew I loved them so much. We would often have her homemade Boston Cream Pie for dessert.
