Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cans of refried beans
1.5 lbs. of hamburger
2 packs of taco seasoning
1 - 24 oz tub of sour cream
16 oz. of guacamole
1 jar of La Victoria mild or medium salsa
1 bag of kraft mexican shredded cheese
1 small can of black olives

Directions:
brown the hamburger - add one package of the taco seasoning. Mix the beans and hamburger together, then spread into the bottom of your dish - I usually use a glass 9 x 11 baking dish.
Mix the sour cream and guacamole together, adding one half of the second pack of taco seasoning. This is your second layer. Pour entire jar of salsa on, this is your third layer. Empty the bag of cheese onto the salsa - spreading around for an even layer. THis is your fourth layer. Then scatter the can of black olives on.
This is wonderful with the meat and beans still warm or served cold later in the day. Microwave for about 45 seconds the next day for lunch!
