Ingredients:
1/4 cup gin
1 fluid ounce Russian vodka
1 tablespoon Lillet blanc
ice cubes
1 lemon twist

Directions:
Pour gin, vodka, and Lillet over ice. Shake or stir (remember, Bond doesn't give a damn anymore!), then strain into a martini glass. Garnish with lemon twist. Enjoy, preferably while dressed in a tux and betting the Crown Jewels at the poker table.

Submitter: 
c-biskit
Description: 
This is the version of the martini that Bond orders in Casino Royale. Make it like Bond: 'I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well made.'
