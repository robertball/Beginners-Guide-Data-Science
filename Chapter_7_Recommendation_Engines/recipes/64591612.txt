Ingredients:
6 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs
¼ cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons coconut aminos (or soy sauce/tamari)
1 tablespoon raw apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon finely minced garlic
1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Whisk together all marinade ingredients.
Put the chicken in a ziplok bag or a marinating container and pour the marinade over. Turn to coat well.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 375F.
Line a baking sheet with foil and lightly coat with oil to prevent sticking.
Place the chicken parts skin side down on the foil. Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully turn chicken over. Bake for 20 minutes more or until juices run clear and the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
