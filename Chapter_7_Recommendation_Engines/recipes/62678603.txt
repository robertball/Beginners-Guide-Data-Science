Ingredients:
4  Beef tenderloin steaks (Filet Mingon) about 8 ozs  patted dry .....
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil.....
1 shallet (chopped).....
4 Tablespoon Butter.....
Sea salt.....
1 tablespoon black peppercorns coarsely crushed.....
1 cup of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon wine or Pinot Noir is best)

Directions:
Sprinkle the strip steaks with sea salt on both sides, and then press the crushed peppercorns into the steaks on both sides. Set a large skillet (I use cast iron) over medium-high heat and add the olive oil with one tablespoon of butter. When the oil/butter is very hot, add the steaks, cooking until nicely browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side.      Check for doneness with a instant read meat thermometer ....medium rare 130-135Â°F   Remember meat will still cook slightly while resting.  We don't want overdone tenderloin steak. Keep warm.
Remove most of the fat from the skillet. Put the skillet back on the burner and heat to medium high. Add the chopped shallot and saute until translucent and tender.  Add the wine and cook until it's reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 7 min., scraping up the browned bits with a wooden spoon. Whisk in the butter until completely melted. Taste and adjust the seasonings, drizzle the sauce over the steaks, and serve immediately.
