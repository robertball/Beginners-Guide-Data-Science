Description: 
This dish is served hot, and is the best bean salad I've ever had. I make it with black beans, kidney beans, green beans, wax beans, and garbanzo beans. You may not like one or more of the types of beans listed above - just substitute your favorites. This dish is especially good for taking to potluck suppers.
