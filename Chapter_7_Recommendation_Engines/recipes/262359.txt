Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained
salt to taste
Â½ cup cornmeal
ground cinnamon, or more to taste
olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Slice tofu into 1/8-inch-thick slices, laying pieces on a paper towel as you go. Season each side lightly with salt.
Place cornmeal in a shallow bowl; add a pinch of salt and cinnamon and stir.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Dip each side of the tofu slices in the cornmeal mixture; gently tap off excess. Place tofu in the hot saucepan and cook until golden brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
