Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 cups shredded zucchini
2 large onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground thyme
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup crushed saltine crackers
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, onion, and garlic in hot oil until vegetables are limp and moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir basil, parsley, black pepper, and thyme into the vegetables; remove from heat. Transfer zucchini mixture to a large mixing bowl.
Stir eggs, crushed crackers, and 1 cup Parmesan cheese into the zucchini mixture until it binds together; shape into 14 3-inch patties.
Pour enough vegetable oil in a skillet to reach about 1/2 inch deep; heat over medium-high heat.
Cook patties, 3 to 4 at a time, in hot oil until well browned, about 2 minutes per side. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese to serve.
