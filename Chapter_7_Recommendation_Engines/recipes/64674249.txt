Ingredients:
10 whole chicken wings, cut into flats and drumettes. ( Discard tips or use for a stock. That leaves you with 20 wing pieces total).

sauce or dry rub

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250°F.
Place a rack onto a cookie sheet.
Dry wing pieces with paper towel.
In a large bowl, toss the flats and drumettes with the baking powder and salt. Place wings on the rack in single layer and cook for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes, leave them in there and raise the heat to 425°F until brown and crispy, 40-50 minutes.
Take wings out and let rest 5 minutes. Toss in a delicious sauce or dry rub and serve.
