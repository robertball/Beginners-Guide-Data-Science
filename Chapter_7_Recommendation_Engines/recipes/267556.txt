Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
4 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese
4 tablespoons diced cooked ham
4 eggs
chopped fresh chives (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unfold pastry sheet on a flat surface and cut into 4 squares.
Place 2 pastry squares in the air fryer basket and cook 6 to 8 minutes.
Remove basket from air fryer. Use a metal tablespoon to press each square gently to form an indentation. Place 1 tablespoon of Cheddar cheese and 1 tablespoon ham in each hole and pour 1 egg on top of each.
Return basket to air fryer. Cook to desired doneness, about 6 minutes more. Remove tarts from basket and let cool 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining pastry squares, cheese, ham, and eggs.
Garnish tarts with chives.
