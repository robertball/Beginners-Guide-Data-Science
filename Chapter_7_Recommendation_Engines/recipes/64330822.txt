Description: 
I created this recipe on day after school many many years ago. My parents loved it then and my family loves it now! I've refined the ingredients with things like steaming bags and flavored Ritz, but essentially it's still the same. The creamy combination of the mushroom soup and the sour cream is perfect. Add to that the gooey  melted cheese and crunchy cracker topping, what's not to like?  My boys will eat 3 helpings each!
