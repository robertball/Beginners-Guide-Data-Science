Ingredients:
1 cup dry mung beans or moong, sprouted (see tutorial above)
1 tsp vegetable oil
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 tomato, finely diced
2 green chillies, slit through the middle
2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp cumin powder
¼ tsp turmeric powder
2 tsp garam masala (use goda masala if you have this)
Juice of ½ lemon
1 tsp sugar (optional)
¼ cup finely chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)
Salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large wok or kadhai or saucepan
Add the onions and a pinch of salt. Saute until the onions start to turn golden-brown.
Add the garlic and green chillies and saute for a few seconds.
Add the tomatoes, turmeric, garam masala, coriander and cumin powders and cook until the tomato starts to break down but isn't quite mushy.
Add the sprouted mung beans and mix well. Cover and let the beans cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes. Stir every once in a while and, if needed, add a couple of tablespoons of water to prevent sticking. You can let the beans cook longer if you want them to be softer. I like mine a little al dente with some crunch to them.
Add salt to taste, sugar and the lemon juice. Mix in the coriander leaves.
Serve hot.
