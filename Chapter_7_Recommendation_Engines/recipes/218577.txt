Ingredients:
1 pound fettuccine
1/4 pound pancetta bacon, diced
1 quart heavy cream, divided
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 pint cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil
ground black pepper
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Place the pancetta in a large, deep skillet, and cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain the pancetta on a paper towel-lined plate.
Heat 1/2 of the heavy cream in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in the fettuccine, and bring to a boil. Add the remaining heavy cream, garlic, pancetta, tomatoes, and basil. Cook and stir until the sauce is reduced, about 15 minutes. Season with pepper. Top with Parmesan cheese before serving.

Description: 
This looks complicated, but it is so simple.  I came up with this recipe when I needed to use up a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes and basil from my patio garden. It is rich and creamy and a perfect fettuccine for a warm summer night. I served this with a crisp white wine......perfecto!
