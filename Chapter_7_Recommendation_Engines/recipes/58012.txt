Ingredients:
2 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 bunches collard greens - rinsed, stemmed and thinly sliced
4 slices bacon
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 cup red wine vinegar

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Before the potatoes are finished, add the collards to the pot.
Place bacon in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to paper towels to drain, and saute the onion in bacon grease until tender. Drain onions of grease, and add to the greens. Crumble in the bacon, and stir in the wine vinegar. Simmer over low heat until greens are tender, about 1 hour.
