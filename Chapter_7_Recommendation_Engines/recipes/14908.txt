Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup pesto
1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers

Directions:
Slice each block of cream cheese lengthwise. Line a loaf pan with plastic wrap. Place one strip of cream cheese between two layers of plastic wrap. Flatten the cheese with a rolling pin until it is the same size as the loaf pan's bottom. Place the cream cheese into the loaf pan. Spread pesto (about 1/4 inch thick) over the cream cheese. Repeat this process until all of the pesto and cream cheese has been used. The final layer should be cream cheese. Fold the plastic wrap over the final layer, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
When you are ready to serve, gently remove the torta from the loaf pan. Unwrap the plastic wrap. Place drained, roasted red peppers over the top of the torta.
