Ingredients:
1 teaspoon unsalted butter, or as needed
6 large fresh peaches
3/4 cup white sugar, divided
3/4 cup packed light brown sugar, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 orange, zested
1 (6 ounce) container fresh raspberries
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup oats (such as Quaker OatsÂ®)
2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8x10-inch glass baking dish.
Bring a stockpot full of water to a rapid boil. Plunge peaches gently into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and place into a bowl of ice water. Peel peaches, cut each into 8 wedges, and place in a large mixing bowl.
Add 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and orange zest to the bowl with the peaches. Mix well to coat. Fold in raspberries. Let sit for 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1 cup flour, remaining 1/2 cup white sugar, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, oats, butter, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix topping until well combined into pea-sized crumbs.
Pour fruit mixture into the prepared baking dish. Cover fruit evenly with crumble topping. Place the baking dish on a cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and fruit juices are bubbling, about 1 hour.
Remove crisp from the oven and let cool, 45 minutes to 1 hour before serving.
