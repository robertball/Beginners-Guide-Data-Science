1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
3 cooked, boneless chicken breast halves, diced (marinate and/or saute with onion and garlic, seasonings)
2 (16 ounce) jars garlic Alfredo-style pasta sauce
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 pints ricotta cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Cook spinach according to package directions; drain.
In a medium bowl, combine chicken and one jar of alfredo sauce, stir together.  In a separate bowl, combine ricotta and drained, cooked spinach, and stir.
In a 9 x 13 baking dish, place one layer of lasagna noodles, edges overlapping.  Pour chicken and alfredo sauce mixture over noodle layer and spread evenly.  Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella over chicken mixture.  Top with another layer of noodles.  Spread spinach mixture evenly over noodles.  Pour 1/2 of remaining jar of alfredo sauce over spinach mixture, spread evenly.  Sprinkle another cup of mozzarella over sauce, lay on the final noodle layer and top with remaining 2 cups of mozzarella and salt and pepper to taste.  Bake 50 to 60 minutes, until top is brown and bubbly.
