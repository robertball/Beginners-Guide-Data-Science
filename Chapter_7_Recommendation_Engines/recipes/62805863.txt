https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/3 cups dark corn syrup
2 t. vanilla
3 T. butter, melted
1 cup (or more) pecans halves
1 unbaked 9" pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  In a large bowl beat eggs.  Add all other ingredients except pecans and crust, and mix well.  Place the pecans in the bottom of the pie crust and carefully pour in filling.  You may need to add more pecans so the top is completely covered.  When adding more pecans, dunk them down into the filling using a toothpick so they are completely coated.  Bake for 45-60 minutes or until  the tip of a sharp knife inserted into the center of the pie comes out clean.  You may need to reduce the heat to 350 degrees and cover the pie crust if it is getting brown too fast.

This was the recipe my mother always used.  She got it out of our local newspaper many years ago.  Once you've made this one, you won't go looking any further!
