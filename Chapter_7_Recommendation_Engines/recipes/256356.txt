Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
2 tablespoons sea salt
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground paprika
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1/2 large white onion, finely chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup finely crushed unsalted saltine crackers

Directions:
Place ground beef into a large bowl and break into smaller pieces. Cover with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, mustard, paprika, and dill weed; knead thoroughly. Knead in onion, egg, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in crackers until thoroughly incorporated.
Shape beef mixture into 5-ounce, 1/2-inch thick patties.
Preheat a grill pan over medium heat. Grill patties until an instant-read thermometer into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 5 to 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
You won't need ketchup or mustard! This savory blend of spices will be enough for any person. This may even make you forget you're eating ground beef. Serve with a light gravy, garlic mashed potato and veg of your choice. I like Italian green beans.
