Description: 
There are a couple of Christmas traditions in our family...
Every year it has become a tradition to make Russ’s favorite eggnog for all my sisters, keep the Gluhwine warm on the stove so the whole house smells like oranges and cloves and bake Christmas cookies (you probably didn’t know this because they just don’t last very long!) and watch “It’s a wonderful Life” with Jimmy Stewart.
