Description: 
My mother often made this lovely fruit-topped cheese-cake. Now our grown sons consider it my 'signature dessert'. Sometimes, I bake and freeze the cheesecake ahead. On the day I serve it, I thaw it, then add the fruit.                               -Christine Eilerts                                Tulsa, Oklahoma
