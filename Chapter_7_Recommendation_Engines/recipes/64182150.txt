Ingredients:
MEATBALL INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 lbs ground pork
1 onion, diced (half is for the meatballs and the other half is for the sauce)
3 cloves of minced or pressed garlic (half is for the meatballs and the other half is for the sauce)
1/3 cup almond flour (or bread crumbs)
2 eggs whisked
2 tsp paprika
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (leaves only)
CHIPOTLE SAUCE INGREDIENTS
28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (we used San Marzano)
14 oz can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes, with liquid
The other half of the diced onions and garlic (see meatball ingredients above)
1 fresh Anaheim pepper (or other mild pepper of your choice) diced
1 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (use 1 pepper chopped, plus 2 tsp of the adobo sauce)
3 tsp chili powder
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp of salt
1/2 tsp ground pepper

Directions:
Sauté all the diced onion in a saucepan with 2-3 tsp of olive or coconut oil over medium heat for about 4-5 minutes
Add all the garlic and cook for one more minute
Remove from heat
Now divide the sautéed garlic and onions - put half in the crock pot, and put the other in a medium mixing bowl
Add remaining chipotle sauce ingredients to crock pot
Add the remaining meatball ingredients to a medium bowl, and mix gently with your hands
Preheat a frying pan with coconut or olive oil over medium heat
Form meatballs by hand – each about the size of a golf ball
Place meatballs in the heated frying pan to get a nice brown crust (they'll still be raw in the middle but will cook through in the crock pot)
Transfer browned meatballs directly to the crock pot with the tomato sauce
Slow cook everything on low setting 5-6 hours
Serve over a bed of cauliflower lime rice or regular lime rice
