Ingredients:
1/2 (12 ounce) package NO YOLKS® Extra Broad Noodles
2 cups chopped green beans (fresh or thawed if frozen)
1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
4 (4 ounce) boneless, skinless salmon fillets
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
1 cup torn fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Add the green beans 4 minutes before draining.
Whisk the vinegar with the syrup, mustard, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) each salt and pepper until combined. Whisk in the olive oil until well combined. Measure out and reserve 2 tablespoon (30 mL) of the dressing. Toss the hot cooked noodles and beans with the onion, red pepper, basil and remaining dressing.
Meanwhile, lightly coat a nonstick pan with cooking spray and set over medium heat. Season the salmon with the remaining salt and pepper. Add the salmon and cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until just a hint of coral remains. Brush salmon with reserved dressing. Serve the noodle mixture topped with a piece of salmon.
