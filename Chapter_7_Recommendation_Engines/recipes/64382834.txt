Ingredients:
One salmon fillet
Kosher salt
Your favorite teriyaki sauce

Directions:
Lay down a sheet of wax paper. Sprinkle 1 tsp of kosher salt on it.
Lay the fish fillet, skin-side down, on the salted wax paper.
Sprinkle about 1 tsp kosher salt over the fillet.
Let the fillet sit for about 30 minutes while the salt absorbs into the fillet.
Before broiling, brush a simple teriyaki sauce onto the skin.
Broil the salmon under 500 degree heat for 4 minutes.
Remove and brush again with sauce.
Broil until desired doneness (4-6 minutes).

Description: 
Good salmon teriyaki has very subtle flavor and extremely crisp skin. It gets that way because of a Japanese cooking trick.
