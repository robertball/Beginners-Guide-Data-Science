Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup oats
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup defatted soy flour
1 ounce fat-free cream cheese, softened
Filling:
2 1/2 (8 ounce) packages fat-free cream cheese
12 ounces fat-free small curd cottage cheese
3/4 cup skim milk
1/2 cup liquid egg substitute (such as Egg Beaters®)
1 3/4 cups granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1 cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt (such as Fage® Total 0%)
1/4 cup defatted soy flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie pan.
Pulse graham cracker crumbs, oats, water, soy flour, and cream cheese together in a food processor or blender on high until smooth. Press crust mixture into greased pie pan.
Mix cream cheese, cottage cheese, milk, and liquid egg substitute in a blender until completely smooth. Pour into a large mixing bowl. Add sweetener, yogurt, soy flour, and vanilla extract and mix well. Pour filling into crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until top begins to brown, about 1 hour. Let cool completely, 3 to 4 hours. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
This cheesecake is essentially fat-free! And guess what? It tastes exactly like (or in my opinion better than) regular cheesecake. Full of protein, this is an excellent choice for breakfast, snacks, or dessert if you are looking to stay lean (and in some cases, mean). Any fruit, chocolate, etc., can be added if you'd like!
