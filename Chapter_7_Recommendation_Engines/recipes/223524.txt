Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
1/2 cup chilled solid vegetable shortening, cut into cubes
1/4 cup chilled vodka
1/4 cup cold water

Directions:
Whisk flour and salt together in a mixing bowl.
Cut the cold butter and then the shortening into the flour mixture with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Sprinkle vodka and water over the top of the mixture. Fold together ingredients until mixture sticks together to form a tacky dough. Divide dough into 2 halves; flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour to 2 days.
When you are ready to make your pie, remove dough from refrigerator, roll each piece out for your pie from the middle to the edge. Bake according to your pie directions.

Description: 
Easier to roll out than normal pie crust, but still with a flaky crust. It is VERY important that the ingredients be cold. This is what helps produce a flaky crust. This recipe is for an unsweetened pie crust. Just add sugar if you would like a sweetened crust.
