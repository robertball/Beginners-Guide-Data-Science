Ingredients:
18 ounces lo mein noodles
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 teaspoon chopped ginger
1 (16 ounce) package frozen stir-fry vegetables
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 green onions, finely sliced
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lo mein in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook for 30 seconds. Add stir-fry vegetables and cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add soy sauce and green onions and cook 3 minutes more. Add cooked noodles and sugar and mix well. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Remove from heat, add sesame oil, and stir. Transfer to a platter and serve immediately.
