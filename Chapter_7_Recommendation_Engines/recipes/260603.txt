1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion and garlic have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Place chicken breasts in the bottom of a slow cooker; add onion, garlic, vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, sweet potatoes, quinoa, green onions, mushrooms, curry powder, oregano, pepper, and bay leaf and mix well. Cook on Low until chicken is tender, 7 to 8 hours.

Description: 
Slow cookers are so great for those times when you want a fuss-free dinner. You can literally throw everything in it and leave it all day so you have a lovely wholesome meal waiting for you at dinner time. 

We left this stew in the slow cooker for 8 hours on a low heat but if you want it ready bit sooner than that, you can turn the heat up to medium and it should be ready in about 4 hours.
