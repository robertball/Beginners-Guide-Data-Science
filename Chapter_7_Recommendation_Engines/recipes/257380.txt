Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package spaghetti
5 ounces guanciale (cured pork cheek), cut into small cubes
3 egg yolks
1 egg
3/4 cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir guanciale until crisp, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk egg yolks and egg together in a bowl; add Pecorino-Romano cheese, salt, and pepper and whisk well. Stir in guanciale. Add spaghetti and toss until evenly coated.

Description: 
Unlike a lot of recipes out there for spaghetti carbonara, this is the true Italian recipe from an Italian! You can't get more authentic than this recipe! Top with extra Pecorino-Romano cheese, salt, and pepper. Note there's no cream, just eggs, and Pecorino Romano cheese is used, not Parmesan.
