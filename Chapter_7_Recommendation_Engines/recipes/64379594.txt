Ingredients:
1 mini Joseph's pita pocket
1/2 cup Bolognese sauce (any other chunky pasta sauce will work too)
1 slice provolone cheese
1 tbsp Parmesan cheese
2 tbsp mozzerella or any other cheese of choice (optional)
1 handful baby spinach
1 tsp coconut oil

Directions:
1. Cut the pita pocket in half and open it
2. Cut the provolone in half and place into both halves of the pita
3. Add other cheeses to the pockets
4. Place spinach in the pockets being careful to keep the pockets as flat as possible
5. Fill the pockets with the pasta sauce, almost to the point where it is overflowing
6. Heat the coconut oil in a small skillet over low medium heat
7. Once the coconut oil is heated, place both halves of the pita in the skillet for about 1-3 minutes then flip and let them warm for another 1-3 minutes. Make sure to place the pita in the skillet with the openings towards the sides of the skillet at an upward angle to keep most of the sauce inside the pita
8. Place the pita on a microwaveable plate and microwave for 30 seconds. Serve immediately.
