Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 (15.5 ounce) cans garbanzo beans
salt and pepper to taste
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
1 cup acini di pepe pasta

Directions:
Combine the tomatoes, olive oil and 1 1/2 cans of the beans in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Puree the remaining 1/2 can of garbanzo beans using a blender or food processor, and stir into the saucepan. Place the sprigs of rosemary into the pan without breaking off the leaves. The sprigs will be removed before serving.
Add acini de pepe pasta and simmer until pasta is soft, stirring gently to prevent sticking. Remove rosemary, and season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I picked up in Italy a few years ago.  Being that I'm not a soup fan, I was somewhat hesitant...  but this thick and hearty soup quickly won my praise.  It will quickly become a favorite recipe!
