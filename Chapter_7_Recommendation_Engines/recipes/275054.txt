Description: 
Pitaya, also known as dragon fruit, comes in various colors, from white to red to yellow. Any one of them will do in this agua fresca. No need to remove or strain out the seeds since the blender will almost pulverize them. Freshly squeezed lime juice is used for a more authentic Mexican agua fresca but lemon juice can also be used. Serve cold and over ice.
