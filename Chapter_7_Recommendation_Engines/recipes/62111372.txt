Ingredients:
2 cans white kidney beans, one drained and one undrained
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 large carrot, peeled and finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large tomato, finely chopped
1 teaspoon chicken boullion granules
1 large Idaho potato, peeled and diced
1 bay leaf
1 very small sprig rosemary, about 1 inch long
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a deep, 10 inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering.  Add onion, garlic and chopped carrot and cook without browning for approximately 5 minutes.
Add tomato, potato, chicken granules, bay leaf, rosemary sprig and the liquid from the one undrained can of beans to skillet. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and cook covered for 10 to 15 minutes or until carrots and potatoes are tender.
Remove cover and add beans and thyme to skillet.  Stir gently as not to break the beans.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Replace lid and simmer gently for 5 minutes until heated through.
Remove bay leaf and rosemary sprig and serve.
