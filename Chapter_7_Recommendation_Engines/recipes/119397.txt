Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
2 (.25 ounce) packages quick-rise yeast
2 1/2 cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees F/50 degrees C)
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
FROSTING:
6 tablespoons butter, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 4 cups flour, dry cake mix, yeast and warm water until smooth.  Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.  Roll each portion into a 14-in. x 10-in. rectangle.  Brush with butter; sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.  Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side.  Cut each roll into 12 slices; place cut side down in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pans.  Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 20 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool for 20 minutes.  For frosting, in a mixing bowl, cream butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla.  Add enough milk to achieve desired consistency.  Frost warm rolls.
