Ingredients:
2 links Italian Spicy sausage
1/8 cup onion, diced (to taste)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can Rotel
8oz tomato sauce
1 T tomato paste
1 T oregano
2 T sherry (or white wine, or vodka)
1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream
Parmeseano Reg (I can't spell it right now - but the good stuff) cheese.

Directions:
Remove sausage from casings, crumble, and saute over medium/high heat until done.
While they're cooking (and just about done) toss in the onion and garlic (being careful not to burn garlic).  Drain sausage if necessary (mine are pretty lean), and return to pan.
Add tomatoes, rotel, sauce, oregano and paste and bring to a simmer.
Add sherry (have a taste for yourself) and mix thoroughly.
Add cream (I felt 1/2 cup was too much), bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until slightly thickened.
Sample, and adjust seasonings to taste.
Serve over hot pasta and liberally dress with parm cheese and freshly chopped parsley.

Description: 
This was inspired by a Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce I was trying to make - only I had to use a hodge-podge of ingredients.  But BAMM!  This stuff ROCKS! (If you like spicy creamy in your face sauce, that is).
