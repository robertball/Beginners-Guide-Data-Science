Ingredients:
4 large chicken breasts
8 ounces cream cheese
2 cans of condensed soup. EITHER cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, cream of celery, or condensed cheese soup. Two different soups is preferred.
2 Tablespoons Dry Ranch Dressing mix.
Cooked Rice or Noodles
1 Head Steamed Broccoli

Directions:
Combine all ingredients (except the rice or noodles) in the crockpot, in the order listed. Do not add any additional liquid. Simmer on low 6-8 hours, or high 4-6 hours, depending on your crockpot. When you are ready to serve, simply stir or whisk sauce until cream cheese is smooth. Serve over rice or noodles, with  steamed broccoli.
As an additional time saver, if you are boiling noodles,  simply add the broccoli to the noodle water, boiling for the last 3 minutes of cooking. Or, allow the broccoli to steam on top of the nearly finished rice for the last 5-10 minutes.
