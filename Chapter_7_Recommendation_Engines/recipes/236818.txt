Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
1 onion, diced
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons salt
1 pound fresh spinach
1 (12 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and diced

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving about 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon.
Heat reserved bacon drippings over medium heat; cook and stir onion in hot bacon drippings until slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and salt together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar and salt are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Add bacon and onion and simmer over low heat until dressing is blended, 3 minutes.
Mix spinach, mushrooms, and eggs together in a large bowl. Pour dressing over spinach mixture; toss to coat.

Description: 
Fresh baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, and boiled eggs are topped with a hot bacon vinaigrette with caramelized onions. Very satisfying and earthy! This is also great topped with grape tomatoes for a little tart pop reminiscent of a nice BLT.
