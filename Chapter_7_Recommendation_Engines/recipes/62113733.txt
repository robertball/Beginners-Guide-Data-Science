Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my son and I in turn gave it to the Deli Department at our local grocery store where it became an instant hit and is a weekly feature on the lunch menu! Not too hot, this heat may be increased with addition of fresh hot peppers. Serve with more cheese and crumbled tortillas chips
