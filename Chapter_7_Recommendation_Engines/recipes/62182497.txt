Ingredients:
Hot Water Crust Pastry
350g/12 oz all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
125g/5oz lard
150ml/1-1/4 pt water
Filling
900g/2lbs coarsely ground pork (2/3rds lean to 1/3rd fat)
2 teaspoons salt
black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried sage
beaten egg for glazing.

Directions:
For pastry, sift flour and salt into a mixing bowl.  Cut the lard into 4 pieces and add to a pan with the water.  Place over moderate heat and bring gradually to the boil.  As soon as it boils pour immediately into the center of the flour.  Beat well with a wooden  spoon until the mixture clings together in a ball, leaving the sides of the bowl clean.  When cool enough to handle, knead lightly until smooth.
Grease a 6" springform pan with lard then lightly dust with flour.  Knead the pastry thoroughly until smooth.  cut off a 1/4 of it wrap in saranwrap and put to one side.  Put the remaining pastry into the tin and gently mold it around until it comes to about 1/2" above the rim of the tin.  Make certain there are no holes in the pastry.  Pack the meat into the pastry case then brush the edges with beaten egg.  Roll out remaining pastry and put on top of pie.  Seal edges with a fork.  Make a fairly large hole in the top to allow steam to escape.  Bake in a 425 oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 and bake for 45 mins. more. Carefully remove the pie from the pan.  Brush the pastry all over with beaten egg.  Put back in the oven for 30 more minutes.  Remove from oven.  Allow to cool.
