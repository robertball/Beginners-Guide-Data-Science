Ingredients:
1/2 pound dried elbow macaroni
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
2 medium carrots, quartered lengthwise and sliced
1 large zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano leaves
salt and pepper
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, plus
1 (10.75 ounce) can water
crumbled feta cheese (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, and set aside.
Brown ground beef with garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Strain off fat, if necessary. When meat is lightly browned, add carrots and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in zucchini and oregano, and continue cooking another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
When vegetables are tender, stir in tomato soup, water, and prepared elbow macaroni, and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with crumbled feta cheese on top, if desired.
