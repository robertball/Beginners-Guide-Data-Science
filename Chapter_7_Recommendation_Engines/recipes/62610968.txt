Ingredients:
1 pound chicken breasts, cooked and diced
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups half and half
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 stalks celery, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, shredded
1 small to medium sized onion, diced
1- 6 ounce bag baby spinach
1- 16oz. package potato gnocchi (I used the mini ones)
Salt and pepper, to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in about 2 tablespoons cold water (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in pot over medium heat.
Saute the onion, celery, garlic and carrots, until onion becomes translucent.
Add chicken and chicken stock. Bring to a boil.
Add gnocchi and gently boil until they are done (about 3-4 minutes).
Add half and half and allow to heat through.
Add spinach and cook until just wilted.
Combine cornstarch and water to make a slurry, if using.
Bring soup to a gentle boil and add slurry, optional, a little at a time, until desired thickness is achieved.
Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
Serve and enjoy!
