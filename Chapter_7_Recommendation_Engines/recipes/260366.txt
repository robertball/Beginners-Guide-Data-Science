Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans asparagus, drained
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1 (13.5 ounce) can spinach, drained
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup vegetable broth, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese (such as Kerrygold™ Dubliner), sliced

Directions:
Spread asparagus across the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Scatter artichoke hearts on top. Place the casserole dish in the oven; this will remove some residual moisture from the vegetables as the oven heats.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place spinach and mushrooms in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave until moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes.
Transfer spinach and mushrooms into a pot over medium heat. Add heavy cream, cream cheese, and broth. Cook and stir continuously until cream cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in Italian seasoning and garlic powder; cook until flavors meld, about 3 minutes.
Remove casserole from the oven; pour sauce over the vegetables. Top with Cheddar cheese slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is lightly browned and edges are crumbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Creamy, cheesy, keto-friendly vegetables. Bonus: All of the ingredients can be found at Costco®! Our family loved it. Throw something crunchy on top of the finished product if desired, such as Parmesan crackers or bacon crumbles.
