Ingredients:
2 (12 ounce) packages fresh cranberries
2 cups white sugar
1 1/4 cups fresh orange juice
1 cup fresh lemon juice

Directions:
In a large pot, add cranberries and enough water to cover.  Boil until cranberries begin to pop.  Drain and put through a food mill placed over a large bowl.
While still warm add sugar to dissolve in the warm berries.  The amount of sugar may vary depending on the tartness of the berries, so if you decide to add more sugar remember that the mixture will be tarter when it has been frozen.
After dissolving the sugar in the berries, stir in fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Pour in 8 or 9 inch square pan and freeze overnight.  Take out of the freezer 5-10 minutes before cutting.
