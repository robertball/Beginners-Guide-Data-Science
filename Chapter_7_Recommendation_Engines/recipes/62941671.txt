Ingredients:
2 Cups Wholemeal Flour
2 Teaspoons Baking powder
2 Tablespoons Canola Oil
½ cup dried Cranberries (chopped)
½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
¼ Cup water (additional 1/8 cup of water may be required)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheets (I use my Pampered Chef large stoneware bar pans.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, coconut and cranberries.
Make a well in the center of the flour and add the oil, mix with an electric mixer on medium speed until it resembles crumbs.
Add first the ¼ cup of water, and mix until combined (add the extra water a bit at a time if required).  The mixture should form a soft dough.
Kneed dough on a floured surface for a good minute.  Roll the dough out until ¼ inch think.  Cut with your favorite cookie cutter.
Bake in the hot oven for 30 minutes, once the initial 30 minutes is up.  Turn off the oven but leave the biscuits in the warm but off over for a further 30 minutes to crisp.
