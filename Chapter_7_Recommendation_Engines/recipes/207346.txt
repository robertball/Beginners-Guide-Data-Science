Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 (4 ounce) fillets halibut
1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 sprig cilantro

Directions:
Combine the water and 1 tablespoon salt in a shallow container. Soak the fish in the salt water for 10 minutes.
Mix the turmeric, coriander, paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Remove fish from the salt water and pat dry with paper towels. Coat fish on both sides with spice mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook fish in hot oil until it flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Serve garnished with cilantro.

Description: 
This recipe is actually something my husband makes on a regular basis and everyone raves about it!!! it's very good. He mostly uses halibut to make this but salmon or cod work very well also.
