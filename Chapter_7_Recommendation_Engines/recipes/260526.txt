Ingredients:
Sauce:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup salted butter, melted
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 egg yolk
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (15 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained, with juice reserved
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Crepes:
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs

Directions:
Whisk 1 cup sugar, butter, water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and egg yolk together in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Cover sauce to keep warm.
Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup mandarin orange juice, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl using an electric mixer until well blended; mixture will be a bit lumpy.
Blend milk, flour, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Set a greased crepe pan over medium heat. Ladle batter in until just covering the bottom of the pan. Cook until top dries, about 3 minutes. Flip and set aside; repeat with the remaining batter.
Spoon filling into crepes and fold over like a taco. Spoon mandarin orange pieces over filled crepes. Pour sauce on top.

Description: 
Perfect for a light brunch. Very easy to make. A little on the rich side, so smaller portions are best.
