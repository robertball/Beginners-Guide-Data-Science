Quick and Easy Borscht Recipe

Ingredients:
1 15-oz can cut beets
1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes
1-1/2 cups sliced onions
1 tsp caraway seed
2 tsp salt
2 TB olive oil
2 celery stalks, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
3 cups sliced cabbage
3-1/2  - 4 cups vegetable broth
fresh ground black pepper to taste
1/4 tsp dillweed
1 TB balsamic vinegar
1 TB honey
Sour cream, for topping

Directions:
Drain beets, reserving liquid.  Slice beets.
Drain tomatoes, reserving liquid.  Set aside.
Heat olive oil in 2-quart stockpot.  Add onions, caraway and salt; cook until onions are clear and soft.  Add celery, carrots and cabbage.
Take reserved juices from beets and tomatoes and add enough broth to make 4 cups of liquid.  Add to stockpot and cook, covered, for about 10 minutes.
Add sliced beets to skillet with black pepper and dillweed.  Stir in vinegar, honey and tomatoes.  Cover, reduce heat to medium low and simmer 30 - 40 minutes.
Serve topped with sour cream and a sprig of fresh dillweed.  While it's delicious served hot, you can also serve it icy cold for a refreshing summer soup.
Note:  I know it seems silly to buy cut beets and them slice them yourself, but the reason I do that is because I get a greater yield of beets this way.  Also, the beets done this way taste better -- for canned beets.  The pre-sliced type seem to be more water than vegetable, and so are less economical in the long run.

Description: 
Inspired by Puma's Russian Cabbage Borscht, which is utterly delicious, this is my version.  You can serve it either hot or cold.  This recipe also works well for folks who are vegetarians or vegans!
