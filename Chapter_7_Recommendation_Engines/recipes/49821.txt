Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup whole almonds

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, and almond extract until smooth. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the butter mixture until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Drop cookies by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets, and press down slightly with the bottom of a glass. Place a whole almond on top of each cookie.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Remove cookies from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
My Mom got this recipe many years from a Chinese man who lived across the street from us when I was growing up. They are very good cookies and so easy to make.
