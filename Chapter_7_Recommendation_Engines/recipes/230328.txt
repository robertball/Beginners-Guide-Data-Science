Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) beef tenderloin
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon sea salt
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Tie tenderloin at 2-inch intervals with kitchen string.
Combine oil and garlic in a bowl; brush over meat. Mix basil, rosemary, sea salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; sprinkle evenly over the meat.
Roast beef tenderloin in preheated oven until beginning to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, 40 to 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
