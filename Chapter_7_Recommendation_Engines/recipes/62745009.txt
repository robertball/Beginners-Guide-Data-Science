Ingredients:
1 lb of ground turkey
1/2 bell pepper, diced
1/4 - 1/2 onion, diced
1/2 cup carrots, diced
3 cloves of garlic, diced
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 egg substitute (1/4 cup)
1/2 tsp. chili flakes
1 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground pepper
2 oz of Monterey Jack Cheese, long slices

Directions:
Starting with the ground turkey, place all ingredients in a bowl and mix together.
Place 1/2 the meatloaf mix in a loaf pan.
Place the cheese in the center and cover with the remaining meatloaf mix, making sure the sides and ends are sealed. It prevents the cheese from oozing out.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes, but using the "Glazed Meatloaf II" glaze, take out after 20 minutes and cover with the sauce. It will have time to soak in and create a slight crust.

Description: 
It is a very yummy and healthy dinner with a surprise in the center. A great recipe to hide veggies in! It goes really well with mashed potatoes or rice. I use the meatloaf glaze from the recipe Glazed Meatloaf II by Delia that I found on Allrecipes!
