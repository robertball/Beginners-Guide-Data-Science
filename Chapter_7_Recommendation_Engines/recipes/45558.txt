Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground ginger
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 thick cut pork chops
1 onion, halved and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon brandy
1 1/2 cups orange juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the flour, ginger, salt and pepper into a paper or plastic bag. Put the chops in the bag, and shake to coat. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Brown pork chops in the hot oil on both sides. Transfer the chops to a casserole dish.
Place the onion in the hot frying pan, and cook until limp. Pour the brandy into the pan, and stir to incorporate any bits of food that may be stuck to the pan. Pour the onion and juices over the pork chops in the dish. Pour the orange juice into the casserole as well.
Cover and bake for 45 minutes, or until chops are no longer pink. Serve with the orange sauce from the dish.
