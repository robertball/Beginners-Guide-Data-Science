Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup milk
3 eggs
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Whisk flour and baking powder together in a bowl; stir in raisins. Whisk milk and eggs together in a bowl.
Beat butter, sugar, and salt together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Beat egg mixture into butter mixture; stir in flour mixture until dough is just mixed.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll out about 1-inch thick. Cut dough with a biscuit cutter or juice glass; place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
My nanny used to make these tea biscuits all the time. One of my favorite memories of visiting Newfoundland is standing at the kitchen table as she made these and gave us a little bit of the raw dough to taste. They're light and delicious! Serve hot with butter and jam.
