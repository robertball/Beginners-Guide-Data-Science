Ingredients:
Ropa Vieja:
1 (2 1/2 pound) chuck roast, or more to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning, or to taste
1 cup beef broth
1/4 cup recaito
1/4 cup recaito
1/4 cup sofrito
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning (without achiote)
1 onion, sliced
10 pimento-stuffed green olives
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
Arepas:
2 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 1/2 cups arepa flour (pre-cooked white corn meal)
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Drizzle chuck roast with olive oil and rub adobo on top.
Pour beef broth into a slow cooker; add recaito, sofrito, and sazon. Add the chuck roast, onion, olives, and garlic. Cook on Low for 8 hours. Add diced tomatoes and carrots. Continue cooking until flavors blend, about 2 hours more.
Bring milk to a simmer in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and stir in butter.
Combine arepa flour, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Add the hot milk and honey and stir until combined. Let mixture stand until milk is absorbed enough for a soft dough to form, 1 to 2 minutes. Form dough into 12 balls about 2 inches in diameter; flatten between palms into 3 1/2- to 4-inch patties about 1/3-inch thick.
Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry 4 arepas at a time until lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

Description: 
Ropa vieja is a traditional Cuban dish, usually made with flank steak, but I only had pot roast. It is cooked until very tender and it shreds, which is why it is called ropa vieja. Ropa vieja translates to ragged clothes or old clothes. It's very yummy, can be served over rice or even used as a filling.
