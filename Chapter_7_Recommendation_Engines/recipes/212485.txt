Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 (16 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce
1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick

Directions:
Mix together the orange juice, brown sugar, and cranberry sauce in a saucepan, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, drop in the cinnamon stick, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until the cranberry sauce is melted and the glaze is hot and bubbling, about 10 minutes.
To use: brush the glaze all over a roasted turkey during the last 45 minutes of cooking. Return the turkey to the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes to set the glaze. Repeat several more times before the end of cooking time.

Description: 
A good, easy, yummy glaze that can be used on chicken or turkey.  I came up with this a few years ago for Thanksgiving, to change up the old boring turkey.  Everyone loved it.  There was no left-over turkey that year.
