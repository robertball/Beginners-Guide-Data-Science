Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/8 teaspoon mustard seed
1 large head cauliflower, cut into bite-size pieces
1 baking potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mustard seeds in hot oil until popping and toasted, 10 to 15 seconds.
Stir cauliflower, potato, salt, and turmeric into oil until coated completely; cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring every few minutes, until cauliflower and potato are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with sugar and cayenne pepper and cook until flavors develop, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
A wonderful dish! Not your boring vegetable! I love the cabbage as much as the cauliflower but plan to use a bigger pan, like a Dutch oven, if you are using cabbage instead of cauliflower.
