Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
5 pounds potatoes, peeled
8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
1/2-3/4 cup half-n-half
2 tsp onion powder
2 egg whites slightly beaten
3/4 c butter, divided
1/3 c chopped chives (optional)
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Place peeled potatoes in large pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook for 20-25 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender. Drain water from pot and place the pot back over medium heat for 1-2 minutes to dry the potatoes out.
Then mash potatoes (I use a hand mixer) until smooth.
Once potatoes are mashed, add in cream cheese, half-n-half, onion powder, egg whites , salt, pepper and chives. Blend well.
Spray insert of crock pot with non-stick butter spray and add mashed potatoes. Cut 1/2 cup of butter into tablespoon pieces and add on top of potatoes. Once potatoes cool they can be stored at this point in the refrigerator overnight.
If you refrigerated the potatoes overnight, the day you serve the potatoes; take potatoes out of refrigerator for 3 1/2 hours to bring to room temperature.
Cook on low heat for 3 hours. Stir once or twice during cooking, adding the last 1/4 cup of butter tablespoon by tablespoon the last half hour of cooking.
Tip: Place a towel under the lid of the crock pot to collect condensation.

Description: 
My mother gave me this recipe after looking on line for something to suit her taste. This was what she came up with. I usually make this the night before Thanksgiving or Christmas and store it in the refrigerator in the insert of my crock pot. Frees up my holiday to enjoy with family and is delicious!
