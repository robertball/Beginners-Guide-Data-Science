Ingredients:
1 lb. Black Tiger Prawns, shelled and deveined
3T extra virgin olive oil
1T butter
1t fresh parsley leaves, chopped
1/8t dried oregano
1/2t onion powder
1/2t cayenne pepper  (can be reduced for less heat)
1/4t dried hot pepper flakes
sea salt & cracked pepper
1/4C Marsala wine

Directions:
Melt the butter in the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat.
When it bubbles, add the prawns then immediately sprinkle them with the parsley and all the dry seasonings.
Constantly move them around for the next 3-4 minutes, until they are mostly pink but not totally curled up.
Add the wine, give them another couple of flips (or stir) and let them sit for a minutes or so sizzling in the liquid.
Turn up the heat a little higher and started moving them around again, just sliding the skillet back and forth quickly, to be sure they don't burn until the liquid had reduced completely.
Serve alone or over rice or pasta.
