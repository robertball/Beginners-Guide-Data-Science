Ingredients:
Brine:
3 quarts cold water
3 (12 fluid ounce) bottles lager beer
2 onions, cut into wide slices
1 1/2 cups kosher salt
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
5 tablespoons curing salt
1/4 cup pickling spice
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 (5 pound) beef brisket, fat trimmed to a thin layer
wood chips
2 cups apple juice, or as needed
Braising Liquid:
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle lager beer
1 onion, cut into large slices
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons pickling spice
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Place water, 3 bottles beer, 2 onions, kosher salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, curing salt, 1/4 cup pickling spice, and 2 tablespoons garlic in a very large pot. Stir well until salts are dissolved. Add beef; stir gently. Use a large bowl or heavy plate to keep the beef submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring once a day, for 4 days.
Soak wood chips in apple juice for 2 hours.
Remove beef from pot, discarding brine, and rinse well until cold water. Let beef come to room temperature.
Preheat an outdoor grill to 150 to 175 degrees F (65 to 80 degrees C). Place soaked wood chips in a shallow aluminum pan on the heat source.
Place meat directly on the grate and allow to smoke for 2 hours.
Combine 1 beer, 1 onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons pickling spice, 2 tablespoons chopped garlic, and black pepper in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat and pour into a large roasting pan. Place beef in braising liquid in the roasting pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
Increase grill temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Place the roasting pan on the grill and close the lid.
Roast the beef until tender, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (60 degrees C).
Remove beef from the roasting pan, discarding braising liquid. Let beef cool until easily handled.
Slice beef into very thin slices across the grain.
