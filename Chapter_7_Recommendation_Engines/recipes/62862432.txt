Ingredients:
1 1/2 quart chicken broth or stock
1 pound dried white beans (great northern, navy, etc...)
1 ham hock (or ham bone w/meat from your last ham)
1 onion, diced
2 stalks celery
2 bay leaves
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp ham base (optional)

Directions:
Add all ingredients to large slow-cooker set on high heat. Cover pot and allow to cook, unmolested, for 4 hours.
Remove bay leaves and celery. Discard. Remove ham hock or bone and carefully (it's hot) strip away any meat. Dice or shred meat and return to pot. Reduce heat to low and cook for another hour.
If you wish, add more liquid or for a thicker soup, continue cooking on high until it's just right. Adjust seasonings (adding ham base during last half hour) and serve with hot buttered corn bread.
