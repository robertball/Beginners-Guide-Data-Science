Directions:
Place the beef in a large mixing bowl, add the cumin, chili powder, and garlic and toss to coat.
Coat a large skillet in cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Add the steak and stir-fry for 4-6 minutes. Add the beans and salsa and stir fry until desired doneness, then remove from heat.
Meanwhile, warm the tortillas in a pan or the microwave. Top each tortilla with 1/8 of the steak mixture and toppings.
