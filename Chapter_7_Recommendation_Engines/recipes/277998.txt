Description: 
Super yummy frosting that is completely free of animal products! Yay! My husband and kiddo love it, and I am sure it will be a hit with your family and friends. Don't tell them it's vegan until after they try it, and they will be pleasantly surprised. The longer you beat the mixture, the more air is incorporated, and you'll get a fluffier frosting.
