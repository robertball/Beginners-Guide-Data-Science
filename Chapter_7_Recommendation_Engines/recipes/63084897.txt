Ingredients:
chicken stock 64 oz.(2 boxes of 32 oz.)
1 can of diced tomatoes, blended
6 green roasted green chiles peeled and diced or 1 (4.5 oz.) can chopped green chile and 1 can (4.5 oz.) jalapeno peppers diced
1 and 1/2 lbs. of boneless pork shoulder-fat trimmed or pork stew meat diced
4 T. of flour to dredge pork
4 T. canola oil
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. of cumin
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/8 tsp. of black pepper
If needed:

1/4 cup of cold water

Directions:
Peel roasted green chiles, remove seeds, and dice.
Dice pork in small pieces.
Add flour to a paper bag.
Dredge pork in flour. Heat oil on medium high for 2-3 minutes. Fry pork in oil until brown.
Add  32 oz. of chicken stock. Bring to a boil and turn down to medium. Boil for 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile blend tomatoes in a blender.
Then, add the rest  of the chicken stock (32 oz.)
Add chili and blended tomatoes
Add garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and cumin.
Turn down heat to simmer for 1 hour.
If  chili needs to be thicker- blend 2 T. corn starch and 1/4 cup of cold water
Bring chili to a boil, add corn starch and whisk with a whisk.
Turn down heat and let thicken for a few minutes.
NOTE: Chili is always better the next day-I like the make this chili the night before so the flavors blend together.

Description: 
An authentic Colorado family chili recipe I grew up eating. Everyone who eats my chili wants my mom's recipe. A flavorful tender pork chili using green roasted chiles. This chili is simmered to bring out the flavor. Enjoy the chili with flour tortillas and fried potatoes. Or pour over chicken enchiladas, beef enchiladas, burritos, or tamales.
