Place the whitefish, mayonnaise, tartar sauce, lemon juice, cream, hot pepper sauce, and black pepper into a food processor. Pulse until smooth, then scrape into a mixing bowl. Stir in the onion, celery, capers, and dill. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld.

Description: 
This spread is great on crostini or as a dip with assorted vegetables. Because it is made in the blender all those pesky little bones are no longer a nuisance. Serve as a spread on crostinis or on cucumber rounds or as a stuffing for hardboiled eggs.
