Ingredients:
2 lbs snapper fillets
salt and pepper
2 tsp paprika
Â½ tsp cayenne
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp canola oil
--------------
For cabbage slaw
4 cups (loosely packed) shredded cabbage
? cup chopped cilantro
2 green onions, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tbsp distilled white vinegar
1 tsp kosher salt
2 tsp white sugar
-------------
? cup sour cream
3 tbsp mayonnaise
juice and zest of 1 lime
salt, to taste
warmed tortillas (corn or wheat), for serving

Directions:
Season fish on both sides with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine paprika, cayenne, garlic powder and cumin. Sprinkle over fish on both sides. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a grill pan on medium-high heat. Add half of the fish and cook until the edges are opaque, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook until fish flakes easily with fork, and is just ever-so-slightly translucent (it will finish cooking with the residual heat). Transfer fish to a plate and repeat with remaining fish.
To make cabbage slaw, toss all ingredients together in a large bowl.
To make crema, whisk all ingredients together and season to taste with salt.
Serve fish in warmed tortillas with cabbage slaw and a drizzle of crema
