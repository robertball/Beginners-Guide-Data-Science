Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups quinoa
2 cups water, or more as needed
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9-inch round pans with cooking spray.
Pulse quinoa in a food processor until ground into flour, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine quinoa flour, water, olive oil, dill, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk, adding more water if needed, until combined. Divide dough evenly between the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden, about 20 minutes. Cut into wedges.

Description: 
A great way to use quinoa! It can be used as a crust or flatbread, made into a main dish, side dish, or appetizer! 
This is one that works well and can be easily changed with the herbs you have on hand or in your garden. We are starting clean-eating this week and tweaked some recipes. This can also be used as a pizza crust, topped with hummus, bruschetta, pesto, or even egg/tofu salad. It's great for any gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan, or vegetarian diet.
