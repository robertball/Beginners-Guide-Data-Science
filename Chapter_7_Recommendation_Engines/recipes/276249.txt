Ingredients:
1/4 pound whole wheat spaghetti
1 1/4 pounds hot Italian turkey sausage, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/2 large red onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 cup vegetable stock
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1 pound kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Brown sausage, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl. Add olive oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes and vegetable stock. Add thyme, oregano, and basil. Return sausage to the skillet, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.
Add kale and cannellini beans to the skillet. Simmer, uncovered, until sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes more. Plate drained pasta and add sauce. Top with desired amount of Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
I am trying to lose some weight again for the thousandth time in my life, and I came up with this recipe because of the low-fat, high-fiber, fresh ingredients. The beans, pasta, and kale are an unusual mixture, but don't hesitate to give it a try. My one and only raised eyebrows when he discovered it was healthy for him. A definite keeper, as he went back for seconds.
