Ingredients:
2 - 255g pkgs frozen mini-tart shells,about 36
3 - 39-g Skor chocolate bars
1cup - unsweetened pumpkin pureé
1/3cup - lightly packed brown sugar
1/4cup - whipping cream
2 - eggs
1/2tsp - vanilla
1/2tsp - pumpkin pie spice or 1/4 tsp (1 mL) each ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg
36 pecan halves, about 100-g pkg

Directions:
Arrange oven racks in top and bottom thirds of oven. Preheat to 375F (190C). Place tart shells on 2 large baking sheets, leaving a bit of space between them. Thaw at room temperature for 10 min.
Meanwhile, finely chop chocolate bars. Spoon 1 scant tsp (4 mL) into each shell. In a medium bowl, whisk pumpkin with sugar, cream, eggs, vanilla and pie spice until blended. Fill shells nearly to the top, then place a pecan half on each.
Bake sheets on separate racks. Rotate baking sheets between racks after 10 min. Then continue baking until filling is set, about 10 more min. Serve warm or cool on a rack.
If making ahead, store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They'll keep well for 2 days, or freeze up to 3 months.
