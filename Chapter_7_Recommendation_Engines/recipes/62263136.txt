Ingredients:
•2 Sweet bell peppers, seeded and quartered
•¾ cup toasted walnuts, chopped
•3 Slices whole wheat bread, crust removed
•1 Clove garlic, finely minced
•2 Tbsp. aleppo pepper
•1 tsp. cumin seeds, coarsely ground
•2 tsp. pomegranate molasses
•2 Tbsp. lemon juice
•½ cup Olive oil
•Salt to taste
•Dash of sumac

Directions:
Roast the pepper quarters, either skin side down on a grill on medium heat, or a toaster over with skin side up on medium heat. While waiting, toast the bread slices in your toaster so they are dry and toasted, but not burnt.
Once the skins of the peppers are nicely blackened, remove to a small bowl and cover. Wait 15 minutes to cool, then remove the skin. Mash peppers with a fork. Place the toast in a zip-top bag, remove excess air, and crush to produce crumbs.  Measure out ¾ cup of crumbs.
Place the pepper mash, garlic, aleppo, cumin, bread crumbs, molasses, and lemon juice into a food processor. Pulse a few times to blend. Run food processor on its lowest setting, while slowly adding olive oil. Do in pulses if needed. The texture should not be smooth and creamy like hummus.
Place into a dish, sprinkle with a dash of sumac, and serve with  traditional Turkish pide (or your favorite flat bread), or spread on crackers.
