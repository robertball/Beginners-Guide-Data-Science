Description: 
This recipe from New Zealand was made popular by our Scottish ancestors who emigrated here 150 years ago. Its really, really yummy and a popular dinner meal or pot luck or picnic addition. 
You must use the Irish-style bacon if you live in USA or Canada; if you live elsewhere, shoulder bacon is fine.
