Description: 
I know the name sounds bad, but this is a fast, simple yummy dish of comfort food.  It's not pretty, and not for serving to guests you want to impress. But if you want a warm satisfying meal for family then this is it!  Try using green and yellow zucchini (not summer squash!) to make it prettier.  I like it over hot rice, my husband likes it with buttered pasta.
