Ingredients:
Slaw:
2 cups thinly sliced green cabbage
1/2 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced green onions (1/4-inch pieces)
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/4 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried garlic flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
Sesame-Ginger Dressing:
3 tablespoons honey
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 teaspoon stone-ground mustard
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon dried garlic flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon wasabi powder
Fish:
3 tablespoons coconut oil
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) cod, cut into 1-inch chunks
4 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 lime, or to taste
1/4 cup roasted cashews

Directions:
Mix cabbage, red bell pepper, green onions, sesame seeds, jalapeno pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl for the slaw.
Pour honey, lime juice, sesame oil, mustard, ginger, 1/2 teaspoon garlic flakes, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and wasabi powder into a jar. Shake until honey is dissolved. Pour over the slaw.
Heat an 8-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Coat bottom of the pan with coconut oil and olive oil.
Mix flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a dish. Dredge cod pieces in the mixture, coating all sides. Fry cod in the hot oil, turning once, until outsides are golden, about 6 minutes. Transfer onto paper towels to absorb excess oil.
Drain the slaw slightly. Place 1/4 of the cod on a tortilla and squeeze some lime juice on top. Add 1/4 of the slaw; top with roasted cashews. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, lime, slaw, and cashews.

Description: 
I had never made fish tacos before, but with my 30 years of professional food experience I was pretty confident in the outcome. This is a delicious recipe with an Asian flair and the sesame-ginger slaw adds a bit of crunch.
