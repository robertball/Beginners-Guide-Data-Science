Ingredients:
1 1/3 (16.5 ounce) packages red velvet cake mix
1 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, divided
2 egg yolks, divided
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Mix red velvet cake mix, butter, 1 egg, and 1 egg yolk together in a large bowl. Press evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Whisk cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Beat in 1 egg until smooth. Beat in 1 egg yolk.
Spread cream cheese mixture over the red velvet layer in the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 30 minutes. Cut into bars.
