Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground turkey
1 3/4 cups chopped red bell pepper
1 cup chopped zucchini
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 cups chopped tomato

2 (10 inch) burrito size whole wheat high fiber tortillas
1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat and cook turkey, red pepper, zucchini, onion and chili powder about 5 minutes, until turkey is thoroughly cooked, stirring occasionally. Stir in 1-1/2 cups tomato and cook, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes or until tomato is soft.
Place 1/3 of the turkey mixture in 9-inch deep dish pie plate. Spread 1/3 of the rice mixture on top. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese, then top with 1 tortilla. Repeat layers ending with rice. Bake covered 20 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and bake uncovered 10 minutes.
