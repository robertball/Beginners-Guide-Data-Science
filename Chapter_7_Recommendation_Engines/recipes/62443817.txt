1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons white sugar
10 oz of Buffalo wing sauce
1 pound of shredded Pizza cheese
1 half of a red onion
1 cooked boneless skinless chicken breast!

Directions:
Bake one chicken brest until juices run clear.  After the beast cools shred by place in a bowl and cover with wing sauce until covered.  Let sit in the refrigerator until dough is ready. Next cut onion as desired for topping.
Mean while in a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour, olive oil, salt, white sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Spread wing sauce as if pizza sauce until lightly covered.  Next cover with cheese, chicken, & onions and bake for 20 to 25 mins until golden brown and enjoy!
