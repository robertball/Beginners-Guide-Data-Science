Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 cup molasses
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons vinegar
6 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine molasses, water and vinegar; add to the creamed mixture and mix until blended. Combine remaining ingredients; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. On a heavily floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut with a 2-1/2-in. cookie cutter dipped in flour. Place 1 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until edges are browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
