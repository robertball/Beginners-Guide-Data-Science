Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
3/4 cup plain bread crumbs
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup dried onion flakes
2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules, or enough crushed beef bouillon cubes to equal 2 tablespoons
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/8 teaspoon celery seed
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
(or a one-ounce envelope of onion soup mix may be substituted for the seasonings)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients and form into a loaf. Place in 6.5 or 7 quart slow cooker, making sure the loaf does not touch the sides of the crock. Turn on cooker to low, and cook for 6 hours, or cook on high for 3 hours. Lining the cooker with a long strip of foil that comes up the sides of the pot makes it easier to lift the loaf out of the cooker. A one-ounce envelope of dry onion soup mix may be substituted for the spices, if necessary.
