Ingredients:
3 3/4 cups Gluten Free all-purpose flour
1 Teaspoon Xanthan gum
1/4 cup + 1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1/4 cup cold water
4 pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and sliced
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3.5 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, Xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Work in the butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and cold water. Sprinkle over flour mixture, and work with hands to form dough into a ball. Chill 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll out half of dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Use wax paper underneath and on top of dough to roll easily.  Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish, covering bottom and halfway up sides. Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
To peel peaches, bring a pot of water to a boil and set a bowl with ice water near the pot of boiling water.  Make sure both have enough water to submerge 4 peaches. Take each peach and cut an X on its bottom side.  Carefully place 4 peaches into the boiling water for 60 seconds and then immediately submerge them in ice water, once cool set aside and repeat for all peaches.  You can now easily peel off the skin.
In a large saucepan, mix the peaches, vanilla, lemon and orange juice. Add 1/2 cup butter, and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted.
In a mixing bowl, stir together sugars, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cornstarch; mix into peach mixture. Remove from heat, and pour into baked crust.
Roll remaining dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut into half-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top crust is golden brown.
