Ingredients:
•2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
•1/2 cup chopped onions
•1 Tbsp. minced garlic
•2 Tbsp. chopped fresh dill
•1 1/2 tsp. salt
•1 tsp. white pepper
•1 pound (about 2 cups) coarsely chopped peeled medium shrimp
•3 cups peeled, seeded, and thinly sliced cucumbers (about 2 large)
•4 cups Basic Chicken Stock (see recipe next page)
•2 cups heavy cream
•1/4 cup peeled, seeded, and chopped Italian plum tomatoes (1 or 2 tomatoes)
•1/2 cup Dill Cream (see recipe next page)
•16 sprigs fresh dill

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large soup pot over high heat and then add the onions, garlic, dill, salt, and pepper and sauté, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add the shrimp and sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in the cucumbers and sauté for 1 minute.
Stir in the stock, cream, and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Remove from the heat.
While the soup is simmering, prepare the Dill Cream.
Purée half the soup mixture in a food processor or blender and return it to the unprocessed half to give the soup a variety of textures. Reheat over low heat.
To serve, allow about 1 cup of soup per portion. Add a dollop of the Dill Cream to each and garnish with 2 sprigs of dill.
