Ingredients:
1 pound lean veal chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste
3 tablespoons butter, thinly sliced
2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
2 ounces shredded provolone cheese
2 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese
1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season both sides of veal chops with salt, black pepper, and cumin.
Put 3 to 4 slices butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish; sprinkle in about 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 of the provolone cheese, and 1/4 of the white Cheddar cheese. Arrange a layer of veal chops atop the cheese layer. Top each chop with 2 to 3 slices butter, 1/3 of the mushrooms, and 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 of the provolone cheese, and 1/4 of the white Cheddar cheese. Continue layering with the remaining ingredients.
Pour enough water into the casserole dish to just cover the bottom; cover dish with aluminum foil and an oven-safe lid.
Bake in the preheated oven until veal is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
