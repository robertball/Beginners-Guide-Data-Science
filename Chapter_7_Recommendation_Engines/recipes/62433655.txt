Mustard Foam Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 Tablespoon Butter
1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped
3 to 5 Black peppercorns, coarsely crushed
3 sprigs Tarragon
200 ml (just under 1 cup - 236 ml is one cup!) dry white wine
1 1/2 Tablespoons coarse grain mustard
150 ml (just over 1/2 cup - actually 0.65 cups) cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
A few twists of freshly milled black pepper
---
You CAN foam it up with a whisk, but a hand-held whizzer is SO much easier.

Directions:
In a pan, warm the butter on a gentle heat, add the shallots, cover the pan and sweat for 5 minutes.
Add the peppercorns and the estragon and continue to sweat until the onion is soft and translucent.
Take the lid off, increase the heat and add the wine.
Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer strongly for 10 or so minutes until the quantity is reduced by half, thus removing 99% of the alcohol.
Remove the Tarragon sprigs, and set the reduction to one side, until maybe 20 minutes before required.
When required, warm the reduction again, add the mustard and the cream, and then bring to the boil, stirring thoroughly all the while.
Remove from the heat, add the salt and pepper to taste, let cool down from boiling but still hot (in case of accidents) and bring to a foam (a hand whizzer does this in seconds!)
Decorate the cooked item on the plate with a wonderful wispy cloud of foamy mustardy heaven.

Description: 
A wonderful creamy sauce for grilled Salmon especially. It works well with Pork also. You can do the preparation and reduction well in advance and simply spend 5 or so minutes rewarming and foaming just before serving.
