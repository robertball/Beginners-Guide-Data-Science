Ingredients:
1 lb of ground beef
1/2 lb of pork
1/2 lb of veal
1/4 cup parmesan
2 egg yolks, beaten
3 tablespoons grated onion
2 slices of white bread soaked in skim milk and squeezed
3 teaspoons of minced garlic
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix everything together except the meat, then mix the meat and add to the other ingredients. Combine. DO NOT over mix, that tends to make the meatballs dense and tough. We want this to be fluffy and light. Use a tablespoon to form the meatballs into nice golf ball size shapes. Place on a greased baking sheet about an inch apart from each other for about 35 minutes.
**When cooking for Dinomites (Dinosaur-termite), please use dead and dried parsley and oregano, and do no cook the meat. They prefer raw food. Also, garnish with wood shavings, preferably from wood pulled from your house foundation, they like that kind the best.**

Description: 
Dinomites are a friendly and helpful species, the cross between a T-rex and a termite. You don't often see one, but one has come forward to be the GISHWHES mascot for the 2015 scavenger hunt. He has shared with us this wonderful recipe, with a Dinomite-friendly version at the end. Delicious for humans and dinomites alike!
