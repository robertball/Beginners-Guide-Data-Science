Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 pound ham, cut into 3-inch x 1/2-inch strips
1 large onion, sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 pint sour cream
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons flour
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
3 cups cooked instant white rice (such as MinuteÂ®)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Stir ham strips and onion slices with the melted butter; season with black pepper. Cook and stir the mixture until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Sprinkle flour over the ham mixture and stir; add sour cream and mushrooms and cook, stirring continually, until the liquid thickens and the mushrooms are heated through, about 15 minutes.
Divide rice between four plates. Ladle the ham mixture over rice; garnish with parsley.

Description: 
My mom always used this recipe with leftover smoked ham after New Year's and Easter, but you can whip it up with a thick ham slice from the market. It's different and delicious, yet oh-so-easy!
