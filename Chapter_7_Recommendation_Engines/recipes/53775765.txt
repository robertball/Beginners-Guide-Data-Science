4 eggs
2/3 cup orange juice
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
sprinkle of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread, cut into 1 inch slices
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 tablespoons grated orange zest

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat together eggs, orange juice, milk, sugar, nutmeg and vanilla extract. Place bread slices in a tightly spaced single layer in the bottom of a flat dish or baking pan.  Pour milk mixture over bread, cover and refrigerate overnight, turning once.
When ready to cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat a jelly roll pan, or rimmed baking sheet, evenly with the melted butter. Arrange soaked bread slices in a single layer on pan.  Sprinkle evenly with orange peel and pecans.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, 20 to 25 minutes.  Check slices during last 10 minutes of baking time to avoid burning.
