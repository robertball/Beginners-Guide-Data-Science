Description: 
I had found a recipe called lasagna curls, but when I made it nobody in the house liked it. So playing around with the recipe and changing the Ricotta to Cottage cheese, Adding different ingrediants to more our taste,this is what I came up with and my family loves it! My kids ask for these all the time. I usually make 2 pans and save one in the freezer for later. Hope you enjoy!
In the picture I had added Fresh spinach to the cheese mixture.
