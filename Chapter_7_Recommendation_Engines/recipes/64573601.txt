Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon chipotle hot sauce, such as Cholula

8 ounces cole slaw mix (with red cabbage & carrots)
½ red bell pepper, diced
2-3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Add oils to wok or large pan and heat over medium heat. Add ground turkey and break up as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper. When cooked, set aside turkey and do not rinse pan.
Mix hot sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sweetener and ginger in a medium bowl to make sauce and set aside.
Put wok back on heat and add garlic, red bell pepper, cole slaw mix and green onions. Saute until cole slaw has wilted slightly, 1-2 minutes.

Return cooked turkey to pan and stir until heated throughout.
Remove from heat, add sesame seeds and serve.
