Description: 
Even people who don't like cranberries or the canned cranberry sauce seem to like this recipe. It is easy to make and keeps for weeks after it is made. I sometimes top it with a dollop of whipped cream. Double the recipe for the holidays. It will fill a mold or a trifle bowl and makes a beautiful presentation on the Thanksgiving or Christmas table.
