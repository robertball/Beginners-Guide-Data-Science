Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon maple flavored extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites with cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add white sugar and confectioners sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while continuing to whip to stiff glossy peaks. Mix in the maple extract. Spoon meringue onto the prepared cookie sheets in 1 inch circles.
Place in the preheated oven, and immediately reduce the temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until cookies are dry and easy to remove from the paper.

Description: 
A variation on the typical meringue recipe that I discovered by accident. A little chewier and maplier than usual.
