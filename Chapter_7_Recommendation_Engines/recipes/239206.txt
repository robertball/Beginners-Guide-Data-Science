Ingredients:
5 cups whole milk
10 parsnips, peeled and cubed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste
salt or to taste

Directions:
Heat milk in a large pot over medium heat until warmed and just under a boil; add parsnips and 1 teaspoon salt, cover with a lid, and cook until parsnips are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain parsnips, reserving the warm milk.
Mash parsnips, 1 cup reserved warm milk, butter, thyme, and pepper together in the pot using a hand mixer or by blending in a blender. Add more milk, salt, or pepper as desired.

Description: 
I was tricked into trying mashed parsnips (I was told they were mashed potatoes) and fell instantly in love. I haven't made mashed potatoes since. Mashed parsnips are full of much more flavor, slightly sweet, but the same great texture. And they are much healthier!
