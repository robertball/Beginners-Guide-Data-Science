Ingredients:
2 large cucumbers, peeled
1 (8 oz.) container of chive & onion flavored cream cheese
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

Directions:
Cut the peeled cucumbers into slices that are about 1 1/2 inches thick.  Then, use a spoon to scoop out most of the seed area.  (But, be sure to leave a bottom.)
Put a spoonful of the cream cheese into each piece of cucumber, then top with a few sun-dried tomato pieces.
Serve chilled.
