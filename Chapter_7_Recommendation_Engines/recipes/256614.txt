Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup blueberries
2 teaspoons lemon zest
7 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, divided
1/4 cup honey
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk all-purpose flour, whole wheat pastry flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Rub in cubed butter with your fingers until mixture resembles coarse meal. Fold in blueberries and lemon zest.
Whisk 5 tablespoons heavy cream, honey, and egg together in a small bowl. Pour over the flour mixture; mix gently with your hands until dough just comes together.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat dough into a 6-inch round about 1 inch thick. Cut dough into 12 rounds using a round cutter.
Transfer rounds to the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons heavy cream over the tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
