1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
Â¼ teaspoon dried sage
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Directions:
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray. Saute the chicken in the oil. Add the onion and saute until translucent. Add the celery and carrots and saute briefly.
Add the chicken soup, mushroom soup, water or broth, salt and pepper, sage and garlic. Do not add the tomatoes yet as they retard cooking time. Bring all to a boil, then cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 10 more minutes, uncovered. Serve over hot cooked rice if desired. Delicious!
