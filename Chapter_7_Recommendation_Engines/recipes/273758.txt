Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-size pieces
salt and pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package fresh sliced portobello mushrooms
1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
3 cups spinach
1 (7 ounce) container pesto
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook garlic, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. Stir in portobello mushrooms and roasted red peppers. Continue cooking until mushrooms have softened, about 4 minutes. Add spinach and cook until it starts to wilt, 1 to 3 minutes.
Mix pesto and cream together in a small bowl. Pour mixture over chicken and vegetables; stir to combine. Cook until sauce thickens, 5 more minutes.
