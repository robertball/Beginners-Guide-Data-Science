Ingredients:
2 tablespoons Butter
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup hot water
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 Medium Onion Small dice
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups.
In a large bowl add sugar and hot water. Allow to cool until lukewarm (110 Degrees), and mix in the yeast until dissolved.Let stand for 10 minutes (Proofing the yeast)
Sauté Onions in the butter till they are translucent and then set aside to cool to 110 degrees or less (I normally make this in advance)
Mix in the egg, salt, onions, and flour.
Allow the dough to rise until doubled in size.
Divide the dough into the prepared muffin cups, and allow to rise again until doubled in size.
Bake for 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
