Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups heavy cream
2 1/4 cups sugar
3 eggs
6 tsp. baking powder
1 1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. vanilla
4 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
Beat cream and sugar well. Stir in eggs and vanilla, and mix until smooth. In seperate bowl, stir together 1 cup of the flour with the baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add to batter, and mix well. Stir in the rest of the flour slowly. Mix until smooth and well blended.
Roll into 1 inch balls and place in cookie sheets, 2 inches apart. Flatten with hands or bottom of a wide cup till about 1 cm thick. Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees for approximately 10-12 minutes. Do not overbake. The cookies are supposed to stay light on top- just the bottoms are supposed to be golden/light brown. Cool, ice with Betty Crocker White Icing, and dip in coconut (or crushed nuts, cornflakes, toasted coconut, etc.). Yummy!
