Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons ground flax seed
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 1/2 cups halved cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix flour, sugar, flax seed, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat eggs, milk, applesauce, lemon juice and canola oil in another bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just moistened; fold in cranberries. Fill prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
