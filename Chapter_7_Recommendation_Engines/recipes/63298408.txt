Ingredients:
16 oz sauerkraut, rinsed and drained well
1/2-1 tsp Whole Caraway Seed (we toast and grind it but Penzey says to throw it in whole)
12 oz corned beef, shredded or cubed
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1 cup shredded Monterrey jack cheese
1/2 cup Mayonnaise
1/2 cup Russian dressing (see notes for recipe)
2 slices rye bread, dried and made into bread crumbs (about 1 1/2 cup crumbs)
3 tbsp butter, melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Toast the bread crumbs with melted butter until just turning golden brown, set aside.
In a 9 x 13 glass baking dish, spread the sauerkraut in the bottom and sprinkle with ground, toasted caraway seeds.
Add an even layer of corned beef then an evenly mixed layer of Swiss and Monterrey jack cheese.
In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and Russian dressing together then spread over the layer of cheese.
Evenly sprinkle toasted breadcrumbs over the top of the casserole.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until bubbling.

Description: 
Oddly I had never had a Reuben sandwich until this year but once my husband and I tried it, we both declared it The best sandwich of all times, ever, true story!  Someone mentioned a Reuben Casserole to me and I had to give this a try.  We made this and (after a little tweaking) everyone happily wanted to slam their face right into the baking dish to eat this.
