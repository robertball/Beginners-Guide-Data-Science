Ingredients:
1 cup long grain white rice
1 can Coconut milk
1 can kidney beans
water
2 sprigs fresh thyme
2 tsp salt

Directions:
Drain kidney beans, reserving liquid.  Add coconut milk to kidney bean liquid.  Add water to make up to 2 cups.  In a small pot, bring liquid mixture to the boil with a teaspoon or so of salt.  When liquid reaches the boil, add rice, kidney beans and thyme.  Reduce heat to medium low, and stir until the mix just returns to the boil.  Cover with a tighly fitting lid and leave alone for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes.  Remove lid and fluff with fork.  Serve immediately.
