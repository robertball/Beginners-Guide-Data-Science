Ingredients:
1 pound beef sweetbreads
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup oil for frying
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Tear the sweetbread apart into 1 inch sections. Discard the stringy ligaments that hold it together. Rinse with water as you go. Dip the slightly wet sweetbreads into flour.
Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet. Fry the sweetbreads in the hot oil until golden brown, turning once. Remove from oil, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
Sweetbread are a gland in cattle, and this is the way my husband and I prepare them. We like them in tiny pieces, but others make them in larger portions. This method of cooking and the taste remind me a little of chicken hearts, only better. One pound of sweetbreads makes plenty for 2 people using our method.
