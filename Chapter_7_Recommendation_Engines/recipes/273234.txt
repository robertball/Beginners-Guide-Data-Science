Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 slices bacon
2 cups leftover fried rice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
2 eggs, lightly beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a cast iron or heavy skillet over medium heat. Add bacon; fry, turning frequently until crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from the skillet; transfer to paper towels to drain. Let cool for 10 minutes. Crumble into bite-sized pieces.
While bacon is cooling, cook and stir rice in the same skillet with bacon drippings, ground ginger, and fresh ginger over medium heat until rice is hot, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in green onion.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat until warm; add butter and melt, being careful not to brown the butter. Add eggs, salt, and pepper; scramble until eggs are set but still moist, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir scrambled eggs into hot fried rice until eggs are broken into small pieces. Add crumbled bacon and mix well.

Description: 
We always have leftover fried rice when we order take-out Chinese. I prepared this with ginger the next day to use the rice and we loved it. Serve with soy sauce.
