Ingredients:
2 (29 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons margarine
1/2 pound mushrooms, chopped
1 onion, finely diced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon white sugar
8 cups beef stock
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the tomatoes with juice in a well buttered oven-proof baking dish. Mix in celery, garlic, and red pepper.  Cover, and bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 25 minutes.
In a large stock pot, melt butter or margarine over medium heat.  Add the mushrooms and onions, and cook and stir for about 8 minutes.
Slowly stir in flour and sugar.  Add beef stock, basil, rosemary, and thyme, stirring until soup comes to a boil. Add the contents of the baked tomato pan from the oven, and bring to a boil.  Cover, and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a food processor, blend the cream cheese until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Slowly stir the cream cheese into the soup.  Garnish with chopped parsley.
