Ingredients:
1 (8oz) pkg cream cheese, softened
1/2 c sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
-----
3 T butter, melted
-----
1/3 c sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
-----
1 (8oz) can refrigerated crescent rolls*
-----
honey, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Beat together cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.
Brush 8x8" baking dish with melted butter. Combine 1/3 c sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Sprinkle 1-2 tsps cinnamon/sugar mixture over bottom of baking dish.
Unroll crescent dough. Pinch seams together, if needed. Divide or cut dough in half to form 2 squares. Place first half on bottom of baking dish. Spread cream cheese mixture over dough. Top with other half of dough. Spoon remaining melted butter over top dough, spreading gently with the back of the spoon to cover. Sprinkle cinnamon/sugar evenly over all.
Bake in preheated 350F oven for about 30 minutes. It is done when dough has puffed and golden, and the middle no longer looks sunken. Remove from oven, and drizzle lightly with honey if desired. Cool before cutting and serving. Refrigerate leftovers.
* I keep the crescent dough in the fridge until needed and assemble this dessert as quickly as possible by prepping everything else first. If it sits on the counter too long it will become very soft and sticky.
