Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2 pounds carrots, peeled, cut into equal-sized pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 cup bourbon whiskey
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 sprigs fresh thyme leaves for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
When butter foams up, add carrots. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until liquid from carrots  evaporates and carrots begin to brown around the edges, 5 or 6 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Carefully pour in bourbon. Cook and stir until bourbon is almost evaporated, about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle in brown sugar. Stir until carrots are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes.
When carrots are nearly tender, raise heat to medium-high to thicken the glaze, 15 to 30 seconds.
Season with cayenne pepper and ground black pepper. Transfer to serving dish and garnish with fresh thyme leaves, if desired.
