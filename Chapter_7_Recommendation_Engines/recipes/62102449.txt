Ingredients:
8 eggs separated
1/4 tsp. salt
2/3 c. white sugar
2 tsp. vanilla
6 tbsp. cornstarch
10 tbsp. flour

Directions:
Cut waxed paper to fit bottoms only of two 10x15" jelly roll pans. Oil the pans and the waxed paper.
Beat egg whites and salt.
Gradually beat in sugar.
Beat until stiff.
Beat yolks and vanilla until thick.
Fold yolks into whites.
Sift flour and cornstarch over egg mixture. Fold in with spatula until all dry bits disappear.
Spread evenly in prepared pans.
Bake at 350 for 9 to 11 minutes or until just pale gold in color. Do NOT over bake. Cut around sides with a sharp knife to loosen sides and slide from pans. Carefully peel off waxed paper when cold. Cut each into 3 equal pieces, 5x10" giving 6 layers. I use a wooden board cut 1 inch larger than the layers and cover it with foil and plastic wrap. Place first layer on the board and slip pieces of waxed paper under the sides and ends. These are removed when the cake is finished. Frost each layer with Mocha or Chocolate Buttercream reserving enough to cover the sides and ends. Sprinkle top and sides liberally with flaked filberts or brazils. Keep refrigerated. Slices best using an electric knife.
