Description: 
My family is from Greece and this lentil soup recipe is adapted from my traditional Greek lentil soup (fakes) recipe. Since becoming a mom finding time to cook has been hard and this soup was a perfect slow cooker candidate. My husband and I think it tastes better than when made on the stove. Baby loves it, too!
