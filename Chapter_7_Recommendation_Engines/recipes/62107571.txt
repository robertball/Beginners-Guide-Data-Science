Ingredients:
For the sponge:
2 eggs
115g sugar
115g self-raising flour
115g butter, melted
For the icing:
135g icing sugar
55g butter
30g cocoa powder, sifted
To decorate:
White chocolate buttons
Milk chocolate buttons
Sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and prepare a 12-hole cake/muffin tin with fairy cake cases.
Whisk together the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy.
Gradually add the flour and the melted butter, gently folding the mixture together.
Pour the mixture evenly into the fairy cake cases.
Bake the cakes for 10-15 minutes, until golden on top and a skewer inserted carefully into one of the cakes comes out clean. Allow to cool for ten minutes on a wire rack before removing from tin.
To make the icing, whip together the icing sugar, butter and cocoa powder.
Once the cakes are cool, ice them liberally and smooth with a knife.
Decorate the cakes with chocolate buttons. A pretty way of doing this is to stick them on at a 90 degree angle in layers all the way around so that each cake resembles a chrysanthemum flower.
