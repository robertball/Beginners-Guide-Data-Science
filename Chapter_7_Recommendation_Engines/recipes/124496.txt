Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 eggs, separated
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg yolks on low while adding cream. Beat for 1 minute. Add to flour mixture; combine on low speed, then beat on medium-high until smooth.
In another small mixing bowl and with clean beaters, beat egg whites on high until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into batter.
Bake in a preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer's directions. Serve with warm maple syrup or fresh fruit in season.

Description: 
These waffles were originally made by my grandmother in a waffle iron on a wood-burning stove. The crispy golden waffles are special to me because, 40 years ago, I served them to my husband the first night I cooked in our new house.
