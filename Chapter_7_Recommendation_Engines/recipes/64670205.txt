Ingredients:
1 TBSP olive oil
1 onion diced
4 green peppers diced
2 diced jalapenos
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 28 oz can petite diced tomatoes
1 32 oz container for chicken broth
1 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce
1 pound hot Italian sausage (casings removed)
salt and pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot.  Add diced onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add green peppers and jalapenos and saute for 5 more minutes. Add a little salt and pepper to the onions and peppers. Add the Italian sausage and brown and drain excess fat. Next add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, and uncooked rice. Bring the mix to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. Occasionally stir to prevent the rice from sticking. Simmer soup for 40 minutes, making sure the rice is cooked through. Add any salt and pepper if needed after tasting. Serve hot. This soup is great with a side of cornbread.
