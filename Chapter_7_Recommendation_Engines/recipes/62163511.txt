Ingredients:
2 cups dry pinto beans
8 cups water
1 tsp salt
4 chicken boullion cubes
1 medium onion, chopped
2 or 3 serrano peppers, finely diced
2-3 large roma tomatoes, chopped
3 tablespoons cilantro, chopped
Optional: Mexican sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Clean beans and combine in pot with water.  Add salt and boullion cubes and bring to a boil.  Reduce to simmer and cover.
After 2 hours the beans will not be fully cooked but now is the time to add in the onion and serrano.  Cover and let simmer.
After the beans are fully cooked, usually around an hour, add in the tomato and cilanto.  Turn up the heat and bring to a boil.  Continue cooking for another 25 minutes.  Add additional water to pot to thin soup to preferred consistency.  It should be somewhat thin.
You can top with the sour cream and cheese if you wish, serve with tortillas or tortilla chips.
