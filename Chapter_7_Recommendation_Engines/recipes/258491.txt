Ingredients:
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
3 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Whisk cocoa powder and sugar together in a bowl until well combined. Add flour, brown sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; continue whisking until evenly mixed. Make a well in the center of the bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour into center of the well of the cocoa mixture; mix until just blended.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This is my spin on having chocolate for breakfast! It's a cross between a pancake and a brownie. I hope you like them as much as my family does. Serve warm with your favorite pancake syrup, whipped cream, and berries of your choice. Enjoy!
