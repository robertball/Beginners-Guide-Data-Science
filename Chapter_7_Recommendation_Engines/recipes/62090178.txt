Ingredients:
1.5 lb bag of homestyle pre-cooked meatballs (no pre-flavored ones like Italian, etc.)
toothpicks (for neat serving)
SAUCE:
1 jar peach jam (or preserves)
8 oz. Russian salad dressing
1 pkg dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Heat up meatballs according to instructions on bag.
Heat up the sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat until they're all blended & thinned down a little.
Pour sauce over the heated meatballs, or add meatballs to saucepan and blend, and then put onto a plate, pouring sauce over them.
For a gourmet look, add some basil leaves around the plate and put toothpicks in the meatballs, and presto, you have a gorgeous appetizer dish.
