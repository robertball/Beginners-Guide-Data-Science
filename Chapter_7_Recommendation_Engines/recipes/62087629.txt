Ingredients:
1 lb. lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup non-dairy sour cream substitute (I use IMO)
8 oz. egg noodles, cooked and drained

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the ground beef and onions for 10 mins, or until browned and onion is tender.
Drain excess grease.
Stir in flour, salt and paprika.
Add the cream of mushroom soup, mix well and cook uncovered for 20 mins.
Reduce heat to low and add the sour cream substitute, stir well.
On low heat, cover for 10 mins.
Pour the beef mixture over the cooked noodles.

Description: 
My mother has a slight dairy intolerance, so growing up we always looked for ways to adapt recipes that called for dairy so she could enjoy them as well. I adapted my beef stroganoff recipe and it is just as tasty using non-dairy products.
