Description: 
When I was little, it was my job to make this. It’s one of my favorite leftovers and it is so easy to make. I always double the recipe! I make this and my cranberry sauce a few days before Thanksgiving. I use the zested and juiced orange from my cranberry sauce in this relish. But if you are only making 1 batch you will need an entire orange.
