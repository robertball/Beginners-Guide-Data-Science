Ingredients:
3/4 cup margarine
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons ice water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place margarine in a stainless steel mixing bowl. Mix using an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on low speed until slightly soft. Pour in flour and salt; continue to mix at low speed to combine. Pour in ice water gradually until a dough forms.
Divide dough in half. Wrap one portion of dough in plastic and refrigerate for later use. Roll out the other portion of dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin. Mold into a 9-inch tart pan. Prick dough base evenly with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
