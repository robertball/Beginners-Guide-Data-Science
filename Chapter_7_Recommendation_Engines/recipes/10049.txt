Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter
2 cups raisins
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 cup chopped walnuts
30 (2 inch) unbaked tart shells

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).
Cream the butter, sugar and eggs well.  Add remaining ingredients and mix thoroughly.
Pour batter into tart shells, no more than half full.  Bake for 20 - 25 minutes.  Watch carefully!!--they'll burn quickly.  Filling will keep in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or so.  Liquid coffee creamer can be used for cream.  Use any good pie pastry for shells.
