Description: 
This recipe is a delicious use of wild rice. Just be sure to season your ground pork if you don't buy it preseasoned (usually labeled as pork sausage). Fresh Italian sausage can also be used, just cut open the casing. Works great prepared a day ahead and re-heated for 20 minutes at serving time.
