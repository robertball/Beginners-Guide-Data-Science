Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup colored sugar for decoration

Directions:
Mix shortening, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together in large bowl.  Stir flour, salt, and baking soda together in a separate bowl.  Blend dry ingredients in with the shortening mixture.  Mix thoroughly with hands.
Divide dough into 3 parts; shape into cylinders, 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 7 inches long.  Roll in colored sugar (or use finely chopped nuts instead).  Chill for several hours or overnight.
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Cut into 1/4 inch slices, and place on greased cookie sheets.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool.
