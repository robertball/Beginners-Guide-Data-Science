Ingredients:
2 potatoes
2 sweet potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
2 pinches salt
1/2 cup dates
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Begin by chopping of both type of potatoes in to bite size chunks.
Once chopped place the potatoes in boiling water until they are just soft enough to be easily penetrated by a fork.
In a skillet melt the butter over medium heat and then saute the potatoes in the pan after sprinkling them with salt.
Just as the potatoes begin to brown mix in the brown sugar, cinnamon, dates and pumpkin seeds into the pan with the potatoes.
Continue to saute the mixture for one to two minutes just until the dates are warm and the pumpkin seeds begin to brown.
Take the potato mixture off of the heat and serve.
