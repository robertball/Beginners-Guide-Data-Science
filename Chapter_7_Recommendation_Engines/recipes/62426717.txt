Ingredients:
1 boneless chicken breast
3 cups whole wheat penne
1 cup chopped yellow onion
2 garlic cloves
Olive Oil
1 Tbsp of butter
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 bunch of asparagus (Chopped)
1 cup of heavy cream
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
Begin by cooking the chicken on a frying pan or in the oven (I used the frying pan). In another frying pan coat the bottom with the olive oil and add the butter. Add garlic and onions. Cook until tender. Add white wine and let simmer until all the liquid has evaporated. In a bowl add chopped asparagus and drizzle with olive oil and salt and pepper and mix. Add heavy cream to the frying pan followed by the asparagus. Heat to boil, then simmer for 30 minutes or until thick. Add in chicken then pour into pasta and mix and ENJOY :)
