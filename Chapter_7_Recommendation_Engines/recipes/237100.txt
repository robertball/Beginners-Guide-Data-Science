Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup water
1 package brownie mix
1 cup chocolate chips, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Blend black beans and water together in a blender until smooth; pour into a bowl. Stir brownie mix into black bean mixture until batter is smooth; fold in 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 25 to 27 minutes. Cool brownies completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares.

Description: 
You won't believe how chocolate-y and moist these brownies are. I like to make them in mini muffin cups with mini foil cupcake liners. Dust them with powdered sugar and you have a decadent treat with the benefit of more protein, more fiber, and fewer fat calories.
