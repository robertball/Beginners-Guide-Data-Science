Ingredients:
6 ounces pancetta bacon, finely diced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup red onion, chopped
1 cup chopped celery

1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 cups chicken stock
4 (19 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups seashell pasta
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In an 8-quart pot, saute pancetta in the olive oil until soft, about 10 minutes. Add onion and celery; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with sage, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Pour in the chicken stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Stir in the drained beans, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta in 4 quarts boiling water with 1 teaspoon salt until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and add to the soup.
Stir in minced parsley before serving, and sprinkle with grated cheese.
