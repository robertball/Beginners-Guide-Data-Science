Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
Mix together 1/4 cup flour, Parmesan cheese, thyme, dill, and salt in a shallow dish.
Pour 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup flour in two separate shallow dishes.
Dip tilapia fillets into plain flour, then milk.
Thoroughly coat the fillets with the seasoned flour; reserve the remaining seasoned flour.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the fillets in the butter, about 2 minutes each side.
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until the fish is easily flaked with a fork, 2 to 5 minutes more.
Transfer the fillets to a dish.
Increase heat to medium, and pour the remaining seasoned flour into the skillet.
Whisk in white wine; cook and stir until reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes.
Gradually stir in 1/4 cup milk. Reduce heat to low and allow sauce to simmer for 1 or 2 minutes more.
Spoon sauce over tilapia to serve.
