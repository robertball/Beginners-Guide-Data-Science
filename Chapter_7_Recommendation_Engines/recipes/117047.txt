Ingredients:
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 (7 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 eggs
2 cups milk
1 cup shredded provolone cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, cook sausage and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a greased 3-qt. baking dish.  Sprinkle with half of the red peppers; top with spinach. In a bowl, combine the flour, Parmesan cheese, basil and salt. Whisk eggs and milk; stir into flour mixture until blended. Pour over spinach.
Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Top with provolone cheese and remaining red peppers. Bake 3-5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
