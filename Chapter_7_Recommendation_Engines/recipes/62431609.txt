Ingredients:
12 roma (plum) tomatoes or 4 large round tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, unpeeled
2 small onions, quartered
1 jalapeno chile pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (enough to drizzle on veges)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 ears of corn (boil and remove corn from cob) or 1 cup of canned or frozen corn

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
In a medium baking dish, place tomatoes, garlic, onion and jalapeno chile pepper. Drizzle with olive oil.
Checking often, broil 5 to 15 minutes, or until outsides of vegetables are charred.
Remove vegetables from heat and cool. Remove and discard tomato cores, jalapeno stem and garlic skins.
In a food processor, coarsely chop the charred vegetables -- I use the pulse cycle so I can get the exact consistency I want. Transfer to a medium bowl and mix in cumin, salt, pepper, lime juice, cilantro and corn.
Cover and refrigerate -- chill before serving.

Description: 
This chunky, smoky salsa tastes amazing with tortilla chips, or as a topping on baked potatoes or meats.  I also include it in my home-made burritos. Roasted tomatoes, garlic, onion and jalapeno are blended with cilantro, corn and cumin creating an amazing flavor.Modified from: Roasted Tomato Salsa I
