Description: 
This is the easiest and best tasting Macaroni salad.  It tastes great as is but you can add your favorite ingredient or two to make it your own personalized recipe.  Keep the base the same just add your favorites. Sometimes I add sliced green olives and chopped hard boiled egg; sometimes a can of drained chunked tuna and a 1/4 cup of French dressing;  or fresh bell peppers and a tsp of yellow mustard and paprika. Endless variations! You may need to mix in a bit more mayo once you are ready to serve depending on your ingredients.
