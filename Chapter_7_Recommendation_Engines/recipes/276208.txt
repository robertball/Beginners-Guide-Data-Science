Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package ground turkey
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup shredded carrots (optional)
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper (optional)
5 low-sodium buttery round crackers, crushed (such as Ritz Crackers®)
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place turkey, onion, carrots, bell pepper, crackers, egg, milk, seasoning blend, and pepper into a mixing bowl. Blend gently using your hands until combined. Mold into a loaf shape and place onto the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 40 to 45 minutes.
