Ingredients:
2 (12 ounce) packages extra-firm tofu
⅔ cup liquid aminos (such as Bragg(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
½ cup canola oil
⅓ cup fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons agave nectar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried thyme
2 teaspoons ginger paste
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place tofu between a few layers of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place a heavy plate on top; add a few books to the plate to press the tofu and drain excess liquid, 20 to 30 minutes.
Unwrap tofu and slice into 2-inch slices that are 1/4-inch thick. Arrange slices in a large, shallow baking dish.
Combine liquid aminos, canola oil, lemon juice, agave nectar, garlic, thyme, ginger paste, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; blend until smooth. Pour over tofu slices.
Marinate tofu in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake tofu in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe that the whole family will love (even your meat eaters). Serve it with brown rice and steamed veggies for a healthy vegan meal any night of the week. Start the marinating process the evening before you intend to cook it. I doubled this recipe in order to have leftovers for lunch. Simply reheat it with potatoes or rice. You can also serve it cold on a salad or as filling for a sandwich.
