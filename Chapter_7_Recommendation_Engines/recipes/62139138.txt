Ingredients:
2 head or bags or broccoli florets cut up small
1 1/2 cup of fat free mayonaisse
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup whole cashews
1 cup of craisens or raisens (I prefer the craisens)
1 pound of crisy fried bacon crumbled
1/4 cup of finely chopped red onion
1/2 cup of grated parmesean cheese

Directions:
Wash broccoli and cut florets into nice bite size pieces and place into bowl
Add cashews, craisens, bacon, onion and cheese to bowl
In separate bowl mix mayo and sugar together
Pour over salad and mix until covered.
You may add more dressing if you prefer a wetter salad.
This salad is the best if made the night before and allowed to sit in the fridge overnight.
