1/2 tsp. double strength vanilla
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
Top Layer:
1 (10 ounce) jar raspberry preserves
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup applesauce

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Combine the oats, flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture. Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.
