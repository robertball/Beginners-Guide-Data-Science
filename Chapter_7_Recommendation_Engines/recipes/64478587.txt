Ingredients:
4 green apples
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
2 Tbsp. pecans, roughly chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Prepare apples by removing the top and cutting or scooping out the core without cutting through the bottom of the apple.
With a sharp knife, slice a ring around the apples horizontally, cutting just through the skin (this will keep them from splitting open).
Place apples in a baking dish just large enough to fit all of them.
In a small bowl, mix together cinnamon, ginger, and pecans.
Fill apple core holes with the nut mixture and bake until apples are cooked through and starting to collapse, about 20-25 minutes.
These can be served hot, at room temperature, or even straight from the fridge the next day!

Description: 
For many of us, apple pie is the definition of comfort food. Try this variation - the aroma of apples as they bake is so evocative of apple pie that you might not miss the pastry!
