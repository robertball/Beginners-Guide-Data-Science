Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup confectioner sugar
1 cup butter
3 eggs
1 cup and 2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon butter, melted
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (175 degrees C) on convection. Line a 9x13 inch pan with parchment paper or quick release foil.
Toast pecans for 10 minutes, making sure not to burn them.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour and 1/2 cup confectioners sugar. Cut in 1 cup of butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the prepared pan, and press in firmly, running up the sides about 1/4 inch.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.
While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a large bowl mix together the eggs, corn syrup, sugars, remaining butter, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chopped pecans. Spread the filling evenly over the crust as soon as it comes out of the oven.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set. Allow to cool completely on a  wire rack before slicing into bars.
