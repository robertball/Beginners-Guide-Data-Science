Cream sugar and butter until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs and flavoring. Mix dry ingredients in separate bowl and add to butter mixture. Mix well.
Put a handful of the freshly made dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll to desired thickness. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Put the rolled dough, including the parchment paper, on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 10 minutes or longer. Your dough will be chilled and ready to cut and bake with no wait and no added flour! Repeat the process with scraps after cutting cookies.
To assemble the Double Sweetheart Cookies follow these instructions: For each Sweetheart cookie you are going to make, cut 2 heart shape cookies of the same size, but one of them need a second heart cut in the middle. This will be the window where the jam will show.  Place in biscuit tray and bake at 350F degrees for 8 to 10 minutes. Leave to cool in rack. When they are already cold spread with jam the cookie without hole and then mount the cookie with hole, which you should have already sprinkled with confectioners sugar. You are ready, you have your first Double Sweetheart Cookie!
