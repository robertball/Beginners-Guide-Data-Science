Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts pounded to 1/4"
Salt and black pepper to taste
8 thin slices deli ham
4 slices Swiss cheese
2 Tbsp flour
1 egg, beaten
1 cup panko bread crumbs
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp honey
1/2 Tbsp olive oil mayonnaise

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Lay two slices of ham and one slice of cheese across each breast, then roll widthwise until you have a tight, jellyroll-like package.
Place the flour, egg, and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Working with one rolled-up breast at a time, dip first in the flour to lightly coat, then in the egg, then immediately in the bread crumbs. Use your fingers to make sure the chicken is evenly coated with crumbs.
Arrange the chicken on a baking sheet and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the chicken is firm to the touch and cooked through and the bread crumbs are brown and crunchy.
While the chicken bakes, stir together the lemon juice, mustard, honey, and mayo to make a smooth, uniform sauce. Serve the chicken with the honey mustard drizzled over the top.
