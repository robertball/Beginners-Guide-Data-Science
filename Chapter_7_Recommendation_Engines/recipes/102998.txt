Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 yellow onions, chopped
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 head garlic, peeled and minced
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 orange bell pepper, chopped
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
2 pounds Italian sausage meat
4 slices applewood smoked bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 (28 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (14 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped
2 cups beef broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark beer
1/4 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
1/4 cup crumbled dried oregano
1 tablespoon fresh-ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt, or amount to taste
2 1/2 ounces dark chocolate candy bar

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large deep pot over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions, garlic, and bell peppers. Cook and stir until the onions are transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the beef stew meat, sausage, and bacon. Cook until meats are evenly browned. Drain the fat.
Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, black beans, kidney beans, chipotle peppers with sauce, beef broth, beer, chili powder, oregano, pepper, salt, and chocolate. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for at least 1 hour; 2 hours is preferred.

Description: 
The first time I tried this chili I was floored! It has wonderful flavors, and is very spicy and very addictive. If you don't like heat, adjust the ingredients. It's perfect at a football tailgate party or picnic. If you like a roasted flavor, bake the garlic before pressing it. For the beer, a hoppy pale ale works well, as does a dark stout. I've also experimented with adding a cup of coffee to the mix to give it a roasted coffee flavor. It also freezes well.
