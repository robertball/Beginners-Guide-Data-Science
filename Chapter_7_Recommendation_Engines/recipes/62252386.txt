Ingredients:
1 large onion, diced
1-2 tsp. olive oil
1 can black beans, drained
1 can niblets corn, drained
1 can rotel diced tomatoes/chilies (do not drain)
garlic salt to taste
1-2 cans chopped green chilies
1/2 - 3/4 package corn tortillas
2-3 cups shredded cheese (colby or cheddar)
1 can golden mushroom or cream of mushroom soup
1/4 - 1/3 c. milk (lowfat works fine)
8 oz. light sour cream
1/2 tsp. garlic powder

Directions:
Saute onion in olive oil over medium heat until a little softened (keep a bit of crunch).  Add black beans, corn, rotel, and sprinkle with garlic salt to taste.  Stir and cook until some of the tomato juice cooks down, and vegetables are warmed through.
Spray 9 x 13 pyrex pan with cooking spray.  Break or cut corn tortillas in half; make a single layer of tortillas in pan, overlapping as needed to completely cover bottom.  Spoon bean mixture over tortillas.  Spread green chilies over beans.  Top with half the cheese.  Place another layer of halved corn tortillas over cheese, completely covering as before.
In a small bowl, mix together mushroom soup, sour cream, milk, and garlic powder (consistency should be thick, but easy to spread).  Spread this over tortillas; top with remaining cheese.
Bake uncovered in a preheated 350 oven about 30 minutes.  Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving.
