Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground pork
1 tsp oil (coconut, olive or vegetable)
1/4 tsp ground caraway seeds
1/4 tsp marjoram
1/4 tsp sage
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp white ground pepper (fine ground)
1/8 tsp black ground pepper
1 tsp table salt (or Himalayan pink salt)
1/4 tsp fine herbs (Provence)

Directions:
Add all ingredients into a mixing bowl and mix well with your hands.  I wear latex gloves so I can feel the mixture to ensure the spices are mixed well.  Add a sprinkle of water as you massage the pork to ensure even consistency (no too much water)
Tear off pieces of the mixture and roll the pork into balls – about 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter (makes about 4 - 6 good sized pork balls)
Add oil to fry pan (I use coconut oil because it’s a high-heat oil); bring a fry pan to medium heat; place pork balls in frying pan and firmly press each ball down into a thin patty; fry evenly on both sides for about 6 minutes each side and serve.
