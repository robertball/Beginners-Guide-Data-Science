Description: 
Scrumptious alternative to ground beef. These delicious ground chicken burgers are the perfect quick and easy meal for 2 to 4 people. These burgers can be prepared in advance and put in the freezer (uncooked) for a quick dinner idea. Also these are very yummy with ground turkey as well. Serve with spicy mustard or ketchup. These burgers are great without the bread as well if you are controlling your carb intake.
