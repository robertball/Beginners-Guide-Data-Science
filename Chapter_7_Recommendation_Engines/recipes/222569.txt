1 1/2 cups ketchup
1/2 pound fully cooked ham

1 1/2 tablespoons onion powder
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Place beans in a large pot and cover with plenty of water. Cover pot with a lid and soak beans for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and fill pot with fresh water.
Cook beans over medium heat until tender, about 1 hour. Drain beans, reserving the water for later use.
Place beans, ketchup, ham, 1 1/2 cup water, brown sugar, molasses, onion powder, mustard, salt, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and 1 cup reserved bean water in a slow cooker. Add more bean water as needed if beans get too dry.
Cook on Low for 7 to 9 hours.
