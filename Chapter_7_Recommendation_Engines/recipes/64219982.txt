Mix all together. Use like store bought  chili seasoning packet.
To make chili: Brown 1lb lean ground beef or turkey, season with seasoning salt (Lawrys) and garlic powder. When meat is about half done add 1/2 chopped onion, 1/2 chopped green pepper. Cook until tender.  And seasoning mixture and cook for a few minutes. Add 2 cans beans (I used one can chili beans and one can kidney beans), 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 small can tomato sauce. Bring up to temperature, reduce heat and simmer at least 20 minutes, but preferrably 1.5-2 hours.
