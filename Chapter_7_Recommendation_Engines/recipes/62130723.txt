Ingredients:
1 package fresh Shanghai noodles (thick or thin)
1 bunch bean sprouts
3 green onions julienned
2 stalks celery julienned
1 bunch oyster mushrooms julienned
2 garlic cloves crushed
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons mushroom infused soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock
1-2 chilli peppers or 1 tablespoon XO sauce (optional)
1 half chicken breast or pork tenderloin, julienned (optional)
2 tablespoons canola oil

Directions:
In a large work or saute pan, boil enough water to par-cook the noodles for 3-5 minutes.
Drain the noodles.
In the same pan of boiling water, blanch the bean sprouts for 2-3 minutes.
Drain along with the noodles and set aside.
Once the wok or saute pan is completely dry, heat the oil to medium high heat.
When oil starts to smoke, quickly stir fry meat (optional)garlic, chilli peppers, green onions, celery and carrots for about 2 minutes.
Add the mushrooms and stir fry for another 3-4 minutes until the mushrooms are slightly browned.
Add the noodles, bean sprouts, sugar, oyster sauce and soy sauce and cook for another 3-5 minutes.
Add chicken stock, lower heat to a simmer, cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes or until the noodles are fully cooked.
Serve hot.
