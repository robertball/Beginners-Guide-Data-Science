Ingredients:
3 pounds of baby red potatoes quartered
2 T Fresh rosemary
2 T Kosher Salt
Â½ C Good quality olive oil
4 cloves fresh garlic pressed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.   Wash and quarter the potatoes set aside.  Chop your rosemary and place it into a bowl large enough to mix all your ingredients.. I like to "crush" the rosemary as I put it into the bowl so it will release more flavor.  Take your garlic and press and press your garlic (I really think fresh garlic is important in this recipe) add your salt and oil, mix well.   Add your potatoes and toss to coat each piece.  Place the potatoes on a baking sheet with a slotted spoon being careful not to allow the oil to puddle on the baking sheet.  Roast the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes, checking for a golden brown color.  Turn the potatoes to brown all sides approx 10 more minutes.  (Oven temperatures vary so keep an eye on them)
