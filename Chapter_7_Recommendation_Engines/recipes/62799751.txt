Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup low-fat buttermilk/soured milk
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
2 large egg whites
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups seedless blackberry or red raspberry jam
cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. Lightly grease two 9-inch round cake pans, then dust with flour. Line bottoms with wax paper.
In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt. In a cup, combine the buttermilk and vanilla.
With an electric mixer on medium, cream the sugar and butter until light yellow and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl often. Add the egg and egg whites and beat well. Beat in a 3/4 cup of jam. Using a wooden spoon, stir in 1/3 of the flour mixture, then 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, followed by another1/3 of the flour mixture and the rest of the buttermilk mixture, then the last of the flour mixture.
Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. The the cake cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans. Carefully peel off the wax paper and let the cakes cool completely.
Place one cake layer upsidedown onto a plate. Spread the remaining 3/4 of a cup onto the first layer. Top with the second layer right side up and frost the top and sides with cream cheese frosting.
