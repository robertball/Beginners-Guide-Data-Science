Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, finely chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth; stir in flour. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a skillet or saucepan over medium heat, saute mushrooms and onion in butter until tender. Remove from the heat. Add cream cheese, salt, thyme and pepper; stir until cheese is melted. Cool to room temperature. On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut into 3-in. circles. Combine egg and water; lightly brush edges of circles. Place about 1 teaspoon of filling in center of each circle. Fold over; seal edges. Brush with egg mixture. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
