Ingredients:
1 - 15 oz can Pumpkin
1 - 15 oz can Coconut Milk (remember to shake can before opening)
3/4 to 1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
Dash of salt
Vanilla Extract to taste
Cinnamon to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325
Put all ingredients in a bowl and mix until all combined.
Pour into your favorite pie crust* or make your own. I did not pre-bake the crust.
Bake 1-2 hours. I started checking at 45 minutes and it took about 1 1/2 hours total to bake. It takes longer with the coconut milk. I checked about every 15 minutes until it was close then ever 5 minutes.
*I personally have found pie crusts to all taste the same so I used a Pillsbury Pie Crust for this recipe. The kind you roll into the pan. It worked really well but I made so much batter that there wasn't much of an edge to the crust. If you want more of an edge, use a different crust or less filling.
Disclaimer: I don't eat dairy so I tried to come up with a recipe that didn't have sweetened condensed milk. My kids devoured this and asked for more and they LOVE regular pumpkin pie! Also when I say "to taste" its because I just pour in what I want. I know that's annoying if you aren't a baker so I would suggest starting with 1/2 tsp of each and see how the filling smells to you.
