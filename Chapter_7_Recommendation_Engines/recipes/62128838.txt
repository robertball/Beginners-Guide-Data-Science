Description: 
My family refers to this as Heart Attack Salad. It does mix potatoes with bacon, cheese and mayonnaise, but it is sinfully delicious. You can cut down on the bacon and use low fat mayonnaise if you wish. The only trick is to NOT overcook the potatoes, it will be too hard to combine the ingredients without it getting mushy.
