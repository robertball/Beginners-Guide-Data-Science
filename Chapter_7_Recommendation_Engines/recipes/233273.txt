Ingredients:
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon wheat gluten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon water, or more as needed
21 tablespoons whole wheat flour, or as needed

Directions:
Mix 3/4 cup flour, gluten, and salt together in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture using a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Mix 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon water into the flour mixture using your hands until dough easily forms a ball; add more water if needed.
Flatten dough into a pancake-like shape on a floured surface; sprinkle top of dough liberally with about 1 tablespoon flour. Roll dough, using a rolling pin, into a thin pie crust about 1-inch larger than your pie pan. Roll the crust onto the rolling pin and transfer to the pie pan.

Description: 
I generally try to eat as many whole grain foods as I can and I was astonished to discover not a single basic 100% whole wheat pie crust recipe here at Allrecipes. So here's mine! I previously had trouble with whole wheat pie crusts; they tended to be hard to work with and crumbly. Then I added wheat gluten, as I do for bread, and voila! 

This makes enough for one 8-inch pie. If you're making a recipe that requires a top and bottom crust, double the recipe.
