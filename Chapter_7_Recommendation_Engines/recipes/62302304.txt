Ingredients:
Ground beef - 1/2 lb 80% lean
Ground Italian sausage - 3/4 lb - hot or mild (we like hot) you can buy patties and beak them down if you can’t find it ground
Yellow cooking onion - 1 large  chopped
Fresh mushrooms sliced  2 cups
Minced garlic - 1/3 cup
Basil pesto - 1/3 - 1/2 cup (I also have used Italian seasoning flaks as a substitute for the pesto in the same qty)
Macaroni  ¾ lbs  rigatoni, ziti, bowties  whatever
Chicken broth  1 quart
Shredded or grated mozzarella cheese
Grated parmesan or romano cheese  1/3 cup
Olive oil  as needed to cook onions and mushrooms
Black pepper to taste
Salt

Directions:
In a large skillet sauté the onions and mushrooms over medium heat with the olive oil until the onions are soft – 8 minutes - see image.
Mix in the garlic and pesto.
In a large pan boil water and cook the macaroni al-dente – add small amount of salt and or olive oil.
Add the ground beef and sausage to the onion mushroom combination and cook until you can’t see any red – 10 minutes – see image.
Add chicken broth and bring to boil – see image.
Add the macaroni and let simmer for 10 - 15 minutes so the macaroni sucks up some of the broth.
Add the grated cheese and mix in and place in oven safe single serving dishes – see image.
