3/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/3 cup dill pickle relish, or to taste

1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped green onions
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain and cool.
