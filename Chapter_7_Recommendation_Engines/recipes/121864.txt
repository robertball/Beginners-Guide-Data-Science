Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup strawberry or plum jelly
TOPPING:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients.  In another bowl, whisk the egg, milk, butter and vanilla.  Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.  Spoon half of the batter into 12 greased or paper-lined muffin cups.  Spoon 1 teaspoon jelly in center of each.  Fill muffin cups two-thirds full with remaining batter.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 1 in. from the edge comes out clean.  Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.  Brush tops with butter.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; dip tops of muffins in mixture.  Serve warm.

Description: 
'As a child, I always loved the gooey surprise in the center of jelly-filled doughnuts,' remembers Darlene Markel from Stayton, Oregon. 'These yummy muffins offer that same sweet filling, but they're baked instead of fried.'
