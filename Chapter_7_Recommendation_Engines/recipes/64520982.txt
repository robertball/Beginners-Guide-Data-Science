Ingredients:
1-2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
2 cups cooked white rice (you can use brown as well) (save about 1 cup to add as garnish)
4 cups different colored bell peppers, chopped (save a bit for garnishing)
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (32 oz.) container of vegetable or chicken broth (you might need more, if it becomes too thick)
2 (8 oz.) cans of tomato sauce
2 (15 oz.) cans of chopped tomatoes (drained)
1 tsp. dried marjoram or oregano
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
To a large Dutch oven over medium low heat add the oil and sauté the peppers and onions until they start to get soft, about 7-10 minutes, stirring often.
Add the broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce, salt and pepper. Mix well and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and continue to cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the soup to reduce a little bit. If it becomes too thick, just add a bit more broth, a little at a time until you get the desired consistency. I don’t like mine too thick or thin. Add in all but one cup of the rice and mix well. Heat through. Ladle the soup into bowls and distribute the reserved rice and peppers over the soup as a garnish. Enjoy!
