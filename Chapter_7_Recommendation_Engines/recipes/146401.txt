2 cups white sugar
1 cup shortening
2 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
2 cups persimmon pulp
2 cups raisin paste
2 cups chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.
Cream the sugar and shortening together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg, blending thoroughly. Mix in the persimmon pulp, raisin paste, and walnuts. Drop by spoonfuls onto prepared cookies sheets, and spread out slightly.
Bake in preheated oven until cookie top springs back when touched, 12 to 15 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This is a spicy cookie that's Mmmm, Mmmm Good! It's hard to get fresh persimmons these days, but if you have them, this is a great recipe. It's an original handed down to me by old/ancient relatives, and over 170 years old. These cookies also freeze well. Have fun!
