Description: 
Sweet blueberries and tart lemon pair well in this alternative to oatmeal. High in protein and fiber, quinoa is a great start to your day! I made this up one morning when I had a craving for quinoa and was looking for a change from the usual. Top with extra milk for a thinner consistency. Also good with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg.
