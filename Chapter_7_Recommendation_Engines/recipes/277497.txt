Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1 (16 ounce) package bacon
1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough
8 frozen hash brown patties, or to taste
8 eggs
3/4 cup milk
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish and set aside.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy but not fully browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Slice biscuits lengthwise and place on the bottom of the baking dish, sealing the dough to cover the bottom completely. Top with hash brown patties. Layer bacon over the hash browns.
Whisk eggs and milk together, then pour over the casserole. Top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is bubbling and bacon is crispy, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This recipe came about when I had all the ingredients for a great breakfast but didn't want to cook everything separately. Threw it into a casserole dish and voila! This is by far the best breakfast casserole I've ever had. It's wonderful when having breakfast for dinner!
