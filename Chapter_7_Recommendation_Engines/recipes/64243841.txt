Ingredients:
4 egg whites
1/2 tsp of Cream of Tartar
1 cup of sugar
Kool-Aid packets in your flavors of choice

Directions:
Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites until they become frothy (you will see lots of little bubbles).
Next, add your sugar in small amounts.
Finally, mix in the cream of tartar.
Continue to whip the mixture until it gets stiff (meaning that it holds a shape when stopped).
Depending on how many Kool-Aid flavors you wish to use, separate your mixture into even parts using small bowls.
Add the Kool-Aid powder 1/2 tsp at a time until the desired color is reached.
Remember, the Kool-Aid powder is potent, so a little goes a long way!
Prepare your baking sheet with a layer of foil covered with non-stick spray, as seen below.
Create an easy meringue cookie shape using either: Wiltonâ€™s Cake Decorating set, ziplock baggies with the tip removed, or using rounded spoonfuls.
Place the Kool Aid Meringues into the oven pre-heated to 225 degrees.
Bake them at this low temperature for about 45 minutes or until the tops become a little brown.
Once they are completely cooled, they will harden and be ready to eat! Some will be sour, some will be sweet, but they will ALL be super cool!
