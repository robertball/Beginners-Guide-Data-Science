Directions:
Whip the cream to form light peaks. Set aside in the refrigerator.
Melt the chopped chocolate in a large mixing bowl set over barely simmering water.
Meanwhile, whip the eggs with the sugar until very fluffy and thick, about 10 minutes. Quickly stir the beaten eggs into the melted chocolate, then fold in the whipped cream.
Pour or spoon mixture into cups or bowls, and chill until firm, about 2 hours.
