Add the ground peeled tomatos, salt, oregano, and basil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fusilli and cook for 12 minutes until al dente. Drain and set aside. Add the lemon juice and sugar, bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer another 20 minutes or until thickened. Stir in cooked fusilli and serve. Garnish with parmesan cheese.

I was trying to use up everything in my pantry, and I combined canned artichoke hearts and ground peeled tomatos with some garlic, spices and lemon juice. It turned out to be delicious!
