Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 Tbsp baking powder
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 tsp salt
5 Tbsp coconut oil {I use LouAnn's}, chilled and cut into cubes
1 cup full-fat coconut milk
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
lime zest, as much as you like

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Add the chilled coconut oil and cut it in with a knife until all small chunks are thoroughly incorporated. Add the shredded coconut and lime zest. Add the coconut milk, stirring just enough to combine. Place the dough out om a floured surface and press {with floured hands} into a 9-inch circle. Cut into eighths.  Place on covered baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes or until the bottoms are just slightly browned.
Enjoy!
