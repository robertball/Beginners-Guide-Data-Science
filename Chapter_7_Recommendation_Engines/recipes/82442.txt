Ingredients:
18 eggs
6 ounces smoked salmon cream cheese spread
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
paprika to taste

Directions:
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer, and fill with cold water to cover the eggs by at least 1 inch. Cover the saucepan, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat, and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from water, and cool.  Peel once cold.
Cut the eggs in half lengthwise. Place the egg yolks in a mixing bowl, and set the whites aside. Mash the yolks with the cream cheese and mayonnaise until thoroughly blended. Fill the egg white halves with the egg yolk mixture using a spoon. Sprinkle with paprika. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
