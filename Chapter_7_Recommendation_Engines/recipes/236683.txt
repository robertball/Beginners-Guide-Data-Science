Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups water
2 cups quinoa, rinsed
4 teaspoons vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
2 1/2 cups frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 sweet onions, chopped
2 bell peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
6 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek), or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring water, quinoa, and vegetable bouillon to a boil in a large pot; stir in edamame, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions and bell peppers until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ginger and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in soy sauce, cilantro, and chile paste.
Stir onion mixture into quinoa mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until excess broth has been absorbed, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I adapted this from a turkey burger recipe when I went vegan. It is also gluten-free if you use gluten-free soy sauce. I use it as a post-workout meal, as it is delicious, satisfying and relatively high in plant-based protein. Enjoy!
