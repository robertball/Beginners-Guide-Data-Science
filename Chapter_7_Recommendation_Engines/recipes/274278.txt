Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup teriyaki sauce, or as needed
6 (1/2 inch thick) slices fresh pineapple
6 hamburger buns
6 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix turkey, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Form mixture into 6 large patties, each about 1/2 inch thick.
Cook burgers on the preheated grill, basting occasionally with teriyaki sauce, until no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Meanwhile, grill pineapple slices until lightly charred, about 3 minutes per side. Do not overcook or pineapple will get mushy. Place hamburger buns, cut-sides down, on the grill. Grill until light golden brown, about 10 seconds.
Place burgers on toasted buns. Place a slice of provolone cheese and grilled pineapple atop each burger and serve.
