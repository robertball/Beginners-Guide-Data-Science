Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Spray 10x8 or 13x9 baking pan with non-stick cooking spray.  Beat sugar and room temperature butter together until light, scraping sides.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.  Add baking soda and sea salt to flour save 1 Tablespoon to toss with blueberries.  Alternate beating in flour and sour cream, ending with flour.  Beat in vanilla or lemon extract.  Gently toss blueberries with flour.  Fold into batter.  Spread half of batter in prepared pan.  Mix cinnamon with brown sugar and pecans, sprinkle over batter.  Spread remaining batter over streusel.  Bake in preheated oven 35 to 45 minutes or until toothpick, inserted in center, comes out clean.  Let cook in pan.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired. Serve warm.   I keep this in the refrigerator since there are so many berries in it and the bottom is a little moist.
