Description: 
I love soup in those large authentic Pho bowl (54 Ounce). The key to any Pho soup is the stock, you can add to stock garlic, cinnamon stick, and star anise. I like to make my own chicken stock but you can doctor up chicken broth. Making this soup is a lot easier than you probably think it's going to be. Most of the work is preparing the vegetables to be a garnish for your soup.
