1 tsp. crushed red pepper
1/2 tsp. garlic
1/2 tsp. oregano

Description: 
This pizza sauce is sweet and smooth, with a touch of spicy red pepper... and it's a breeze to make! It was inspired by Chicago deep dish pizza and the sweet sauces we Illinoisans love so much! Enjoy.

Also, I recommend making the sauce the TOP layer of your pizza and using the cheese as the BOTTOM layer; put your desired toppings in the MIDDLE of your pie. This works for deep dish or thin crusts. Cook the pizza a little longer than usual and the cheese will be gooey and delicious!
