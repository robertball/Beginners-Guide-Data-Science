Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, sliced thin
1 red bell pepper, sliced thin
2 cups chicken stock
4 cups vegetable juice (such as V-8Â®)
2 (14 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
3 cups shredded smoked turkey
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 jalapeno pepper, minced (or more to taste)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper in hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the pot and reduce heat to low. Stir vegetable juice, black beans, turkey, diced tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, cumin, chili powder, jalapeno pepper, salt, and pepper into the stock. Raise heat to medium, bring the soup to a simmer, and cook until heated through and the flavors meld, 15 to 30 minutes.
