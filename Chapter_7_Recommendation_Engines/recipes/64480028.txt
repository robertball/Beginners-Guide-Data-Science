Ingredients:
12 oz. Pasta (long pasta  fettuccini, linguine, or spaghetti work best)
1 Tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Two Sweet Italian Sausages
A Handful of Baby Carrots
1 Can (15 oz.) White Beans (Cannellini works well)
Two Cloves of Garlic
½ Cup Basil (cut into strips)
One Small to Medium Onion
½ Cup Parmesan Cheese
¾ Cup Heavy Cream
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Bring some water to a boil with the baby carrots in a medium-sized pot.
Cut the sausages into one-inch pieces and sauté them in olive oil for fifteen minutes. Once the insides are no longer pink, put the sausages in a mixing bowl.
Peel and chop the onion into small pieces, and sauté it in the same pan for five minutes. Strain the beans if they are canned, and add them to the sauté along with heavy cream during the last two minutes. The garlic (peeled and chopped into small pieces) goes in during the last minute.
Once the sauté is done, put it in the bowl with the sausages.
Add pasta to the pot of water once it is boiling. Stir occasionally. Check the package for cooking time.
When it is al dente, strain the pasta and add it to the bowl along with carrots. Mix everything together, and serve with basil and Parmesan cheese on top.
