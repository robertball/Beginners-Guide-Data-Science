Ingredients:
1 package Betty Crocker devil's food cake mix
1/2 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
170 g caramel ice cream topping
117 g bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped (Daim Bars from the Euroshop!)
1/2 pint of whipped cream

Directions:
Bake cake according to package directions for a 9x13 inch pan; cool on wire rack for 5 minutes.   Make slits across the top of the cake, making sure not to go through to the bottom.
In a saucepan over low heat, combine sweetened condensed milk and most of the caramel topping, stirring until smooth and blended.  Slowly pour the warm topping mixture over the top of the warm cake, letting it sink into the slits; then sprinkle most of the crushed chocolate toffee bars liberally across the entire cake while still warm. (Hint: I crush the bars into small chunks as opposed to crumbs - I like to have pieces I can chew on!)
Let cake cool completely, then top with whipped cream. Decorate the top of the cake with some more chocolate toffee bar chunks and swirls of caramel topping. Refrigerate and serve right from the pan!
