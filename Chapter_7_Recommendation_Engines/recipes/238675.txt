Ingredients:
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
ground black pepper to taste
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a small baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place garlic cloves on prepared baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Fold aluminum foil tightly around garlic.
Roast garlic in the preheated oven until soft and fragrant, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove garlic from aluminum foil and transfer to a bowl.
Mash garlic, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and salt together with a fork until spread has a uniform, paste-like consistency.

Description: 
This is an awesome and simple bread spread to use in place of butter or garlic butter. Use light mayonnaise if you want fewer calories. The prep time is almost nothing if you have roasted garlic in the fridge from a previous meal. Spread thinly on bread before toasting in the oven or serve in a bowl for guests to apply to their own bread.
