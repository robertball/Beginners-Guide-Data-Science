Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
1  lemon, juiced
¼ cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¾ teaspoon paprika
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained

1 medium green bell pepper, sliced
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 ½ cups orange juice

Directions:
Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle with lemon juice, cover, and marinate at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Mix the salt, pepper, and paprika in a small bowl, and sprinkle over the chicken. Place chicken in the skillet and quickly brown on all sides. Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Distribute olives, onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper evenly in the baking dish. Pour orange juice over all.
Cover with aluminum foil, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until chicken juices run clear.
