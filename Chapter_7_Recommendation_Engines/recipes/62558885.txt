Ingredients:
1/2 c sugar
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1/4 tsp nutmeg
2 eggs
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 c milk
6-8 thick slices stale bread (depending on size)
butter
maple syrup or powdered sugar for topping

Directions:
Leave bread on a wire rack overnight (8 hrs) to dry.
Preheat a large griddle to medium heat.  Whisk together sugar, cornstarch and nutmeg. Beat in eggs and mix well. Whisk in vanilla and milk.
Dip stale bread in egg mixture, letting soak for about 10 seconds per side. Let dipped bread rest on wire rack for a few minutes to absorb custard before cooking.
Brush griddle with butter and cook over medium heat until golden brown and cooked through. Serve warm with real maple syrup.

Description: 
Typical french toast tastes eggy to me, but I don't like eggs. I tried pain perdu, but found it a bit too sweet. This version was the perfect balance for me and my family. It's day old bread soaked in custard and cooked on a griddle until fluffy and golden brown. Reminds me a little of bread pudding. In fact, I use the same custard when I make bread pudding, only with croissants so it's nice and buttery. I hope it's your perfect french toast, too.
