Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 (8.8 ounce) packages UNCLE BEN'S® READY RICE® Whole Grain Brown Rice
1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 medium avocados, divided
4 tablespoons cilantro, divided
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cup fresh corn kernels
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup tortilla chips

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Melt butter in skillet; add rice and beans, stirring frequently. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add water, as needed, to get rice to desired texture. Remove from heat; set aside.
In a blender or mini food processor, combine 1/2 of an avocado, 2 tablespoons cilantro, and lime juice. Blend until sauce is thin. Add water if needed.
In 4 separate bowls, evenly divide rice and bean mixture, tomatoes, and corn. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of avocado-cilantro sauce. Top evenly with remaining avocado and cilantro. Add 1 tablespoon crushed tortilla chips to each bowl.

Description: 
This dinner bowl recipe comes together in mere minutes and appeals to vegans and omnivores alike. To bring this meal together even faster, make the avocado-cilantro sauce earlier in the day. We like to keep the corn raw for extra crunch and a fresh flavor, but feel free to use cooked, frozen and thawed, or canned corn kernels, if that's what you prefer.
