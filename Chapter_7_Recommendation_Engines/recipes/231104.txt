Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (10 ounce) container grape tomatoes, halved
1 cucumber, peeled and diced
1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1/4 red onion, finely diced
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, diced
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package tricolored (rainbow) rotini pasta
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Stir garbanzo beans, grape tomatoes, cucumber, black olives, red onion, olive oil, garlic, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, basil, salt, and black pepper in a large salad bowl.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain. Gently fold pasta into salad and chill 15 to 20 minutes to blend flavors. Mix feta cheese into salad.

Description: 
I invented this fresh and easy recipe when I found myself continually invited to summer potlucks, and I needed a no-fuss dish to make. You can even make this the day before. A quick, easy, and healthy pasta salad that is great for potlucks and always a crowd-pleaser.
