Ingredients:
Filling
- 2 cups Dried Lentils
- 1 Large Onion
- 1 Celery Stalk
- 4 Cloves of Garlic
- 2 tsp Fresh Thyme*
- 1 tsp Fresh Rosemary*
- 1 Dried Bay Leaf
- 1 tbsp Oil or Butter
- 4 cups Vegetable Stock**
- 3-4 tsp Tomato Paste
- 1-2 tsp Vegan Worcestershire Sauce***
- 2-4 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar***
- 2-3 tbsp Soy Sauce***
- 1 10oz bag Frozen Mixed Vegetables (peas, carrots, green beans, corn)
- Salt and Pepper to taste
Mashed Potatoes
- 3 lbs Potatoes
- 3-4 tbsp Vegan Butter
- 1-2 Tbsp Vegan Milk
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp Garlic Powder (optional) and/or
- 1 cup minced Green Onion (optional)
- Package of vegan cheese (optional)****

Directions:
1. Peel and chop potatoes and place in a pot of water. Place on stove to high until boil, then lower temp to a simmer and cover with lid for approx. 15 minutes or until you can put a fork easily into potatoes.
2. Once potatoes are cooked all the way through, drain water from pot and move potatoes to a mixing bowl. Mash the potatoes however you’d like (I prefer using an electric mixer, because I’m lazy). Add butter and soy milk, then salt and pepper to taste. Add garlic power and/or green onions now if you are trying to make garlic mashed potatoes or green onion mashed potatoes.
3. While the potatoes are cooking, in a medium pot add vegetable stock, tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf, and lentils and bring to boil on high temp. Lower temp to a simmer and cover until lentils are fully cooked.
4. Prep for the filling by dicing your onions and finely chopping your celery and garlic cloves.
5. On a large saucepan of pot, add 1 tbsp of oil or butter and put on stove on high. Add onion, celery, and garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Lower temp to medium and continue to sauté for about five minutes or until evenly browned and caramelized.
6. Add red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce to the saucepan to deglaze. Incorporate the cooked lentils and frozen vegetables into the pan with the vegetables until fully mixed.
7. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add vegetable and lentil mixture to large baking pan first and then add mashed potatoes on top in equal parts. If adding vegan cheese on top, sprinkle on top of mashed potatoes now. Cover pan with foil and put in over for 20 minutes. Uncover and put back in oven for 5-10 minutes or until browned.
8. Leave to cool and then serve!
*If using dried herbs, cut quantities by half.
**If using vegetable bouillon, use 2-3 vegetable bouillon in 4 cups of water.
***Modify the amount of these ingredients to your own preference. Don’t be afraid to trust your tastebuds.
****You don’t have to put the vegan cheese on it, but if you do I recommend a cheddar one.
