Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup skim milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups fresh blueberries
1/2 cup brown sugar (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 6 jumbo muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk whole wheat flour, white sugar, baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk skim milk, egg, softened butter, and vegetable oil. Mix the liquid ingredients into the whole wheat flour mixture to make a smooth batter, and gently fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them to the top.
Combine brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl and spoon the mixture onto the muffins, if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until the muffins are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I received free blueberries recently. I admit I never actually tasted a real one before. Always the boxed muffin kind. I loved them. Recently switched to whole wheat, so I wanted to try a new muffin recipe out. This is the one that not only turned out great, but filling as well. When I was eating it, I was craving eggs. Next time I will have to remember to throw in a fried egg or two on the side. I made 6 jumbo muffins.
