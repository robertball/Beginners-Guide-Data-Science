Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
4 (3.5 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, casings removed
2 cloves garlic
1 dash red pepper flakes
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with chicken broth and 1 cup water; add broccoli rabe. Bring to a boil and cook until nearly tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, stirring to break into small pieces, until crumbly and browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add broccoli rabe, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until broccoli rabe is tender, about 3 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe has been in my family for a long time. It works really great as a side dish or as a main dish if served with pasta (I like to use either gemelli or cavatelli). The chicken broth takes a lot of the bitterness out of the broccoli rabe. Top with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.
