Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 minced garlic cloves
1 1/2 cups milk
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Melt butter and garlic in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat.  Add cream cheese in pieces, stirring with wire whisk until smooth.  Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps.  Stir in grated Parmesan.  Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency.  Sauce will thicken rapidly, thin with milk if cooked too long.  Toss with hot pasta to serve.
