Combine first 5 ingredients.
To juice and rind of orange, add oil and enough boiling water to make 3/4 cup (not sure if this is add to juice to equal 3/4 cup or add oil and boiling water to juice to equal 3/4 cup, hmmm Mom and her lack of detailed instructions! Try the former first!)
Add egg to dry ingredients, mix, then add liquid, nuts, and cranberries.  Don't stir too much.
Pour into greased and floured bread pan (not sure, makes 2 loaves??).
Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour 10 minutes.
