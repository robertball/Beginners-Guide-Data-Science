Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup onion, diced
1 cup sour cream
3 (14.5 ounce) cans French style green beans, drained
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup crumbled buttery round crackers
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in flour until smooth, and cook for one minute. Stir in the salt, sugar, onion, and sour cream. Add green beans, and stir to coat.
Transfer the mixture to a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Spread shredded cheese over the top. In a small bowl, toss together cracker crumbs and remaining butter, and sprinkle over the cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden and cheese is bubbly.
I am not too big on veggies, but I CRAVE this dish!!! First, FRESH, steamed grean beans are key! I reduce the sour cream to 3/4c as others have suggested, reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp, add black pepper, and 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder with the salt & sugar. I use a large can of french fried onions and mix 1/4-1/2 can into beans, the rest I crush with the cracker topping and extra melted butter. I add extra cheese (like most cheesy recipes I use), and mix some into the beans. This can be mixed together ahead of time then thrown in the oven 30 minutes before serving.
