Traditional French Canadian Tourtiere Recipe

Ingredients:
8 lbs Ground Pork
8 lbs Ground Beef
4 cups finely chopped onions
6 cups water (up to edge of meat in cooking pot)
2 ½ tbsp. Salt
2 tsp. Pepper
1 ¾ tsp. Cloves
2 tsp. Allspice
1 tsp. cinnamon
4 to 6-tbsp. liquid chicken seasoning.

Directions:
Mix all of the ingredients in a large pot and cook until mixture comes to a boil. Simmer for approx. ½ hr.
Drain liquid in separate container. Chill liquid roughly 1 hr until fat separates and firms and you are able to discard fat from top of liquid. Combine liquid with meat.
Fill prepared pastry shells with meat and add a TBSP of liquid to each plate. (Prevents pie from being too dry…however, don’t add too much liquid)
Top with decorative vented pastry.
(Takes about 1 ½ lbs. of meat per average size pie plate.   Approx. 1 lb. for smaller foil pie plates).
Bake at 400 degrees for approx. 50 minutes; cook a little longer until golden brown if you’re going to serve it right away.
Pies can be frozen. Reheat at 350 until pie is heated through (cover edges with foil to prevent over browning).
Dabs of butter can be placed in vent holes before reheating…adds just a little bit more flavour to this delicious tradition!  Makes 8 to 10 regular 8/9 inch tourtieres.

Description: 
Originally from my grandma's recipe box, the secret of this delectable Christmas treasure is found in the ground cloves and chicken seasoning.  We've always made our tourtieres en grand (in large quantity) as they freeze great making them a terrific quick fix throughout the busy holiday season!
