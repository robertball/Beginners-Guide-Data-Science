Ingredients:
1 carrot
2 shallots
Ham steak
2 cans Cannellini beans
Baby Spinach
Knorr home-style stock
Siracha

Directions:
Soup Pot: Dice the shallots, one carrot and the meat.  Heat up some olive oil, and saut√© the ham, carrot and shallots until either ham starts to brown or shallots are cooked.  Once they are cooked add the chicken broth. If using Knorr home-style stock, use 7 cups of water.  Bring to boil and make sure the Knorr capsules have dissolved.  Open cannellini beans and rinse and drain.  When broth is boiling you can add the tortellini and beans.  When tortellini is almost done turn heat to low and add handfuls of spinach (half a bag).  When spinach has wilted taste the soup for seasoning.  Pepper and salt to taste.  Add a wee bit of siracha at the end to your temperature.
