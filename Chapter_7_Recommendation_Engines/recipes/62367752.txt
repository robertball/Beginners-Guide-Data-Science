Ingredients:
2 tubes of regular size 10 ct. biscuits
1 pound Bacon and or Sausage
1 Dozen eggs
1 small onion (diced or rings)
1/2 green pepper (diced or strips)
2 cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese
salt and pepper

Directions:
Brown sausage and or bacon in skillet until browned.  Drain on paper towels.  **Hint...I like to cut up the bacon while it is raw and then fry it for more crispy, even pieces.
Lightly spray a small cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.  Open cans of biscuits and place them on the cookie sheet.  With your "buttered" fingers smash them down and spread towards pan edges until they meet and there are no big holes between them...filling entire pan.
Place in preheated 350 degree oven and bake until biscuits are about 1/2 way done. DO NOT OVER BAKE!
While the crust is par baking beat the eggs and LIGHTLY scramble them until just solidified.
Pull crust from oven and top with the eggs.
Next add the meat followed by the veggies and then topped with the cheese. Salt and pepper to taste.
Place back in oven on top rack and bake until cheese is melted and just starting to brown.
