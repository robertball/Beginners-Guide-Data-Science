Ingredients:
4 Red Peppers (cut in quarters)
2 Yellow or Orange Peppers (cut in quarters)
2 Onions (cut in quarters)
4 Tomatoes (cut in half)
2 small zucchini (sliced lengthwise in 3s)
3 peeled garlic cloves (sliced in half lengthwise)
Olive oil - to brush on vegetables
salt to taste
basil to taste

Directions:
Place all cut vegetables on a foil covered cookie sheets with sides to prevent the juice from spilling over the sides.
Brush with Olive Oil.
Place under broiler and watch carefully.  Take out when the edges of the vegetables start to turn black.  Remove immediately, flip vegetables over and repeat by placing back under the broiler.  Remove when vegetables are just golden brown.
Tip vegetables into a glass or stainless steel bowl and cover with plastic wrap immediately.  This steams everything and makes removing the skin much easier.  Leave for approx. 15 minutes.
Remove wrap, and peel as much of the skin from the vegetables as you can.  Using a hand blender, (or blender if you do not have one), blend into a soft puree.
Add spices to taste.
Freezes wonderfully.
