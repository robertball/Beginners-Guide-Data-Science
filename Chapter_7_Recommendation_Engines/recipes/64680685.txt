Description: 
Roasted Potato Italian Style
Roasted potatoes have browning and crisping happening while cooking. Halfway through cooking I turn them over with a spatula and add red onion and cherry tomatoes, then cook until they're tender and nicely browned around the edges. I've been known to add chopped yellow and green peppers and at the end add some black olives. You can crumble feta cheese on this 
 too.
