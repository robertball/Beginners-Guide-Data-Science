Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup butter flavored shortening
2/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup brown sugar
5 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet, or use parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and cream of tartar. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in milk and vanilla. Knead briefly on a floured surface. Roll out into a large rectangle, 1/2 inch thick. Spread softened butter onto surface of dough. Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle evenly over butter. Roll tightly, and cut into 12 equal slices. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
These yummy rolls aren't really biscuits, but they're named after rolls I used to get at my local bakery.  My family thinks they're sweet enough without icing, but a simple powdered sugar one would be nice.
