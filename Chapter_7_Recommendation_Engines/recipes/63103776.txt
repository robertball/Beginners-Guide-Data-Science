Ingredients:
1/4 cup egg substitute
¼ teaspoon Tabasco
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon chili powder
¼ teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/2 cups cornflakes
1/3 cup pecan pieces
1.2 pound catfish fillets, about 1 inch thick, cut into 5 portions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
Blend egg substitute, hot sauce (or cayenne), oregano, chili powder and garlic salt in a shallow dish. Pulse cornflakes in a food processor until coarse crumbs form. Transfer to a large plate. Pulse pecans in the food processor until coarsely chopped; mix the pecans with the cornflake crumbs. (Alternatively, place cornflakes in a sealable bag and crush with a rolling pin; chop nuts with a knife.)
Dip each catfish fillet in the egg substitute mixture, then dredge in the cornflake mixture, coating both sides. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
