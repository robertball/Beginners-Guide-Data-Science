Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup Arborio rice
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 (8 ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup grated mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring broth to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover saucepan and keep broth warm over low heat.
Melt butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic to onion and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir rice into onion mixture and cook until fragrant and slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add wine to rice mixture and stir for 1 minute.
Pour 3/4 cup hot broth into rice mixture; cook and stir constantly until absorbed, about 6 minutes. Add 3/4 cup more hot broth; cook and stir for 6 minutes. Add 3/4 cup hot broth; cook and stir for 6 minutes. Add 3/4 cup hot broth; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Add the remaining 1/2 cup hot broth and mushrooms; cook and stir for 5 minutes.
Stir Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper into risotto; cook and stir until cheeses are melted, about 30 seconds.
