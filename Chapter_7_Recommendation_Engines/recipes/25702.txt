1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
2 cups half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook cauliflower in water to cover until just tender, 5 to 10 minutes.  Drain and set aside.
In a large pot over medium heat, melt margarine.  Stir in onion, garlic and Worcestershire and cook until onion is translucent.  Pour in beer and bring to a boil.  Pour in chicken broth and return to a boil.  Then reduce heat, stir in cauliflower, and heat through.
In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water, stirring to dissolve.  Set aside.  Stir half-and-half and Cheddar into the soup until the cheese melts.  Stir in cornstarch mixture and continue to cook and stir until soup thickens.  Serve at once.
