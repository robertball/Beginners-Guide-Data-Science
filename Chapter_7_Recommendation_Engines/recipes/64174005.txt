Ingredients:
2 Cups Brown Sugar
1/2 Packet of Taco Seasoning
1/4 Cup Rachel Ray 24/7 Seasoning
1 Tbls Cinnamon
1 Tbls Garlic Powder
1 Tbls each Salt & Pepper
10 Lb+ Pork Shoulder or Butt

Directions:
Sift brown sugar to be super fine (this also works with a cheese grater if you have hard brown sugar) until you have around two cups and put into a bowl.
Mix into brown sugar 1/2 packet of taco season.
Next add a significant amount of cranks -about 1/4 cup from Rachel Ray 24/7 seasoning (or you can use a mix of sea salt, coriander seeds, garlic, black peppercorns, red bell peppers, chili, and cumin seeds).
Then add 1 tablespoon of each cinnamon, garlic powder, salt and regular fine black pepper.
MIX TOGETHER VIGOROUSLY.
Rinse off Pork and lightly pat dry (you want some moisture left).
Cover the entire pork in this rub until its a deep reddish brown color, cover gently and refrigerate for at least 90 minutes- overnight would be best.
Smoke between 170 and 220 for 1/2 hour per pound of meat.
Remove the pork from the smoke box and transfer to oven preheated to 325 and continue to cook until the meat will easily pull apart, anywhere from 2 to 4 hours.
