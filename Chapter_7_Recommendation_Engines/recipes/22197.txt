Description: 
This fragrant chicken will make its presence known long before it comes from the oven. Its spicy aroma will get everyone in the mood to enjoy a Middle Eastern feast! Serve with hot cooked rice or couscous, if desired.    Kalamata olives garnish this Moroccan dish to add a slightly salty flavor.
