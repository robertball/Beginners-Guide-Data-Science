Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package sour cream and onion dip, divided
1 3/4 cups bread crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch pepper
2 eggs, beaten
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine ground beef, 1/2 cup of the onion dip, bread crumbs, celery, onion, dill, salt, pepper and eggs. Use your hands to mix until well blended. Press into a 9x5 inch loaf pan, or form a loaf and place it in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
While the meatloaf is baking, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining onion dip and cream of mushroom soup. Cook, stirring until heated through. Spoon over servings of meatloaf.

Description: 
If your family dislikes tomato based meatloaf like mine does then this is the meatloaf for you!  Sour cream and onion dip keeps the meat moist and it is served with a delicious sour cream and mushroom sauce.  My family usually adds a bit of Cajun seasoning blend since we Louisianians like our food spicy.  This recipe just might change your family's mind about meatloaf!
