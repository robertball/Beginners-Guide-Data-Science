Ingredients:
1 c. uncooked quinoa, rinsed
2 c. water
1 T. vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
4 tsp. garlic, chopped
1 T.chili powder
1 T.ground cumin
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (19 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 jalapeno or chipotle pepper, finely chopped
2 tsp. teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 c. chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes; set aside.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, garlic and bell peppers and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the tomatoes and black beans.
Now add the chipotle pepper, chili powder, oregano, and cumin.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, stir in the reserved quinoa.  Remove from the heat, and stir in the cilantro to serve.
