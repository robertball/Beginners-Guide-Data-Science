https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 can sweetened condensed milk
3 Tbsp butter, melted
1-1 1/2 tsp vanilla (to your taste)

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine milk, melted butter and vanilla; mix well and set aside.
In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. (Careful on this step, if you whip it too much you will have butter). With the mixer on low speed, slowly drizzle the milk mixture into the whipped cream. Continue mixing for about 1-2 minutes more, or until fully combined.
Pour mixture into airtight, freezer-safe bowl and freeze for 4-5 hours or overnight. Enjoy!
*For chocolate ice cream: combine the milk, melted butter, 1 Tbsp cocoa powder and 1/2 tsp vanilla.
*For strawberry ice cream: combine milk, melted butter, 1/4-1/2 cup strawberry sauce (the kind you make for strawberry shortcake) and 1/2 tsp vanilla.
*For cinnamon bun ice cream: combine milk, melted butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla.
*You may omit the butter but the finished product will not be as creamy.

Description: 
I stumbled across this recipe on Pintrest and just had to share it! This recipe is simple, creamy, and delicious. I have made it a dozen times already and my family just raves about it. Best part is, you do not even need an ice cream maker! Warning: This recipe is not really for those who are looking for a healthier alternative, trust me. But, you will not be disappointed in this recipe, I know we are not.
