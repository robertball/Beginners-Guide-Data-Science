Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups flour
2 cups ground almonds or hazelnuts
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. cloves
2 tsp. cocoa powder
6 1/2 Tbsp. butter
1 egg
1/4 cup honey
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 Tbsp. cocoa
2 Tbsp. boiling water, or as needed

Directions:
"Fuer den Teig" - for the dough: Mix together the flour, almonds, sugar, baking powder, salt, spices, and 2 tsp. cocoa powder.
Rub in the butter with your fingers or a pastry blender until the mixture is fine again.  Add the egg and honey, and mix to form a dough.
On a floured surface, roll out to about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into man-shapes.  At this point, you may want to make holes at the top of their heads so they can be hung on the wall.
Bake on greased baking sheets at 350 degress for 15 to 20 minutes, until the edges are well-browned.
"Fuer den Guss" - for the icing: Mix together the powdered sugar and 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder.  Mix in enough boiling water to make an easily spreadable icing.  Apply to the cooled men with a table knife, and allow them to sit for a few hours, until the icing hardens.

Description: 
This German Christmas cookie recipe comes from my college's much-loved German language resident.  She hung them up on the walls as Christmas decorations, and we used to sneak them off to eat during class.  For the best flavor, put them aside in a tin for a few weeks before eating them.
