Ingredients:
1 loaf French bread
1/2 cup softened butter
1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
2 cups shredded mozzarella
6 green onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Slice bread in half horizontally.  Using your fingers, pull out most of the soft bread to form a hollow shell. Mix together butter, mushrooms, cheese, green onions and garlic.  Spread the mixture on both cut sides of the bread.  Place the bread, cut sides up on baking sheet and bake until cheese has melted about 15 minutes.  Cut in wedges to serve.
