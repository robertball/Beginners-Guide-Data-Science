Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into serving-size pieces
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, diced
1 cup water
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 quinces - washed, cored, and quartered

Directions:
Heat the olive oil until smoking over medium-high heat. Add the lamb and sear until well browned on all sides, then set aside. Reduce heat to medium, then stir in butter and onions, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent.
Pour in water, then season with salt, pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. Add seared lamb pieces, and quartered quince. Cover and bring to a simmer.
Simmer the kidonato over medium-low heat for 1 hour, or until the lamb is tender, adding additional water if needed.
