Ingredients:
4 ears fresh corn, in the husks
4 slices bacon, diced
1 tablespoon diced onion
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
4 cups chicken stock
2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced
6 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 cup shredded cooked chicken
coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roast whole ears of corn directly on the rack of the preheated oven until kernels feel tender when pressed, about 25 minutes. Cool briefly, then peel back the husks and cut the kernels off the cobs.
While the corn is roasting, dice 1/2 the bacon slices. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and saute bacon until evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and reserve 1 tablespoon of the fat.
Add onion and garlic to the pan; saute until transparent, but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add roasted corn kernels, chicken stock, and potatoes; bring to a simmer.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes smooth and light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool.
Add the cooled flour mixture to the simmering stock, mixing with a whisk. Simmer, stirring often to keep from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until potatoes are tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Add cream and cooked chicken; simmer for 10 minutes.
Season chowder with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Ladle into bowls and top with bacon.
