Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
Place beaten eggs and bread crumbs in two separate shallow bowls. Slice a pocket into each chicken breast. Wrap a slice of swiss in between two pieces of ham. Stuff into pocket.
Dip each chicken breast into egg, and then into breadcrumbs.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breast on all sides. Arrange the chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, blend soup and cream; season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour over the chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
Make a batch of rice to go with the cordon bleu.
