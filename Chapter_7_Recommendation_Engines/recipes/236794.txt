Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 cup quinoa
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 lime, juiced

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute jalapeno peppers and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan. Stir black beans, tomatoes, quinoa, corn, and salt into the broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, until the liquid is fully absorbed into the quinoa, 20 to 25 minutes.
Fluff quinoa with a fork. Stir in cilantro and lime juice.
