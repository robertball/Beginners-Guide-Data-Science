Ingredients:
1 10-oz jar of maraschino cherries
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup semisweet chocolate pieces
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
1. Drain cherries, reserve juice. Halve any large cherries. Beat butter with electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping bowl. Beat egg and vanilla until combined. Beat cocoa powder and as much flour as you can with mixer. Stir in any remaining flour.
2. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls about 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Press your thumb into the center of each ball. Place a cherry in each center.
3. For frosting, in a small saucepan combine chocolate pieces and sweetened condensed milk. Cook and stir over low heat until chocolate melts. Stir in 4 teaspoons reserved cherry juice. Spoon 1 teaspoon frosting over each cherry, spreading to cover.
4. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes or until edges are firm. Cool on cookie sheet 1 minute. Transfer to wire rack and let cool. Enjoy~!!!
