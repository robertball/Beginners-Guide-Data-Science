Ingredients:
1 French baguette, cut into diagonal 1/2 inch slices
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter or margarine
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Set the oven to broil at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a small saucepan, combine the olive oil, butter and garlic. Set over medium heat, and cook until butter has melted and the mixture starts to bubble. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat.
Dip each slice of bread into the garlic mixture, turning to coat each side. Place Parmesan cheese on a plate. Press one side of each piece of bread into the cheese, and place cheese side up on a baking sheet.
Broil on the middle rack of the preheated oven for about 8 minutes, or until golden brown.
