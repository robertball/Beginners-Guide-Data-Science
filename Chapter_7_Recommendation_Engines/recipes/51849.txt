Melt butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add garlic and shallots, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned. Add a splash of the beef broth, jalapeno, and red chile pepper, and simmer for a few minutes to blend the flavors.
Add the tomatoes, basil leaves, white wine, and remaining beef broth. Bring to a boil. Dissolve cornstarch in a small amount of the light cream, and pour it and the rest of the cream into the stock pot. Return to a boil, and add the mussels.
