Description: 
My husband asks for this dish on a regular basis. It's one of his favorites. I don't mind because it's a healthy low calorie dish that is easy and inexpensive to make; especially on those days when I don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. (Tip: I buy several rotisserie chickens at a time and bone them all, then freeze the excess meat until ready to use.)
