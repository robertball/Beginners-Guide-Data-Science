Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
3 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 1/4 cup milk or water
1 1/2 tbsp oil
1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast

Directions:
Mix all of the ingredients in a bread machine on the dough mix setting, or kneed by hand.
Let the dough sit out of the machine for at least 2 hours, or until the dough has risen considerably. For a fluffier dough, let rise for an additional 1-2 hours and do not stretch it over the sides of the 9 by 14 inch baking sheet.
Once the dough has risen, cut it in 2 to 3 equal parts, depending on your preference and the size of your baking sheets. WHen using a traditional 9 by 14 inch pan, cut into 2 parts for a dough of average thickness. When using round, medium sized pizza pans, you can make 3 thin crusted pizzas or 2 average-thick crusted ones.
Follow the rest of the instructions using my pizza recipe.
