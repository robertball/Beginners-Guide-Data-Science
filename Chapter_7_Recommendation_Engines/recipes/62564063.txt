Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Crisco Vegetable Shortening
1 Cup Jif Creamy Peanut Butter
3/4 Cup Granulated Sugar
1/2 Cup firmly packed Light Brown Sugar
1 TBS Milk
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1 Egg
1 1/4 Cups All Purpose Flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Combine shortening, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk and vanilla in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed of electric mixer until well blended.  Beat in egg.
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in small bowl.  Mix into creamed mixture at low speed until just blended.  Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheet.  Make crisscross pattern on dough with floured or sugared fork.
Bake at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes (they will still look a little soft but will set up during cooling.) Cool 2 minutes on cookie sheet.  Carefully (they are delicate until cooled) remove to wire rack to cool completely.
