Ingredients:
2 cups mashed baked sweet potatoes
1 1/3 cups eggnog
2 eggs
5 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup sweet butter, softened
3 tablespoons light rum
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 (9 inch) frozen deep-dish pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Beat sweet potatoes, eggnog, eggs, sugar, butter, rum, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour sweet potato mixture into prepared pie crust.
Bake pie in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking until pie is set, 50 to 55 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Description: 
This is a delicious twist on traditional sweet potato pie. I had some left over baked sweet potatoes and some eggnog and ended up with a rich and creamy pie that my friends request again and again. Yams or potatoes work really well, too. Since eggnog is only commercially available during the holidays, I've resorted to making my own during other times of the year. I use various recipes from Allrecipes.com. Serve chilled with whipped cream.
