Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 9-inch cast-iron skillet in oven to warm it.
Mix milk and cornmeal together in small bowl and let soak for 10 minutes.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Beat cornmeal mixture, eggs, and butter into the flour mixture until you have a smooth batter, about 1 minute.
Remove skillet from oven. Swish vegetable oil in the skillet to coat; pour off excess.
Pour batter into the skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve.

Description: 
A simple, slightly sweet corn bread made in the versatile cast-iron skillet. Tastes great and is a good base recipe to experiment with. Cast-iron skillets take a little bit of time to warm up.  Pre-warming the skillet allows the corn bread to cook evenly.
