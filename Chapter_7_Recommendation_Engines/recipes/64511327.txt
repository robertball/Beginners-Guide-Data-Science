2 cups water
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tsp. dried rosemary

1 tsp. garlic powder
1 bay leaf
4 whole peppercorns
8 sub buns

Directions:
Put roast in slow cooker.
Add all ingredients (except buns haha!).
Cover and cook on high for 5 - 6 hours (or low for 10 - 12) or a combination that works for you and adds up to the equivalent cooking time and beef is tender.
Remove meat from broth and shred with forks.
Serve broth in small cups for dipping.
