Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon chipotle paste
1 cup prepared mild salsa
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2 ears corn, husks removed
3/4 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed and drained
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 lime, juiced
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
4 oz (1 small) haas avocado, sliced
4 lime wedges
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro

Directions:
In a medium bowl combine the salt, cumin black pepper, chipotle, and salsa.
Place the chicken in the pressure cooker and pour the salsa over chicken. Cook on high pressure 20 minutes. Quick or natural release, add the corn and cook high pressure 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, add the quinoa, water and salt to a saucepan and cook over high heat, bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook for about 18 to 22 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and remove from heat. Stir in the lime juice, olive oil, and 1/4 cup cilantro.
When chicken is cooked, remove corn and set aside on a dish.
Remove the chicken and place in a bowl, shred and add 1/2 cup of the sauce. Using a knife cut the corn off the husk.
Place 2/3 cup quinoa in each bowl, with 1/2 cup shredded chicken topped with more sauce, 1/3 cup corn, 1/4 cup tomatoes and 1 ounce avocado.
Top with remaining cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
