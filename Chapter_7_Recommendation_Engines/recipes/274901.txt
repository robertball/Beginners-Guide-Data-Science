Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package whole mushrooms
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
toothpicks

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Clean and dry mushrooms. Wrap 1 strip of bacon around each mushroom and secure with a toothpick.
Place mushrooms on the preheated grill. Cook, turning often, until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes.
