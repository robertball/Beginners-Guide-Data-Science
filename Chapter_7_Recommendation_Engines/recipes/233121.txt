cooking spray
6 cups sliced rhubarb
2/3 cup white sugar
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry-flavored gelatin mix

3/4 cup water
1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted

Spread rhubarb into the baking dish. Sprinkle white sugar, gelatin mix, and yellow cake mix over the rhubarb. Pour water over the rhubarb mixture. Drizzle butter over the rhubarb mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until rhubarb is tender, about 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and top with whipped topping.
