Ingredients:
1 pound fresh or frozen cranberries
3 quarts cold water
2 cups orange juice
2 1/8 cups pineapple juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 cups white sugar, or to taste
1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon whole cloves
1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries

Directions:
Place the cranberries and water into a large pot. Bring to a boil and cook just until the berries pop, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand at room temperature until cold, several hours.
Strain out the cranberries and stir the orange juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice and sugar into the liquid. Add the cinnamon stick, whole cloves and allspice berries. Bring to a low boil. It is ready to serve at this point, but it is even better if you allow it to sit overnight.

A lovely clear red, hot beverage for holiday parties, an afternoon break, for dinner or bedtime as it contains no caffeine.  I have been making this for decades and keep it in the fridge all winter. One of my most requested recipes!
