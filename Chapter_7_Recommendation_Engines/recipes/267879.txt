Ingredients:
Coconut Sweet and Condensed Milk:
14 ounces sugar-free coconut milk beverage
1/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
Crust:
1 cup almond flour
2 tablespoons granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
2 tablespoons butter, melted
cooking spray
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Pour coconut milk and sucralose into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Let bubble, stirring constantly, for 15 minutes. Pour into a bowl and allow to cool.
Mix almond flour and Splenda(R) together in a bowl and add melted butter. Coat a pie plate with nonstick spray. Cut a circular piece of parchment paper to fit and place in the bottom of the pie plate. Spread crust mixture into the prepared pie plate and refrigerate until set, about 20 minutes.
Place cream cheese in a mixing bowl and mix until broken up. Add Splenda(R), lemon juice, and vanilla extract and blend well. Mix in coconut milk mixture slowly until desired consistency is reached. Pour filling into the pie plate and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
