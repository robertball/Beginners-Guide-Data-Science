Ingredients:
1  28oz can Mild Green Enchilada Sauce
1 14oz carton of Cream of Chicken Soup
1-14oz can chicken broth (2 cans if desired)
1/4 cup sour cream
2  28oz cans Whole Ortega Chiles
1 Rotisserie Chicken (Meat torn off)
2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar, jack recommended)

Directions:
In a large pot, combine the enchilada sauce, cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and chicken broth.  Whisk until well-combined.
Add remaining ingredients. Use a hand blender to blend all the ingredients to desired consistency.  You could just blend everything but the chicken if you desire, and add that at the end if you prefer it in larger pieces.
Heat over medium-low heat for at least 30 minutes until cheese is melted and soup is heated through.  Serve with sour cream, sliced green onion, and avocado on top!
Enjoy!

I created this by accident trying to make a casserole that flopped and decided to create a soup out of it instead!  Yum!
