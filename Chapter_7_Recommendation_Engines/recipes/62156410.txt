Ingredients:
1 pkg thin mint or mint cookies, crushed
Cupcake liners
4 packages cream cheese (8 ounces) softened.
1 ½ cups white sugar
¾ cup milk
4 eggs room temperature
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
¼ cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Crush thin mint cookies to a medium fine powder. Put cupcake liners in cupcake tin. Put a heaping teaspoon of crushed cookies in the bottom of each tin.  Spread so it covers the bottom.
In a large bowl, mix softened cream cheese with sugar until it is smooth.  Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time.  Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth.
Fill each tin half full with batter. They will puff up slightly as they bake, then settle back down as they cool.  Bake in the preheated oven for 25-35 minutes, or until no longer jiggly in the middle when touched.
Let cool for at least 1-2 hours.
