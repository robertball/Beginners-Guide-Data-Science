Ingredients:
1 stick of butter
1/3 cup flour
1 small yellow onion, minced
2 stalks of celery, minced
1 med-large bell pepper, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
salt to taste, about 1/2 tsp
1 cup clam juice
1/2 cup water
1 pound peeled and cleaned, crawfish tails
1 pound peeled and cleaned, shrimp
3 tbsp lemon juice
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
5 cups cooked, long grain rice

Directions:
Make your roux by melting the butter over med-low heat and slowly adding the flour, stirring constantly.
Continue to cook an stir the mixture until it turns light brown.
When the roux is ready, add the minced onion, minced celery, minced bell pepper, minced garlic and the bay leaves, cayenne, black pepper and salt.
*The flavors in the Etoufee are suppose to really blend together to create something unique so make sure you really "mince" your veggies; you do not want big chunks.
Cook for 5-10 minutes until veggies are soft.
Now add the clam juice, water, crawfish tails and shrimp, stirring until mixed.
Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer until thickened; about 5 minutes.
Add them lemon juice and chopped parsley and then serve over warm rice.
*I feel this recipie is best if you make it the day before you plan on serving it. It gives the flavors time to mix together and is much tastier after being reheated.
