Ingredients:
1/4 honeydew melon - peeled, seeded, and cubed
1 cup vodka
3/4 cup white sugar
4 drops green food coloring
3 drops yellow food coloring

Directions:
Place the honeydew in a bowl and mash until some of the juice is released; pour into a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth, 10 to 15 seconds. Measure 1 cup of the melon puree, and pour into a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Add vodka, sugar, and green and yellow food coloring. Cover and shake until the sugar is dissolved. Store at room temperature for 1 week.
Strain the melon mixture into a bowl through a paper towel-lined sieve to remove any solid bits. (You may need to do this multiple times.) Pour the vodka into a bottle, and seal until ready to use.

Description: 
Pureeing the melon before adding to the vodka is the secret to this recipe's success. The food coloring is the final touch that makes this almost indistinguishable from the name brand version.
