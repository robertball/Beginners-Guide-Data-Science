Ingredients:
Cooking Spray or Butter (for greasing dish)
1 lbs. lean ground beef or turkey
1 medium onion, chopped (1/2 cup) - I used frozen chopped onions
1 package taco seasoning (or 1/3 cup)
1 can (4.5oz) chopped green chiles, drained
1 cup milk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup Bisquick mix (I used Gluten-Free Bisquick)
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese
Optional Fillings: Black Beans (drained), Corn
Garnishes: Sour Cream, Taco Sauce, Salsa, Sliced Black Olives, Shredded Lettuce, Chopped Tomato, Jalapenos

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease a pie plate or 9x9 square dish (Note: if adding additional ingredients to filling, the larger square dish might be better than pie dish).  Cook ground beef and onions in a large skillet until fully cooked.  Drain off fat.  Stir in taco seasoning (dry).  Optional: stir in black beans and/or corn.  Spread meat and onion mixture into greased dish.  Layer green chiles over meat and onions.
In a separate bowl, whisk together Bisquick, milk, and eggs.  Pour mixture over dish.  Bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean.
Spread shredded cheese over top of dish.  Place back in oven for another 8-10 minutes.  Remove from oven and let it sit for 5 minutes before serving.  Serve with optional garnishes.
