Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
1 large onion, sliced
2 red bell peppers, seeded and diced
3 tomatoes, cored and diced
1 jar Tomato & Olive & Ouzo Sauce
2 Japanese eggplants, diced
2 medium zucchini, diced
1 can chickpeas, drained
1/4 cup parsley, roughly chopped
1/4 cup basil, roughly chopped
4 sprigs fresh thyme
1 teaspoon salt and black pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a heavy bottomed pot & sauté garlic over medium heat until very fragrant. Reduce heat to low, add onions & bell peppers. Cover with a lid & let the onions wilt, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Remove the lid & sauté the vegetables until all the water released has evaporated & the onions start to brown. Add tomatoes, cover with the lid, & simmer until tomatoes have released a lot of liquid. Add tomato sauce, eggplant, zucchini, chick peas, parsley, basil, thyme, salt & pepper.
Stir to combine,cover with a lid & cook until tender about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the vegetables are soft, remove the lid & let the ratatouille continue to simmer until the excess liquid has evaporated & the stew is thick. Adjust the salt and pepper to taste & serve.
