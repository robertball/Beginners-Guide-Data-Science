Ingredients:
Mixed Berry Sauce
One 16-oz bag frozen mixed berries, thawed 1/4 C granulated sugar
2 Tbsp seedless raspberry preserves
1 Tbsp lemon juice
Waffles:
8 slices whole wheat or white bread (I used Brioche)
4 large eggs
3/4 C milk
1 Tbsp sugar
1 tsp vanilla
Pinch of salt
4 Tbsp creamy peanut butter
Nonstick spray

Directions:
Sauce: Combine the fruit and sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil; stir occasionally, until berries soften, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender or food processor.  Add the preserves and lemon juice; blend until smooth.  Cool.
Waffles: The night before, place bread on a baking rack; let stale overnight.
Crack eggs into a medium baking dish and whisk lightly.  Add milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt; whisk.
Spread 1 Tbsp of peanut butter on 4 slices of bread.  Top with remaining slices to make four sandwiches.  Flatten slightly.  Soak sandwiches in egg mixture, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
Heat a square four-slot waffle maker.  Spray top and bottom grates with nonstick spray.  Remove sandwiches from the egg mixture using a slotted spatula, allowing excess liquid to drip off.  Make two at a time on the diagonal of the grates.  Press down gently at first, then add a little pressure to the cover and press until it is completely closed.  Cook until golden brown.  Carefully remove each waffle to a plate.  Drizzle with mixed-berry syrup.
