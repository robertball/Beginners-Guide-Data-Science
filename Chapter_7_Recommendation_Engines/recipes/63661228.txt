Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 large red or yellow beets, chopped into cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 bunch arugula, well washed and torn apart
1/3 cup walnuts
4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
Remove the beet skins and chop them into cubes. I highly suggest wearing an apron for this.
Place the beets, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a roasting pan and cook until the beets are tender, about 40 minutes.
Remove the pan & place the beets in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
Toss with the remaining ingredients.
Enjoy
