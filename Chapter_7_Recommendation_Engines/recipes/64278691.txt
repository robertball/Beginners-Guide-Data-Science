Ingredients:
3 sticks (1 1/2 C.) unsalted butter, room temp.
8 oz. cream cheese, room temp.
6 large eggs
3 C. white sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
3 C. all purpose flour, sifted
pinch of salt

Directions:
In a stand mixer or using a hand mixer, cream together the butter and the cream cheese. Once combined and creamy, beat in the sugar 1 C. at a time. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. Add the vanilla and salt, beat in the flour 1 C. at a time. Once it is all mixed up pour into a well buttered and floured tube cake pan. Fill an oven proof bowl with water and place the water and the cake into a 300 degree oven. Bake for 1 hour 45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack to finish cooling before slicing.
