Ingredients:
5 pandan leaves, chopped
3/4 cup water
2 eggs
1 1/4 cups coconut cream
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup evaporated milk
10 slices white bread, cut into squares

Directions:
Blend pandan leaves and water together in a blender or food processor until smooth; strain through a piece of cheesecloth. You should get about 1/2 cup pandan juice; you can discard anything more than that.
Beat eggs in a bowl; add coconut cream and sugar and continue beating until sugar is dissolved.
Place egg mixture over a double boiler and stir while heating. Add evaporated milk and pandan juice. Stir until mixture has thickened into a custard, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove from heat and spoon into a serving dish. Serve custard with squares of white bread.
