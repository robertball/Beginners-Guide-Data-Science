Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 lb ground pork
1/2 c seasoned breadcrumbs
1/2 c minute rice
1/2 yellow onion, minced
1 egg
1 tsp garlic salt
1 small head cabbage, roughly chopped into large pieces
1/2 bag sauerkraut, rinsed and drained
2 regular sizes cans of diced tomatoes
2 regular sized cans of condensed tomato soup, diluted with only ONE can of water
3 T onion powder

Directions:
Combine the first 7 ingredients and form into meatballs.
Very lightly brown the meatballs in a dutch oven or sauce pot.
When they are just cooked on the outside, cover with the tomato products and onion powder, then layer the sauerkraut and cabbage on top.
Cover and cook for about 30 minutes on medium heat.
When the cabbage has softened, stir it all together and cook another 30-60 minutes on medium or low heat, or until the cabbage is fully cooked. Meatballs should be 170, which should be very easily attained in this cooking time.
Eat with mashed potatoes!
