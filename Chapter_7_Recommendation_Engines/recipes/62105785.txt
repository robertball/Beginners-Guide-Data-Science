Ingredients:
1 package ciabatta rolls
4 ground chuck patties
fresh cilantro
1 avacado
your favorite chile blend (I like Pendery's Fort Worth Lite)
salt and pepper
1 lime
4 slices pepper-jack cheese
your choice of condament with a "kick" (some of my favorites are jalepeno mustard and hot plum or raspberry chipotle sauce)

Directions:
Season patties with salt, pepper, and chile blend to taste and throw them on the grill.
Slice the avacado and give it a squirt of lime juice.
Cut the rolls in half.
Just before taking the patties off the grill, cover them with the cheese slices and show the rolls to the grill to toast them up nicely (only about 30 seconds or so)
Assemble the burgers with a heavy dose of cilantro, sliced avacados and your favorite spicy condament.

Description: 
This is a yummy twist on a traditional burger using ciabatta rolls rather than traditional buns.  Spice it up however you like!  Goes great with chips and homemade roasted salsa.
