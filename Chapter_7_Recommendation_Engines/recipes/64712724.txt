Ingredients:
4 strips bacon, diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
½ white onion, diced
1 cup diced cremini (baby bella) mushrooms
1 cup chicken stock
16 oz cauliflower rice (2 bags)
½ cup (1 stick) butter
1 cup heavy cream
1 ½ cups grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. (This can be done on a grill or stovetop.)
2. Add the bacon to the saucepan and cook until crisp. Remove the bacon from the pan using a slotted spoon (leave the fat in the pan) and transfer to a small bowl.
3. Add the garlic, onion, and mushrooms to the bacon fat and sauté for about 5 minutes, until softened and lightly browned.
4. Add the chicken stock and cauliflower rice to the pan and mix well.
5. Let simmer for about 5 minutes, until the cauliflower rice has absorbed most of the chicken stock.
6. Stir in the heavy cream and parmesan cheese, mix well.
7. Pulse a few times with your immersion blender just to break down any of the large pieces. (You don't want to turn into soup!)
8. Stir in about 3/4 of the cooked bacon.
9. Transfer the risotto to a serving bowl and top with the remaining bacon.
10. Serve and enjoy!
