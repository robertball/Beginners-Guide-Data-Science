Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 ounces lean ground beef
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup spaghetti sauce
1 small zucchini, peeled and grated
4 button mushrooms, finely chopped
1 small carrot, peeled and grated
salt and ground black pepper to taste
olive oil cooking spray
4 sheets phyllo pastry
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in spaghetti sauce, zucchini, mushrooms, and carrot; season with salt and pepper. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
Spray half of each sheet of phyllo dough with cooking spray and fold in half lengthwise. Place 1/2 cup of the beef mixture on one edge of each phyllo sheet; top with 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese. Fold up into rectangular parcels.
Transfer parcels to a baking sheet. Spray with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
On a health kick and missing my meat pies, I made this low-fat version. All the pastry without all the fat. A great way to get some vegetables into the kids as well - they loved it!
