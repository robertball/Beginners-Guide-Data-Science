Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded
½ cup butter

Directions:
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Cook the wings 8 to 12 minutes on each side, until juices run clear. The larger pieces will take slightly longer to cook.
Melt the butter in a saucepan, and mix in the hot sauce, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.
Place wings in a large container with a secure lid. Pour sauce over the wings, and seal. Shake wings with the sauce until thoroughly coated.
