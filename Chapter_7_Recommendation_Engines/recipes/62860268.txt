Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup half & half
1/3 cup chopped nuts(pecans or walnuts)
2 tsp of cinnamon sugar mixture
10 biscuits

Directions:
In a round 9" cake pan pour half & half and mix in brown sugar. Sprinkle nut on top of mixture. Lay biscuits and sprinkle cinnamon sugar mixture on top of the biscuits. (If using frozen biscuits let set for 5 minutes or more before baking)Bake at 350 f degrees until biscuits are lightly brown. Immediately turn rolls upside down on a serving plate. We think best time to eat them is while they are still warm.
