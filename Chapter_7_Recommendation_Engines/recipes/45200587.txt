Ingredients:
1 quart chicken broth
8 ounces of water
1 onion, finely chopped
1 head cauliflower, finely chopped
1/2 head broccoli, finely chopped

1 carrot pee;ed and finely chopped
1 teaspoon curry paste, or powder (more if you wish a stronger curry flavor)
1/2 teaspoon garam masala (optional)
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup half and half
1 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a stockpot, saute onion, celery, carrots and garlic in a little olive oil until soft.  Add chicken broth, curry paste,  cauliflower, and broccoli.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low.  Continue to simmer until vegetables are tender.  Season with curry powder, chicken bouillon, salt, and pepper.
When cauliflower and broccoli are soft use stick blender to puree soup. I like to leave mine with a little texture.
Add half and half . Heat on low until cheese is melted,

Description: 
My boss brought this soup to the office one fine day and I was hooked on it from the first taste.  It is a snap to make and the flavors are mild, yet very distinct.  My kids loved it the first time I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste.  It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.Modified from: Tim Perry's Soup (Creamy Curry Cauliflower and Broccoli Soup)
