Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast, pounded thin
1/4 cup sliced button mushrooms
2 teaspoons yellow onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup dry Marsala wine
1 thin slice prosciutto ham, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1/2 stick unsalted butter
Flour
Salt
Black pepper
1/4 cup Italian parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
Lightly season chicken with salt and black pepper.  Heat oil or clarified butter over medium high heat in a saute pan.  Once the oil is hot, lightly dredge the chicken in flour and add to saute pan.
Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes until browned and then flip over. Cook about 1 minute more, add the mushrooms and cook for another minute.  When chicken is almost finished, add the Marsala wine, prosciutto, onion, a pinch of salt and black pepper, and allow the wine to reduce by 85%. When most of the wine has been evaporated, remove pan from heat and toss the chicken and mushrooms well. Allow the pan to cool for a minute. The wine should be almost all evaporated and reduced to a thick syrup.
Cut the butter into small cubes (about 6). Return the pan to low heat and, using a wire whip, fold the butter into the reduced wine one cube at a time. Stir constantly as you add the butter. Do not allow the sauce to get too hot or it will separate. Once all the butter is folded in, add chopped parsley and toss.
Place the sauteed chicken on the plate and spoon the remaining sauce over the chicken. Serve with your favorite side of pasta or vegetable.
