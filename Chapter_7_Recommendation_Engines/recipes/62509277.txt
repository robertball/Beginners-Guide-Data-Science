Ingredients:
8 cooking apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 C sugar
1 T cinnamon
Juice of 1/2  lemon
1 t vanilla extract

Directions:
Place apples in 5-qt. pot.
Add sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice, and vanilla.
Add just enough water to cover half of the apples (to prevent watery sauce).
Bring apples to a boil; reduce to a simmer until apples are soft.
Hand-blend or mash apples to desired consistency. Serve warm or cold.
