Ingredients:
1/3 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup superfine sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange zest
2 teaspoons orange juice
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon buttermilk
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter,  sugar and egg until light and fluffy. Stir in the orange juice and orange zest. Sift together the flour, cornstarch and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the buttermilk and poppy seeds to form a soft dough. Drop dough by tablespoons onto cookie sheets and press a white chocolate chip into the center of each one.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until just golden. Cool on cookie sheets for about 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely. Store up to one week in an airtight container.
