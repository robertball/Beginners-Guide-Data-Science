Ingredients:
4-6 ripe bananas - puree in blender
1 1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
3 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon banana extract
3/4 cup butter
4 oz Bar of Ghirardelli Unsweetened 100% Cacao
4 oz White Baking Chocolate
Chocolate Cake Mix (18.5 oz)OR
1 3/4 Cup Flour
2 Cups Sugar
2 Teaspoons Baking Powder
2 Tablespoons Unsweetened Cocoa Baking Powder
ICEING
2 oz White Baking Chocolate
1/2 teaspoon Banana Extract
1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 12 oz Evaporated Milk
2 1/2 - 3 Tablespoons of Cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Lightly grease one 9 x 13 inch pan (preferably metal).
If you did not use pre-made cake mix, mix the 1 3/4 C of flour, 2 C of sugar, 2 T of cocoa powder, & 2 t of baking powder together evenly and set aside. This is now your chocolate cake mix.
In another large bowl, combine banana puree, evaporated milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla and banana extract. Mix well. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Sprinkle 1/2 the dry cake mix evenly over the pumpkin mixture. Melt the dark chocolate in microwave, drizzle over cake mix. Sprinkle just enough dry mix over to cover the dark chocolate swirls. Melt the white chocolate & drizzle over mix. Add the remaining dry cake mix evenly over the swirled chocolates. Melt the butter or margarine, and drizzle it over the cake mix.
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until done.
ICEING
Melt butter with milk & sugar & cornstarch, bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add white chocolate, vanilla, & banana extract stir until melted and thickens. Pour over cake - cake does not have to be cooled, but it can be.
