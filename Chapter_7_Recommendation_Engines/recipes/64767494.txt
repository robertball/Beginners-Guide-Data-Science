1 tbsp Butter
1 1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Beat Egg Yolks slightly in a medium mixing bowl.  Set aside.
Mix in saucepan: Sugar, Cornstarch, Salt
Stir in gradually: Milk
Once mixed, cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture thickens and boils.
Boil 1 minute and remove from heat.
Stir HALF of the mixture into the Egg Yolks previously set aside.
Once blended, put the mixture back into the saucepan and boil again for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Blend in butter and vanilla until smooth.
Pour immediately into pie crust.
Add Meringue on top, sealing the meringue to the edges of the crust to minimize shrinking.
