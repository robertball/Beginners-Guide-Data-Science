Ingredients:
3/4 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 cup wheat germ (or just add more oats)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil (applesauce)
1 egg
1 cup blueberries
1/3 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups.
In a large bowl, mix the 3/4 cup oats, wheat germ, flour, sugar, walnuts, salt, and baking powder. Stir in the milk, oil, and egg just until dry ingredients are evenly moist. Fold in the blueberries. Scoop batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Mix 1/3 cup oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl, and sprinkle over the batter.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
