Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts (defrosted)
campaignIcon
1 large can or Cream of Chicken Soup (or two small cans)
2 boxes of Stuffing mix
1 cup Sour Cream (we used light)
1 small package of frozen green beans
Crockpot
Non stick cooking spray

Directions:
Spray the crockpot with non stick cooking spray
Place the defrosted chicken breasts in the bottom of the crockpot as your first bottom layer.
Next tear open two boxes of stuffing mix (we used the Stove Top Chicken flavor), pour the dry mix over the raw chicken.
In a separate bowl, mix together the soup and sour cream. Top this mixture over the dry stuffing mix.
The last layer will be the frozen green beans.
Now add about 1 cup of water to the top of this mix.
Cook on high for 4 hours or cook on low for about 7 to 8 hours.
Tip: About ½ way between the cooking time use a fork to fluff the stuffing mix. This will allow the water to drop through the soup mix and create a steam to cook the stuffing. Add less water if you prefer a dry stuffing or add more water if you like it really moist.

Description: 
I finally perfected my Crockpot Chicken and Stuffing Recipe!  I say this because there’s a special technique you must do in order to stop the stuffing from drying out.  I don’t like dry stuffing.  I like light, fluffy and moist stuffing.  This recipe is easy but there’s an order to the ingredients to make it come out just right.  This recipe has amazing flavor added to it also.
