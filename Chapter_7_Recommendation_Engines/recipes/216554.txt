1 (10.5 ounce) package silken tofu, drained
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the tofu, pumpkin, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and clove into a blender. Puree until smooth. Pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue baking until a knife inserted into the mixture comes out clean, about 40 minutes more. Cool before serving.
