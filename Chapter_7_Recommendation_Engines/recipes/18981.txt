Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) sponge cake, cut in cubes
1 cup seedless raspberry jam
8 ounces fresh raspberries
10 fluid ounces heavy cream
3 egg yolks
3 tablespoons white sugar
10 fluid ounces heavy cream
2 ounces sliced almonds

Directions:
Spread a little jam on each piece of cake and place in the bottom of a large glass bowl.  Sprinkle raspberries over cake.
Heat 10 fl. oz. cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  While the cream is heating, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until pale yellow and smooth.  Strain yolk mixture into a clean bowl.  Pour hot cream into egg yolks and stir vigorously.  Return mixture to pan over low heat and cook, stirring, until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
While custard is cooling, whip 10 fl oz. cream until soft peaks form.  Place almonds on a baking sheet and toast, in a 300 degree oven or toaster oven, stirring frequently, until golden, 2 to 10 minutes.
Spread cooled custard over cake in bowl.  Top with whipped cream and toasted almonds.  Chill 2 hours before serving.
