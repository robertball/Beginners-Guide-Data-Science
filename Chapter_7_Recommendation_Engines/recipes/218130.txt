Ingredients:
4 chicken drumsticks with skin
4 bone-in chicken thighs with skin
4 chicken wings with skin
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Rinse chicken drumsticks, thighs, and wings with cold water, and place into a bowl. Pour in lemon juice and vinegar; mix in the cinnamon, nutmeg, and kosher salt until the chicken parts are thoroughly coated with the spice paste. Allow to stand, covered, for at least 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Grill the chicken pieces on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink at the bone, the juices run clear, and the spice-coated skin is blistered, well-browned, and blackened in spots, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe was one I made on the fly one year and it was fantastic. Nicely blackened on the grill with a hint of sweetness.
