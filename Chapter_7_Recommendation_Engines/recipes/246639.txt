Ingredients:
Marinade:
1 yellow onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
Stew:
12 chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into thirds
2 yellow onions, sliced into 1/2-inch rings
3 quarts water
4 carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rings

Directions:
Mix chopped onion, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, and black pepper in a large bowl to make marinade. Add chicken thighs; soak for at least 20 minutes.
Spread onion rings on the bottom of a large pot. Place chicken thighs, with some of the marinade, on top. Pour in water to fill the pot halfway. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cook until chicken thighs are tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Add carrots and jalapeno peppers. Cook until carrots are soft, about 30 minutes more.
