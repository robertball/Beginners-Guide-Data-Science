Ingredients:
5 eggs
2/3 cup chocolate milk
2 ripe bananas, well mashed
10 slices bread
Butter or cooking oil
Sliced bananas and strawberries (optional)
Maple syrup, chocolate syrup, and/or jam

Directions:
Whisk eggs in a large bowl until well blended. Whisk in chocolate milk and bananas.
Dip bread slices into egg mixture; let soak briefly to coat both sides. Remove bread, letting excess egg mixture drip back into bowl, and place in a large lightly buttered or oiled frying pan over medium heat. Cook bread for a few minutes on both sides until golden brown.
Serve topped with bananas and strawberries, if desired, and drizzled with syrup. Or, spread with jam.
