Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes
kosher salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 cup diced celery
3 large cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups beef broth
3 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons hot sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves

Directions:
Season beef cubes with kosher salt, black pepper, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
Dust beef with 1/3 cup flour and toss lightly to coat.
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot oil until evenly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove beef with slotted spoon; transfer to a bowl.
Stir bell pepper, onion, celery, and garlic into the oil left in the pot; cook and stir until vegetables are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and add to the bowl of beef. Drain oil, reserving about 3 tablespoons in the pot. Reduce heat to low.
Gradually whisk 1/4 cup flour into the reserved oil until you achieve a dark golden-brown roux, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir constantly and watch carefully; roux burns easily.
Slowly pour beef broth into the roux while stirring; bring to a simmer, and cook until thickened, stirring constantly, about 3 minutes.
Return the beef and vegetables to the pot. Add bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, basil, tomatoes with green chiles, and 1 teaspoon salt.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves and stir in chopped parsley to serve.
