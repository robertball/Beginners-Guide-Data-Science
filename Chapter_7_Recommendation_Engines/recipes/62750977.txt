Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups warm water
1 1/3 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup ground or milled flax seed
1 1/2 cups bread flour
3 Tablespoons brown sugar
3 Tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients in your breadmaker as recommended by the manufacturer.  Set the bread machine to the dough cycle and let it run.  When the machine indicates the dough is finished, place it in a lightly oiled bread pan and let it rise until doubled (about 1/2 hour).  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.

A nice light wheat bread and the flax adds a great flavor dimension, as well as a nutritional boost.  I make this bread at least once a week for my family!  We all love it!
