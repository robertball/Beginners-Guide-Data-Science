3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
3 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups canned pumpkin puree
4 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup water
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, sugar, salt and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, beat together pumpkin, eggs and water. Stir pumpkin mixture into flour mixture; beat until well blended. Fold in chocolate chips.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.

Description: 
They may sound a little weird, but if you decide to use some good semi-sweet chips, they turn out mighty tasty. You may substitute walnuts for the chocolate chips if you wish.
