Description: 
I went to a tiny school out in the country where the cook actually cooked. This was my all time favorite dessert with school lunches. Kids would trade other food just to get more peanut butter bars. Kids would also buy extra milk because it's a very dry and rich bar. Years later when I finally got the recipe from the school cook, Connie, it was all listed in very large weights. Through trial and error, I think we finally have it down to a family size recipe.
