Ingredients:
15 small (2x2-inch) sourdough bread slices
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (6.5 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange bread slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and brush tops with 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.
Bake in preheated oven until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes.
Combine artichoke hearts, olives, tomato, onion, 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese together in a bowl.
Spoon artichoke mixture onto the toasted bread slices. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
