Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pound fresh rhubarb, chopped
2 pints fresh strawberries
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 tablespoons butter
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix flour and sugar. Add strawberries and chopped rhubarb. Toss with sugar and flour and let stand for 30 minutes.
Pour filling into pie crust. Dot top with butter, and cover with lattice top crust.
(Apply yolk to top of pie, using a pastry brush - I didn't do this.) Sprinkle with sugar.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), for 35 to 40 minutes, or until bubbly and brown.  Turn off the oven and let sit for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on rack.
