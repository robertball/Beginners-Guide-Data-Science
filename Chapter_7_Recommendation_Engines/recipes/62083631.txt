Ingredients:
4 cups (moderately packed) fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
2 to 3 tbsps. sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil and Italian seasonings, drained and julienned
1/3 c shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
2 tbsps. grated Parmesan cheese
4 5-oz. boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 tsp. dried Italian seasoning
3/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray.
Add the spinach, and cook over medium-high heat, 2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.
Remove from heat, and toss in the sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella and Parmesan.
Set aside.
Cut a deep pocket into the thickest side of each piece of chicken, and stuff a quarter of the spinach mixture into each pocket.
Close by pressing flesh together and securing with a wooden toothpick, if necessary.
Combine the Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and sprinkles both sides of the chicken pieces with some of the mixture.
Wipe out the skillet, add the olive oil, and preheat over medium-high heat.
Add the chicken, and cook for 2 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for about 8 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through.
Serve hot.
