Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts halves, boneless and skinless
Â½ cup breadcrumbs
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tbsp dried basil
1 tbsp dried thyme
2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cups tomato sauce
4 oz fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced
2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.
Combine the herbs, salt, pepper and breadcrumbs in a shallow dish to blend. Cover chicken breasts with mixture and shake off any excess.
Heat olive oil in large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook just until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the skillet from the heat.
Spoon the tomato sauce over and around the chicken. Sprinkle parmesan over each chicken breast. Cover each chicken breast with mozzarella slices.
Bake, covered with foil, for 10 minutes, and then uncovered for 5 minutes, until the cheese melts and the chicken is cooked through.
