Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) salmon fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 clove garlic
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons Meyer lemon juice
1/4 pinch dried dill weed

Directions:
Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook salmon, skin side-up, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn salmon and continue cooking until skin side is slightly browned and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan. Press garlic into the butter using a garlic press and cook for 1 minute. Pour in cream and stir constantly for 2 minutes. Add lemon juice and dill. Be careful that the sauce doesn't break.
Serve sauce over salmon.
