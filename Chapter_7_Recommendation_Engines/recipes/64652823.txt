Ingredients:
50g onion
175g eggplant
185g yellow and red bell pepper
115g zucchini
100g tomatoes
1 clove garlic, crushed
25g fresh basil leaves
2 sprigs fresh oregano
1 fresh cayenne pepper, stem removed
Pinch of salt and pepper
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp white wine
1 tsp vinegar

Directions:
Preheat airfryer to 200Â°C.
Cut all the vegetables into one-inch cubes. Put them into a mixing bowl. Add the crushed garlic clove, basil, oregano, hot pepper, salt and pepper then mix well to distribute everything evenly. Drizzle oil, wine, and vinegar while mixing to coat all the vegetables.
Pour into the baking dish and insert it into the basket. Cook for eight minutes. Stir the vegetables and cook for another eight minutes. Stir again. Check for doneness.  Cook at five-minute intervals until the vegetables have achieved the desired doneness. (Between 20-25 minutes should be expected.)
Turn off the airfryer, leaving the dish inside. Allow to rest for approximately five minutes before serving.

Description: 
Traditional ratatouille vegetables are mixed with Italian herbs then airfried to create a quick and easy side dish that is healthy and delicious. Using an airfryer keeps the vegetables from getting soggy without using too much oil. You will need the baking accessory or an adaptable baking dish to use inside the airfryer basket.
