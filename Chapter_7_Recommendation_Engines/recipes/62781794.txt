Ingredients:
1 box fusilli or small penne rigate pasta
2 cups fiddleheads washed and drained
3 pieces cooked and crumbled bacon
1 English cucumber, seeded and finely chopped
Sundried Tomato Dressing
1/2 cup oil-packed sundried tomatoes, drained and chopped
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
3/4 cup vegetable oil
Salt and pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and oil lightly. Set aside.
In a saucepan, cook fiddleheads in boiling salted water until tender, 3 to 5 minutes depending on the size. Rinse in cold running water. Drain. Set aside.
In a skillet, cook bacon. Remove the bacon and crumble. Set Aside.
In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, egg yolk, mustard, lemon juice and garlic. Add the first third of the oil drop-by-drop, whisking constantly. When the emulsion begins to form, add the remaining oil in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly. Season with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, combine all the salad ingredients with the mayonnaise. Adjust the seasoning.

Description: 
A great way to use fiddlehead ferns. A very tasty late spring salad. If you can't get fiddleheads you can always use green beans. This salad is great for a BBQ, picnic or pot luck!
