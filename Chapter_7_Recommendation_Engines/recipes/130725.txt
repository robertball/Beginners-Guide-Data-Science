Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 head escarole, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 (15 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (15.5 ounce) can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove the bacon and reserve the drippings in the pan. Add olive oil to the drippings and heat for 1 minute. Add the escarole; cook and stir for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and continue cooking and stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the chicken broth and beans, and season with red pepper flakes. Simmer for 5 to 7 minutes. Ladle into bowls to serve and top with the crumbled bacon and Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
After searching high and low for a soupy escarole and beans recipe, I finally created my own version. It tastes just like the appetizer I order at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in New York. It has a soupy consistency so best served in a bowl with a crusty bread for dipping. My husband asks me to make this every week. I promise you will love this recipe. The cooking technique removes the bitterness from the escarole while maintaining the firmness of the beans.
