Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup thinly sliced onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, divided
1 cup 1/2-inch sliced zucchini
1 cup 1/2-inch sliced yellow squash
1/4 cup chopped black olives
1/4 cup capers (optional)
4 (4 ounce) cod fillets
2 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning to onion; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir zucchini, yellow squash, olives, and capers into onion mixture; top with cod fillets. Sprinkle tomatoes, remaining 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper onto cod fillets. Reduce heat, cover skillet, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork and zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over fish; cover skillet until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a friend and made a few changes to fit our taste. My husband is not a fish lover but he said, 'this is pretty darn good for fish'. From him that is a rave review!
