Ingredients:
Ingredients
* 2  to 2 1/4 pounds  boneless pork shoulder roast
* 2  to 3 tablespoons  vegetable oil
* 4  medium  carrots, thinly sliced (2 cups)
* 1  medium  yellow sweet pepper, cut into thin strips (1 cup)
* 1  8-ounce can  sliced water chestnuts, drained
* 1  large  onion, chopped (1 cup)
* 1  cup  uncooked long grain white rice
* 1  14-ounce can  reduced-sodium chicken broth
* 1/2  cup  water
* 1/4  cup  soy sauce
* 2  tablespoons  molasses
* 2  tablespoons  light-color corn syrup
* 1  to 2 teaspoons  red chili paste
* 1  teaspoon  five-spice powder
* 1/3  cup  sliced green onions

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Trim fat from meat. Cut meat into 3/4-inch pieces. In an extra-large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Cook meat, half at a time, in hot oil until brown. Transfer meat to an ungreased 3-quart rectangular baking dish. Stir in carrots, sweet pepper, and water chestnuts.
2. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add onion; cook just until tender. Add rice; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in broth, water, soy sauce, molasses, corn syrup, chili paste, and five-spice powder. Cook and stir just until mixture comes to boiling. Carefully add to meat mixture; stir to combine.
3. Bake, covered, about 1 hour or until meat and rice are tender. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes before serving. Stir gently. Sprinkle with green onions. Makes 6 servings.
