Spent grain dog treats Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
6 cups spent brewers grain
6 cups flour
3 eggs
1-1/2 cups peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Mix all ingredients thoroughly.
Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. Press down into a thin layer (about 1/4") on cookie sheets. Score almost all the way through into the shapes you want.
Bake for about 30 minutes at 350 F.
Loosen them from the sheet, break the biscuits apart where you scored them and spread out on the cookie sheet.
Return to oven at 200F for 4 - 6 hours (until they are very dry).
Store in an airtight container to keep them dry and mold-free. They freeze well too.
