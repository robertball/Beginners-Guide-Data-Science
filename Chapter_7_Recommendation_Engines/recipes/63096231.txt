Ingredients:
Used premade k-cups
Your favorite ground coffee
K-cup caps such as  DisposaKup Lids (preferred) or foil or press & seal

Directions:
Remove the foil from a used k-cup.  Rinse the k-cup to remove coffee grounds.  Do not remove the paper filter.  Turn the k-cup over on a drain board or dish rack and allow to air dry.  Once dry, fill k-cup with ground coffee; the cup should take a scant 1/8th cup.  Tap the coffee a bit with a spoon to compact it.  Leave about 5mm space between top of k-cup and coffee.  Use a pastry brush to brush any coffee away from the top edge of the k-cup.  Cap the k-cup with a k-cup cap (or press & seal or foil).  When using the k-cup be sure to line up the hole on the bottom with the bottom needle of your coffee maker.
