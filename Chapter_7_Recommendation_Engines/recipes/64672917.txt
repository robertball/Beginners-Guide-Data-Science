Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
Salt and pepper, to taste
Garlic and onion powder, to taste
1 (10.75 oz) can cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 oz) can cream of mushroom soup
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
Frozen tater tots (to cover)

Directions:
In a non-stick skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until no longer pink. Drain any excess fat off the meat and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.
Next, Open both cans of soup and add contents of both cans to cooked beef. Allow to simmer for about 5 minutes to help flavor the meat.
Then, scoop the meat mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the mixture. And finally, spread tater tots over the cheese covered meat mixture to cover completely.
Preheat the oven as directed on the bag of tater tots and bake as directed for crispy tots.
Remove from oven and serve hot and enjoy!
