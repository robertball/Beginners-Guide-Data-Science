Ingredients:
8 oz diced slab bacon
1 oz butter or oil
6 fl oz heavy cream
6 fl oz milk
3 eggs
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
pinch ground nutmeg
4 oz Swiss Cheese
9 inch Almond Flour Pie Crust #1

Directions:
Saute the bacon in butter or oil until browned.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain.  Discard the rendered fat, or save for another use.
Whisk together the cream, milk, and eggs.  Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
Scatter the bacon and cheese evenly over the crust.  Add the custard mixture gradually, stirring it gently with the back of a fork to distribute the filling ingredients evenly.
Set the quiche pan on a sheet pan and bake in a 350 degree oven until a knife blade inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
