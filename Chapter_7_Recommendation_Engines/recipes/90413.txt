Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped
4 slices pickled jalapeno pepper, finely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the ground beef, onion, egg, hot pepper sauce, and bread crumbs. Season with paprika, parsley, salt, and pepper. In a separate bowl, mix the cheese, red chile pepper, and jalapeno pepper. Form the beef mixture into 4 balls, and press a well in the center of each. Stuff with equal amounts of the cheese mixture. Press meat around filling to seal. Arrange on a baking sheet, and press gently into thick patties.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until well done.
