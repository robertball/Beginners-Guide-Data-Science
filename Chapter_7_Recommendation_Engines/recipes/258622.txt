Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 ½ cups frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
¼ cup finely shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons drained and chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4  toothpicks
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Microwave spinach in a microwave-safe bowl until defrosted, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Place chicken thighs in a gallon-sized resealable bag and pound with a heavy glass bottle until about 1/4-inch in thickness. Pat dry with paper towels.
Combine the warm spinach, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix until cheeses melt. Spread over the chicken thighs; roll and secure with toothpicks.
Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken thighs seam-side down and cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and bake the chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes.
