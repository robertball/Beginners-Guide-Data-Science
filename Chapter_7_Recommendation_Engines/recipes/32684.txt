Description: 
Believe it or not, the party punch that people flip over is the easiest to make! Quit fooling with all those measurements and come on over to the easy side of the street! By the way, the French vanilla that always seems to taste the best in this punch are the cheap off-brands. Sounds like a line, but it's true!
