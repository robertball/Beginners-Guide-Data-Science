Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 lb Italian sausage (I make my own)
1 large onion, diced fine
6 oz Tomato paste
1-2 cans Diced tomato
1-2 cans Tomato sauce
1 T Granulated garlic (or 2T fresh)
2 t Basil
1 t Oregano
Pepper
Salt
1 T Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Brown ground beef and sausage, add onions and saute'. Add tomato paste and stir until well blended. Add one can each of diced tomato and tomato sauce. If you like it more saucey than meaty, add more diced tomato or tomato sauce. Add garlic, basil, oregano and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a low boil and taste. Add salt, pepper and more spices if you want. I add about 1 T of crushed red pepper.
