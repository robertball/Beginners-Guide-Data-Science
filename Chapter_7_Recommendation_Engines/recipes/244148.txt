Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package fresh fettuccine (such as Buitoni速)
1 (15 ounce) jar light Alfredo sauce (such as Classico速 Light Creamy Alfredo)
3 ounces dried figs (such as Sun-Maid速), stemmed and thinly sliced
2 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto (such as Boar's Head速), cut into thin strips
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in the boiling water until pasta floats to the top, 2 to 5 minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a bowl.
Combine Alfredo sauce, figs, prosciutto, and black pepper in the same saucepan used for pasta; cook and stir over medium heat until warmed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add pasta to Alfredo sauce mixture and mix well; transfer to a serving bowl and top with Parmesan cheese.
