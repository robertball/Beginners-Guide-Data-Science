Description: 
This spicy and sweet shredded chicken can be used in many different Mexican dishes. I love it on crunchy tostadas. This is a great recipe to make ahead and freeze for a quick dinner option during the week. Level of spiciness will depend on the salsa brand you use. You can use straight chipotle peppers from the can, but be prepared for blazing hotness! If you can't blend the mixture, that's OK; just chop everything up very small, it will break down a little more once you cook it. Serve on tortillas or chips. Garnish with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream, or guacamole.
