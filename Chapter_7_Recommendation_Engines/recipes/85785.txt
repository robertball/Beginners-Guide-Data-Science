Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten slightly
1/2 cup Enova™ Brand Oil
1/2 cup grated carrots
1 3/4 cups grated zucchini
1/2 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 365 degrees F. Grease and flour an 8x3-inch loaf pan, set aside.
In a medium bowl combine the eggs and Enova oil; mix well. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Gently stir the egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Fold the carrots, zucchini, walnuts (if used) and the raisins into the above mixture.
Pour the mixture into the loaf pan and bake for about 55 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Remove from the oven to a wire rack; allow to cool for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and return to wire rack until completely cooled.

Submitter: 
Enova™ Brand Oil
Description: 
Baking with Enova™ oil is a real treat. You don't have to skimp on Enova™ oil to save on fat, so your breads, cakes and cookies can still taste rich and moist, not dry or crumbly. Enova™ oil mixes and bakes just like the oil you use now, but less of the fat in Enova™ oil ends up stored in your body. Enjoy this moist carrot and zucchini bread. Why not have another slice?
