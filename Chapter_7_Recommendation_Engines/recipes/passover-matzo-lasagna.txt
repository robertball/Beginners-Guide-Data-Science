Ingredients:
6 matzo sheets
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (24 ounce) carton cottage cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (28 ounce) jar marinara sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Soak matzo sheets in a large bowl of hot water until tender, about 30 seconds. Drain. Combine eggs, cottage cheese, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of a cup of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Place 2 matzo sheets over the sauce, then pour another layer of sauce over the sheets. Spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture on top, then another layer of sauce. Continue layering until all the matzo sheets are used, finishing with a layer of sauce. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes.
