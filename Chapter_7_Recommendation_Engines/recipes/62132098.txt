Description: 
When I was little, this is the ice cream my mom and I would come home and make after picking strawberries at Cherry Hill Farm in MD.  I now share this recipe with my son and we have made Strawberry Shortcake numerous times by simply adding shortcake, fresh strawberries and whip cream to the ice cream.
