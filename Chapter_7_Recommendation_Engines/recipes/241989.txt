Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 fresh peaches, halved and pitted
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon sliced almonds
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons brandy
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking dish with cooking spray.
Arrange peaches cut-side up in the prepared baking dish.
Put butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat, add almonds, and heat together until butter melts, about 2 minutes. Stir honey, brown sugar, and cinnamon into the melted butter; bring to a simmer and add brandy and salt. Stir to dissolve the salt, remove saucepan from heat, and add vanilla extract; pour the mixture over the peaches.
Bake peaches in preheated oven until the peaches are cooked through, about 30 minutes.
