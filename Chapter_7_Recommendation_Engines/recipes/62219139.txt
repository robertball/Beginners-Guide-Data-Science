Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and grated potatoes - Yukon Golds prefered
1 tablespoon grated onion
3 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons Matzo Meal - Add more if dough is runny.
1 teaspoon Salt
1/2 cup oil for frying

Directions:
Grate the potatoes along with the onion in a food processor.
Place the potatoes in a cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.
In a medium bowl stir the potatoes, eggs, matzo meal and salt together.
Let stand a few minutes so that Matzo Meal can absorb the liquid. Note- add more Matzo Meal if dough is still runny.
In a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until hot. Place large spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, pressing down on them to form 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick patties. Brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. Let drain on paper towels. Serve hot!
