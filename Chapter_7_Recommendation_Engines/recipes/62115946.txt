Ingredients:
BASE:
120 Grams of Butter (1 stick)
1/2 cup of sugar
1 teaspoon of baking powder
1 cup of flour
2 Tablespoons of cocoa
1 pk of Gregg's instant pudding "Chocolate smoothie" flavor (if you live outside NZ or Australia you must use the non-cook instant pudding style sachets!)
CARAMEL:
2 Tablespoons of golden syrup (v. important: don't substitute!)
60 Grams of Butter (2 Tablespoons)
1 can of sweetened condensed milk.

Directions:
Mix all dry ingredients including the instant pudding mix together in a bowl.
Soften the butter in the microwave on 30% and add to the dry ingredients and mix throughly. (The mixture should be holding its shape when you squeeze it.)
Press into a shallow square baking dish.
Bake at 175 degrees celcius for 15 minutes whilst making the caramel.
Melt all caramel ingredients together in a saucepan until it has very lightly thickened.
Remove the base from the oven and pore the caramel evenly over the base and return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins untill the caramel is bubbling.
Remove to cool completely before frosting with your favorite chocolate frosting. Slice into squares and keep in plastic airtight container for up to a week. Will freeze well.

Description: 
This is my own twist on a national favorite in New Zealand. Experimenting one day i added something that makes this the best chocolate caramel slice in New Zealand hands down!

WARNING: This is a very sweet slice, not recommended for amateur choc-o-holics!
