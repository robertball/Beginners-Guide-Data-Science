Ingredients:
1/2 cup coarse salt
1 napa cabbage, cut into chunks
2 jujube (Chinese dates), or more to taste (optional)
5 1/2 cups water, divided
3 tablespoons salted fermented shrimp (saewujeot)
2 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces
6 cloves garlic, sliced
2 tablespoons sliced fresh ginger
1/2 Korean radish, cut into matchsticks
5 chestnuts, cut into thin strips
1/2 pear, cut into matchsticks
2 carrots, cut into matchsticks
1 red chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced, or more to taste
1 green chile pepper, seeded and thinly sliced, or more to taste
4 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Dissolve 1/2 cup coarse salt in a large bowl of water. Submerge cabbage in the salted water and let soak, 12 to 24 hours. Drain. Rinse well and drain, squeezing out excess water.
Soak jujube in a small bowl of water for 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, pit, and cut into thin slices.
Combine 1/2 cup water, salted shrimp, scallions, garlic, and ginger in a food processor; puree until smooth.
Pour puree into a large bowl; add jujube, radish, chestnuts, pear, carrots, red chile pepper, green chile pepper, brown sugar, and 2 teaspoon salt. Stir in remaining 5 cups water. Mix in cabbage until well coated.
Pack cabbage mixture into an airtight jar. Pour in any liquid left in the bowl.
Seal and let sit at room temperature until starting to ferment, 1 to 2 days. Transfer to the refrigerator.

Description: 
We thought venturing into other kimchi domains would be a wise decision, especially with the warmer weather. This type of kimchi is perfect for those who can't handle spicy foods and is milder in flavor. Enjoy with rice and other meals.
