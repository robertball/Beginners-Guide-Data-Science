Ingredients:
3 racks baby back pork ribs, outer membrane removed
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup vinegar
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
Sauce:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons steak sauce (such as A.1.®)
1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Crystal®)
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Place marinated ribs in a shallow baking dish; add water. Tent aluminum foil over baking dish.
Bake ribs in the preheated oven until heated through, about 1 1/4 hour.
Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Combine vinegar and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl and pour into a spray bottle.
Transfer ribs to the smoker. Let cook, spraying generously with vinegar mixture every 30 minutes, until tender, about 3 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add ketchup, honey, steak sauce, hot sauce, garlic, and cayenne pepper. Simmer sauce until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.
Brush sauce over ribs. Grill until deeply browned, about 15 minutes.
