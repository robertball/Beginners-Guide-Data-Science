Title:
Perfect Pita Chips with a twist! Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 package of pita pockets (white or wheat)
2 tbsp cinnamon sugar
1 tbsp brown sugar
2 tbsp olive oil
I can't believe its not butter spray or melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Split pita pockets in half and cut into 4ths or 8ths
lay out on cookie sheet and spread a small amount of olive oil on to each chip (you really only need to coat the top of the chip lightly and I recommend using either a plastic basting brush or your fingers)
I spray each chip with butter spray or drizzle melted butter on each chip (just a bit)
Mix together cinnamon sugar and brown sugar and sprinkle to your liking on top of chips (make sure you see a light coating on each chip and thicker coating won't hurt just makes it sweeter!)
Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes (turning cookie sheet every 5 minutes held to even out crispness and color but not necessary)

Description: 
Even better than the store bought chips with a twist... perfect crunchy chips for that person who needs combination salt and sweet!! Great with both white and wheat pockets.

* make the wheat ones even sweeter by brushing a light light coating of honey over the chips instead of butter!
