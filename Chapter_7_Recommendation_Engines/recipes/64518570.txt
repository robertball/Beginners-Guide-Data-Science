Ingredients:
1/2 lb uncooked medium pasta shells
1 can (14.5 oz) fire roasted diced tomatoes, undrained
1 can (10 oz) mild enchilada sauce
2 cups water
1 bunch thinly sliced green onions, greens and whites separated
2 tsp chili powder
1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained, rinsed
1 can (11 oz)  whole kernel sweet corn, drained
2 cups shredded chicken
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (8 oz)
Chopped fresh cilantro, lime wedges and sour cream, if desired

Directions:
In large colander, rinse and drain uncooked pasta. In 4-quart saucepan, mix pasta, tomatoes, enchilada sauce, water, green onion whites and chili powder. Heat to boiling over high heat; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered 14 to 16 minutes, stirring frequently, until pasta is tender; do not drain.
Stir in beans, corn and chicken; return to simmering. Cook 2 minutes longer to combine flavors. Remove from heat; stir in cheese.
