Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) packages extra-wide egg noodles
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
5 cloves garlic, diced
1/2 cup fresh parsley
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 (32 ounce) cartons seafood stock (such as Kitchen Basics®), divided
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon dried cilantro
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) package frozen peeled crawfish tails, thawed and undrained
2 pounds peeled and deveined small shrimp
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons Creole seasoning (such as Zatarain's®)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over low heat; cook and stir onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix parsley, sage, basil, and lemon zest in a bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
Pour 1 cup seafood stock in a measuring cup and set aside; pour remaining stock and lemon juice into onion mixture. Stir in thyme, cilantro, dill, sea salt, and black pepper; cook until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Add crawfish to seasoned stock mixture; cook until crawfish are heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir shrimp into crawfish mixture; cook until shrimp are pink and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Remove crawfish and shrimp from sauce using a slotting spoon; transfer to a bowl and cover.
Whisk cornstarch into reserved 1 cup seafood stock until completely dissolved; stir into sauce. Cook, stirring constantly, at a simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.
Mix half-and-half and Creole seasoning into sauce until fully incorporated and warmed; add crawfish and shrimp back into sauce. Toss sauce with egg noodles.

Description: 
I made this for Easter and got a family request to make it again for Mother's Day. These amounts are for the family, so it makes quite a bit. The time took longer for me because of the amount of shrimp I had to peel, but if you cut this recipe down, it won't take you so long. This time I also included crawfish. Oh ya'll gotta try it! Enjoy!
