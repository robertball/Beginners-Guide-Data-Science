Duck Breasts Made Easy Recipe

Ingredients:
2 Duck breasts, each about 8 ounces (225g) off the bone
Salt and freshly milled black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.
With a very sharp knife, score the skin of each duck breast at an angle 6 or 7 times, trying not to cut into the flesh. This is so that the entire breast does not curl up as the skin is cooked, but remains flat in the pan. Season the skin with 2 pinches of salt and 2 of pepper per breast.
On a medium-low heat, in a large ovenproof frying pan, cook the duck breasts to melt the fat away and to crisp the skin. Spoon out any excess fat (keep for roasting potatoes etc etc) 3 or 4 times, until the skin is crispy and golden brown. This should take 10 to 20 minutes.
Season the meat side of the breasts with a pinch or two of salt and pepper then turn the breasts over and cook for 1 minute.
Turn the breasts skin side down again and then place the pan into the hot oven for 4 minutes.
Remove from the oven (do NOT try to pick the panhandle up with bare hands) and allow to rest for 4 minutes.
Carve and serve.

Description: 
Delicious, tender, pink duck breast meat with a crispy skin, what could be more delightful? And it's nothing to be scared of. Very simple, and delicious, with the added bonus of removing nearly all the fat which can be kept for making wonderful roast potatoes for example.
