Ingredients:
150 gr flour
1.5 cup ice cold Prosecco, divided
Pinch of salt
1 tsp fresh rosemary, minced (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the flour and salt with one cup of ice cold Prosecco. Whisk until the batter is smooth and creamy.
Add more Prosecco to thin the batter to a light consistency that will cover and bind to the food. Allow to rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before using.
