Title:
Taco Roll-Ups Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 packages cream cheese (I use the 1/3 less fat)
1/2 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/2 package of Hidden Valley Fiesta Ranch Seasoning (in the salad dressing aisle)
7 medium sized burrito shells

Directions:
Mix that all together and spread one generous spoonful evenly onto a medium sized burrito shell. Then roll it up tightly and slowly, so you don't tear the shell.
You should get about 6 or 7 roll-ups
Chill the roll-ups for 10 minutes uncovered in your refrigerator.
Slice the chilled roll-ups in one inch "coins"-and eat the ends that don't look pretty...it happens.
