Ingredients:
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 Tablespoons butter or margarine
2 Tablespoons water
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 (8oz) tube refrigerated biscuits
1/2 cup dried fruit or diced apple (optional)

Directions:
Mix first four ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and microcook on high for 2 minutes or til melted.
Separate biscuits and cut each biscuit into four pieces.
Combine all ingredients & stir gently just til all pieces are coated.
Pour the mixture evenly around the ring of a microwave-safe tube/bundt pan (Silicone works great or substitute a glass pie plate with a custard cup in the center)
Microwave on high for 3 minutes (up to 5 minutes for a low wattage oven) then let rest for 5 minutes. After cooking ring will look slightly damp in center, but will finish cooking as it rests.
Invert onto serving dish and enjoy!
A double recipe will take 5-8 minutes to bake.
