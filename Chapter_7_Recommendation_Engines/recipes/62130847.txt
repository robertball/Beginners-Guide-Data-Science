Ingredients:
4 tablespoons apricot preserves
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons sriracha hot chili sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled & deveined(leave tail on if preferred)

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium high heat.
In small saucepan over low heat combine preserves, honey, chili sauce, vinegar & oil.  Heat on low stirring occasionally until preserves are melted & it is well combined.
While grill heats & glaze is cooking, skewer 3-4 shrimp onto small bamboo skewers that have been soaked.
When grill & sauce are ready, lay shrimp skewers on grill. Cook about 1 minute.
Turn skewers over.
Cook another minute, baste with glaze.
Turn skewers over.
Baste the second side with glaze, remove when cooked to desired doneness.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds & serve with extra sauce for dipping.
(I find if you work from left to right on the grill, doing each skewer in the same order each time it works great, by the time you get to the far end, the end you started on is ready for the next step.)

Description: 
I love the sweet chili sauces so many restaurants are featuring now & wanted to make my own.  I knew to make it come out a clear glaze I need to use a jelly or preserves, & it worked. I used size 26-30 shrimp. Make 8 appetizer servings or 4 main course servings.
