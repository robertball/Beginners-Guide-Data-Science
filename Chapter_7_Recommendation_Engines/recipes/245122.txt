Ingredients:
1/2 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce
1 (2 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, or to taste
1/2 tomato, diced
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced mushrooms
2 tablespoons diced olives
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
4 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Mix pizza sauce, pepperoni, tomato, onion, mushrooms, olives, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into the hot oil and cook until set, about 5 minutes. Pour pizza sauce mixture over eggs and cook until firm enough to fold 1 side of eggs over the filling creating an omelet, 5 to 10 minutes more.
