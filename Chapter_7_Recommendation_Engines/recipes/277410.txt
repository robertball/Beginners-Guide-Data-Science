Ingredients:
2 (14.5 ounce) cans reduced-sodium chicken broth
3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, or more to taste
4 (14.5 ounce) cans water
1/2 sweet onion, cut into 4 wedges
1 stalk celery, cut in chunks
1 head broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets
2 ears fresh corn, kernels cut off, or more to taste
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1/2 sweet onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups uncooked white rice
2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground thyme
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup

Directions:
Combine chicken broth and chicken in a large stockpot. Add 4 cans of water, onion wedges, and celery chunks and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and cook until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the centers and have absorbed the flavors of the onion and celery, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove and discard onion and celery.
Remove chicken to a plate and shred meat with 2 forks. Return shredded chicken to the pot and add broccoli florets, corn kernels, chopped celery, and chopped onion. Stir in rice, salt, pepper, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and rice is cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. Stir in condensed soup and cook until heated, 3 to 5 minutes.
