Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (14.5 ounce) can canned diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can brown beans
1/2 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes
chili powder to taste
garlic powder to taste
2 celery stalks (sliced very thin)
1 large carrot (grated)
1 small  sweet vidalia  onion (pureed)
1 small red pepper & Yellow pepper (pureed)
3 large mushrooms (sliced)
V-8 juice - add a little splash if chili is to thick, or more
if you like your chili on the thinner side.
Note:
Vegetables can be cut or sliced larger, I do them small to sneak
in more vegatables for the day.

Directions:
Crumble the beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain off grease. Saute vegetables until cooked. mix in the cooked hamburger, vegetables, tomatoes, brown beans. Add garlic powder and chili seasoning mix to taste. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for hiding more veggies in your families diet. The sweetness comes
from the vidalia onion and peppers. There is no sugar added...Kids love brown beans, in
place of the regular kidney...(kidney are healthier), but adding the extra veggies rounds out
this chili as a healthy, lower sodium chili. Enjoy!!!Modified from: Thirty Minute Chili
