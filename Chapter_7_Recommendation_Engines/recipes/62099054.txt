Ingredients:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2 c. fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 c. chopped bell pepper
1/2 c. chopped onion
1 clove garlic
1 t. Italian seasoning
2 T. butter
1 - 15 1/2 oz. jar spaghetti sauce (I use Prego)
1/4 c. water
2 - 10 oz pkgs. frozen chopped spinach, cooked and very well drained
1 lb. ricatto cheese
8 oz. pkg lasagna, cooked and drained (I use 16 oz.)
1/4 c. chopped onions
2 - 6 oz pkgs. mozzarella cheese slices (approx 6x3 inch)
1/2 c. fresh parmesan, grated

Directions:
In 2 qt. sauce pan saute mushrooms, peppers, 1/4 c. onions and garlic in butter.  Add spaghetti sauce, water and Italian seasoning.  Mix well, cover and simmer 20 minutes.
Combine spinach (make sure there is not water dripping out of it), ricatto and 1/4 c. chopped onions.  Mix thoroughly.  In 11x13 pan put a very thin layer of sauce.  Add a single layer of lasagna noodles, overlapping them a little. Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce over noodles, then put 1/2 the spinach mixture and top with mozarella slices.  Repeat ending with sauce on top of second layer.  Sprinkle parmesan evenly over the top.  Bake 30 minutes.  Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
