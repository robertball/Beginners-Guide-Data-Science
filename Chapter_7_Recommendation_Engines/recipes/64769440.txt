1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 onion, chopped
1 cup chopped carrots

1/2 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style stewed tomatoes, drained and diced

Description: 
This is a great recipe for cleaning out veggies from your fridge. I put in my recipe things that are always in my fridge but you can easily substitute the veggies add cauliflower, celery, or zucchini etc.
Make sure you have at least a 6 quart pressure cooker.
