Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

Directions:
Trim and flatten the chicken breasts and then cut in half.  In a flat bowl mix together the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Dip chicken breasts in egg mixed with milk, then in bread crumb mixture to coat. Place coated chicken on a greased rack and refrigerate. Either pan fry in olive oil or bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until juices run clear, turning over chicken 5 minutes before removing from oven.
