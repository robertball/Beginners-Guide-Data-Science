Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 tablespoons molasses
1 large egg
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
Icing:
3 cups powdered sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons light corn syrup
1-3 teaspoons water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F
Combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, butter and molasses in large bowl; beat until light and fluffy. Add egg; blend well.
In a seperate bowl, sift together flour and all remaining ingredients. Add butter mixture in two stages and mix well to form a smooth dough. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour for easier handling.
On a floured surface, roll out 1/3 of dough at a time to 1/8 inch thickness. Keep remaining dough refrigerated. Cut with floured 2 1/2 inch gingerbread boy (or girl) cookie cutters. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets covered with parchment paper.
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until set. Immediately remove cookies from cookie sheets. Let cookies cool completely before decorating.
Icing: Sift powdered sugar into bowl. Mix in lemon juice and corn syrup. Mix in enough water by teaspoonfuls to form a smooth icing that is soft enough to pipe, yet firm enough to hold shape.
