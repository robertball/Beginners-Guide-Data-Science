Ingredients:
2 tablespoons caraway seed, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 pounds boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  In a small bowl, mix together the caraway seed, salt, mustard powder, thyme, oregano and vegetable oil to make a paste.
Place the roast in a roasting pan fat side up. Rub the spice mixture into the top and sides of the roast. Insert a meat thermometer into the roast, and place in the oven.
Roast for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F (67 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes. The temperature will rise to 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Slice and serve.
