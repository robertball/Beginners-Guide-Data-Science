Ingredients:
5 ounces pancetta
1/4 fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
1 garlic clove, minced
2/3 cup olive oil
3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
3 large celery stalks, chopped
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Arrange pancetta slices on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cool. Chop pancetta.
2. Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice, cilantro, lemon peel, and garlic in small bowl. Whisk in oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Place potatoes in large pot. Add enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium. Simmer until tender, about 20-25 minutes depending on the size of potatoes. Drain. Let stand until cool enough to handle.
4. Cut potatoes into 1/4 inch length slices. Place in large bowl. Add celery and lemon juice mix. Toss gently to coat. Season to taste. Cover and chill until cold-- at least 1 1/2 hours.
