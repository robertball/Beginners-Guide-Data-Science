Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 pound mushrooms, coarsely chopped
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/3 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
2 jalapeno peppers, minced, or to taste
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 whole wheat tortillas
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 sprigs cilantro, chopped, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, bell peppers, and jalapenos. Season with salt, pepper, and chili powder. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Lightly brush tortillas with olive oil. Place tortillas on a grill or skillet over medium heat and heat until char marks start to appear, 1 to 2 minutes.
Divide mushroom and bell pepper mixture among tortillas. Top with Cheddar cheese and heat until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
