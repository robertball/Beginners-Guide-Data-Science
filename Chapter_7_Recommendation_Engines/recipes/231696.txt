Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
1 cup brown sugar
4 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®), or more if needed
1 quart beef stock
1 onion, peeled
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 bay leaves
12 whole black peppercorns
2 pounds red potatoes, quartered
1 (16 ounce) package carrots, cut into sticks
1 head cabbage, cut into wedges

Directions:
Rinse brisket thoroughly in cool water and place into a large Dutch oven. Generously coat beef with brown sugar on all sides. Pour Irish stout beer around roast, followed by beef stock. Liquid should cover brisket by about 1 inch; add another beer if more liquid is needed.
Place onion, garlic, bay leaves, spike packet from corned beef, and peppercorns into liquid. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover Dutch oven. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours, turning brisket over in the beer mixture every 30 minutes. Place potatoes and carrots around roast, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Add cabbage wedges and simmer until tender, about 10 more minutes. Brisket should easily pull apart with your fingers or a fork.
Transfer vegetables to a serving bowl and place corned beef on a serving platter; let meat rest 10 minutes before slicing across the grain to serve.
