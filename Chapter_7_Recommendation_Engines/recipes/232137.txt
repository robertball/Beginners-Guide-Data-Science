Ingredients:
Brisket Rub:
3 tablespoons smoked paprika
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 1/2 pounds beef brisket
Barbeque Sauce:
3/4 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup water (optional)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1/2 onion, sliced into rings

Directions:
Mix paprika, pepper, salt, brown sugar, chili powder, and cumin together in a bowl; rub evenly over the surface of the brisket. Put brisket in a large, resealable plastic bag; refrigerate 30 minutes to overnight.
Stir barbeque sauce, water, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke together in the bottom of a slow cooker. Lay brisket into the sauce mixture. Arrange onions atop the brisket.
Cook on Low until brisket is very tender, 6 to 7 hours. Rest brisket 10 minutes before slicing or shredding; serve with sauce from the slow cooker.

Description: 
This is a wonderful and very easy recipe to throw in the slow cooker on those really busy days. It can be increased for a large group or downsized for 2 people. It reminds me of summers in Texas.
