Ingredients:
8 ounces white or crimini mushrooms
1 medium onion, halved and sliced (optional)
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 lb ground beef or meatless crumbles
8 ounces wide egg noodles
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups hot water or beef stock
1 teaspoon Better than Bouillon Beef Base (omit if using beef stock)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4-1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, optional
2/3 cup sour cream

Directions:
1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and brown the mushrooms. Remove to a bowl and set aside.
2. Add the ground beef and onions, if using, and brown. Bring back to medium high heat and add the noodles, milk, beef stock, mushrooms, cornstarch, salt, pepper, paprika, and dry mustard, if using. Stir to combine and cover. Lower the heat to medium and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked through.
3. Add the sour cream and simmer for 5 more minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
My husband LOVES this dish.  We made it three times within a month when we first found it.  I've made some tweaks to the original dish - the original only used 4 mushrooms (!), no onions, and no mustard powder.  You can easily add or remove things as you see fit.  It would probably be really good made with chicken and chicken broth, too.  Maybe add some peas or broccoli and adjust the seasonings to fit.  It's a much healthier alternative to hamburger helper!
