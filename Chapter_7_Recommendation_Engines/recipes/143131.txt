Ingredients:
1 sprig fresh rosemary, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1 hot chile pepper, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 limes, juiced
6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
salt and pepper to taste
3/4 pound boneless lamb, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 eggplant, peeled and cubed
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
1 (10 ounce) box couscous
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Combine rosemary, mint, chile pepper, garlic, the juice from 2 of the limes, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Add the lamb and coat well with the marinade; marinate at least 1 hour and up to overnight in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the eggplant, red and yellow peppers, and onions with 3 tablespoons olive oil; toss to coat.  Place vegetables on a large baking sheet in a single layer and roast until tender, about 20 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet over medium heat.  Remove lamb from marinade (discard marinade); cook and stir until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Add couscous; stir briefly to coat well.  Add water; cook and stir until just boiling.  Cover; set aside until all the water is absorbed, about 10 minutes.  Fluff couscous with a fork, and stir in the juice of 1 lime.
Serve lamb and vegetables over couscous.
