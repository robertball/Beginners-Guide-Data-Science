Ingredients:
Preparation Time: 10 min
Total Time: 50 min
Serves: 4-6
Ingredients
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 granny smith apples, quartered and sliced
4 tbsp brown sugar
4 eggs
1 cup salted butter
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup flour
1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 small pinch (1/8) teaspoon nutmeg
Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and grease the bottoms and the sides of your 11x7 casserole dish. Place the pecans into the bottom of the casserole dish and sprinkle two tablespoons of brown sugar on top. Place the pecans into the oven and let them bake for 10 minutes.
2. While the pecans are toasting, take a medium-sized bowl and quickly blend the eggs, butter, granulated sugar, flour, baking powder, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Peel and cut your apples into slices and set aside (sprinkle with some lemon juice, so the apple wedges don't go brown).
3. Remove the pecans from the oven and place the sliced apples over the top, trying your best to create an even layer. Sprinkle the two leftover tablespoons of brown sugar over the apples and pour the batter over the top. Place into the oven for 35 minutes, or until the cake is springy to the touch.
4. Once cooked, carefully flip the cake over onto a dish and serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
Pro tip: Make sure that the entire casserole dish is well-greased with butter to ensure that you are able to flip the cake over without issue. Use a butter knife to loosen the edges before flipping.
