Ingredients:
6 phyllo sheets
3/4 of lb of ground turkey
1/4 cup sweet and sour sauce
1/4 cup garlic cream cheese
6 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1/4 Spanish onion, finely chopped
1/2 tsp of curry
1/2 tsp of cumin
1/4 tsp of cayenne
1/4 cup of olive oil
salt & pepper to taste
brush

Directions:
Remove phyllo from fridge at least 1 hour before using.
Preheat oven to 350F.
In a large skillet, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and set to medium heat.
Add the chopped onions and cook until they start to soften. Add the ground turkey and garlic and cook until the meat has browned.
Add the cumin, curry, cayenne, salt, pepper and turn heat to low. Now add the sweet and sour sauce and cream cheese and mix thoroughly. Turn heat off and let cool before handling
Lay out the 6 phyllo sheets on a flat surface and keep covered with a damp cloth. Remove one sheet at a time to a cutting board. Brush a thin line of oil down one side and fold over the sheet lengthwise. Now brush the top with a thin layer of oil.
Take 2 large heaping tbsp of the meat mixture and place in the mixture of the phyllo dough at one end leaving about an inch on the bottom and each side to fold.
Fold from the bottom over top the mixture. Then fold in each side one at a time and roll the wrap to the end.
Place the roll in a greased casserole dish and brush with olive oil. Repeat these steps until all are wrapped.
Put it in the oven for about 20 minutes, until the dough has browned a bit and looks flaky.
Let cool for a couple of minutes before serving.
