1 tsp. Salt
1/4 tsp. Black pepper
4 tbsp. Ketchup
1/2 c. - 2/3 c.Whole milk (or half-n-half)
Sauce
4 tbsp. Apple Cider Vinegar
2 tbsp. - 4 tbsp. Dark Brown Sugar
1/2 c. Ketchup

Directions:

Smooth out top.
Sauce:
Combine sauce ingredients and pour on top and sides of meatloaf.
Bake at 350°F about 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until done.

*The addition of 1 or 2 teaspoons of Kitchen Bouquet® makes this recipe very good.
**Recipe should be "plump" from the addition of the milk or Half & Half. It should NOT be runny.
***A second batch of sauce served hot is good to serve with the meatloaf.
