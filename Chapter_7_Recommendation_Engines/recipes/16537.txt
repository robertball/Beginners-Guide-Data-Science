Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) pie shells, baked
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter flavored extract
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups unsweetened pineapple juice
1 (7.25 ounce) package fluffy white frosting mix
1/2 cup boiling water
1 teaspoon rum flavored extract
3 ounces cream cheese, softened

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter or margarine and sugar together until fluffy. Blend in eggs. In a separate bowl,  mix together flour and salt, then add to sugar mixture. Stir until ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Add butter flavoring, vanilla, and pineapple juice to sugar and flour mixture. Blend well, then pour mixture into a large saucepan or double boiler. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook mixture an additional 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
In a large heatproof mixing bowl, blend frosting mix with boiling water. Beat until stiff, then stir in rum flavoring.
Add cream cheese to mixture on stove, and stir just until incorporated. Pour mixture into frosting and blend until smooth. Pour mixture into baked pastry shells and sprinkle with chopped pecans. Chill for 4 hours before serving.
