Ingredients:
1 Bushel Cortland Apples (or your favorites)

2 T. Ground Cinnamon

Directions:
Section the apples using an appple corer/slicer (the round kind not the corer/pealer) Add 24 oz of water to the bottom of the steamer. I use a spaggeti cooker pot. Add the sliced apples (peal, core, and all) to the steamer basket and steam till very soft. They'll look like all puffed up. Run the steamed apples through a vegetable/fruit strainer. Add the water from the bottom of the steamer till the sauce is a thikness you prefer. Add the Splenda (sugar), Cinnamon, and Nutmeg and stir till mixed well. Transfer into canning jars, lightly install the seals and rings on the jars, and prosses for 20 minutes. remove from the canner and tightem the lids. Let cool to seal the jars.
