Description: 
I came across this recipe in a grocery store flyer just before Canadian Thanksgiving  I am not a pumpkin pie fan although the rest of the family is.   I should say they were  - the dessert is all gone but half of a pumpkin pie remains.  This will be a new tradition at our Thanksgiving table.
