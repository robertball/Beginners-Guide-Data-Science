Ingredients:
6 Flour Tortillas
1 lb Ground Beef
1 envelope Taco Seasoning Mix(I used the McCormick Mild)
1 Can tomato Sauce(8 oz)
2 Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese
1 1/4 Cups Milk
1 Cup Bisquick
2 Eggs

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Grease 13X9X2 inch  pan.  Line pan with tortillas(I cute them into a square and use the extra pieces to fill in the holes.  Cook ground beef, drain and add the taco seasoning mix and the tomato sauce.  Spoon over the tortillas.  Sprinkle with cheese.
Beat milk, eggs and Bisquick in blender on high speed for about 15 seconds(it really works).  Pour over beef mixture.
Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until knife inserted into center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes before cutting.  Serve with chopped tomato, shredded lettuce and sour cream if desired.
Recipe also calls for one medium chopped onion, but I don't put it in mine.
