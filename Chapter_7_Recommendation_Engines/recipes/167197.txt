Ingredients:
2 pints whole fresh strawberries
1 cup roasted peanuts, finely chopped
1 (16 ounce) container cream cheese frosting

Directions:
Wash and pat dry the strawberries with paper towels, leaving the green caps and stems intact.
Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper, and set aside. Place the finely chopped peanuts in a bowl, and set aside.
Heat the frosting in the microwave until warm and melted, 20 to 40 seconds. Hold each strawberry by the green top, and dip it straight down into the warm frosting, coating about 3/4 of the berry.
Gently roll the dipped strawberry in chopped peanuts, and place on the lined baking sheet to set up. Serve as soon as they have set.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite summer treats.  They are elegant enough for a Mother's Day brunch, but easy enough for a mid-week treat.
