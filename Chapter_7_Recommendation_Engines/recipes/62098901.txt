Ingredients:
3/4 cup uncooked brown rice
1 1/2 cups red lentils
2 T. oil
6 cups water
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 to 2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
2 tsp dried basil
1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 1/2 to 3 cups Italian breadcrumbs
2 eggs

Directions:
Heat 2 T oil in a heavy bottomed 4 quart saucepan.  Add the brown rice and cook until it is golden brown.
Add the lentils, water and salt and bring it to a boil.  Cook until the rice and lentils are tender and the water is absorbed.  Add water if needed but it should form a very thick mixture.
After cooking, let cool slightly and put the mixture in the bowl of a mixer or food processor.
Add eggs, bread crumbs, cheese, spices and mix well.  The mixture should be the consistency of meatball mixture.  Add breadcrumbs or cheese as needed for flavor and texture.
Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a frying pan.  Scoop 3 T of mixture and form into a patty about 1/4-1/2 inch thick.  Fry the patties until browned on both sides.  Drain on a paper towels and cool.  Store in airtight containers in the fridge or freezer.

Description: 
This is my original recipe.  My teenage vegetarian daughter devours these patties as snacks or made into a sandwich.  We use them for Chicken Parmesana or shaped them into meatballs served with spaghetti sauce and made Italian sandwiches with sauce and provolone cheese. They freeze well, also.
