Ingredients:
1.5 cups raw walnuts
2 cloves garlic
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano
1 T. finely chopped mixture of marjoram, thyme, oregano
Pepper
Salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil.
Add walnuts and cook for 5 minutes. Drain. This will help soften the walnuts and reduce a bit of their bitterness.
Add garlic cloves to mortar with a couple pinches of salt and grind to a fine paste.
Add blanched walnuts and chopped herbs and grind until fairly creamy, but still retaining a bit of coarseness for texture in the sauce.
When desired consistency is achieved, transfer paste to a medium bowl and slowly whisk in the olive oil.
Add more pepper and another teaspoon of salt.
Whisk in the heavy cream, and then the Pecorino.
