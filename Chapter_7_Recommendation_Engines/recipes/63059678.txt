Ingredients:
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 large egg
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray non stick spray onto mini bundt pan molds.
1. Mix flour, baking powder, 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl with a whisk.
2. Beat the egg, melted butter, milk, and vanilla in another bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened.
3. Spoon the batter into molds equally. This will fill 12 half muffin size bundt pans molds. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden.
4. While the donuts are baking, mix the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together.
5. When the donuts are done, remove them from the mold and roll them in the sugar and cinnamon mixture while they are still warm.
