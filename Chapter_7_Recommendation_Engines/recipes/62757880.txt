Ingredients:
3	pounds  russet potatoes , scrubbed
1	cup  heavy cream
6	tablespoons  unsalted butter , cut into 1/4-inch cubes and softened
1	large  egg  plus 1 egg yolk, lightly beaten
1 1/4	teaspoons  Salt
1/2	teaspoon  pepper
pinch  nutmeg
1/2	teaspoon  baking powder

Directions:
1. MICROWAVE POTATOES Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees. Meanwhile, prick potatoes all over with fork, place on plate, and microwave until tender, 18 to 25 minutes, turning potatoes over after 10 minutes.
2. MASH POTATOES Cut potatoes in half. When cool enough to handle, scoop flesh into large bowl and mash until no lumps remain. Add cream, 3 tablespoons butter, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and baking powder and continue to mash until potatoes are smooth. Let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Gently fold in remaining butter until pieces are evenly distributed.
3. PIPE AND BAKE Transfer potato mixture to piping bag fitted with Â½-inch star tip. Pipe eight 4-inch-wide mounds of potato on rimmed baking sheet. Spray lightly with cooking spray and bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve.
MAKE AHEAD Once piped onto the baking sheet, the potatoes can be covered loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerated for 24 hours. Remove plastic and spray lightly with cooking spray before baking.
