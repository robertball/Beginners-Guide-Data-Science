Ingredients:
Tomatoes, any sort, but best if not too juicy.
Salt and Pepper
Herbs (optional)

Directions:
Cherry tomatoes can just be halved, other tomatoes should be sliced into the size you want, and if very juicy, then scoop out some or all of the insides.
Place the prepared tomatoes on a baking tray (on paper if you want to cut down the clean up times), insides upwards.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Add any herbs you want, if you want.
Place the tray in the oven and turn it on to very low - around 65°C (150°F).
Go to bed and wake up in the morning to home-made "Sun-dried" Tomatoes.
Freeze as is, or store in a jar, covered with Olive Oil.
