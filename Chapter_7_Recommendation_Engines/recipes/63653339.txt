Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup spent brewers grains
1/4 cup flaxmeal
1/4 cup oat flour
1/3 cup buttermilk powder
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoons xylitol
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1-1/2 tablespoons canola oil
1-3/4 cups water

Directions:
Heat waffle iron
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, spent grain, flaxmeal, oats, buttermilk powder, baking powder, sugar substitute, cinnamon, and salt.
Make a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Add the eggs and lightly beat with a fork. Add 1Â½ cups water and the oil and mix well
Ladle some batter into the center of the waffle iron until it spreads to 1 inch from the edges
Cover and cook. As they are cooked, transfer the waffles to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. When you've used all the batter, place the cooled waffles on a baking sheet, and freeze until solid. Store in ziplock plastic freezer bag. Reheat straight from the freezer in a toaster or toaster oven.
