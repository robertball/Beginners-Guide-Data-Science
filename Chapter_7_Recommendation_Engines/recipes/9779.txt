Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup shortening
1/3 cup butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 ounces cream cheese
1/3 cup white sugar
1 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl beat shortening and  butter until softened.    Add the 3/4 cup sugar and beat until fluffy.   Add milk, egg and 1 tsp of the vanilla and  mix well.
In a separate bowl combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and beat until well mixed.
Divide dough in half and chill 2-3 hours or until easy to handle.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets.
Mix softened cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla until smooth.  Stir in the coconut.
Roll each half of the dough into a 10-inch square.    Cut each square into sixteen 2 1/2-inch squares.   Place 1/2 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.    Cut 1-inch slits from each corner to center of square.   Drop a level tsp of the coconut mixture onto each center.
Sprinkle chopped nuts in the center and firmly press to seal.  Bake for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm and cookies are slightly puffed.  Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute, then remove and cool thoroughly on rack.
