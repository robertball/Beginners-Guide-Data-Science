Ingredients:
½ cups Whole Wheat Flour
½ cups Rye Flour
½ cups Yellow Corn Meal
1 teaspoon Baking Powder
½ teaspoons Baking Soda
¼ teaspoons Salt
2 teaspoons Pumpkin Pie Spice
1 cup Buttermilk
½ cups Dark Brown Sugar (packed)
½ cups Pure Pumpkin Puree
½ cups Dried Cranberries, Chopped
½ cups Chopped Pecans
*Ready-To-Eat Cheesecake Filling

Directions:
Spray clean a 1-pound vegatable/fruit tin can genereously with nonstick baking spray and set aside.
Mix flours, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pumpkin spice in a large bowl.
Stir in buttermilk, brown sugar, and pumpkin puree until blended. Add dried chopped cranberries and nuts and throughly mix together.
Spoon batter into prepared tin can. Cover with foil and secure it with string.
Place can in the middle of a large pot. Pour boiling water into the pot till water reaches halfway up the can. Cover the pot and keep it boiling for 2 1/2 hours on high heat.
Periodically, check the can, making sure it does not shift. If necessary, move it back to middle, pour additional water to keep the level halfway up the can at all times.
When done, remove the can from the pot and let it cool (about one hour). Slowly invert the loaf onto a plate. Let it cool again for 30 minutes.
Turn the loaf on its side to slice 12 slices. Cut slices in half to make half moons. Spread 2 tablespoons of ready-to-eat cheesecake filling onto one side of the moon and make a sandwich.
Plate and serve! These can be served warm or cold.
