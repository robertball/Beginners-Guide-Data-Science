Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup honey
2 eggs
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and shredded
4 ounces Swiss cheese, shredded
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the honey and eggs. In a separate bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture; mix until combined. Fold in the apple, cheese and walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Turn the loaf out onto a wire rack and let cool completely.
