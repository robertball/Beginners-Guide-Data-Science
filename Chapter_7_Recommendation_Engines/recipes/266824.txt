Ingredients:
1 large orange, unpeeled
1 3/4 cups almond flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, softened
5 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place orange in a saucepan. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until orange is soft, about 30 minutes. Drain.
Cut orange into chunks and discard seeds.
Mix almond flour with 2 tablespoons sugar.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan and coat the pan with a handful of the almond-sugar mixture.
Combine orange chunks and 1 cup sugar in a food processor; pulse until pureed. Add almond flour mixture and butter; process until smooth. Add eggs; mix until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; process until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.

I found this recipe in an old magazine, decided to try it on a whim, and it soon became my family's favorite cake! Works really well as a side to coffee.
