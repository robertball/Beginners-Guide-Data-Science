Ingredients:
2 cups red wine
1/2 cup steak sauce (e.g. A-1)
3 oranges, sliced into rounds
1 bunch green onions, sliced
4 small red chile peppers, seeded and finely chopped
4 large cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
salt and pepper, to taste
3 pounds beef sirloin steak, boneless, cut across the grain into 1/4 inch strips

Directions:
Combine the red wine and steak sauce in a large bowl. Stir in the orange slices, green onions, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Place steak strips in a shallow dish and pour marinade over meat. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Set grate 4 inches from heat. Soak wooden or bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.
Remove steak from marinade, and discard; thread meat onto skewers. Arrange skewers on prepared grill, and cook until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
