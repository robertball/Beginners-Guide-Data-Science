Ingredients:
1 envelope onion soup mix
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 1/2 pounds ground beef
10 slices process American cheese
10 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine soup mix, ketchup, brown sugar, horseradish and chili powder.   Crumble beef over mixture; mix well. Shape into 10 patties. Grill, broil or pan-fry until the meat is no longer pink.
Cut eyes, nose and mouth out of each cheese slice to create a jack-o-lantern. Place cheese on burgers; cook until cheese is slightly melted, about 1 minute. Serve on buns.

Description: 
It's fun to 'carve' cheesy faces for these nicely seasoned burgers I served at my Halloween theme party. Hungry trick-or-treaters in our family welcome the hearty sandwiches...and they're a can't-miss entree for a casual holiday get-together. -Vicki Schlechter, Davis, California
