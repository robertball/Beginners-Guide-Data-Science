Ingredients:
8 eggs
1 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided
6 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package SmithfieldÂ® Cubed Ham

Directions:
Scramble eggs with water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs, stirring frequently, until scrambled to desired consistency.
Spread 1 teaspoon of butter over 1 tortilla and place butter-side down in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese over entire tortilla. Add 1/2 cup scrambled egg and 1/3 cup Smithfield(R) cubed ham to one side. Cook 3 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Fold the plain cheese side over the filled side and flip the quesadilla. Cook an additional 2 minutes or until golden and toasted. Cut into 2 or 3 pieces.
Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 5 more quesadillas.
