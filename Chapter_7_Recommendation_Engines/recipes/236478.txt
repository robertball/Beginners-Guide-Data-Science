Ingredients:
1 cup buckwheat groats
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 cup spelt flour
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup soy milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons oil
2 tablespoons honey (optional)
cooking spray

Directions:
Place buckwheat groats in a bowl. Pour boiling water over groats and set aside for groats to absorb water, about 10 minutes. Retain water if it doesn't all absorb.
Heat a skillet over medium heat.
Whisk flour, coconut, and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Beat milk, egg, oil, and honey together in a third bowl. Stir buckwheat groats mixture and flour mixture into milk mixture until just combined.
Spray skillet with cooking spray. Pour batter, 1/4 to 1/3 cup per pancake, into heated skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
These hearty pancakes are flavored with buckwheat and coconut. Don't expect a smooth-appearing cake. These pancakes appear lumpy because of the buckwheat groats.
 Even though these are wheat-free, they are not gluten-free! The honey may not be needed in the pancakes if you will be putting a sweet touch on the finished pancakes.
