Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 cake mix (any flavor)
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 (16 ounce) container Betty Crocker速 Rich & Creamy vanilla frosting
Food color, as desired
1 piece green peelable string licorice
1 jellied ring candy

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease bottoms and sides of two 9-inch round cake pans with shortening or cooking spray. Make cake mix as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Pour into pans.
Bake as directed on box for 9-inch round cake pans. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
Use serrated knife to cut one-fourth off each cake to form a straight edge about 7 inches long as shown in diagram (discard small pieces of cake or save for another use). Spread about 2 tablespoons frosting on bottom side of 1 cake. Place bottom side of other cake on frosting, matching cut edges. On serving plate or tray, stand cake, cut side down. Cover; freeze 1 hour or until firm.
In small bowl, mix remaining frosting and food color until desired shade. Frost cake.
Use peelable string licorice for handle and jellied ring candy for clasp. Decorate purse as desired with assorted candies. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
