Ingredients:
1 pound roll of hot breakfast sausage (like Jimmy Dean)
1/4 cup of butter
2 teaspoons of finely mined garlic
2 cups of water
2 cups of half and half
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup of quick cooking grits (not instant)
3 eggs
2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided
1 can diced green chiles
1 teaspoon hot sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish; set aside.
Brown the sausage in a skillet until cooked; drain and set aside. In the same skillet, melt the butter and then saute the garlic a couple of minutes until softened.
Replace half of the water needed to prepare the grits, with half and half.  Bring mixture to a boil, stir in the salt and grits, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring a couple of times; remove from the heat.  Beat the eggs in a small bowl and temper them by beating in a couple of tablespoons of the hot grits.  Add the tempered eggs to the grits. Stir in the butter and garlic, scraping all of it from out of the skillet, and 1-1/2 cups of the cheese.   Reserve the remaining cheese for later. Add the cooked sausage and hot sauce, and chiles, and stir the grits until everything is blended in well.
Turn out into the prepared baking dish and bake at 350 degrees F, for about 50 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top, and return to the oven for 10 minutes longer, or until cheese is lightly browned.
Cook's Notes: Make a Mexican version of cheese grits, by adding jalapenos, hot sauce and pimentos, and go queso by using Velveeta cheese and adding Rotel tomatoes.
