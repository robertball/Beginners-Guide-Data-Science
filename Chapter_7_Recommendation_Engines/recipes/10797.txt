Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup shortening
2 eggs
2 teaspoons orange zest
4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 egg white
2 teaspoons white sugar
3/4 cup candied citron peel
24 red candied cherries

Directions:
Cream together 1 cup sugar with  butter or margarine, and shortening.  Beat in 2 eggs and add orange peel.
Sift flour and gradually blend into sugar mixture.  Dough should hold together and not be crumbly.
Take a walnut sized piece of dough, and roll in palms of hand to create a 4 to 6 inch rope.  Bring ends together to form a circle, and fold ends over each other.  Brush with a mixture made from beaten egg white and 2 teaspoons sugar; this makes a glossy finish.  Add green citron slices for  "leaves" and 1/2 red citron cherry for" berry" - use to decorate at the knot.
Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) on ungreased cookie sheets for 10 to 12 minutes.  Bake only until cookies are light brown on bottom - just barely baked.
