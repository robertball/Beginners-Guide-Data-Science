Ingredients:
•	2 qts vegetable/chicken stock, or water
•	1 c red beans (soaked in water overnight)
•	1 c dry quinoa (or millet, or brown rice)
•	1 c dry pearl barley
•	1 packet Thai Red Curry paste (approx. 2 oz)
•	1 small can coconut milk
•	2 T fresh lime juice
•	1 stalk fresh celery chopped
•	1 medium red chili pepper sliced
•	6-8 large cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
•	2 T ground black pepper
•	3-4 T chicken bullion powder
•	1 fresh, red tomato  diced
•	1/2-1 fresh green pepper  seeds and core removed, diced into 1" pieces
•	2-3 T Mixed Italian herbs
•	2 T Chive, Onion, Garlic powder mixture
•	1 bunch fresh Green onion, washed  sliced from white to an inch or 2 of green (about ½ - 3/4 C)
•	1-1 ½ inches of fresh ginger, sliced thin

Directions:
Rinse the beans, quinoa/millet and barley to clean.
Add everything into the crock pot except the lime juice, coconut milk. Turn crock pot to high. (I stirred it once in a while, but it might not be necessary unless you really make it thick. Then stir to avoid scorching the beans, barley and quinoa.)
Cook for 4 hours, then add the Coconut milk and lime juice about 15 minutes before serving, stir briefly to mix.
Serve
If you want it thicker, add more barley or quinoa. I'm anxious to hear what others do with this recipe. It's fantastic - spicy, but I love it like that. Have fun!

Description: 
This soup began as something else that evolved as it was being cooked. After tasting it a few times, it needed something else. So, the Thai Red Curry paste, lime juice and coconut milk were added after cooking for 4 hours. That was the magic! Everyone who tried it was very satisfied, except one who didn't care for anything spicy. This isn't overpoweringly spicy, just enough heat tamed by the lime juice and coconut milk. Some things I've added at different times: Black rice, mung beans, sesame seeds, black beans, fava beans, wheat berry, fresh cilantro, diced pumpkin and diced winter squash.
