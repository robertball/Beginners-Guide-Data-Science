Ingredients:
2 lbs Italian sausage, casings removed (mild or hot)
1 small onion, chopped (optional)
3 -4 garlic cloves, minced
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 cups water (for a long period of simmering for flavors to meld. If you don't want to simmer it as long, add less)
3 teaspoons basil
2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4-1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon fresh coarse ground black pepper
1/4 cup red wine (a good Cabernet!)
1 lb thin spaghetti
parmesan cheese

Directions:
In large, heavy stockpot, brown Italian sausage, breaking up as you stir.
2
Add onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally until onions are softened.
3
Add garlic, tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce and water.
4
Add basil, parsley, brown sugar, salt, crushed red pepper, and black pepper.
5
Stir well and barely bring to a boil.
6
Stir in red wine.
7
Simmer on low, stirring frequently for at least an hour. A longer simmer makes for a better sauce, just be careful not to let it burn!
8
Cook spaghetti according to package directions.
9
Spoon sauce over drained spaghetti noodles and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
