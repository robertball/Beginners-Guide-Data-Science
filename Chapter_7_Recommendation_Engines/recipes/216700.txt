Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups cubed butternut squash
2 cups cubed turnips
1 cup thinly sliced celery
1 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 quart chicken stock
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/8 teaspoon ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the butternut squash, turnips, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until the vegetables just begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the chicken stock in a large pot over medium heat until simmering.
Transfer the vegetables to simmering stock, and add the bay leaf, honey, pepper, nutmeg, coriander, cayenne pepper, and salt. Continue simmering until all the vegetables are softened, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf before serving.

Description: 
Before you go 'yuck', give it a try! An abundance of turnips prompted me to find a different use for them.
