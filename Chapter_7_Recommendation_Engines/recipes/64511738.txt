2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 banana, mashed or sliced

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, add dry ingredients (oats, flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg). These can be mixed by hand or blended in food processor/blender if you want finer oats.
2. In a separate bowl, mix egg, milk, oil, and vanilla extract.
3. Add wet ingredients into dry ingredients and lightly mix
4.  Add and lightly stir in banana and walnuts
5. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat and let the batter sit for about 5 minutes.
6. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle.  Pancake is ready to flip when its edges have set and the bubbles forming on the surface have just started to pop. Flip and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes or until golden on the second side.
