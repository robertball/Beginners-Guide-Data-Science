Ingredients:
3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 2 cups frozen chopped spinach or collard greens)
Enough water to boil spinach
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3-4 tbsp. water

Directions:
If using raw spinach, rinse thoroughly.  Bring spinach and water to a boil in a medium pot.  Turn heat to low and allow to simmer for 10 minutes.  Drain.
If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.
Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked spinach, along with the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of water, and puree on high until as smooth as possible.  Stop occasionally to push top contents to the bottom.  If necessary, add the rest of the water to make a fairly smooth puree.
Store in the refrigerator for 2 days or freeze in 1/4 portions.
