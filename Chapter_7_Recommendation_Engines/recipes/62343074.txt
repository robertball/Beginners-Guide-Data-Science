Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand)
1/2 cup whey protein powder, vanilla
2 tablespoons ground flax seed
2 tablespoons Sucanat
2 tablespoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
2 cups almond milk (you can use soy milk if desired)
1 whole egg and 1/2 cup egg whites
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup frozen blueberries

Directions:
Preheat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.
In a large bowl, mix flours, Sucanat, protein powder, flax seed, baking powder and salt.
In a small bowl, mix oats and almond milk. Whisk in eggs. Pour into the flour mixture all at once, mixing just until combined. Gently fold in blueberries.
Pour batter about 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared griddle. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until bubbly. Flip, and continue cooking until lightly browned.

Description: 
I wanted these as a Sunday morning post-workout brunch, which means I needed more protein in it. I also do not use any refined sugar, so I substituted Sucanat (non refined cane sugar) for the brown sugar.Modified from: Oatmeal and Wheat Flour Blueberry Pancakes
