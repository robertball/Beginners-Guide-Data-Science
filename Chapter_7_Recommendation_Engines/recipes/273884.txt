Ingredients:
6  thin skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  green onions, sliced
1  red bell pepper, sliced
2 cups chicken broth
¼ cup dry white wine
¾ cup heavy cream
½ cup halved cherry tomatoes
½ cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
Pat chicken breasts dry and sprinkle with 1/2 the Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the very hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, until juices run clear when chicken is pricked with a fork and both sides are browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Add green onions and bell pepper to the drippings in the skillet. Cook until tender, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and wine and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Simmer until juices have reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes more. Add cream and continue to simmer to reduce slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cilantro, plus remaining Cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.
Add chicken to the skillet, cover, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes more.
