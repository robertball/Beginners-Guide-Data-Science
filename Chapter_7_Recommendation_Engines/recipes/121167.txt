Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups quick-cooking oats
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
Additional Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Pour oats into a wide-mouth 1-qt. glass container with a tight-fitting lid. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; place on top of oats. Layer with pecans, chocolate chips, brown sugar and sugar, packing each layer tightly (do not mix). Cover and store in a cool dry place for up to 6 months.
To prepare cookies: Pour cookie mix into a large mixing bowl; stir to combine ingredients. Beat in butter, egg and vanilla. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
Since half the fun of cookies is baking them, I give this merry-making mix as a gift. The ingredients look so pretty in a jar...and the cookies smell terrific coming out of the oven!
