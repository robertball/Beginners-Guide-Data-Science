Ingredients:
Almonds (whole).............10 minutes
Almonds (sliced)..........7-10 minutes
Chestnuts...................25 minutes
Hazelnuts................12-15 minutes
Macadamia................12-15 minutes
Peanuts..................20-25 minutes
Pecans...................10-15 minutes
Pine Nuts....................5 minutes
Walnuts..................10-15 minutes

Directions:
OVEN METHOD: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the nuts, in a single layer, on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned and fragrant. Cool pan on a wire rack.
STOVETOP METHOD: Heat a large, dry skillet on medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add a single layer of nuts. Stir frequently with a spatula until the nuts turn golden brown and fragrant. Remove from the heat and from the skillet to stop the cooking.
MICROWAVE METHOD: Spread a single layer of nuts on a microwave-safe plate. Cook the nuts on full power, at 1 minute intervals, stirring between minutes,  until the nuts have a crisp crunch and a toasted flavor and have become fragrant. You will not get the golden brown color that you get with the oven or stovetop methods, but this will do in a hurry.
