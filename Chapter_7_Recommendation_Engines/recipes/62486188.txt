Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
1 cup sour cream
1(4 serving) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1(18-ounce package) spice cake mix
5 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease a 10-inch tube pan. Combine cake mix, instant pudding, sour cream, eggs, and vegetable oil and beat together well. In a separate bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon, and pecans. Pour half of batter into prepared pan (this cake would work well in individual bundt pans. As the size of bundt pans vary, I can't say how many it will make with your pan size. I would guess 4-6. Cooking time will decrease of course. Same temp but check after 30 minutes) and sprinkle with sugar mixture, reserving a little to sprinkle on top. Pour the rest of batter into pan and sprinkle with the rest of sugar mixture. Bake 1 hour. Let cool and remove from pan.
