Ingredients:
1 lb ground Italian sausage (can do sweet or hot whichever your family prefers)
1/2 lb ground sirloin
1 onion diced
3 cloves garlic minced
2 14.5 oz cans Italian style diced tomatoes
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
1 tsp. brown sugar
1 32 oz carton chicken broth
1 tsp basil
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
Diced green pepper (optional)
1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)
Broken lasagna noodles (or package of frozen cheese tortellini)
Shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Brown Italian Sausage, ground sirloin, garlic and onion - strain grease. Add Diced tomatoes,tomato sauce, brown sugar, chicken broth, basil and parmesan cheese. Simmer on low for 20 min. In separate pot prepare pasta according to package directions, add to soup. Serve topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. NOTE: if you are going to freeze or refrigerate keep pasta separate from soup or it will absorb all the liquid - still tasty - but loses the "soup" quality.

Description: 
Tastes just like Lasagna but without all the work! One of our families favorite recipes this tastes even better the second day. I love to serve it with garlic bread and a ceaser salad.
