Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup vanilla Greek-style yogurt
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 cup chopped strawberries, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat and grease a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk buttermilk, yogurt, butter, eggs, and sugar together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Fold strawberries into batter.
Pour about 1/3 cup batter into preheated waffle iron; cook until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
