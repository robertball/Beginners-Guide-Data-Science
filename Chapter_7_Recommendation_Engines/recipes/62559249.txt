Buttery Crispy Special Roasted Potatoes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut in half
1 tsp sea salt, plus more to taste
1/2 cup butter
1/4 tsp pepper
Optional, rosemary or thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water, and add 1 tsp sea salt.  Bring to a boil, and cook until not quite tender, about 12-15 minutes. Drain.
In a small roasting pan (should JUST fit the potatoes) place 1/2 cup of butter.  Put the potatoes in, and break up butter with a spoon into pieces surrounding the potatoes.  Season with salt and pepper, and herbs if using.
Bake, uncovered, "basting" the potatoes with the butter every so often and turning them over, for about 40 minutes.  If they start to look dry, add a bit more butter.
Turn on the broiler, and broil until tops are crispy and golden brown.  Enjoy!
