Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can premium white-meat chicken, packed in water, drained
1/3 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 tablespoons basil pesto sauce, divided
Vegetable oil spray
1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough
1 cup fresh asparagus cut in 1-inch pieces, or canned, cut asparagus, drained
1 cup chopped, fresh red bell peppers (roasted*) or canned, roasted red bell peppers, drained
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 ounce feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Brown chicken with onion and garlic in olive oil in a medium, non-stick skillet. Remove from heat; blend with 2 tablespoons pesto sauce; set aside.
Lightly coat a 9x12-inch baking sheet or a 14-inch pizza stone with vegetable oil spray. Press or roll dough onto baking sheet or pizza stone to desired thickness. Spread remaining 2 tablespoons pesto sauce over dough, leaving a 1-inch edge. Arrange chicken mixture, asparagus and roasted red peppers on top. Sprinkle with cheeses. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until cheeses melt and crust is lightly browned.
