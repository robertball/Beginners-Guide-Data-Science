Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon milk, or more as needed (optional)
3 fresh nectarines - peeled, halved, and pitted, or more to taste
1 (6 ounce) container fresh blackberries, or more to taste
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and salt gradually and mix in well. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Combine flour and baking powder, sift, and quickly beat into the batter on low speed. Thin batter with a little milk if needed. Pour batter into the prepared springform pan. Arrange nectarines and blackberries on top in a decorative pattern.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy cake with fresh nectarines and blackberries. I like to arrange the fruit in the shape of a flower or some sort of pattern. You can use peaches or blueberries as well.
