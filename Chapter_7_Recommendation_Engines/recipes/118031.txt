Description: 
This sassy southwestern-style entree stars a blend of corn, black beans, sweet peppers and zesty stewed tomatoes that's spooned over brown rice. 'I like to serve it for lunch,' writes Sandra Shafer of Mountain View, California. 'It's also tasty made with salsa instead of the tomatoes.'
