Melt the butter and cream cheese in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the flour, milk, and jalapenos. Cook until the mixture reaches a pudding-like consistency.

Description: 
This casserole with corn, jalapenos, and cream cheese is similar to another one on this site, but much better. This side can go with any Mexican dish and many more. I even made it as part of our Thanksgiving dinner.
