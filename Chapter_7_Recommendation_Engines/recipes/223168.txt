Description: 
Super simple yet delicious and beautiful, this grape tomato salad rounds out any meal adding loads of bright red color and tantalizing flavor. Sweetened rice vinegar adds a bit of sugar and acid, and the olive oil helps the body to absorb the lycopene in the tomatoes. Hint: replace the oregano with another dried spice that compliments your meal.
