Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) ham steak, chopped
1 cup KRAFT 2% Milk Shredded Cheddar Cheese
1 cup frozen broccoli cuts, thawed, drained
1 cup frozen cauliflower florets, thawed, drained
2 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup PHILADELPHIA Chive & Onion 1/3 Less Fat than Cream Cheese
1/2 (14.1 ounce) package ready-to-use refrigerated pie crust
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.
Combine first 5 ingredients. Microwave cream cheese spread in microwaveable bowl on HIGH 1 min. or until completely melted, stirring every 15 sec. Add to ham mixture; mix well. Spoon into 4 (8-oz.) ramekins.
Unroll pie crust on lightly floured surface; roll to 12-inch circle. Cut into 4 rounds with 5-inch cookie cutter. Cut leaves from about 1/4 of the trimmings with small cookie cutter or sharp knife; discard remaining trimmings.
Beat egg and water with fork until blended; brush onto top edges of ramekins. Top with pastry rounds; press gently onto top edges of ramekins to seal. Top with leaf cutouts; brush lightly with egg wash. Discard any remaining egg wash. Place ramekins on baking sheet. Cut slits in crusts to vent.
Bake 30 to 32 min. or until golden brown.

Description: 
Warm ham and cheese go together like broccoli and cauliflower. And we've put that in the mix, too. Our hearty, creamy pot pie looks restaurant-worthy and tastes even better.
