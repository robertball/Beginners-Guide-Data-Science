Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup prepared horseradish
2 pounds kielbasa sausage, sliced thin

In a slow cooker combine the sugar, ketchup and horseradish. Add the sausage, and mix well. Cook on High until it starts to boil.  Reduce heat to Low, and cook until sauce thickens, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
Kielbasa, also called kielbasy or Polish sausage, is a spicy sausage usually made with pork (though beef is sometimes added). It comes in chunky links, and is sold precooked. I haven't met anyone yet who didn't like this dish. I even like it and I really don't care for kielbasa that much! Another bonus is that it is easy to make, and is yet another recipe for your slow cooker.
