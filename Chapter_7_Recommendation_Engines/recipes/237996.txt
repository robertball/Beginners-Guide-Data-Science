Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup finely grated carrot
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups chicken broth
3/4 cup half-and-half
3/4 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi
1 1/2 cups chopped cooked chicken
3/4 cup shredded fresh spinach
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
Melt butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, carrot, and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into vegetable mixture; cook and stir until vegetables are evenly coated and flour is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
Pour chicken broth, half-and-half, and milk over vegetable mixture; cook and stir until mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and stir gnocchi, chicken, and spinach into broth mixture; season with rosemary, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg. Cook soup over low heat until gnocchi become tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
