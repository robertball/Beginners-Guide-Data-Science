4 boneless pork loin chops, cut 1/4 inch thick
4 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler. Place the pork chops on a broiling pan and set under the broiler. Cook for about 5 minutes, turning once, or until browned on each side.
Open the French rolls and lightly toast. Spread mayonnaise on the insides. Place one of the cooked pork chops into each roll. Spread chile sauce directly on the meat. Sprinkle with a little lime juice and top with slices of marinated (Vinegar, sugar, salt) onion, cucumber, carrot, cilantro, salt and pepper. Finish with another quick drizzle of lime juice.
