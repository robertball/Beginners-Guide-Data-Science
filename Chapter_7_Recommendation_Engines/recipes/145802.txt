Description: 
Being an enthusiastic Philadelphia Eagles football fan, I wanted to create a burger recipe that had a taste of Philly, and some green ingredients, as a tribute to the Birds. If you like cheeseburgers, melt your favorite cheese, and eat! We love to load ours onto potato rolls and add lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles. As my sister says, 'Don't forget the bacon!'
