Ingredients:
1/2 pound spaghetti
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound prawns, peeled and deveined
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 tablespoons tequila reposado
1 cup heavy cream
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
salt to taste
1 cup fresh spinach
black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add prawns and garlic; saute until prawns are opaque, about 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low; add tequila and spinach. Cook until alcohol evaporates, about 3 minutes.
Combine cream, chipotles in adobo, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour over prawns, stir, and simmer over low heat until everything is well heated (do not boil), about 3 minutes.
Toss pasta in the sauce until well combined and serve immediately with freshly ground pepper and Parmesan cheese.
