Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 small onion (diced)
2 garlic gloves (mined)
1 tbsp canola oil
1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
1 can (8oz) tomato sauce
1 can (12 oz) tomato paste
1 tbsp basil
1 tbsp oregano
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tbsp ground black pepper
2 tsp red pepper flakes
1 cup beef bouillon broth
1 box of your favorite type of noodles

Directions:
Heat to medium-high.
Add oil, diced onion, minced garlic, and ground beef to pan. Cook until meat is brown, but not over done.
In separate pot, add the rest of the ingredients (diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, brown sugar, black pepper, and beef bouillon).
Once beef is browned, drain liquid from the pan and add the meat, onion, and garlic to the pot with everything else.
Turn pot to high heat until boiling. Then cover, put on low heat, and simmer for 45 minutes.
While sauce is simmering, cook any noodles you desire.
Eat sauce over noodles
