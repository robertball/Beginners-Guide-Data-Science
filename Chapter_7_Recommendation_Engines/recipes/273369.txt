Ingredients:
1 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
1 2/3 cups milk
3 eggs
1 cup brown rice flour
1 cup almond meal
1 cup cornmeal
1/3 cup quinoa flour
1/4 cup polenta
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat together sweetener, butter, water, and flaxseed meal using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until creamy. Pour in milk and eggs; mix well. Add brown rice flour, almond meal, cornmeal, quinoa flour, polenta, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined and smooth.
Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 22 to 27 minutes.

Description: 
I had to experiment a lot to get this perfect, fluffy, and wholesome cornbread recipe, but I finally came up with one I like! Not only is it delicious, but it's gluten-free and uses Splenda® instead of sugar. If you'd like to use natural sugar instead, it will work just fine. A little bit of polenta gives it a really nice corn flavour on top of the cornmeal. The almond meal lowers the carb count, too! Enjoy! Cover with foil for the last 7 minutes of cooking time to avoid over-browning the top!
