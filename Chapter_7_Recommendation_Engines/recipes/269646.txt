Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 onion, diced
1 celery stalk, diced
1 carrot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken stock
1 butternut squash, peeled and cubed
1 small turnip, peeled and diced
1 small sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat until just bubbling and beginning to smell nutty, 1 to 3 minutes. Add onion, celery, and carrot; cook until onion is soft and translucent, another 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic directly to the bottom of the pot and cook for about 1 minute before stirring; be careful to prevent burning. Add chicken stock, butternut squash, turnip, and sweet potato and bring to a boil. Cover pot and simmer soup until sweet potato is fork tender, about 40 minutes.
Puree soup using a stick blender to desired consistency. Season to taste with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and black pepper.

A delicious, warming squash soup with other fall vegetables and spices is perfect for a cold day. Light enough to serve as an appetizer, but delicious enough to make a main dish. Serve hot with a hearty slice of toast.
