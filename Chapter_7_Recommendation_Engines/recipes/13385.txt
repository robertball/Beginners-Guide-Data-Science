Ingredients:
2 cups cucumber - peeled, seeded and shredded
2 tablespoons grated onion
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of celery soup
2 cups cottage cheese
2 cups buttermilk
1 pinch seasoning salt

Directions:
Grate cucumber and onion, and strain out liquid.
In a blender, mix cream of celery soup, buttermilk, cucumber and onion mixture.  Blend, add one cup of cottage cheese and blend again.
Since the blender may not hold all of the ingredients, pour half of blended mixture into a bowl.  Add remaining cottage cheese and blend.  Combine all soup into one bowl and stir in seasoning salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
