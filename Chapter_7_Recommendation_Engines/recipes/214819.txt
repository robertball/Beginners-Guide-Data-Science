Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup sucanat
1/2 cup grapeseed oil
1 cup half-and-half cream
1 1/2 teaspoons rum flavored extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 lime, zested
1 tablespoon minced fresh spearmint
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 3x7-inch loaf pans. Whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl; set aside.
Beat the eggs, sugar, sucanat, grapeseed oil, half-and-half cream, rum extract, vanilla extract, lime zest, and spearmint with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until just moistened, then stir in the blueberries, and pour into the prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle the tops evenly with the turbinado sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I love mojitos and had some blueberries to use.  Since I was in a baking mood rather than a cocktail mood, I created a way to use those flavors in a quick bread.  We love it.
