Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
4 carrots, diced
4 stalks celery, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, finely diced
4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
3 cups milk, at room temperature
12 ounces freshly shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Place cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and blend until finely chopped.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Pour in broth and cauliflower; increase heat to high. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk milk in slowly and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add Cheddar cheese slowly until completely combined.
Pour broth from cauliflower mixture into an electric blender and puree to your desired consistency. Return to the saucepan. Pour cheese sauce into soup and stir well to combine.
Serve in bowls and garnish with additional Cheddar cheese, if desired.
