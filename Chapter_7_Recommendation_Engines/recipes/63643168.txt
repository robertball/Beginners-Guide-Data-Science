Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) pkg al frescoÂ® Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage, sliced thin, on the bias
2 lb yellow onion, sliced thin
1 tbsp thyme, fresh, chopped
1/4 white wine
1 (large) apple, sliced thin
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 (12 oz) Tandoori style naan
10 (slices) Brie, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375&deg; F.
In a large skillet coated with olive oil, cover and sweat onions over medium high heat. Stir periodically so that the onions do not stick and burn on the bottom of the pan. After 20 minutes, remove cover and add the fresh thyme and white wine. Continue to cook for an additional 10 minutes until the onions are well caramelized. Onions should cook down by about 1/2 in volume.
Top each naan with 1/2 cup of caramelized onions, then with the thinly sliced apples in a circular pattern. Top each apple slice with a slice of the Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage. Finish with slices of brie (about 2 1/2oz on each pizza).
Bake on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes or until cheese is bubbly hot. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Slice each naan using a pizza wheel into 6 slices. Serve as an appetizer or hors d'oeuvre.
