Ingredients:
8 cups fresh spinach
1/2 lb bacon diced
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons brown mustard
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 red onion, very thinly sliced
2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Clean spinach by washing removing stems (important to remove stems as they are bitter).  Chop and place spinach in a large serving bowl.
In a small bowl mix sesame oil, red wine vinegar, brown mustard, brown sugar, and salt, set aside until later.
Fry diced bacon until crisp.  Remove bacon and place on paper towels to dry, retaining bacon grease in skillet.  Place onion in hot bacon grease and fry until limp, about 3-4 minutes. Remove onions and drain on paper towels with bacon.  When dry, add to bowl with spinach.
Heat bacon grease and add dressing. Bring to a boil. Pour hot dressing over spinach. Toss immediately to coat all the leaves with hot dressing, wilting the spinach.  Cover and let sit until ready to serve.
To serve, sprinkle  with hard-boiled egg and season with black pepper.

This was a favorite of mine when growing up.  I have since made it my own and maybe even have improved on it (sorry Mom).
