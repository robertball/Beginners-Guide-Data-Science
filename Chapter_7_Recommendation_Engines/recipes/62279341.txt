Description: 
This is a family recipe passed along by my late cousin David.  It is so simple...just four ingredients thrown in the slow cooker!  Not only is it great to come home to a hot delicious meal...your home will smell wonderful too!  It is great with the extra gravy spooned over egg noodles or mashed potatoes.Modified from: Cousin David's Slow Cooker Brisket
