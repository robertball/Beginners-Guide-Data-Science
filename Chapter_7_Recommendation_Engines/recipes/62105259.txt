Ingredients:
Buns
2/3 cup butter
1 pkg yeast
1 1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp cardamom (I use green, but black works, too)
1/2 cup sugar
6 cups flour
4 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
Filling and topping
marzipan
whipped cream
milk
icing sugar

Directions:
Melt butter in warm saucepan, let cool till just warm to the touch
Put yeast in bowl; add butter, milk and egg.  Stir to dissolve yeast.
Add salt, cardamom, sugar, and 5 cups flour.  Work into dough.  Place in warm spot and let rise for 1/2 hour.
Mix baking powder with remaining flour and work into dough.  Knead until smooth.
Form into 24 small balls, or 16 larger ones.
Place on greased baking sheet, cover, and let rise 35-40 minutes.
Bake in 480 F degree oven for 10 minutes.
Cool on wire rack.
Cut off circular top piece from bun. Set aside
Scoop out interior to make a hole.
Combine marzipan with bread, and add enough milk to make a smooth mixture.
Spoon into holes in buns.
Pipe whipped cream on top of filling.
Sprinkle reserved tops with icing sugar and place on top of whipped cream.
Serve in shallow bowl of warm milk, or as is with coffee.

Description: 
These Swedish desserts are served, traditionally, on Fat Tuesday, but, nowadays, they are happily eaten as often as they can be found.

We love that these are not too sweet, and are just big enough.
