Ingredients:
3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth, divided
1/3 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar or cider vinegar
2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 pound boneless pork loin chops, cut into thin strips
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 cups broccoli florets
3 medium carrots, sliced
3 celery ribs, sliced
4 cups shredded cabbage
6 green onions, sliced
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a bowl, combine 1/4 cup broth, soy sauce, vinegar, honey and garlic powder; mix well. Pour 1/3 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add the pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Drain and discard marinade from pork. In large nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry pork in oil for 2-3 minutes or until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm. In the same pan, stir-fry broccoli and carrots in reserved marinade for 2 minutes. Add celery; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add cabbage and green onions; stir-fry 2-3 minutes longer or until vegetables are crisp-tender.
Combine cornstarch and remaining broth until smooth; stir into vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened. Return pork to the pan; heat through. Serve over rice if desired.
