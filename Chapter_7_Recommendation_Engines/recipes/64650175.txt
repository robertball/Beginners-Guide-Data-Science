Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust
2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup key lime juice

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine condensed milk, sour cream, and lime juice. Mix well and pour into graham cracker crust.
Bake in preheated oven 5 to 8 minutes at 350 degrees, if desired, to let pinhole bubbles burst ( I didn't bake my pie).
Chill pie thoroughly before serving. Garnish with lime slices and whipped cream if desired.
