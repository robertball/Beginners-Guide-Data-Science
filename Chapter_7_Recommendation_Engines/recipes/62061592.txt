Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp table salt
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
3 oz buttermilk
3/4 cup cornflake crumbs
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast(s), four 4 oz pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ÂºF. Lightly coat an 8 X 8 X 2-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.  Combine flour, salt and cayenne pepper together in a medium-size bowl. Place buttermilk and corn flakes crumbs in 2 separate shallow bowls.  Roll chicken breast halves in flour mixture and evenly coat each side. Next dip chicken into buttermilk and then corn flakes crumbs.  Place coated chicken breasts in prepared baking dish. Bake until chicken is tender and no longer pink, about 20 minutes (there is no need to flip the chicken during baking). Yields 1 breast per serving.
