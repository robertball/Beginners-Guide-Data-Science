Ingredients:
Waffles:
1 1/2 C pur√©ed sweet potatoes
2/3 C milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 Tbsp melted butter
1 1/2 C all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp brown sugar
1 1/2 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp ginger
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp salt
Syrup:
1 C maple syrup
1/2 C cranberry sauce
1/2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
1. Preheat waffle iron.  In medium mixing bowl, mix together sweet potatoes, milk, egg, and melted butter.
2. In large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and salt.  Add wet ingredients to dry and stir to combine.
3. Cook batter in waffle iron according to waffle maker instructions. (My waffle maker takes 1/3 C batter per waffle and cooks for about 3 minutes.)
4. In small saucepan, combine syrup, cranberry sauce, and cinnamon.  Cook over medium heat until warmed through and combined.
