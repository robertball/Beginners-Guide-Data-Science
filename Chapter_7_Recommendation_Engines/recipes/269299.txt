Ingredients:
2 cups dried elderberries
2 cups distilled water
1/2 cup dried rosehips
1/2 cup dried hibiscus flowers
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 cinnamon stick
6 whole cloves
8 tablespoons grass-fed gelatin (such as Great LakesÂ®)
1 cup raw, local honey
12 ounces pureed strawberries

Directions:
Combine elderberries, distilled water, rosehips, hibiscus flowers, ginger, cinnamon stick, and cloves in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes.
Strain mixture through a sieve into a bowl, squeezing all juice from berries. Discard solids. Return liquid to the saucepan over low heat. Sprinkle gelatin on top and whisk until dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool until mixture is warm but no longer hot. Stir in honey or pureed strawberries until dissolved.
Immediately pour mixture into fun-shaped silicone molds a 9x13-inch baking pan lightly greased with coconut oil.
Refrigerate until hardened, about 30 minutes. Remove gummies from molds or cut into pieces. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator
