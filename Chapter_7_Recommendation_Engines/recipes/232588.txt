Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2/3 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, halved
1 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup cooked shrimp
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Heat 2/3 cup olive oil and garlic in a skillet over medium-low heat until garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard garlic cloves.
Toss bread crumbs with about 2 tablespoons garlic olive oil in a bowl and spread bread crumbs over a baking sheet. Pour remaining garlic olive oil over spaghetti and toss to coat.
Bake bread crumbs in the preheated oven until toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread crumbs to the bowl with spaghetti and toss.
Melt butter in a clean skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shrimp, rosemary, and basil until shrimp is coated and heated through, about 5 minutes. Toss shrimp with spaghetti mixture and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.
