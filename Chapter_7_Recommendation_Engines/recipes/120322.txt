Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 tablespoon butter or stick margarine
1 tablespoon grated onion
8 ounces reduced-fat ricotta cheese
1 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 egg whites
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain. Mash potatoes with butter and onion until small lumps of potato remain; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat ricotta cheese, sour cream, salt, garlic powder, rosemary and pepper until smooth. In a small bowl, beat egg whites until frothy; fold into cheese mixture. Fold into potato mixture.
Generously coat muffin cups with nonstick spray; evenly sprinkle muffin cups with bread crumbs. Fill with potato mixture; smooth tops. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 27-30 minutes or until edges of potatoes are lightly browned. Cool for 15 minutes. Loosen timbales from sides of muffins cups; invert onto a baking sheet to remove.
