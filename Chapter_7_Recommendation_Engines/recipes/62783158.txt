Ingredients:
1/4 cup cajun (Old Bay) seasoning, or to taste
2 lb. raw shrimp, unpeeled
1 lb. spicy pepper sausage links (sliced into rounds)
2 lb. king crab legs (4 bunches)
1 lb. small red potatoes
12 pearl onions
2 stalks (1 1/2 cup) celery, chopped
2 cups baby or chopped carrots
4 ears of corn

Directions:
Bring 6 quarts (1.5 gallon) water to boil in large stewing pot, add old bay seasoning
Add potatoes, boil for 15 minutes
To avoid fishy flavor: bring separate pot of water to a boil, add old bay to taste and cook crab legs for 10 minutes
Add carrots, celery, and onions; continue boiling 10 minutes
Add sausage and corn, continue boiling 5 minutes
Add shrimp and transfer crab, turn off heat. *The key is to not overcook the shrimp! They should not be in boiling water longer than 2-3 minutes.
Serve in large bowls, as a stew. Peel shrimp and crab as you eat.
