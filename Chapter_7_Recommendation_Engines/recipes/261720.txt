Ingredients:
olive oil
1/2 pound leeks, cleaned and chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 green onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced (optional)
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/3 head green cabbage, chopped
1/4 eggplant, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1/4 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed (optional)
1 clove garlic, minced
water to cover
1 Roma tomato, chopped

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add leeks, celery, red onion, green onion, jalapeno, basil, and rosemary. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage, eggplant, carrots, tofu, and garlic. Add water to cover. Bring soup to a boil uncovered.
Cover soup partially; reduce heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are almost tender, about 20 minutes. Add tomato. Cook until vegetables are fully tender, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt.

Description: 
This delicious vegan vegetable soup uses lots of vegetables in a tasty, light broth, easy to adapt to your personal taste! Suggest adding cooked basmati rice when serving to make a complete meal.
 This will need salt and tastes better the second day. Also, cooking and prep time may not be entirely accurate. I invented this soup at 1 am - I'm a college student - but it is delicious.
