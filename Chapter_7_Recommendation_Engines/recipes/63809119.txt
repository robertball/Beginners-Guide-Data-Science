Ingredients:
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 pounds green beans, washed and ends trimmed (use a variety of beans if desired)
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
3/4 cup coarsely chopped pecans
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of water with 2 teaspoons of salt to a boil.
Add the green beans and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and refresh under cold running water. Drain.
In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat.
Add the pecans, Worcestershire sauce, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and the black pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the pecans are golden brown and fragrant, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the green beans and cook, stirring, until well coated and warmed through, about 1 minute.
Remove from the heat and serve.
