Ingredients:
3/4 cup rye bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1/3 cup evaporated milk
1/4 cup thousand island salad dressing
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 (12 ounce) can corned beef, flaked
1 (8 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained and chopped
1/2 pound ground chuck
1 (9 inch) deep-dish pie shell
4 ounces shredded Swiss cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix bread crumbs, egg, evaporated milk, salad dressing, onion, mustard, salt, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl; add corned beef, sauerkraut, and ground chuck and mix well.
Spread about half the meat mixture into the pie shell and top with about half the Swiss cheese; repeat layers. Put pie crust on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until the crust is browned and the cheese is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This was one of my favorite dishes growing up. I thought it was lost forever until I recently came across it in my mother's recipe collection. It's a reuben sandwich in a pie shell!
