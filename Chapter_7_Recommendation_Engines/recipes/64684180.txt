Ingredients:
1-1 lb baguette sliced into 10-12 slices
Extra virgin olive oil to spread on baguette
4-5 ounces goat cheese (softened to room temperature)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2-3 oz. of finely sliced almonds ( I use a truffle slicer or you can buy store package for convenience) Save a few for garnishing.
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, minced (save some for garnishing)
2 to 3 tablespoons honey (use a quality one please...it does make a difference)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Place baguette slices on a baking sheet and brush with olive oil. Bake for 2-3 minutes or until crisp but not brown. Remove from oven.
In medium mixing bowl, mix room temp goat cheese, ground cinnamon, sliced almonds and minced rosemary to a creamy spread blend.
Spread goat cheese on slices evenly and place back in oven and bake for another 3-4 minutes or until cheese is soften.
Remove from oven and drizzle with honey and garnish with some of remaining almonds and rosemary
Serving immediately best to enjoy...(I enjoy anytime though)

Description: 
I love, love...goat cheese. That said, this goat cheese spread is fantastic on sliced baked Baguettes, crostini, Triscuit crackers, spread on celery stalks or even just by the spoon (yes, I did say that)!
