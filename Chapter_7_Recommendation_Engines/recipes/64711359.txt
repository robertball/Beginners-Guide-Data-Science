Ingredients:
1 cup panko
1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp packed brown sugar
2/3 cup plus 1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/4 tsp ground ginger
Pinch of ground cloves
5 stalks rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups)
1 pint strawberries, halved
1 tsp fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup roughly chopped almonds
4 Tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for the skille
Ice cream, for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Whisk the panko, brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the cinnamon, allspice, ginger and cloves in a medium bowl until combined. In another bowl, toss the rhubarb and straberries with the remaining 2/3 cup granulated sugar and the lemon juice to coat.
Butter a cast iron skillet (or shallow 8-inch baking dish). Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the breadcrumb mixture in the bottom of the skillet. Top with the rhubarb, then sprinkle with the remaining crumbs and the almonds. Dot with the cut-up butter.
Cover and bake for 20 minutes. Remove cover and bake an additional 10 minutes or until top is golden brown. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Serve warm and top with ice cream.
