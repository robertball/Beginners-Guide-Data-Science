Ingredients:
2 cups canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Stir together the chickpeas, lemon juice, olive oil, brown sugar, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, garam masala, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and salt in a mixing bowl. Spread the chickpea mixture in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until the chickpeas are dark brown in spots, crisp, and have shrunk quite a bit, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway through the cooking time. Cool to room temperature before serving.
