Ingredients:
2 pounds turkey breast
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups fat-free sour cream
1 (10.75 ounce) can 98% fat-free condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup milk
1 cup water
1 (12 ounce) package lasagna noodles
1 (15 ounce) can green beans
1 (14 ounce) can whole-kernel corn
1 (12 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add turkey, garlic, salt, and pepper and cook until turkey is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Dice turkey into small pieces.
Combine sour cream, soup, milk, and water in a mixing bowl and whisk sauce until combined.
Layer 1/3 of the lasagna noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with 1/2 of the turkey, green beans, corn, and stuffing mix. Cover with 1/3 of the sauce mixture. Add another layer of noodles and repeat. Add a top layer of noodles and remaining sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until noodles are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Add Cheddar cheese and return to the oven until cheese melts and starts to bubble, 5 to 10 minutes more.
