Ingredients:
250g dark chocolate (70-80% cocoa parts)
100g butter
150g caster sugar
150ml water
4 egg yolks
500ml double cream

Directions:
Break up the chocolate and place with the butter in a MWC on Low for 5-10 minutes or warm-ish oven for about 15 minutes. Remove and stir until melted and blended together.
Over a low heat dissolve the sugar in the water then turn up the heat and boil rapidly for a few minutes to get a light syrup. It's ready before the syrup takes any colour. Leave the mixture to cool for just a minute.
Whisk the egg yolks in a basin, trickling in the hot syrup. Continue whisking until the mixture is thick and mousse-like.
Whisk in the cream. Then fold in the melted chocolate and butter until thoroughly blended.
Pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen. Transfer to plastic container and place in the freezer for an hour before serving.
