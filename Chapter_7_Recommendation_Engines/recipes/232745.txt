Ingredients:
1 pound thick-cut bacon
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's® Honey)
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserve about 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon and transfer to a slow cooker.
Cook and stir ground beef and onion in bacon drippings in skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer ground beef mixture to the slow cooker.
Mix brown sugar, barbeque sauce, ketchup, mustard, molasses, liquid smoke flavoring, black pepper, and chili powder in a bowl; pour over ground beef-bacon mixture. Stir well. Add baked beans, kidney beans, Great Northern beans, and pinto beans; mix well.
