Ingredients:
25 oz cheese ravioli, fresh or frozen
1 TB EVOO
1 large shallot, chopped (about 2 TB)
3 (about 1 1/2 lbs) summer squash (yellow or green), thinly sliced
1 cup heavy cream
1 TB grated lemon zest, about 2 large lemons
1/2 cup grated pecorino or Parmesan, 2 oz

Directions:
Cook the pasta according to pkg directions.  Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water; drain pasta and return to the pot.
Meanwhile, heat the EVOO in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the squash and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper to the skillet.  Cook, tossing often, until the vegetables are just beginning to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the cream and lemon zest and cook until the vegetables are tender and the cream is slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the squash mixture, grated cheese, and 1/2 tsp salt to the pasta and toss gently to coat.  If mix seems too dry then add some of the reserved cooking water until at desired consistency.
Serve sprinkled additional grated cheese and lemon wedges.
