Ingredients:
12 Figs
Feta Cheese
Balsamic Vinegar
Agave Nectar or Honey

Directions:
Cut the Figs in half, place on a pie pan.
Sprinkle Feta on the individual halves
Drizzle Agave Nectar to taste, I drizzle quickly and not to sweet
Drizzle Balsamic Vinegar, again, a couple of Table spoons, but I eyeball it and go for taste.
Place pie pan in a 350 degree oven and cook for about 15 minutes to melt the cheese.
Enjoy.
