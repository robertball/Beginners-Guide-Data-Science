Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup quick-cooking rolled oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup low fat milk (2% or less M. F.)
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/3 cup NUTELLA®
2 bananas, sliced

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together whole-wheat flour, oats, all-purpose flour, and baking powder well. In a smaller bowl, whisk together eggs, buttermilk, milk, brown sugar, and vanilla until sugar is dissolved.
Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and whisk just to combine.
Heat a non-stick griddle or fry pan sprayed with cooking spray over medium heat. Spoon small dollops of batter (approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons) onto the pan and cook until small bubbles appear on the edge of the pancake and surface appears slightly dry; flip and cook the other side until lightly golden brown.
Spread each pancake with a little NUTELLA(R). Layer a few slices of banana on each pancake and then stack three or four of them one on top of the other.
