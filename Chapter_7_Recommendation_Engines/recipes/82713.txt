Ingredients:
4 sprigs fresh rosemary
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/4 inch thickness
4 slices smoked fontina cheese
4 slices prosciutto
½ cup white wine
½ cup chicken broth
¼ cup olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
4 cloves garlic, halved
salt to taste

Directions:
Use a knife or grater to sharpen the thick ends of the rosemary sprigs. Soak sprigs in water for at least 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Layer each chicken breast with 1 slice fontina and 1 slice prosciutto. Roll tightly, and skewer each with a rosemary sprig to secure.
In a bowl, whisk together the wine, broth, oil and pepper. Pour into a medium baking dish. Place rolled chicken breasts in the dish. Place 2 garlic halves under each breast.
Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until chicken juices run clear. Remove from baking dish, reserving sauce, and allow to stand 5 minutes.
Transfer remaining sauce to a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Drizzle over chicken to serve. Season chicken with salt to taste.
