https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup (5 oz) almond/vanilla bark (alternatively use chocolate, if desired)
4 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup very hot water
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla, I prefer clear vanilla extract to keep the icing white
food coloring, optional

Directions:
Melt chocolate/bark in microwave using 30 seconds bursts. Heat for 30 seconds, stir well, repeat as needed to melt. Usually complete in only 2-3 cycles for me.
Add powdered sugar, hot water (heat in mug in microwave covered w plastic wrap!), corn syrup, vanilla and stir until well combined and smooth.
Let cool enough to handle.
Quickly dip cakes with a fork/spatula or spoon over cakes and allow to cool.
If icing gets too thick while sitting, heat 30 seconds and stir.
