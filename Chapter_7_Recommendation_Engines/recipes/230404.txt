Ingredients:
1 rutabaga, peeled and cut into spears
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 sprigs fresh rosemary, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine rutabaga spears with oil, minced rosemary, garlic, and salt.  Toss until evenly coated.
Lay rutabaga spears onto a baking sheet, leaving space between for even crisping. Bake until rutabaga fries are cooked through and crisped on the outside, about 30 minutes.
