Ingredients:
Dal:
1/2 cup yellow dried split peas (chana dal)
1 cup red lentils (masoor dal)
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch sea salt
1 pinch asafoetida powder (hing)
water to cover
Tarka:
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Place split peas in a container. Cover with water. Let soak, at least 2 hours. Drain.
Combine split peas and red lentils in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Season with turmeric, sea salt, and asafoetida. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, until dal is the consistency of porridge.
Heat ghee and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin; cook until starting to pop, about 30 seconds. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until tarka is very dark brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve tarka over dal.
