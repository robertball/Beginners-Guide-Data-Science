Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/4 cup water
1 (10 ounce) bag chopped fresh spinach
2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, liquid reserved
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 (7 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and sesame seeds; cook and stir until garlic is tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Heat water in another skillet. Add spinach. Cook and stir until spinach is wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Place the garbanzo beans into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Add the spinach, artichokes, and garlic mixture. Blend to desired consistency, pouring in reserved garbanzo bean liquid as needed. Spoon mixture into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until chilled. Top with roasted red peppers before serving.

Description: 
This is my new twist on hummus. We love spinach artichoke dip and hummus so I tried to make a more delicious spinach artichoke dip by adding it to hummus. I served with homemade pita chips.
