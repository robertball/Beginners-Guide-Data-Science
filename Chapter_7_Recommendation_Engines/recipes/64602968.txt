Ingredients:
• 2 pound boneless beef chuck shoulder roast
• 2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces

• 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
• 1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce
• 1 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

• 2 cups of beef broth – NOT NEEDED UNTIL DAY OF COOKING

Directions:
PREP
1. Label your freezer bag.
2. To your freezer bag, add all ingredients except beef broth. Add beef roast
to the freezer bag last so it’s the first ingredient poured into your crockpot.
3. Remove as much air from the freezer bag as possible, seal, and lay flat in
your freezer.
COOK
1. The night before cooking, move frozen bag to your refrigerator to thaw.
2. The morning of cooking, pour contents of freezer bag into your crockpot
and add beef broth.
3. Cook on “low” setting for 8-12 hours, or until beef shreds easily and carrots
are soft.
4. Shred beef and serve.
