Ingredients:
6 1/2 c flour
2 t baking soda
1 t salt
1 c shortening
2 c sugar
2 eggs
1 t vanilla
1 c sour cream
For glaze:
1 1/2 c powdered sugar
2 T milk
1 t almond or vanilla extract
Food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Consider making a half batch. Seriously.
Preheat oven to 375
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt; sift.
In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, sugar, eggs, and vanilla; beat for 2 minutes. Mix in the sour cream.
Add the flour mixture (it is easiest if added in increments). Dough will be thick.
Form into a ball; refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.
Roll out dough to 1/4" thickness on a surface sprinkled with powdered sugar (to prevent sticking); cut out desired shapes.
Bake at 375 for 9 minutes, or until light brown on the bottom.
Glaze: Combine powdered sugar, milk, and extract. Spread on cooled cookies.
