Ingredients:
4 1" thick pork chops
1 med onion, thinly sliced
4 cups apple sauce
1 cup white wine
3 tbs butter
S&P;

Directions:
In a large skillet, place the seasoned pork chops on med-high heat.
In the spaces between the chops, add the butter and onions.  Saute the onions while the first side of the chops cook.  Don't burn the chops, but don't worry if they get the pan brown.
When the chops are done halfway through, turn them.
When the second side is just done and the onions have some good color, add the white wine to deglaze the pan.
When the brown bits are incorporated, add the apple sauce, and simmer until the alcohol burns off, and the liquid thickens somewhat.
Serve with the apple onion mix on top of the chops.
