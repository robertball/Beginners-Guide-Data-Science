Ingredients:
4 tablespoons of butter
2 medium sweet onions, sliced
2 chicken boneless chicken breast
Tuscan seasoning
1 colored bell pepper, sliced thin (I used orange)
4 ounces of sliced portabella mushrooms
1 large tomato sliced in bits sized pieces
garlic powder
Salt and ground pepper

Directions:
In medium cast iron pan melt butter over medium low heat (4 setting) and add onions, cook about 20 minutes until half caramelized.
Move onions over making a place for the two chicken breast, season both sides of the breast with my Tuscan seasoning.
Cover the chicken with mushrooms, bell pepper slices and top with the tomatoes. Sprinkle with more of the seasoning, garlic powder, coarse sea salt and ground pepper. Cover pan with aluminum foil and bake on grill at 375Â° for about 50 minutes. I did uncover the   dish for the last five minutes, but really doesn't need it.
