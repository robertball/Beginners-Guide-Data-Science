Description: 
This is a good way to make a wholesome weeknight dinner or weekend lunch.  The dish is flavorful and hearty and REALLY easy to make. The herbs make this taste like it is harder than it is- we LOVE a spicy sauce so we add lots of red pepper flakes.  The cream cheese makes the sauce richer. A house salad and a loaf of crusty bread make this a complete meal.
