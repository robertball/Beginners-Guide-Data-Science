Ingredients:
3/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 clove garlic, coarsely chopped, or more to taste
1 pasteurized egg
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 pound bacon
1 head romaine lettuce, torn
1/2 red onion, sliced
6 fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 (6 ounce) package croutons

Directions:
Blend mayonnaise, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, egg, black pepper, and seasoned salt in a blender until smooth. Refrigerate for flavors to blend.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.
Mix romaine lettuce, bacon, onion, mushrooms, and croutons in a large bowl. Pour dressing over salad; toss to coat.
