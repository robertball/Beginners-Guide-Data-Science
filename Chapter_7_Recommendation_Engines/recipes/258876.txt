Description: 
A quick, low-meat, low-cost yet delicious meal. I came up with this while living in Japan where meat is very expensive. This is a very forgiving recipe and I've made many substitutions over the years, such as garlic instead of onion, cabbage instead of napa, and even made omissions when low on ingredients and every time it turns out fine.
