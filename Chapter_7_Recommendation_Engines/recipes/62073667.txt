Ingredients:
4 Reg. size cloves of garlic
4 Tbsp of oil
1 pinch basil
2 cans white corn
2 cans black beans
2 cans diced tomatoes (I use petite diced.)
1 can of green chiles
3/4 bunch of green onion
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. ground cumin
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
(You can also use 1/2 green pepper chopped, if the taste suits you.)

Directions:
Begin by pressing or chopping the garlic. Then cook the garlic, oil, basil together by either sautaing, or roasting on a stone at 350Â° for 10 mins.
While the garlic is cooking, pour the corn, beans, tomatoes and chiles in a sauce pot (at least 2 qt.) and keep the juice from 1 of the cans of corn and both cans of tomatoes and the chiles.
Chop green onions, keeping the white onion, and 2/3 of the green stalk. Add.
Add spices.
If you choose, add the green pepper, chopped, now.
When garlic is done, add to the mixture in the pot.
Turn burner to Med. low and let simmer for 30 mins.
Refrigerate for atleast 1 hour (best served cold.) or top a southwestern chicken/fish dish.
