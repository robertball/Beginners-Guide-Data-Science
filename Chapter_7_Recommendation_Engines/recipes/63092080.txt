Ingredients:
1 loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
2 tbsp melted butter (I use 3)
2/3 c brown sugar
1/2 c chopped walnuts or pecans
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/3 c. heavy cream
2/3 c. sifted confectioner's sugar
1 tbsp milk (I use 2)
dash vanilla

Directions:
roll dough to a rectangle, about 18X6".
Brush with melted butter.
Combine brown sugar, chopped nuts, and cinnamon.
Sprinkle over dough.
Starting at long edge, roll dough up, jelly roll fashion; moisten edges and seal.
Cut roll into 20 slices.
Place rolls, cut side down, into two lightly buttered round cake pans.
Let rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled.
Pour the cream over the rolls and then bake at 350 for 25 min.
Combine confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla.
Drizzle over rolls while still warm
