Ingredients:
12 oz. Pasta
2 Tbsp Butter
2 Tbsp All-purpose Flour
2½ Cups Light Cream or 2½ Cups Heavy Cream
½ Cup Parmesan Cheese
½ Cup Romano Cheese
Five or Six Baby Carrots (optional)
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in the medium-sized pot, and add baby carrots if you are using them.
While you are waiting for the water to boil, put ¼ cup of butter into a small pot and melt it. Add flour once it is all melted, and mix it in thoroughly.
Then, add light or heavy cream and mix that to create a creamy white sauce. Once you have an even white sauce mixture, add each cheese and mix thoroughly.
Add the pasta of your choice to the medium-sized pot once the water is boiling, and cook it until it is al dente. Depending on the type of pasta you use, the boiling time will vary.
Strain pasta, put it in a bowl, and pour the sauce mixture over it.

Description: 
This recipe is my all-time favorite, and this particular version, believe it or not, was my first attempt at my own sauce! I think I used too much flour in the sauce pictured, but it still wasn't too bad! This is a super-clean version of Alfredo sauce. That is, there's nothing in it but a roux and cheese!!
