Ingredients:
3 cups sugar
1 1/2 cups butter or margarine
6 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup apple cider
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
ICING:
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream sugar and butter. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir together all dry ingredients; set aside. Combine cider and vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with cider mixture to batter. Mix until well blended. Spoon into a greased 10-in. angel food cake pan or fluted tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for about 1 hour and 10 minutes or until cake tests done. Meanwhile, combine all icing ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. While cake is warm, drizzle 1/2 of the icing over cake. Serve remaining icing over individual cake servings, if desired.

Description: 
Fall in New England is so beautiful, and the apple cider here is the best! This recipe is a family favorite and I like to serve it with hot cocoa.
