Ingredients:
1 lb hamburg
1 Italian sausage link
rice, 1 bag rice made
garlic powder, season to taste (I like a lot)
onion powder, season to taste
1 can diced tomatoes, with or without spices, don't drain.
1 onion chopped
6 green peppers, remove tops and clean out seeds.
1/2 c. tomato sauce for topping
cheese of choice for toppings (I used taco cheddar since I had it in my fridge)

Directions:
Fry onion, hamburg & sausage together. Remove from heat. Drain.
Add diced tomatoes with it's liquid & rice, stir well. Add garlic & onion powder to taste.
Allow to cool. Once cooled fill peppers with your hands, it's cleaner & quicker than using a spoon. Also less likely to split the peppers. Just my opinion. : )
Bake in 350 oven for 1 hour. After 55 minutes add cheese for topping. Remove from oven when melted.  Before I added the cheese I also added 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce onto each pepper.
