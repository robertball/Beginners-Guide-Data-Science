Ingredients:
1/2 cup vinegar
1 tablespoon whole allspice berries
2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste
3 pounds beef chuck roast
3 bay leaf
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup cold whipping cream

Directions:
In a large glass bowl or dish, stir together the vinegar, allspice berries, and water with some salt and pepper. Cover and marinate the meat in the mixture overnight in the refrigerator.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the meat in a roasting pan with the marinating liquid, bay leaves and onion.
Cover, and roast for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, or until the roast is fork tender.
Let the roast sit, and remove 1/3 cup of the meat juices to a saucepan. Stir together the cornstarch and heavy cream, and stir into the meat juices. Add 1 cup of water, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently until thickened. Do not allow the mixture to boil. This will be your gravy to put over dumplings, potatoes or meat.
