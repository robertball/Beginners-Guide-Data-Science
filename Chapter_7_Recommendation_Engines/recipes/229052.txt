Ingredients:
7 ounces gluten-free gingersnap cookies, finely crushed
1/4 cup margarine, melted
2 pounds chevre (soft goat cheese) at room temperature
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 eggs, room temperature
3/4 cup coconut milk
8 ounces cultured coconut milk (coconut milk yogurt)
1 tablespoon gluten-free vanilla extract
1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
Combine gingersnap crumbs with melted margarine and mix well. Press crumb mixture into bottom of prepared pan; place pan in the freezer.
Beat chevre and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the cheese mixture before adding the next. Mix in coconut milk. Add coconut yogurt, vanilla extract, and gluten-free flour; mix just until incorporated.
Pour cheesecake batter into chilled crust and bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn oven off and allow cake to cool in oven with its door closed for at least 2 hours. Refrigerate for an additional 4 to 6 hours before serving.

Description: 
A gluten-free, soy-free, cow dairy-free New York cheesecake that has that decadent mouth-feel. I have served it several times without anyone noticing it wasn't the REAL STUFF. At a recent party my husband mentioned that he had not had cheesecake for 20 years because of his allergies so this became my goal and voila! Enjoy!
