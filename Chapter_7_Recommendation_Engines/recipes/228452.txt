Ingredients:
1/2 cup fine bulgur
6 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped
1/2 onion, minced
5 bunches Italian parsley, minced
1/2 bunch fresh mint leaves, minced
1 bunch green onions, minced
Dressing:
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Wash and rinse bulgur until runoff water becomes clear. Place prepared bulgur in a large bowl. Add tomatoes to bowl; stir to combine. Allow mixture to sit until bulgur absorbs tomato juice and expands, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Add onion, parsley, mint, and green onions to bowl. Stir to combine.
Mix together tomato paste, vegetable oil, and lemon juice in a bowl, stirring until thoroughly combined. Add dressing to salad; mix to coat. Season with salt, ground black pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.

Description: 
This tabbouleh is as authentic as you can get! It's a compilation of recipes I've taken from my mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, and various cookbooks. This can be served on romaine lettuce leaves for garnish. Also, I've noticed that this recipe tastes even better the next day, so don't hesitate to make it the day before your guests arrive.
