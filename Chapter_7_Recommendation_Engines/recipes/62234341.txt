Ingredients:
1 apple, tart, sliced
1 t lemon juice
1 1/2 T margarine
1/8 cup brown sugar
1/8 t salt
1 t cinnamon

Directions:
Core, peel and slice apple.  I used 'slicer' then cut each 'slice' in half.  Toss with lemon juice.
In a cast iron skillet,  over medium heat, melt butter.
Lay apples evenly over skillet bottom.
Sprinkle brown sugar, then dash of salt.
Let cook for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle with cinnamon, and cook until apples are tender and juicy.
Mine took about 3 to 4 minutes tops.
