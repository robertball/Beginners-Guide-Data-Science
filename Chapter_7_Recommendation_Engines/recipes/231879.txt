Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 small eggplant, peeled and diced
1 small onion, finely diced
2 tablespoons dried mint
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 loaves French bread, cut diagonally into 1-inch slices
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Mix tomatoes, eggplant, onion, mint, basil, and garlic powder in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid has evaporated, about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet.
Toast bread slices in the preheated oven until crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Let cool slightly.
Spoon tomato mixture onto each toasted bread slice; sprinkle with goat cheese.
Broil in the preheated oven until goat cheese is lightly browned, about 4 minutes.
