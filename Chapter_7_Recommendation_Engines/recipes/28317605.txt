Ingredients:
4 squares semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, chopped
6 Tbsp (3 ounces) unsalted butter, cut in pieces
3/4 Tsp pure vanilla extract
2 Tsp light corn syrup
1 1/3 cups icing sugar, sifted
1/2 cup sour cream, room temperature
1 Tsp hot water

Directions:
Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl placed over a saucepan of simmering water.
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and corn syrup.
Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time (at this point the frosting will be quite thick).
Place the frosting in the bowl of your food processor and, with the processor running, gradually add the sour cream and hot water. Process until the frosting is nice and shiny.
