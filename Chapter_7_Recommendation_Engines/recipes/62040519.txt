"Poor Man" Paella Recipe

Ingredients:
-Extra Virgin Olive oil (optional)
-2 to 2-1/2 lb assorted sausages, sliced 1/4 inch thick for the thicker sausages and 1/2 inch for the thinner sausages. (I like to use 1 or 2 each Knockwurst, Mild or spicy Italian, and 3 or 4 each of breakfast links and hotdogs. NOT cheese-filled sausages, they ooze. Use whatever your family likes best.)
-6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs cut in quarters
-1 large onion, chopped
-2 cloves garlic, minced
-3 cups long-grain rice (I personally prefer Parboiled because I don’t like sticky rice)
-6 to 7 cups chicken stock (I sometimes use 3 or 4 chicken bullion cubes when I don't have stock.)
-pinch saffron  (optional)
-salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, quickly brown sausages and chicken, stirring frequently until golden. (add a little olive oil only if it’s not a non-stick pan, otherwise don’t bother…there will be enough grease in there soon enough.)  Add onions and garlic and continue to cook, stirring frequently until soft.  Add rice, stir until well coated.  Stir in 6 cups water or stock and saffron, if using.  Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
2.Bring rice mixture to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer gently adding more stock if necessary, for about 20 minutes or until rice is soft but not dry .  Try not to stir during cooking.
3. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I threw this together one day when I didn’t know what to make for supper.  I jokingly call this the “Poor Man’s” paella…when you’re too poor to pay for the seafood.
