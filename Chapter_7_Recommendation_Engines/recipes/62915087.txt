Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 1/2 cups flour
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 can crushed pineapple
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut
Glaze:
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup cream
2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Beat sugar and eggs together well. Add vanilla and pineapple. Mix. In seperate bowl, mix dry ingredients (not including coconut) together. Add to batter and mix well.
Pour into large cookie sheet. Sprinkle coconut over top, and bake at 350 degrees approximately 20-30 minutes or until golden and done (check for doneness by inserting toothpick. If it comes out with batter stuck on it- bake longer. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cake is done). Cool.
Meanwhile mix all glaze ingredients in a small pot. Bring to almost boiling point, stirring almost constantly. Remove from heat. Let glaze cool just enough to thicken a wee bit. Pour over cooled cake, and set in refridgerator (or freezer) to cool (so the glaze can set). Cut into portions, serve, and enjoy.

Description: 
These squares were often made by my very own mother at home, and I remember them being a popular sweet treat. I now make them for my family, and they are a favorite with almost everyone (everyone who likes pineapple, that is)! :)
