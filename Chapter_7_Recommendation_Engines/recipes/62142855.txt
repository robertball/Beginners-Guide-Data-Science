Description: 
I live in Nebraska and the loosemeat style sandwich has been a small town, Midwest staple for as long as I can remember. My mom gave me this recipe, which she has had in her recipe box for ages. It nails the restaurant recipe on the head. It's perfect for simmering on the stove, ready to eat when your family and friends are hungry.
