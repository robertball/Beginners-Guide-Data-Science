Description: 
Cupcakes are all the rage these days. A friend gave me this absolutely scrumptious recipe. These vanilla cupcakes are so yummy with or without the buttercream frosting, and so easy. Much better than using a packaged cake mix! Use icing at room temperature because it will set when it's chilled. Icing can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
