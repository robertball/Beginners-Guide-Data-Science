Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
1 teaspoon minced parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup dry bread crumbs
6 tablespoons butter
4 slices lemon

Directions:
Place each veal cutlet between two pieces of plastic wrap, and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. Dip in flour to coat.
In a medium bowl, stir together the Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg and milk. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture, then press in the bread crumbs to coat. Place coated cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded cutlets until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a serving platter, and pour the pan juices over them. Garnish with lemon slices.
