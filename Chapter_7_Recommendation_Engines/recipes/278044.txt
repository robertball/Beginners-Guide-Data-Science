Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
2 pounds raw shrimp, headless and shells on
1 head garlic, peeled and minced
4 teaspoons Cajun seasoning, or to more taste
1 loaf French bread, sliced
1/4 cup butter, softened, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place butter pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish and let melt on the middle oven rack.
Carefully remove the hot baking dish from the oven, stir in minced garlic, and return to the oven until fragrant, about 1 minute, being very careful that garlic does not brown. Remove from the oven.
Add shrimp to the baking dish. Stir until well coated in garlic butter and sprinkle with Cajun seasoning. Return to the oven and bake until bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp and garlic butter to a serving bowl.
Spread bread slices with softened butter and place on a cookie sheet.
Bake bread in the oven until butter is melted and top crusts of bread are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This garlic and shrimp recipe is delicious. It's a snap to assemble. This recipe will soon be a family favorite. The true way to eat this dish is to leave the shrimp unpeeled and slurp the butter out and then peel the shrimp and eat them. Personally, I like to peel our serving of shrimp into a bowl, drizzle the peeled shrimp with the seasoned garlic butter, and eat with a big chunk of crusty bread for dipping. However you eat it, you will love it!
