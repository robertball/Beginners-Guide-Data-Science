Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (or 2 1/4 tsp)
1 tsp honey (or sugar)
1 cup warm water (about 110 degrees)
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 1/2 cups bread flour (AP will work in a pinch)
2 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp Italian Seasoning (divided
1 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic salt
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees
Line baking pans with parchment paper
In the bowl of your mixer dissolve yeast and honey in warm water. Let sit until creamy, about 10 min.
Stir in flour, salt, oil, Parmesan cheese and 1 tsp of the Italian seasoning. Beat until smooth and the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Let rest (about 5 min.)
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, and pinch off about 3 tbsp worth off. Roll into a log shape. Place on baking sheet.
Bake for about 13-15 min until just golden brown.
While bread sticks are baking mix butter, garlic salt and the remaining Italian Seasoning.
Brush butter mixture onto bread sticks and bake for an additional 3 min. until golden brown and delicious.
