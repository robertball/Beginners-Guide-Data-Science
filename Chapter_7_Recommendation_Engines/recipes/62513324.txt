1 Cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 Cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 Tablespoons cream sherry

Directions:
In a heavy 5 or 6 quart saucepan, combine sugars, salt, cream sherry, orange zest and orange extract. Stir. Take about 5 minutes to bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil one minute. Add butter, and stir to blend well. Remove from heat and add walnuts. Toss nuts well until coating sets. Turn out walnuts onto a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil. Spread out and cool about an hour. Divide nuts into bite sized chunks, and store in airtight container.
