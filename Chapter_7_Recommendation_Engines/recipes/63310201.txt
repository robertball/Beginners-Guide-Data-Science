Ingredients:
4 pounds potatoes, peeled
15 slices bacon
1 (16 ounce) container reduced-fat sour cream
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons dried parsley
8 chopped baby carrots
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and allow to cool to room temperature. Dice once cooled.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Allow to cool, and crumble the bacon into a large bowl.
Place the cooled potatoes into the bowl with the bacon, and mix in the sour cream, mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, chives, salt, and pepper. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
