Ingredients:
2 pounds beef oxtail
1 clove garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
2 tablespoons bacon drippings or shortening
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups broth from cooked oxtails
2 dashes browning sauce
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Place oxtails, garlic, onions, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, Greek seasoning, and seasoning salt in a large stock pot. Fill with enough water to cover oxtails, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil. Cover, and reduce heat to medium. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove from heat, and reserve 2 cups broth.
Warm bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in flour, and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in broth and browning sauce. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook, stirring constantly, until gravy thickens. Remove from heat.
Place oxtails in skillet, and stir to coat with gravy. Return to stove, and cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Description: 
This recipe was my mom's. It's a soul food blast from the past. I adjust spices to my personal taste (I love lots of spices). Double the gravy recipe if you like lots of gravy. My family loves this dish served with rice.
