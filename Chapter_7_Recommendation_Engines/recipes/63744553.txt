Remove from marinade and give a little shake and lay on a plate.
Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat then add in oil. When oil is hot place fish skin-side down in skillet. Cook until opaque and firm to touch, about 3 minutes per side.
Flake the fish or cut into small portions, squeeze one of the lime wedges over the top, and toss to coat.
