2 cups diced cooked chicken, or more to taste
1 cup dried cherries

2 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon champagne vinegar
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and rinse under cold water.
Combine chicken, cherries, celery, almonds, and pasta together in a large bowl. Whisk mayonnaise, confectioners' sugar, water, vinegar, poppy seeds, salt, and black pepper together in a separate bowl; fold dressing into chicken-pasta mixture.
