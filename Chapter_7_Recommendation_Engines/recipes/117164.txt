Ingredients:
1 egg
3 egg whites
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons finely chopped green pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup torn fresh spinach

Directions:
In a small bowl, beat the egg and egg whites. Add cheeses, salt, pepper flakes, garlic powder and pepper; mix well. Set aside.
In an 8-in. nonstick skillet, saute the mushrooms, green pepper and onion in oil for 4-5 minutes or until tender. Add spinach; cook and stir until spinach is wilted. Add egg mixture. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Cut into wedges. Serve immediately.

Description: 
'I lightened up this savory dish by using olive oil, one regular egg and three egg whites, explains Arlene Hammonds of Gray, Tennessee. 'For a change of pace, I like to mix diced celery and parsley with different cheeses.'
