Ingredients:
Chocolate Crumbles
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 cup sugar
2/3 cup good-quality cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
CRUST
3/4 of the chocolate crumb recipe above
2 teaspoons sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 to 2 tablespoons of melted butter
Banana Cream
2 very ripe bananas. [We are talking about black/brown bananas here. Tosi says this makes all the difference in the world.]
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 egg yolks
2 gelatin sheets (or 1 teaspoon powdered gelatin)
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon yellow food coloring
3/4 cup heavy cream
1 cup powdered sugar
1 just-ripe (yellow) banana, sliced

Directions:
Combine all crust ingredients in a mixer until it starts to come together. Bake 300 for 20 min, on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Cool and use for crust.
Mix  3/4 of the chocolate crumb recipe above, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Press into
Combine the ripe bananas, 1/3 cup heavy cream, and 1/4 cup milk in a blender & puree until totally smooth. Add the next section of ingredients--the sugar, cornstarch, salt, & egg yolks and blend. Pour into a medium saucepan. Clean out the blender.
Bloom the gelatin. (To bloom sheet gelatin, soak it in a small bowl of cold water for 2 minutes. Gently squeeze to remove any excess water before using. To bloom powdered gelatin, sprinkle it evenly onto the surface of 2 tablespoons of cold water in a small dish or cup. Allow to soften for 3-5 minutes.)
Dump the contents of the pan into the blender. Add the bloomed gelatin and butter and blend until smooth and even. Color the mixture with yellow food coloring until it is bright yellow. Tosi realizes that this is a lot of coloring, but says, "banana creams don't get that brilliant yellow color on their own. Womp," which I think is a good enough argument for food coloring as any.
Transfer the mixture to a heatsafe container & chill in refrigerator for 30-60 minutes or until completely cooled.
Using a whisk or a mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the cream and powdered sugar to medium-soft peaks. Add the cold banana mixture to the whipped cream and slowly whisk until evenly colored and homogenous. (Stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container, this will stay fresh for up to 5 days.)
Assembly!
Pour half the banana cream into the chocolate pie shell. Cover with a layer of sliced banana and then cover that with the remaini
