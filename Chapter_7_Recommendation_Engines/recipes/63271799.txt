Ingredients:
2 Tbs. olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 medium onion, chopped fine
1 cup uncooked rice
2 Roma tomatoes, peeled and chopped
2 tsp. chili powder
2 cups chicken stock
3/4 tsp. salt, or to taste

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil.  Saute the onion over medium heat until softened.  Add the garlic,  rice, tomatoes, and chili powder, and saute another couple of minutes, stirring to coat all the grains of rice with oil.  Pour in the stock, add the salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat, cover the pan, and simmer the rice for 15-18 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed.  Remove the pan from the heat, and let the rice steam, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a well-seasoned version of Spanish rice that is a fine complement to Southwestern main dishes.  Bonus, it's even better the next day, so sometimes I double the recipe!
