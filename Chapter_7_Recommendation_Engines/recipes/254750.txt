Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped parsley, or to taste
2 green onions, chopped, or to taste
1 pound lump crabmeat, picked over for pieces of shell
1 1/2 cups coconut milk
1 tablespoon palm oil (optional)
2 tablespoons bread crumbs
1 dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
clean scallop shells
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, green bell pepper, parsley, and green onions; cook until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add crabmeat; cook until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.
Pour coconut milk and palm oil into the skillet. Cook until slightly reduced, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in bread crumbs to give mixture a paste-like consistency. Season with hot pepper sauce, salt, and black pepper.
Stuff scallops shells with the crab mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top. Arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
