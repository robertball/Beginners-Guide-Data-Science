Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 lemons, zested and juiced, divided
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
12 ounces fresh blueberries
For Glaze:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup hot water
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper liners.
Stir flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, oil, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a medium bowl. Stir into the flour mixture until just moistened. Fold in blueberries. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling them about 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer muffins onto a wire rack to cool for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, butter, hot water, vanilla extract, and remaining zest in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine.
Dip cooled muffin tops in glaze. Cool until glaze firms up, about 10 minutes. Dip muffins a second time.
