Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 cups chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned and chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups boiling water
1 cube chicken bouillon
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 dash ground white pepper
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Heat butter and oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over low heat. Add onion and garlic, cover, and cook until soft, about 20 minutes.
Increase heat to medium and stir in chanterelle mushrooms. Sprinkle with flour and pour in boiling water, stirring constantly. Season with chicken bouillon, bay leaves, thyme, white pepper, and nutmeg and bring to a simmer. Cover and simmer until mushrooms are soft and flavors are well combined, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove bay leaves. Puree chanterelle soup with an immersion blender until smooth.

Description: 
Chanterelles have a lovely mellow flavor and a beautiful light-orange color. If you can't get your hands on chanterelles, really any other wild mushroom or store-bought chestnut mushrooms will do. Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche or sour cream.
