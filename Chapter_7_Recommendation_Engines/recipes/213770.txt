Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
Salt and pepper
1 teaspoon butter
2 tablespoons tomatillo salsa, warmed
2 tablespoons chopped ham

Directions:
Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper in bowl until blended.
Heat butter in nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot.  Pour in egg mixture. As eggs begin to set, gently pull the eggs across the pan with an inverted turner, forming large soft curds.
Continue cooking--pulling, lifting and folding egg--until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains.  Do not stir constantly. Remove from heat.
Top eggs with tomatillo salsa and ham. Serve immediately.
