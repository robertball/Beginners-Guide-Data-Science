Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved or quartered
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 slices bacon
2 teaspoons lemon zest (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 15x10-inch baking pan with foil.
Place Brussels sprouts into the prepared pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper; toss to coat.
Roast in the preheated oven until Brussels sprouts are crisp-tender and brown, stirring every 5 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes total.
While the Brussels sprouts are roasting, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble when cool enough to handle.
Drizzle roasted Brussels sprouts with remaining 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with crumbled bacon and lemon zest.
