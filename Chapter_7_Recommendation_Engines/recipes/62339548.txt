Ingredients:
1 tsp caraway seeds
1 pound sack sauerkraut, drained
1 cup beer or apple cider
1/4 cup spicy brown grainy mustard (I use country dijon)
1 long folded link kielbasa
softened butter for bread
8 slices marble rye bread
8 slices Emmentaler or Swiss (or Muenster)
1/2 cup sweet red pepper relish (essential)

Directions:
Heat a small skillet over medium heat.  Toast the seeds a couple of minutes then stir in sauerkraut, beer or cider, and mustard and simmer 10 minutes.
Cut kielbasa into 4 portions.  Split each piece in half across, opening them up.  Grill the sausages on a hot griddle or skillet until crispy on both sides, about 7 - 8 minutes total.  Wipe the grease off the griddle and drop heat to low.
Lightly butter 1 side of each slice of bread.  Build butter-side-out sandwiches of grilled kielbasa, sauerkraut, and 2 slices of cheese and a generous smear of the relish.
Grill the sandwiches until crispy.  Cut and serve with additional relish.
