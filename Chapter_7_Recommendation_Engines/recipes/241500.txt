Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken, wings removed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch herbes de Provence, or to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
2 heavy clay bricks, wrapped tightly in aluminum foil

Directions:







Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
You should use a big cast iron pan for this, but it will also work in a high-quality, heavy-duty stainless steel pan, or other oven-proof skillet. The key is to heat it very well before the chicken goes in. Other than that, there's really no way to screw it up, unless you under or overcook it, which won't happen, since you're going to check it with the thermometer.
