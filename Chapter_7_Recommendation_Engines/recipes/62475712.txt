Ingredients:
Cake Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, room temperature
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 (12 oz.) container of sour cream
1 tsp. vanilla extract
Topping Ingredients:
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)

Directions:
In a mixer, cream together butter and sugar.  Add eggs to the mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture alternately with the sour cream and vanilla.  Mix until combined.
Then pour half of the batter into a greased 9?x13? baking pan, and sprinkle with half of the topping.  Add the remainder of the batter on top, and sprinkle with the remaining topping.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean.
