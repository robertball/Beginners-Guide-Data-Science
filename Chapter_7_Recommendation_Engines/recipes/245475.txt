Ingredients:
4 (6 inch) flour tortillas
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 poblano chile, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup frozen corn, thawed
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
1/4 cup mild enchilada sauce
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 dash hot pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place tortillas on baking sheet covered with foil; lightly brush each with olive oil, and prick all over with fork.
Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until they are puffed and golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on cooling rack.
Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, poblano chile, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until onions are translucent and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in black beans, corn, garlic, oregano, and salt; cook and stir until mixture is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Return tortillas to the foil-lined baking sheet in a single layer; spoon 1 tablespoon enchilada sauce over each tortilla. Top with 1/4 of the black bean and corn mixture and 1/4 of the shredded Mexican cheese.
Bake pizzadillas in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 5 to 6 minutes.
Remove pizzadillas from oven; top each with sour cream, queso fresco, and cilantro. Add a dash of hot pepper sauce to each slice.

Description: 
I make this for Meatless (lacto-ovo) Monday Meals. It is a big hit! The flavor profile is complex and savory and you can add a dash of hot sauce to spice things up even more. I cut the pizzadillas in half for the kids.
