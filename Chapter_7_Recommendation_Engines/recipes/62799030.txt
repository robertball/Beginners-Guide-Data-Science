Ingredients:
4 medium sweet potatoes (about 3 pounds), washed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Bake potatoes on high heat in a microwave for approximately 10 minutes (adjust time according to the power of your microwave) or still firm, but not hard.  Cut lengthwise into ranch style "fries", and place in large container with tight lid (for shaking).  Mix all other ingredients, and pour over potatoes. Cover, and shake gently for complete coverage.  Grill on low to medium heat for 10-15  minutes (until soft when checked with a fork).  Use any leftover sauce to baste potatoes.

Description: 
A little bit of sweet and a little bit of spicy.  A nice twist to a traditionally seasonal food.
