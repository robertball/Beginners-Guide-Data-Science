Ingredients:
6-8 chicken breasts
2 teaspoons seasoning salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cumin
3/4 cups fresh lime juice
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 tablespoon honey
8 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Pound chicken pieces to 1/2" thick. Pierce all pieces with a fork. In a small bowl, combine the seasoning salt, ground black pepper, cayenne pepper and cumin. Rub all chicken breasts with the spices, then place the chicken into a large, resealable plastic bag.
In a separate medium bowl, combine the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, honey and cilantro. Mix well and pour into the bag with the chicken. Seal and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil grate.
Grill chicken for about 10 minutes per side. Brush with the marinade every 5 minutes. Chicken is done when juices run clear.
