Description: 
I've been searching for years for a good chili recipe that wasn't too heavy on the tomato side or on the chili powder side.  This is a combo of a chili recipe and chili seasoning recipe that I found with a couple additions of my own.  Adjust the garlic salt and red pepper flakes to your taste.  Serve with fresh diced onions, crackers, cheddar cheese or whatever you like!Modified from: Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili
