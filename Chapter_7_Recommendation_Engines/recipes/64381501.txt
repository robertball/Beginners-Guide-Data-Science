Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
2/3 cup water
1/4 cup olive oil
White balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
10 grape tomatoes, halved
Sea Salt
Black Pepper

Directions:
Combine the asparagus and water in a 10 inch skillet and place over medium heat; cover. Allow the asparagus to steam until tender, about 10 minutes; drain.  Reduce heat to low and return the skillet to the heat. Add a splash of white balsamic vinegar to the olive oil and drizzle over the asparagus. Season with sea salt and black pepper; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Add the grape tomatoes to the skillet and replace the lid. Allow to sit covered until the cheese melts and the tomatoes are slightly steamed, about 2 minutes.
