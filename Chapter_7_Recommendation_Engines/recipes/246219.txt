Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
4 ounces Brie cheese, cut into 4 slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts with Creole seasoning, salt, and pepper; cook until evenly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool.
Cut each puff pastry sheet in half. Place 1 sliced chicken breast on each half; top with 1/4 of the bacon and 1 Brie cheese slice. Fold top and bottom of pastry over chicken. Press pastry seams together with your fingers to seal; place seam-side down on prepared baking sheet.
Cook in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe was created to replicate a dish I tried while traveling to Key West, FL. It was the best chicken dish I have had in a while! It is quick and easy too.
