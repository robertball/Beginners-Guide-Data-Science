Ingredients:
1 Jalapeño, chopped
4 oz cream cheese
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 lb ground beef
salt and pepper, to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 Tbsp. cumin
Bacon (optional topping)
Other optional toppings: sliced cheddar cheese, red onion, tomatoes, lettuce

Directions:
Combine the jalapeño, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese until your cheese mixture is well-blended.
Season the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic, and cumin.
Separate your meat into four balls (depending on how big you want your burgers to be).
Create an indentation with your thumb, then scoop the cheese mixture in.
Wrap the burger around the cheese, making sure to close all edges so the cheese does not leak out while grilling.
Place the patties on the grill along with some bacon (optional), grilling for three to five minutes (depending on preferred done-ness).
Open up the grill, flip the bacon, flip and place cheese on top of the burger to melt (optional).
Place your patty on the bun and start assembling your burger while the bacon finishes cooking. Enjoy!
