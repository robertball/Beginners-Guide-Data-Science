Ingredients:
1 medium butternut squash, halved and pricked all over using a fork
2 tablespoons margarine
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon curry powder
5 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon honey
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 cup 10% cream

Directions:
Place squash halves on a microwave-safe plate; cook in the microwave for 10 minutes. Remove peel and seeds. Place cooked squash flesh in a food processor and puree.
Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; add mushrooms and onion. Cook 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in flour and curry powder, cook 5 minutes more. Gradually stir in chicken stock and wine. Cook until smooth and slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes. Whisk in cooked squash, honey, and nutmeg. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir cream into soup and reheat if necessary.
