Ingredients:
8 oz. tub mascarpone cheese
1/8 cup cream (light or heavy-- either is fine)
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1 tsp. vanilla extract (or any other extract will work too)

Directions:
Empty the contents of the mascarpone cheese in to a medium sized bowl.
Add the cream and the extract of your choice.
Blend the ingredients with a hand mixer until completely mixed.
Set the mixture aside.
Bring 1 cup of water to a vigorous simmer or light boil.
Place a heat proof boil in the pot to create a double boiler so that hte bottom of the bowl does not touch the boiling water.
Put the chocolate chips in the bowl and let the heat from the boiling water melt the chips.
Stir the chips occasionally to prevent sticking.
Once melted, fold the chocolate chips in to the mascarpone cheese mixture.
After folding the chocolate and cheese together, place the faux mousse in the fridge to set for at least an hour (preferably two).
