Ingredients:
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup cooked and peeled whole crawfish tails, chopped, plus more for garnish
8 ounces white American cheese, cubed
8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cubed
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or more to taste
1 sprig fresh cilantro

Directions:
Pour heavy cream into a deep skillet over low heat. Add crawfish tails, American cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, green chiles, and Creole seasoning. Cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
Pour queso into a warm bowl. Garnish with cilantro and a few pieces of crawfish tails. Continue to stir queso every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent the cheese from solidifying on top.
