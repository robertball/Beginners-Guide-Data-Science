Ingredients:
1 Reynolds® Oven Bag, large size
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
1 cup beef broth
4 shallots, peeled and sliced
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon honey
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (3 pound) beef chuck pot roast, trimmed of fat
4 cups hot cooked rice
Chopped green onions and/or sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Do not exceed 400 degrees F. Add flour to a Reynolds(R) Large Oven Bag. Shake. Place bag in a roasting pan at least 2 inches deep.
Place carrots, broth, shallots, soy sauce, ginger, honey, and garlic in bag. Gently squeeze to blend. Add meat to bag.
Close bag with tie (found inside package). Holding the bag upright, cut six 1/2-inch slits in top of bag to allow steam to escape. Tuck ends of bag in pan.
Place pan in oven, allowing room for bag to expand during cooking without touching heating elements, wall, or racks. Bag should not hang over pan.
Bake about 2 1/2 hours or until meat and vegetables are tender.
Cut open top of oven bag carefully. Remember: Always support bag with pan.
Serve roast, vegetables, and cooking liquid over hot cooked rice. Garnish with green onions and/or sesame seeds, if desired.
