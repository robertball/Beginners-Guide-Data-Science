Description: 
Tired of thick and grainy PB frostings, I converted my favorite buttercream recipe into a smooth and super peanut buttery tasting frosting.   It's great as a frosting or cake filling, but we especially love it a top my Brownie Batter + Cupcakes = The SECOND BEST Cupcake.  Ever cupcakes.
