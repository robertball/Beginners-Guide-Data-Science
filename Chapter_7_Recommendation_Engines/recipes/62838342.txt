Ingredients:
4 oz butter, softened
1 1/4 c sugar
3 eggs, at room temperature
1 t vanilla extract
Freshly grated zest of one orange
2 c flour
2 T cornstarch
1 t baking soda
1/2 t salt
1 1/2 t ground cardamom
1/2 t cinnamon
1/2 t powdered ginger
1 scant cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly butter 5x9 inch loaf pan.  Line the pan with waxed paper and butter the paper.
In a bowl, cream the butter, gradually adding the sugar.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth and fluffy after each addition.  Blend in vanilla and zest.
Sift in the dry ingredients into a separate bowl.  Add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.  Mix until uniformly blended.
Scrape the batter into the pan and level the top.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 60-70 minutes.
Cool the cake in the pan, on a rack, for 15 minutes.  Turn out of the pan and peel down the waxed paper.  Finish cooling, slice and serve.

Description: 
This cake is wonderful plain, but it also makes a perfect vehicle for strawberry sauce or lemon-verbena sauce, a puree of mixed berries and sugar, or a vanilla-scented custard sauce.
