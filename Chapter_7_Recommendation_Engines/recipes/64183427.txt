Sweet Buttermilk Scones Recipe

Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1/3 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 sticks (6oz) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons orange zest
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 cup white chocolate chips (optional)
1 cup dried cherry flavored cranberries
1/2 stick butter, melted for brushing
1/4 cup sugar for dusting

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees
In a medium bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, orange zest, and salt with a fork. Add cold butter pieces. Use fingertips to work the butter into the dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.
Pour in buttermilk and almond extract and mix until all ingredients are just moistened. You should have a soft dough with a rough look. Stir in white chocolate (if using) and dried fruit. If dough looks too dry, add another tablespoon buttermilk.
Gather dough into a large ball, pressing gently so it holds together. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead briefly-12 times should be enough. Cut dough in half, making two 7" circles around 1/2" deep. Cut each into 8 wedges, brushing with butter and sprinkling with sugar.
Bake on cookie sheet 10 to 14 minutes until golden. Cool 5 minutes on pan before removing to a wire rack to cool the rest of the way.

Description: 
These scones are great for the holidays. They are very sweet so feel free to use another dried fruit or leave the white chocolate out for a less sweet treat. I hope you enjoy these as much as my family does!
