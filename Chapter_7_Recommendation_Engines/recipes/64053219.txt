Ingredients:
240 g pasta corta (bow tie, fusili, penne, etc.)
1/8 cup olive oil
20 cherry tomatoes, halved
200 g bocconcini di mozzarella
6 fresh basil leaves
100 g black olive, snoccialate
1/2 TBSP oregano

Directions:
Cook the pasta as per directions, until al dente.
Meanwhile, in a large salad bowl combine all the other ingredients and mix well making sure the ingredients are well covered with the oil, oregano and basil.
When the pasta is cooked, drain and wait until cooled enough that you can touch it without it burning your fingers.  You do not want to melt the cheese.
Add the pasta to the tomato/oil/cheese mixture.
Serve lukewarm or cold.  The more it is allowed to sit, the more the flavours attach to the other ingredients.
