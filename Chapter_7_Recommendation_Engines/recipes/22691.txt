Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls
8 ounces cubed Brie cheese
3/4 cup whole berry cranberry sauce
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12 inch pizza pan or 9x13 inch baking dish.
Unroll the crescent rolls and separate into triangles. Arrange in the pan with tips towards the center and lightly press together.
Bake 5 minutes, or until lightly brown.
Remove from the oven and sprinkle with pieces of Brie cheese. Spoon the cranberry sauce over the cheese. Top with pecans.
Bake an additional 8 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown. Cool 5 minutes and cut into wedges or squares.

Description: 
I love baked Brie.  This is an easy and delicious way to prepare it. Any kind of jam may be used in place of cranberry sauce (I like raspberry). I have been told by many that they'd like to make a meal out of it.
