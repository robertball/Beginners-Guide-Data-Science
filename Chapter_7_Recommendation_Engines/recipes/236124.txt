Ingredients:
Slow Cooker Chili Con Carne:
1 (15 ounce) can red enchilada sauce
3/4 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter
1 (2 pound) beef chuck roast
1 onion, sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
Nachos:
1 (16 ounce) package tortilla chips
3 cups shredded Mexican-style cheese blend
Optional Toppings:
1 cup salsa
1 medium ripe avocado, chopped
1 medium tomato, chopped
1/4 cup black olives, sliced
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Pour the enchilada sauce and apple butter in a Crock-Pot. Place the beef roast in it, followed by sliced onions, garlic, salt and red pepper. Cover and turn the Crock-Pot on high for 4 to 5 hours, until the beef is falling apart.
Using two forks, shred the beef roast into the sauce, and leave on warm until ready to serve.
For the Beef Nachos:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange the tortilla chips on a large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle half the cheese over the top and bake for 3 to 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
Scoop the chili con carne over the chips, and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the hot beef. Top with any additional toppings and serve immediately.
