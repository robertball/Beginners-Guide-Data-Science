Description: 
This cobbler recipe comes from my mother-in-law.  We always have this dessert after a summer meal at her house.  I love it during the summer with peaches fresh from the local orchards, but it came be made year-round with frozen or canned peaches.  (Just add extra cook-time if you use frozen peaches.)  It tastes like peaches topped with snickerdoodle cookies.
