Ingredients:
Filling:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 onions, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1 tablespoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 cube beef bouillon
1/2 cup hot water
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup black olives
1/2 cup raisins
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch white sugar
2/3 cup shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
6 tablespoons cold water, or as needed
3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry onions until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, paprika, and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar. Cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes more.
Dissolve bouillon cube in hot water; stir into beef mixture. Add oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat until flavors combine, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in olives and raisins; remove from heat and let cool.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sift flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 pinch sugar together in a bowl. Cut in shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until dough sticks together. Shape dough into 2 equal balls. Roll out crusts to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Place bottom crust in pie pan.
Spoon filling into pie crust; use a slotted spoon to avoid transferring oil. Pour in beaten eggs; cover with top crust. Pinch edges together; cut 4 slits in the top for vents.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); bake until golden, 35 to 40 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a variation of Chilean empanadas that I made to simplify my husband's favorite recipe from his home country. The meat filling is a harmonious mix of beef, raisins, and olives that will make your tongue tingle when you take your first bite. And don't be surprised when you've eaten more of the pie than you had planned.
