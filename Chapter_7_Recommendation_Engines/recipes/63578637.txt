Ingredients:

Beat the cream cheese with the cream of coconut in a stand mixer until smooth and no lumps remain. Fold in the Cool Whip until well combined. Garnish by piping the reserved Cool Whip on top of the dip (or mix the entire container of Cool Whip into the dip, if you choose). Chill in the fridge for at least an hour (or overnight) Serve with fruit.
