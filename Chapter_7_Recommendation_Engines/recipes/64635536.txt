Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
8 -10 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (I leave the skin on)
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp fresh ground pepper
1 Tbsp paprika
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pkt of ranch dressing mix
6 Tbsp hot sauce
2 cups fiesta Mexican blend cheese or 2 cups monterey jack and cheddar cheese blend
1 cup crumbled cooked bacon
1 cup diced green onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F.
In a large bowl mix together the olive oil, hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, ranch dressing mix  & paprika. Add the potatoes and stir to coat. Add the potatoes to a greased 9 x 13 baking dish. When scooping the potatoes into the baking dish, leave behind any extra olive oil/hot sauce mix. Add the diced chicken to the “left behind” olive oil/hot sauce mix and stir to coat all the chicken. Allow to marinate as the potatoes bake.
Roast the potatoes for 45 minutes, stirring every 10-15 minutes, until cooked through and nice and crispy on the outside. Once the potatoes are fully cooked add the marinated chicken. Once the potatoes are fully cooked, remove from the oven and lower the oven temperature to 400°F.
In a large bowl mix cheese, bacon and onions together. Top the raw chicken with the topping. Bake 30 minutes or until until the chicken is cooked through and the topping is melted and bubbly delicious. Serve with extra hot sauce and/or ranch dressing.
