Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 large potatoes, peeled and grated
1/4 cup butter, melted
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 eggs
3/4 cup shredded provolone cheese
6 slices prosciutto
2 teaspoons maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large 6-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix potatoes, melted butter, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.
Divide potato mixture among muffin cups. Press to create a thin crust over the bottom and up the sides of each cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are a light golden brown and potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Crack an egg gently into each cup. Continue cooking until egg whites are set and yolk is runny, about 6 minutes. Remove from the oven; cover eggs with provolone cheese.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Toss prosciutto with maple syrup and pepper in a small bowl. Spread out on a small baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
Place muffin tin and baking sheet under the preheated broiler. Broil until cheese is melted and prosciutto is crisp, about 1 minute.
Transfer egg baskets to a serving plate. Chop prosciutto and sprinkle on top.
