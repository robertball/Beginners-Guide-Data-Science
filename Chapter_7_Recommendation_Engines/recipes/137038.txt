Ingredients:
Rolls:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 (8 ounce) cans Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or Pillsbury® Crescent Recipe Creations™ refrigerated flaky dough sheet
4 teaspoons preserves or jam
Glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 teaspoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In small bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon juice; beat until smooth.
Crescent Rolls: Unroll dough; separate dough into 8 rectangles; firmly press perforations to seal. Recipe Creations: Unroll dough; cut into 8 rectangles.
Spread each rectangle with about 2 tablespoons cream cheese mixture. Roll up each, starting at longest side; firmly pinch edges and ends to seal. Gently stretch each roll to about 10 inches.
On ungreased large cookie sheet, coil each roll into a spiral with seam on the inside, tucking end under. Make deep indentation in center of each roll; fill with 1/2 teaspoon preserves.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until deep golden brown. In small bowl, blend all glaze ingredients, adding enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle over warm rolls.
