Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes)
5 tablespoons baking cocoa
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 cup flaked coconut

2 cups confectioners' sugar

GLAZE:
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
1 tablespoon butter (no substitutes)

Directions:
In the top of a double boiler, combine butter, cocoa, sugar, egg and vanilla. Cook and stir over simmering water until mixture reaches 160 degrees F and is thickened. In a large bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, coconut and walnuts. Stir in cocoa mixture; blend well. Press into a greased 9-in. square baking pan; set aside. For filling, combine butter, milk and pudding mix in a mixing bowl. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth; spread over crust. For glaze, melt chocolate and butter; spread over filling. Cover and refrigerate until set. Cut into bars.

Description: 
Thick and fudgy, these treats only look fussy. The truth is, they're layered bars that don't require any baking time at all! My grandmother concocted the recipe years ago.
