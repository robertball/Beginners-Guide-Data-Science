Description: 
This is a super easy but wonderfully tasty salad recipe I picked up years ago which has become a summer tradition with my family!  The ingredients and proportions are adjustable to personal preference. For added flavor, you can boil the pasta in a mixture of 1 part water and 1 part chicken broth.
