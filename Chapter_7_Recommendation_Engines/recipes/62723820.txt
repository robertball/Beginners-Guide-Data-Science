Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup butter
1 tsp salt
1 1/2 tbs active dry yeast
1 egg beaten
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup of your favorite jam or sugar free jelly

Directions:
Combine sugar with salt and 1/2 cup butter (reserve the rest for later. Beat with mixer until fluffy.
In a separate bowl, combine 3/4 cup plus 2 tbs warm water (115 degrees) with active yeast. Let sit for ten minutes until nice a foamy. Add beaten egg to yeast mixture.
Sift white and wheat flour in a medium bowl. Combine the whipped butter mixture with the yeast mixture, then add to the flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time until a soft dough forms. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes until it doubles in size. (dough needs to be left to rise in a warm draft free area -- I like to preheat my oven to about 300 then turn it off, let cool slightly and then put my dough in to rise).
Roll dough out to 1/2 inch thick. Cut dough into circles with a large biscuit cutter, or you can do just do squares with a knife. Place on a greased pan 1/2 inch apart. Brush tops with melted butter and cover with towel to rise for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Make a dent in the center of each kolache and fill with 2 tsps of your favorite jelly. Bake for 25 minutes and then brush with melted butter.
