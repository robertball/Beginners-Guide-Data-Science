Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 1/2 cups chocolate chips
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix corn flakes cereal, confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, and butter together in a bowl. Scoop mixture using a melon baller into balls and arrange on a plate or baking sheet. Refrigerate until solid, at least 3 hours.
Melt chocolate chips and oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes.
Grease a baking sheet.
Gently roll peanut butter balls in the melted chocolate until evenly coated; arrange on the same baking sheet.
