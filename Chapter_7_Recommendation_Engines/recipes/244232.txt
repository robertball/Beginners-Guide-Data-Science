Ingredients:
10 tablespoons marshmallow fluff
10 graham cracker squares
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate, or as needed

Directions:
Spread about 1 tablespoon marshmallow fluff evenly onto 1 side of each graham cracker square.
Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Cool chocolate for 1 to 2 minutes. Spoon chocolate into a piping bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped.
Pipe chocolate in the shape of a spider web onto the marshmallow fluff of each graham cracker. Put a dot with some legs in the corner to represent a spider.

Description: 
Taking the traditional s'more and giving it a Halloween twist! Perfect if you don't have a fire pit for roasting and great for a crowd. The only 'cooking' involved is melting the chocolate. If you don't want to take the time to melt the chocolate, they sell chocolate icing in piping bags already for cakes and cookies. You can buy those for easy use, especially if this is for kids.
