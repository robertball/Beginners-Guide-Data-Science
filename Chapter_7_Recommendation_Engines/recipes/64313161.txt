1/2 tablespoon fish sauce
1/2 tablespoon lime juice, fresh
1 teaspoon ginger, fresh minced
1/2 clove(s) garlic minced
1 pinch pepper, red flakes
1/2 tablespoon oil, canola
1/2 pounds pork, boneless leg cutlets

1 1/2 cups, 1 head(s) cabbage, napa (Chinese)

Directions:
Whisk together fish sauce, lime juice, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
For the pork:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork with salt and pepper and cook, turning once until lightly browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and slice into thin strips. Place pork in a medium bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the dressing. /span>
In a large bowl, combine cabbage, bell pepper, and remaining dressing. Lay lettuce leaves on a clean, dry work surface. Divide pork among leaves. Top with cabbage mixture and roll tightly, tucking edges in as you go. Place rolls, seam side down, on a cutting board, cut in half, and serve.
