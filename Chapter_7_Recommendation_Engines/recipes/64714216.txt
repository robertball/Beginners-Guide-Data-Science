Ingredients:
2 cups pomegranate juice (about 6-8 pomegranates)
2 cups water
1 small box Strawberry Jello
3 cups sugar
8 jelly jars, lids & rings

Directions:
Rinse the pomegranates.  Using a sharp knife, score the pomegranates across the top and down the sides, then turn 90 degrees and score again.   Fill you sink with 3 inches of water, pull the pomegranates apart and separate the juice filled seeds from the membrane.   The membrane will float to the top and the seeds will settle to the bottom.   Process the seeds in a food processor (without adding water) two cups at a time, to separate the juice from the seeds.  Place the resultant pulp in a colander set over top of a 6 quart saucepan and allow the juice to drain.  While it's draining, wash your jars, rings & lids and put them in a large canner with boiling water to sterilize. Add water to juice to make 4 cups of liquid.  Mix the dry jello into the juice, bring to a rolling boil and boil for 1 minute.  Add 3 cups of sugar, bring back to a boil and boil 1 minute.  Remove from heat and ladle into sterilized jars.  Put lids & rings on and tighten.  Place in the boiling water in the canner and boil for 5 minutes.  Get them out, allow to cool.  If you have any that don't seal, place them in the refrigerator to use first.
