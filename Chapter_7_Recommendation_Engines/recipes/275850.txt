Ingredients:
4 ounces shelf-stable gnocchi
1/3 cup pasta sauce
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, about 3 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread 1/2 of the pasta sauce on the bottom of a 5-inch round casserole dish. Layer with gnocchi and spread the remaining pasta sauce on top. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
