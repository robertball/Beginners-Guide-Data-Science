Ingredients:
4 lbs. granny smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced
2 T. fresh lemon juice
3/4 cup plus 3 T. sugar, divided
1/4 cup plus 2 T all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/8 tsp. ground allspice
1/8 tsp. salt
1 recipe Sweet Pie Dough  (recipe follows)
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 T. water

Directions:
1. In large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and salt; toss to combine.  Refrigerate the mixture for at least 8 hours, and up to overnight.  Strain mixture through a sieve; reserve apples, and discard juice.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
3.  On a well-floured surface, roll each disk of the prepared Sweet Pie Dough into a 12 inch circle.  Carefully place 1 dough circle in a 9 inch deep dish pie pan.
4.  Trim excess dough, leaving a 1/2 inch border, then fold the border under itself, creating a crust
5.  In a small bowl, combine 2 T. sugar and remaining 2 T. flour.  Sprinkle the mixture over the crust in the pan; spoon strained apples into crust.  Top with remaining dough circle, trimming to fit.  Using fingers, lightly pinch the top and bottom crusts together to create a wavy edge.
6.  Using a paring knife, cut small slits or ovals into top crust.  In a small bowl whisk together the egg and water.  Using a pastry brush, lightly coat top crust with egg wash, and sprinkle with remaining 1 T. sugar.
Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until interior is bubbling and crust is golden brown.
