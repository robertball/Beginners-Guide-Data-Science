Ingredients:
2 large ripe tomatoes
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, partially drained
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
2/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut the tops off of the tomatoes and use a knife to cut around the inside, separating the flesh from the skin.  Scoop out the flesh.  Place the tomatoes in a small baking dish.  In a small bowl combine the canned tomatoes with the bread crumbs, 1/3 cup of cheese and the sausage; mix well.  Spoon the mixture into the tomato skins and top with the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
