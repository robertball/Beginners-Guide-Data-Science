Description: 
I made this when I had limited groceries, farmer's market produce, and I wanted something satisfying. I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe as-is on this site, but you can use which ever you prefer. The hot sauce packet I used was from a fast-food restaurant, but you can sub your own here as well.
