Ingredients:
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and cut into chunks
1 banana, peeled and cut into chunks
1 cup unsweetened soy milk
1/4 cup raw cocoa powder
2 tablespoons agave nectar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (optional)

Directions:
Place avocado, banana, soy milk, cocoa powder, agave nectar, lemon juice, and coconut into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Divide into small containers, and store in the refrigerator 1 hour until set.

Description: 
It may seem odd to have a banana and avocado in the same recipe, but the banana completely hides any taste of the avocado.  The avocado is there simply for texture and nutritional value. Even my kids love this recipe! You can use any unsweetened milk in this recipe - almond, soy, rice, or coconut - and for a little crunch, use raw cocoa nibs instead of the cocoa powder.
