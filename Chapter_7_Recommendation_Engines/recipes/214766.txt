Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 cups flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons apricot jam
2 cups milk
Sauce
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat 2 cups sugar and eggs with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Stir in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, vinegar, and apricot jam.  Pour in 2 cups of milk and stir until well combined. Spoon the batter into a greased, 2 quart oven-proof baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Pierce the baked pudding several times with a skewer or fork.
Place 1 cup sugar, water, 1 cup milk, butter, and vanilla in a saucepan and stir over medium heat. When the mixture comes to a boil remove it from the heat and slowly pour the mixture over the hot pudding. Serve warm.
