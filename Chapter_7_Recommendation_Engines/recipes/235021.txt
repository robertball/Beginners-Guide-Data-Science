Ingredients:
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped
1 cup white sugar
2/3 cup light corn syrup
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup pecans, coarsely chopped
1 Tenderflake® Frozen Deep Dish Pie Shell, defrosted
1/3 cup pecan halves
whipped cream for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Position rack in the bottom third of the oven.
Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over water that is barely simmering. Stir constantly.
Whisk together sugar, corn syrup, eggs, chocolate, butter, vanilla and salt. Add chopped pecans and pour into the unbaked pie shell. Arrange the pecan halves artfully on top of the filling.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes. The center may still seem under-set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Cut into wedges and serve with a generous dollop of whipped cream.

Description: 
Few pies satisfy the sweet tooth the way pecan pie does. Adding chocolate takes it to a new height, and it is delightfully easy to make.
