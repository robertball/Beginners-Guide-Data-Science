Ingredients:
2 cups unsweetened non-dairy milk
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
2 cups medium grind whole-grain cornmeal (I use Bob's Red Mill)
1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
2 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup applesauce
2 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 tsp fine sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8 inch glass baking dish with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, mix milk and apple cider vinegar. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix cornmeal, whole-wheat pastry flour, baking powder and salt with a whisk.
Add applesauce and maple syrup to the milk and vinegar and whisk to combine.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon until well combined.
Bake for 50-60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the bread comes out clean.
Let cool in baking dish for 10 minutes.
Lift the bread out of the baking dish and let cool completely on a cooling rack.
Slice in four on each side to have 12 squares.
