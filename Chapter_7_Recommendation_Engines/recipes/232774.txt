Ingredients:
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups soft bread crumbs (white or whole wheat)
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce
12 hoagie buns, split in half and toasted
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine eggs, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add ground beef and the 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese; mix until combined. Form into 48 meatballs. Place meatballs in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Bake for 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 160 degrees F. Drain meatballs on sheets of clean paper towels.
Combine marinara sauce and the cooked meatballs in a 4- to 6-quart pan. Heat over medium heat until heated through, stirring occasionally. Spoon hot meatballs and sauce into buns. Top meatballs with any remaining sauce. Sprinkle the 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese over meatballs. Let stand for 2 minutes before serving.
[Cleaning tip: Once the stove top is cool, wipe up any spills with Clorox(R) Disinfecting Wipes*.]
