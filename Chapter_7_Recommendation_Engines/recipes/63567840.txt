Ingredients:
1 teaspoon coconut oil
4 chicken leg quarters
1 onion, chopped
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles
1 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoons garam masala
1/2 tablespoon brown mustard seed
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons salt
8 wedges lime
1/2 cup sour cream
Chopped cilantro

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet, and brown the chicken on all sides. Set chicken aside, and mix in the onion and jalapenos. Cook until tender. Pour in the coconut milk and stir in diced tomatoes with green chiles. Season with cumin, garam masala, mustard seed, cayenne pepper, and 2 teaspoons salt.  Bring to a boil. Return chicken to skillet, and continue cooking 10 minutes, or until chicken juices run clear.
Remove chicken from skillet, cool enough to handle, and remove meat from bones. Return meat to skillet. Serve mixture over the cooked rice. Garnish with lime wedges, and top each serving with a dollop of sour cream.
