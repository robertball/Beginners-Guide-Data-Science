Ingredients:
5 strips bacon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup light mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's LightÂ®)
1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Crumble the bacon once cooled enough to handle.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes; transfer to a bowl. Add the crumbled bacon, light mayonnaise, blue cheese, and black pepper to the onion and garlic; stir to combine.
