Ingredients:
2 medium to large sized boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2T Exta Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
2 - 8oz packages of cream cheeses, softened
1 - 8oz package fineley shredded cheddar cheese

1/4 cup blue cheese dressing

Directions:
Heat large skillet on medium  heat. Heat olive oil to two turns of the pan. Add garlic cloves and chicken and cook chicken for 12-15 minutes turning once, or until juices run clear. While chicken is cooking move on to step 2.
Combine in a large microwave safe bowl the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, buffalo wing sauce, ranch dressing, blue cheese dressing, garlic powder and Cayenne pepper. Microwave on 50% power for 4 minutes. Mix and return to cook on 50% for 2 minutes. Repeat until the cheese is melted and all ingredients are well incorporated.
Remove chicken from the pan and let rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes so the juices can re-incorporate themselves into the meat. After meat has rested, shredded the chicken into small pieces and add to cheese mixture.
Add parmesan cheese and microwave for 2 minutes on 50% power.
Add finely chopped celery to the mixture and stir.
Serve with tortilla chips.
