Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 large eggs
1/8 cup coffee-flavored liqueur (such as Kahlua®)
2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine whole wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, eggs, coffee liqueur, cocoa powder, salt, baking soda, and vanilla in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until blended but still a little lumpy. Fold in chocolate chips with a spatula. Drop heaping tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let rest on the baking sheets, 1 to 2 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I don't cook much, but when I use a recipe, I can't help but change it. I started with the Toll House® recipe on my bag of chocolate chips and made some changes, yielding a rich, chewy, chocolaty pile of goodness!
