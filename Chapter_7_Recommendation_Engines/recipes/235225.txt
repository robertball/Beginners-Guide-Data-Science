Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
3/4 cup butter, melted
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 egg
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/2 cup cinnamon chips, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil with about 1 inch hanging over the edges for 'handles'. Spray foil with cooking spray.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; beat in 2 eggs until combined. Beat 1 more egg and vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture until combined. Stir flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir into brown sugar mixture until batter is smooth.
Beat cream cheese in a separate bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; beat in remaining 1 egg until just combined. Beat pumpkin puree into cream cheese mixture; stir in pumpkin pie spice.
Spread 2/3 the batter into the prepared baking pan. Drop spoonfuls of pumpkin mixture over batter; top with spoonfuls of remaining 1/3 batter and swirl together with a butter knife. Sprinkle cinnamon chips over batter-pumpkin mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until blondies are lightly browned on the edges, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars.

Description: 
These yummy bars are a good way to use up any extra pumpkin you may have leftover from fall baking or an excuse to open another can! I had mini cinnamon chips, so 1/2 cup was plenty. If you have the full-size ones, you'll probably want more. Just sprinkle as much as you want over the top. If you don't have cinnamon chips at all, try butterscotch chips!
