Ingredients:
4 1/2 pounds beef short ribs
1 quart water
1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed
2 onions, chopped
2 beef bouillon cubes
2 carrots, cut in chunks
2 stalks celery, quartered
1 chayote squash, peeled and quartered
2 potatoes, quartered
salt to taste
1/4 head cabbage, cut into wedges

Directions:
Place the beef ribs in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for 5 minutes. Drain; discard the cooking water (the ribs will not be fully cooked).
Return the beef to the pot. Pour in the 1 quart water, peppercorns, onions, and beef bouillon. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour.
Skim any fat floating on the surface. Stir in the carrots, celery, chayote, and potatoes; cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt. Add cabbage and cook an additional 5 minutes.
