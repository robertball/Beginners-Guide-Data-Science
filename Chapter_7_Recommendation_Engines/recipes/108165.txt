Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup water
1 (15.5 ounce) can small white beans
1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 sprig cilantro, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup calabaza (pumpkin-like squash), peeled and medium diced
1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon with coriander and achiote
1 cube chicken with tomato flavored bouillon
1 pinch salt
1 pinch black pepper
1 pinch ground cumin

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onion and green pepper; cook until the onion begins to turn brown, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the water, white beans, tomato sauce, garlic, cilantro, and calabaza.  Season with the sazon packet, bouillon cube, salt, pepper, and cumin; stir well to combine.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the calabaza has softened, about 20 minutes.  Remove the cover, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, about 10 more minutes.

Description: 
A wonderful combination of Caribbean ingredients turn into a very flavorful meal! Pour the beans over white rice or have as a soup. Great with breaded thin steaks. I get requests for this meal from all my family, friends, and coworkers.
