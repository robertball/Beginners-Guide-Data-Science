Ingredients:
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 pounds lobster tails, thawed
cooking spray
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-sized potato nuggets (such as Tater TotsÂ®)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup butter
1 avocado, diced
1/4 cup sour cream
1 lime, juiced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Bring 9 cups water and salt to a boil in a Dutch oven or large pot. Add lobster; simmer, uncovered, until shells turn bright red and meat is tender, 8 to 12 minutes. Drain. Cut tails lengthwise with kitchen shears through the center of the shells. Remove meat and chop into bite-sized pieces.
Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill to high heat (450 to 650 degrees F (230 to 340 C)). Lightly coat a 10x15-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Toss tots with oil on the prepared baking pan, then spread into a single layer. Transfer pan to grill; cook for 10 minutes, then toss to turn. Continue grilling, tossing occasionally, until tots are browned on all sides, about 15 minutes more.
Melt butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add lobster and bring to a simmer to heat through, 3 to 5 minutes.
Blend avocado, sour cream, and lime juice in a blender until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer tots to a serving platter, and top with lobster and melted butter. Top with avocado sauce, Sriracha, and chives.

Description: 
I'm from New England, where lobster is a tradition. My favorite way to use it: Combine a fancy ingredient like lobster with a humble ingredient like a tot. The avocado crema and hot sauce really make this dish, though.
