Description: 
This is a West Indian marinade used for generations. It's best suited for fish and game. I like it on chicken and pork. Allow meat to marinate for at least an hour before cooking. Make sure you adjust the amount of chile peppers to your taste. Also, I sometimes replace the orange juice with marmalade for a sweeter marinade.
