Ingredients:
2 slices bacon
2 medium yellow squash, thinly sliced
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped (optional)
1 dash soy sauce
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until crisp. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Add the squash, onion, and jalapeno to the skillet. Fry in the bacon drippings until tender, but still firm, stirring frequently. Crumble bacon into the skillet, and season with soy sauce, salt and pepper. Stir, to blend in seasonings, and serve.

Description: 
I thought I would try creating something I hadn't seen before. I combined an element of stir fry with some ingredients I had seen popping up in other squash recipes. Squash, onion and jalapeno are fried with bacon for a tasty summer side dish.
