Ingredients:
1 (10 pound) bone-in spiral-cut ham
1 cup orange marmalade
1 teaspoon McCormick速 Mustard, Ground
1/2 teaspoon McCormick速 Garlic Powder
1/4 teaspoon McCormick速 Black Pepper, Ground
1/4 teaspoon McCormick速 Cloves, Ground

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Place the ham on its side in roasting pan. Mix marmalade and spices in small bowl until well blended. Brush 1/2 of the marmalade mixture over ham, gently separating the slices so mixture can reach middle of ham. Cover loosely with foil.
Bake 1 hour, basting occasionally with pan drippings. Remove foil. Brush with remaining marmalade mixture. Bake 45 minutes longer. Serve ham with pan drippings.
