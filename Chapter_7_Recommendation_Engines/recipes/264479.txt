Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
2 eggs, separated
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon orange extract
1 orange, cut into wedges

Directions:
Pour orange juice into a saucepan. Sprinkle gelatin powder on top. Let stand until softened, about 1 minute. Place over low heat; stir constantly until granules are completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 1 hour.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Combine egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Set aside.
Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold into the large bowl with the egg yolk-sugar mixture, followed by the stiff egg whites. Fold orange-gelatin mixture and orange extract into the large bowl with the egg yolk-cream mixture.
Pour mixture into a mold and freeze 8 hours to overnight. When it's time to serve, dip mold in hot water to loosen bottom and sides; turn out onto a serving plate. Decorate with orange wedges.

Description: 
A rich, Italian ice cream dessert made with orange, sugar, eggs, and cream. Great to prepare for a special occasion, as you can make it a few weeks in advance if you need to. I made it for Christmas in the shape of a Christmas tree.
