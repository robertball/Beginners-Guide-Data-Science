Ingredients:
2 cups raw hazelnuts
1/3 cup honey
1 cup cocoa powder
5 tbsp canola or olive oil
5 tbsp heavy cream
1/8 tsp fleur de sel or sea salt

Directions:
1. Toast the hazelnuts on a dry pan in an oven preheated to 350F for approximately 10 minutes, until quite fragrant. Stir once or twice to prevent burning.
2. Using a food processor or blender, grind the hazelnuts down until they begin to release their oils and become "hazelnut butter", about five minutes of constant pureeing. Note the nuts will start to gum up around the blade, this is a good thing so keep going!
3. Once the nuts looks like a very thick, shiny paste, you can add the honey, cocoa powder, and salt. Begin to slowly pour in the oil. Then, slowly pour in the cream. Puree until well mixed; mixture should look shiny, smooth, and spreadably thick.

Description: 
This creamy, rich chocolate hazelnut spread is not only just as good as the store-bought stuff, but better because it contains no sugar and no preservatives!
