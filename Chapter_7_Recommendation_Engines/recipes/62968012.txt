Ingredients:
1/2 C almond butter
1/2 C palm shortening
1/2 C maple syrup (Grade B will add a lot of flavor)
2 eggs
1 Tbsp vanilla
2 C almond flour
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp cinnamon
1 Tbsp granulated sugar (we recommend date sugar or unrefined cane sugar)
1 Tbsp cinnamon

Directions:
? Beat together almond butter, shortening, syrup, eggs, and vanilla until smooth
? Combine flour, soda, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in a separate bowl
? While beating wet mixture on low, slowly add dry mixture until combined
? Mixture will be wet and sticky, drop tablespoons several inches apart (8 per cookie sheet) and use a circular motion to spread cookie out into a flat disk, about a 1/2 inch thick, onto greased or lined cookie sheet
? In a separate bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon then sprinkle over cookies (about 1/8 teaspoon each)
Bake cookies at 350 for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown on the edges, centers should be slightly wet but will be spongy and bounce back if you press on them
Let cool thoroughly (at least an hour) â€“ or store in an airtight container and chill up to a week or two (serve at room temperature
