Description: 
I love trying different flavors in baked goods and when I found rose water in a local grocery store, I absolutely had to try it. Some of the recipes I found for rose-flavored cakes produced flavors that were too floral for me, so I wrote my own recipe :) The resulting cake is tender and tasty with just a hint of rose fragrance. If you like stronger rose flavor, just add more rose water. I hope you enjoy this cake as much as I do.
