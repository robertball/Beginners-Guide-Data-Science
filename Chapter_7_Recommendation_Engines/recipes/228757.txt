Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups broccoli florets
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add broccoli, water, quinoa, and chicken bouillon cubes to the onion mixture; bring to a boil stirring to dissolve the bouillon cubes. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer until quinoa is fluffy, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir evaporated milk and flour into the quinoa. Increase heat and bring the mixture to a boil; cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

Description: 
This kid-friendly soup is a tad sweet and, perhaps best of all, easy for little hands to spoon up without making a big mess.
