Whole Wheat Crumpets Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm (105' - 115') water
2 tsp honey
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 cups milk (best if it's at room temp.)
3 inch round metal forms (like a cookie cutter but open at top - I used wide-mouth canning jar rings)

Directions:
In a large bowl combine the warm water and the honey.  Blend in yeast and let sit until foamy and bubbly.
Put the flour, salt, baking soda and milk in the bowl with the yeast mixture and stir till blended.  Cover the bowl and let sit in a warm place for about 30 minutes.
Warm a griddle to approximately 220' (medium-low heat).  Grease well  the griddle and the rings prior to each batch.  Place rings on the griddle and allow to get warm.  Put approximately 3 tablespoons of batter into each ring. The batter will be quite elastic and stringy, but will fill out the ring as it heats up.  Avoid over-filling the rings.  Avoid starting out with heat too high.  These cook slow on the first side - pull off rings when bubbles create holes on the top.  When there are some holes on top  and the underside is golden, but not too dark, flip.  Increase temperature to about 230' and cook until golden.  Remember to decrease the temperature when starting a new batch.
Serve.

Description: 
These are a little like an English muffin, except a bit more dense and cake-like with a hint of sweetness.  They are good eaten warm and soft or you can let them sit out a bit for a more European crusty texture, then slice and toast them.
