Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup plain all purpose flour
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup shortening
1/3 cup butter
3-4 Tbsp vodka
3-4 Tbsp ice water

Directions:
Combine flour, cocoa, sugar & salt in medium bowl; cut in shortening & butter with pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle 1 Tbsp of water over the flour and toss with a fork. Alternate this process with vodka and water until flour is moistened.
Press dough together with hands into a ragged ball and place on lightly floured surface. Roll out to 1/8" thickness. Line pie plate with pastry. Cut off excess and tuck edge under; crimp edge as desired.
Use remaining dough for pie dough cookies.
If baking prior to filling the crust, pierce crust on bottom and sides with a fork several times and place in freezer for 10 minutes while your oven is preheating. Line crust with foil or parchment paper and fill full with pie weights or dried beans if you have them (I don't). Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully remove weights and foil lining. Bake an additional 10-15 minutes until set. Allow to cool completely before filling.
