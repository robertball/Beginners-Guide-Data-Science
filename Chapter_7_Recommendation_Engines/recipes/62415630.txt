Ingredients:
1 package fried tofu
1/2 cup bamboo shoots
4 tablespoon green onions
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon pressed garlic
2 tablespoon fermented black beans--chopped finely
2 tablespoon Szechuan bean sauce
1 tablespoon Chili sauce
1 teaspoon chicken powder (optional)
2 cups water (you may use chicken stock instead so you can skip the chicken powder)

Directions:
Heat up the vegetable oil on medium heat, put in the garlic, bean sauce, black bean, and chili sauce. Stir everything until the oil becomes red.
Then put in the bamboo shoots and tofu. Stir everything evenly. Put in the water with chicken powder (or chicken stock only). Turn up the stove to bring it to a boil, then turn the stove to medium heat.
You may cover it with a lid. Let it cook until the water has evaporated. Then put in the green onion and stir everything evenly, you are ready to serve.
NOTE: There is usually salt in the bean sauce, black beans, and chili sauce. You do not need to add any more salt :)
