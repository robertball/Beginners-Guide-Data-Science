Ingredients:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
2 med. onions, finely diced
2 red bell peppers, finely diced
1 tsp. sugar
2 tsp. balsamic or red wine vinegar
salt
freshly ground pepper
1/2 to 1 tsp. capers
............................
1 loaf French bread
4 oz. goat cheese

Directions:
To make the red pepper relish, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until tender and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.
Stir in the peppers and cook 10 more minutes, stirring often. Mix in the sugar, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan, and cook until the mixture is very soft and the juices are somewhat caramelized, not watery, about 20 more minutes. Stir occasionally.
Scrape the mixture into a bowl, then stir in the capers. Let cool completely; chill until ready to use. Bring the relish back to room temperature before serving.
Slice the French bread horizontally and cut into 3- to 4-inch lengths. Heat in a 400-degree oven until slightly crisp(not hard).
Spread some goat cheese on each piece, then top with a spoonful of the pepper relish.
