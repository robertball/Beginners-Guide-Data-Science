Ingredients:
8-10 pounds beef rib roast, bone-in
10 cloves garlic, minced
2  tablespoons olive oil
2  teaspoons salt
2  teaspoons ground black pepper
2  teaspoons dried thyme

Directions:
Place roast in a roasting pan, ribs down. Combine garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper and thyme in a small bowl. Mix well. Spread mixture across the layer of fat on the roast and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 500°F, or as high as your oven will go. Make sure not to turn on your broiler!
Roast beef in the center of oven for 20 minutes. Decrease temperature to 325°F and continue roasting for 1 to 2-1/4 hours longer until a meat thermometer inserted into the center registers 135°F for medium rare. Now the rib will rise in temperature up to 10 degrees out of the oven while resting.
Allow to sit 10-15 minutes before carving meat from the bone and slicing.
Cooking the rib this way will give you all different temperatures of meat. The ends will be more well done and the center more rare.
