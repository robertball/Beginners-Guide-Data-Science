Ingredients:
6 prepared croissants
4oz smoked salmon, chopped
2 scallions, slivered
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 medium white onion, diced
3 tbsp butter
1 cup monterey jack cheese, shredded
1 cup swiss cheese, shredded
1 cup shredded mozzarella
12 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk
2 tbsp dill (fresh preferably)
1 tsp salt
fresh cracked black pepper

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
Slice the croissants in half, reserving the tops and breaking up the bottom portion.
Melt the butter over medium heat.
Sautee the garlic and white onion until fragrant and translucent.
Beat the eggs with the milk until frothy.
Layer the torn croissant pieces, egg mixture, cheese, dill, salmon, garli/onion and sliced scallions in a non-stick oven pan sprinkling each layer with fresh black pepper and salt. Top the casserole with the croissant tops, pressing them into the casserole so that they moisten.
Bake in the preheated oven until the eggs are done and the croissants are browned. Serve hot.
