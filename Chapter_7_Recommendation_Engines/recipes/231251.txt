Description: 
My 7-year-old daughter requested cheeseburger tacos for dinner one night, so I created this and all the kids loved it! The adults also raved after tweaking their tacos by adding onions, peppers, hot sauce, etc. to the meat mixture. Serve with hamburger toppings on the side. This is a very kid friendly recipe!
