Ingredients:
2-3 pound pork loin roast
1 tablespoon chili powder - divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup apple jelly
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Mix 1/2 tablespoon chili powder with garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Pat roast with paper towel  to remove excess moisture, coat with spice mix on all sides evenly.
Place pork roast in a shallow roasting pan or small rimmed baking tray (no rack needed).
Bake for 25-28 minutes per pound.
In a small saucepan combine ketchup, apple jelly, apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder.  Heat over low heat until jelly is melted and all ingredients well combined, raise heat to medium low and allow to come to simmer for 1-2 minutes.  Remove from flame but keep warm (back of stove usually is fine.)
Glaze pork roast with sauce about 10 minutes before removing from oven.
Remove pork from oven when internal temperature measures 150°.
Cover with foil and allow to rest 10-15 minutes.
Transfer pork to serving platter and stir any juices left on tray into sauce.
Slice pork thinly, serve with sauce.
