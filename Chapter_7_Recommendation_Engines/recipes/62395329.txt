Ingredients:
2 lbs Okra, cut in 1/2 pieces
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 cup plain flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
2 tbsp Cajun seasonings
Salt
Vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place cut okra in bowl with buttermilk and let soak while oil heats up to 350 degrees.  Mix the flour, cornmeal, and cajun seasoning together in a gallon size zip bag.  Once the oil is ready, transfer approximately a fourth of the buttermilk soaked okra into the bag with the flour mixture and shake to coat well.  Shake off the excess flour mixture and carefully put it in the hot oil.  Fry until golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and salt to taste. Serve while warm.
