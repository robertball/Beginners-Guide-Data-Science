Description: 
Nothing sets the mood on a cold winter day better than a roaring fire and a hot buttered rum. This is a single-serving recipe. If done right, this drink tastes like melted caramel swirling over your tongue. That makes it too sweet to drink with a meal, but also one of the best dessert drinks ever made. Drink these in moderation.
