Ingredients:
1 boneless chicken breast (8-9 ounces)
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
(or fresh of any of the above)
1 Tablespoon cornstarch mixed w/a little water for thickening
4 ounces (uncooked) egg noodles

Directions:
Start water for egg noodles.  When water boils, cook noodles according to package directions.
Cut chicken breasts into 1" squares (bite-sized). Heat olive oil in a medium skillet, and brown the garlic, onion, and chicken breasts.  Sprinkle lightly with pepper and sea salt, if desired.  Pour tomatoes and balsamic vinegar over chicken, and season with basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes.
Add the cornstarch and water mixture and thicken the sauce.  Add the cooked noodles.  Simmer for another 3-4 minutes and serve.
