Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) prepared pie crust
1 cup diced ham
2 1/2 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese
1 1/4 cups milk
4 eggs, whisked
1 red bell pepper, diced, or more to taste
1 medium onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place pie crust in a 9-inch glass pie plate.
Cook ham in a skillet over medium heat until it no longer looks moist, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
Combine Cheddar cheese, milk, eggs, bell pepper, onion, garlic, black pepper, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Stir in ham. Pour into the prepared pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden, top is starting to color, and filling is set, about 1 hour.
