Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar Pace® Picante Sauce
1/2 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
6 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
1 green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Stir 3/4 cup picante sauce, sour cream and chili powder in a medium bowl.
Stir the picante sauce mixture, chicken and cheese in a large bowl.
Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll up the tortillas and place seam-side up in a lightly greased 11x8-inch shallow baking dish. Pour the remaining picante sauce over the filled tortillas. Cover the baking dish.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until the enchiladas are hot and bubbling. Top with the onion.
