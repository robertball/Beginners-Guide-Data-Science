Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup rice
2 slices bacon
1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
2 eggs, beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cinnamon sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon into small pieces.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggs until set, about 5 minutes. Season scrambled eggs with salt and pepper.
Layer rice, eggs, and bacon in a bowl; top generously with cinnamon sugar.

Description: 
This is a dish my mother used to make when I was a kid. It's great and when I made this for my ex-wife, she fell in love with it... and it's requested all the time.
