Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/4-inch slices
2 slices whole wheat sandwich bread
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon dried thyme
½ teaspoon dried rosemary
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried marjoram
1  egg
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
¼ cup olive oil

Directions:
Cut each tofu slice into thirds, widthwise. Press each slice between paper towels to drain as much liquid as possible. Place on a plate and freeze, about 1 hour.
Place bread in a food processor. Add Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, and marjoram. Blend to make fine bread crumbs. Pour into a small bowl.
Beat egg in a bowl. Dip tofu slices into egg and coat in bread crumbs. Place breaded tofu on a plate. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place 1/3 of the tofu into the pan. Cook, turning over halfway, until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tofu.
