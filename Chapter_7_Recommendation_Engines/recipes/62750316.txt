Ingredients:
2 slices bread (I used whole wheat)
1/2 medium onion finely diced
1 clove garlic minced
1/2 tablespoon sunflower oil
1 pound ground chicken
1/4 cup fresh parsley (1 T if using dry)
1 egg
1 can 8oz pineapple pieces- no sugar added drained- set juice aside for sauce
Sauce
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup natural sugar
1/4 cup pineapple juice (from can of pineapple)
1 1/2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
?Pre-heat oven to 400°.
?In a small skillet, heat sunflower oil over medium heat.  Add in onions and garlic, cooking until onions become translucent (3-4 minutes.)  Set aside to cool slightly.
Using a food processor, turn bread into crumbs (if you don't have a food processor, just shred with your hands.)  In a large bowl combine all the ingredients for the meatballs and stir until everything is mixed thoroughly.  Shape into 12 meatballs and place in a 9x13 pan.  Sprinkle pineapple pieces over meatballs.
?Whisk together ingredients for sweet and sour sauce, adjusting sugar and pineapple sauce for desired sweetness.  Once ready, cover meatballs in the sweet and sour sauce.  Bake for 23-25 minutes until meatballs are cooked all the way through.

I started craving meatballs. I set out to make chicken meatballs.  I had skeptics (you can’t make chicken meatballs) but the end result was delicious and even the skeptic though so!  Perfect for a meal
