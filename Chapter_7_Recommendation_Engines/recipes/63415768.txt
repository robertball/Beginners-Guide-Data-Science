Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
4 eggs
2 cups flour
1 cup melted butter
1/2 tablespoon ground cardamom (more or less to taste)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Line your stovetop (around your burner) with foil. There is a lot of butter in these wafer cookies, and as you turn the Krumkake iron some butter may leak out onto your stove. Using foil around your burner will save lots of clean-up.
Spray the Krumkake iron with Pam.
Preheat the Krumkake iron. It takes about 5 – 6 minutes to heat up over a medium-high flame. Don’t forget to flip it to warm both sides.
Using an electric mixer, beat eggs slightly. Gradually add sugar and continue to beat until light and creamy. Slowly add melted butter.
Sift flour and fold into egg mixture with cardamom and vanilla.
Drop by teaspoonful onto heated Krumkake iron. Cook on both sides for about a minute over a medium-high flame; then remove and roll on a cone shaped form.
Remove from cone when cool or when the krumkake holds its shape.
Repeat process until all the batter is used.
Serve plain or fill with sweetened whipped cream and strawberries.
