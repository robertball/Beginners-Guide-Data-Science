Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
1/4 cup mashed potato flakes
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
2 tablespoons sugar
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. In a saucepan, heat water and oil to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat until blended. Beat in eggs until smooth. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Place in a grease bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into loaves. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
With all the sweet breads that get served during the holidays, it's nice to make this nutritious wheat bread. I use it for sandwiches and also enjoy it toasted and buttered.                      --Carol Forcum, Marion, Illinois
