Description: 
This adorable dessert for one tastes just like the real thing, but it makes me feel indulgent and sophisticated because I get to eat it with a spoon!  You can make as many as you need and have enough for a crowd in a snap!  If you want, you can make a Rocky Road version by adding some chopped walnuts:)
