Description: 
This is a wonderful, slightly creamy egg dish. The chopped parsley gives it tons of great color! If you can't find Creme Fraiche in your grocery store, just combine 1 tablespoon of buttermilk to 8oz (1 cup) of heavy cream. Stir together, and pour into a mason jar. Very lightly screw the lid on and let sit for 5-8 hours. Then it can be refrigerated 10-14 days.
