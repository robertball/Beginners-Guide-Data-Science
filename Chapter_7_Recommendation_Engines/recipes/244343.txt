Ingredients:
1 Smithfield® Garlic & Herb Seasoned Pork Sirloin
3 egg yolks
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
8 tablespoons butter
8 large eggs
4 English muffins

Directions:
Cook pork sirloin according to the directions on the package.
For the hollandaise sauce: Whisk 3 egg yolks, 1 tablespoon milk and 1 tablespoon lemon juice in a pan over medium heat.
Slowly add 8 tablespoons melted butter while stirring vigorously until combined.
For the poached eggs: Fill a sauce pan with three inches of simmering water. Carefully crack eggs into water and cook for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.
An egg poacher can also be used in place of this method to simplify things.
Toast English muffins and top each one with a slice of pork sirloin, an egg and hollandaise sauce.
