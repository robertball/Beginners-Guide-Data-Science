Ingredients:
1 pound dried Corona beans
3 quarts cold water
2 bay leaves
1 large red onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, sliced
2 cups tomato sauce
2 tablespoons tomato paste
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 cups water, or more as needed
4 ounces feta cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill

Directions:
Place Corona beans in a large bowl. Cover with a generous amount of water and let soak, 8 hours to overnight.
Drain beans into a pot. Add 3 quarts fresh water and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, stir, and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until just tender but not too soft, 45 to 60 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drain beans and spread into a large casserole dish. Add red onion, garlic, tomato sauce, tomato paste, honey, 1/2 cup dill, olive oil, salt, pepper, cayenne, vinegar, and water. Mix until well combined. Place dish onto a lined baking sheet to catch any spills.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is bubbling and caramelized and beans are soft, about 1 hour. Check periodically and add more water if casserole is too dry.
Stir casserole and smooth the top. Garnish with feta cheese and 1 tablespoon dill.

Description: 
I used to believe the best baked beans came from Boston or Texas, but ever since I discovered this very hearty giant bean casserole, I have to give it to the Greeks. 'Big Fat' refers not only to size of the beans, but also to the huge flavor of this dish. Use the largest beans you can find: Gigante beans are the best, but Corona and lima beans also work great. Serve alongside grilled meat or simply with extra feta for a great vegetarian main.
