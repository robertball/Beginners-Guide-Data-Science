Description: 
These delicious Caramel Cookie Waffles (called Stroopwafels by the Dutch) with richly filled chewy centers are one of Holland's true specialties.

The history of the Stroopwafel goes back until 1784. A baker from Gouda baked a waffle of old crumbs and spices and filled this waffle with syrup. The Stroopwafel was born. In fact the Stroopwafel was a rest product. And therefor a popular pastry among the poor.
During 1784 the Stroopwafel was only known in Gouda. Nowadays every bakery in Gouda has its own recipe.

Did you know.... that every Dutchman eats about 20 Stroopwafels a year!
