Ingredients:
1/2 cup almond flour (add more as necessary to get a workable dough consistency)
1 egg
1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
Italian spices such as oregano and basil to taste

Directions:
In a bowl, mix all the ingredients and add more flour as needed to form a ball. Oil a pan with olive oil and add the dough ball, pressing down with both hands to form the shape of a small pizza crust.  Don't worry if it's not as big as the pan.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit with the crust in the pan (this allows the crust to set up and brown). By the time the oven heats up, the crust should be crisp and ready for toppings.
Add desired toppings, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 10 minutes.
