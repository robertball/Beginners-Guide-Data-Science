Ingredients:
15 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup olive oil
4 (8 ounce) flat iron steaks
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange garlic cloves on a baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over garlic.
Bake garlic in preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once to prevent burning. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
Place cooled garlic and 1/2 cup olive oil in a food processor; blend until mixture is a paste.
Season steaks with salt and pepper. Rub garlic paste on both sides of each steak.
Place a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the steaks until the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 5 minutes per side. Remove the whole pan from the heat and let stand until steaks reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), or your desired degree of doneness.
