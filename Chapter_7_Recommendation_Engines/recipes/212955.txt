Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (9 ounce) box frozen peas and carrots
1 (1.5 ounce) box raisins
1 small potato, diced

Directions:
Cook the ground pork in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat the olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the browned pork into the onion mixture; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Mix the potato, peas and carrots, and raisins into the pork; allow the mixture to cook together until the vegetables are completely tender, about 10 minutes. Allow the filling to cool completely before spooning into empanada dough.
