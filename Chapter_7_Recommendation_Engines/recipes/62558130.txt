Description: 
I grew up drinking this tea at my grandmother's house and I now fix it at my house on really cold days, when I am sick (lots of vitamin C!), and at Christmas.  It is perfect to let simmer on the stove to make the house smell good and to serve to guests.  I have no idea why its called Russian tea, that is just what my grandmother always called it.
