Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Penne pasta
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced crosswise
1 (24 ounce) jar Barilla® Roasted Garlic Sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
In a small bowl combine 1 cup chickpeas, 1 tablespoon oil, and salt; spread in an even layer in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan.
Roast chickpeas about 30 minutes or until browned and crisp, stirring once halfway through roasting; cool completely.
In a food processor blend remaining chickpeas until finely processed; set aside.
In a large pot bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a rolling boil; add salt to taste and the Penne; stir gently.
Cook pasta according to package directions; remove from heat and drain well, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium heat; saute zucchini for 2 to 3 minutes; remove zucchini from pan and set aside.
In the same saucepan stir together the Roasted Garlic sauce and processed chickpeas; bring to a very low simmer.
While pasta is draining, pour Roasted Garlic sauce mixture into large pot; stir in zucchini and 1 tablespoon rosemary; stir in pasta.
Stir in up to 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid until desired consistency is reached; serve immediately topped with roasted chickpeas and crumbled feta.
