Ingredients:
4 boneless and skinless chicken breast halves
Â¼ cup (50 mL) all purpose flour
Â½ tsp (2 mL) salt
Â½ tsp (2 mL) black pepper
1 tbsp (15 mL) butter
1 tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 cup (250 mL) fresh mushrooms, sliced
Â½ cup (125 mL) dry white wine
2 tbsp (30 mL) fresh lemon juice
2 tbsp (30 mL) capers, drained
1 cup (250 mL) Tre Stelle® Grana Padano Parmesan Cheese, grated
1/2 cup (125 mL) fresh Italian parsley, chopped
4 cups (8 ounces) linguini pasta noodles

Directions:
Between two pieces of plastic wrap flatten chicken breasts to 1/4” thickness. Mix together flour, salt and pepper; dredge chicken breasts in mixture, shake off excess flour and set aside. Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until nicely browned and cooked through: approximately 15 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and keep warm in a low oven if desired. Scrape skillet to loosen brown bits; add mushrooms, wine, lemon juice and capers to the pan. Increase heat to medium high and cook for 5 minutes. Meanwhile in a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook pasta until al dente and drain.
Place pasta and chicken on a serving dish and pour mushroom sauce over both. Top with grated Grana Padano Parmesan and Italian parsley.
