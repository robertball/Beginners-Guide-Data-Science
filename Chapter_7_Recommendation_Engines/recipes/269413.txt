Description: 
For years, my family and I have been searching for a good, traditional-tasting coquito recipe. After having tried the whole egg yolk thing, simply adding ingredients to regular eggnog, and others, I found the best-tasting to be the most basic. This recipe ensures everyone at the party gets a taste, but you may want to double the recipe, because most will not settle for just a shot's worth.
