Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cube beef bouillon
wooden paint stir sticks

Directions:
Combine ground turkey, soy sauce, honey, Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar, liquid smoke, garlic powder, pepper, ginger, olive oil, and beef bouillon in a large bowl. Mix well and cover. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 12 hours.
Tape 2 paint stir sticks 2 inches apart on a flat work surface. Cover with a large piece of plastic wrap. Place a golfball-sized piece of turkey mixture between the sticks. Cover with another piece of plastic wrap. Roll turkey mixture into a thin strip using a rolling pin. Transfer strip to a dehydrator tray. Repeat with remaining turkey mixture.
Dehydrate at 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) until thoroughly dried, 5 to 8 hours.
