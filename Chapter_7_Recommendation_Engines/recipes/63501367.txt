Directions
1. Turn the crockpot to high. Add onions, garlic, sugar, butter and balsamic vinegar.
2. Cover, and let cook for at least one hour, stirring on occasion to brown the onions.
3. After one hour add the flour, beer, stock, thyme and salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook for 6 – 8 hours.
4. Prior to serving, dish out soup portions into oven safe bowls. Cover each bowl with a piece of toasted bread, a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and a healthy pile of cheese.
5. If the soup was still hot, place the bowls under the broiler for 4 – 5 minutes, keeping as close eye. If the soup was cold, place in a 350 degree oven for15 minutes and then finish under the broiler until cheese melts.
Enjoy!
