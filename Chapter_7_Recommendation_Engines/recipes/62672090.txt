Ingredients:
1 lb good quality round steak, sliced stir fry style
1/2 cup soy sauce (I swear by Silver Swan)
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup peanut oil
1/3 cup rice wine vinegar
1/3 cup minced garlic (we love garlic, adjust to taste)
1 medium sweet onion, chopped stir fry style
2 cups chopped fresh asparagus (1 inch pieces)
1-2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 bunch green onions, chopped into 1 inch pieces
1 red bell pepper, sliced stir fry style
1 cup whole roasted cashews (I use unsalted)
3 tbs sesame seeds
corn starch

Directions:
slice beef, place in large ziplock bag.  Combine soy, sugar, oil, rice wine vinegar, garlic, and 1 tbs sesame seeds and add to ziplock.  Refrigerate overnight if able, or as long as possible, (I have gone as little as 30 minutes, but overnight is best).  Pour entire contents of ziplock into wok, cook on high for about 3-4 minutes until beef is browned well.  Add vegetables, mushrooms, and cook another 3-4 minutes stirring frequently to coat everything in the marinade.  Add cashews and 1 tbs sesame seeds, continue cooking until desired doneness is achieved.  Thicken as necessary with corn starch (about 1 tbs should do it quickly)   Garnish with remaining 1 tbs sesame seeds and serve.

Description: 
Very good stir fry.  A little on the sweet side.  Cook in a large wok on med high heat.  Marinading overnight is good, but not necessary.
