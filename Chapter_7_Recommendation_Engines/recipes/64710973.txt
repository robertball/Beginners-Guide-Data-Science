Ingredients:
2 medium russet potatoes, cut into wedges
1 1/2  Tbsp. olive oil
1/2 tsp. sea salt
1/8 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. parsley flakes
1/2 tsp. chili powder

Directions:
1. Set the air fryer to 400 degrees so that is is preheated once the potatoes are assembled.
2. Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add all remaining ingredients and mix well to combine.
3. Place 8 wedges in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes.
4. Flip wedges with tongs and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining 8 wedges.
*Note* The easiest way to wedge a potato is to cut it in half lengthwise. Place each half flesh side down on the cutting board and cut each half lengthwise again. You will end up with 4 large wedges at this point. Cut eat wedge in half lengthwise giving you a total of 8 wedges per potato.
