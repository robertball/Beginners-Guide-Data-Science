Ingredients:
FONDANT CENTRES
1 can (15oz) sweetened condensed milk
1 cup (1/2 lb) butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla or almond extract
1/2 tsp salt
12 cups (3 lbs) approximately, icing sugar, sifted
Yellow food colouring
--
CHOCOLATE DIP
2 lbs sweet chocolate chunks/wafers
--
ROYAL ICING
2 egg whites at room temperature
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
2-1/4 cups icing sugar, sifted
1 tsp vanilla or almod extract

Directions:
FONDANT CENTRES
Cream together butter, salt & vanilla
Add sweetened condensed milk & beat until smooth
Gradually beat in icing sugar until beaters no longer move easily then switch to spoon
Place on board/counter to continue kneading/mixing by hand
Add enough icing sugar until the fondant easily lifts off the counter
Divide fondant into 3rds
To one third add yellow food colouring (for "yolk")
Divide yellow fondant into 24 equal pieces and roll into balls
Divide each of remaining 2 thirds of white fondant into 12 equal pieces
Roll each into a ball and flatten it
Place the yellow “yolk” in the center of the egg “white,” and wrap the white around the yellow ball. Form into an egg shape, and place on baking sheet lined with waxed paper
Cover with plastic wrap
Place in fridge to chill at least 1 hour, or even overnight
CHOCOLATE DIPPING
Put chocolate in double-boiler over hot water, stirring constantly until melted
Cool chocolate to 85ºF, stirring to cool evenly; use a candy thermometer to help maintain the temperature during dipping
Using tongs, first dip the flat bottom of the egg, twisting the wrist to allow excess chocolate to drip off into the bowl. Place chocolate side up on the counter to dry while doing the rest. By the time the bottoms are all coated, the first ones will be dry
Repeat for tops. Any marks left can easily be covered when icing
Set on waxed paper and put in fridge to cool
Allow eggs to set, then decorate with Royal Icing, or leave undecorated and wrap in coloured foil
ROYAL ICING
In medium bowl, using electric mixer, beat eggs with cream of tartar until foamy
Gradually add icing sugar until mixture quite stiff
Divide into as many bowls as you'd like different colors. Coloring may thin icing; if so add more icing sugar

As children, we made these to raise money for our church group. We took orders ahead of time and personalized the eggs by request. They were a sure-fire money-maker every year!
