Ingredients:
2 cups chocolate wafer crumbs
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
4 ounces milk chocolate candy bar, chopped
2 cups whipped topping
1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted

Directions:
In a bowl, combine wafer crumbs and butter. Press onto the bottom and 1-1/2 in. up the sides of a greased 9-in. springform pan. Chill for 15 minutes or until set.
In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined. Stir in chocolate chips. Pour into crust.
Place pan on a baking sheet. Bake at 325 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.
For frosting, in a microwave-safe bowl, melt candy bar; stir until smooth. Cool to room temperature. Gradually stir in whipped topping. Remove sides of springform pan. Frost top of cheesecake; garnish with almonds. Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
Heavenly is a good description for this luscious dessert, conveniently made a day ahead. When I dont have a candy bar on hand, I melt  cup of chocolate chips to use in the frosting. Whipped cream can be used in place of the whipped topping. --Arlene Butler, Ogden, Utah
