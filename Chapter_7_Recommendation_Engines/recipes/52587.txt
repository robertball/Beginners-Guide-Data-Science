Ingredients:
3 green bell peppers, seeded and finely chopped
2 (4 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers, drained
1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar
6 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 (6 fluid ounce) container liquid fruit pectin
5 drops green food coloring (optional)

Directions:
Combine the bell peppers, chile peppers, vinegar, sugar, and cayenne pepper in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. When the mixture comes to a rolling boil that cannot be stirred down, stir in the pectin. Cook for 5 more minutes at a boil, then remove from the heat. Stir in the green food coloring, if desired.
Ladle jelly into hot sterile jars leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Process jars in a boiling water bath for 5 to 10 minutes to ensure a good seal.
