Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup shredded Gouda cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)
2 cups chopped cooked broccoli
1 3/4 cups diced cooked chicken
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk in cream cheese, Gouda cheese, mayonnaise, chicken broth, and ranch dressing mix. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until completely incorporated, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in broccoli, chicken, salt, and pepper until combined. Transfer to a casserole dish and top with Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and broccoli-chicken mixture is heated through, about 25 minutes. Switch the oven to broil, and cool until cheese starts to brown, 2 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
Following the keto diet, this casserole is cheesy, creamy, and easy to prepare. Any cheese can be used and any cut of chicken. I prefer chicken thighs because I find them more flavorful. The choice is yours.
