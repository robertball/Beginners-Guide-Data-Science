Description: 
I found this recipe a while ago on a Swedish blog, and I have made it many times since then. I made some moderations to make it even better, and now it's the whole family's favorite snack. 
It tastes just like Snickers® but instead of artificial flavorings and white sugar you get healthy ingredients like almonds, dates, and dark chocolate. Try it--you won't be disappointed!
