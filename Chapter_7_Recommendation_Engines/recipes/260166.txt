Description: 
This delicious, quick, and easy fruit smoothie recipe is super sweet and very tasty and it makes a fantastic breakfast. We've used frozen fruit in this recipe as it helps make the smoothie nice and cold, but fresh fruit also works well too. You can add any greens to the recipe if you like - baby spinach or kale is masked well by the fruity flavors of the raspberry and cherry.
