Ingredients:
1 32 ounce bag of frozen crinkle cut french fries
2 tablespoons Old Bay™ crab seasoning (or more to taste)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
For the cheese sauce:
8 ounces white American cheese diced (Such as Kraft™ DELUX)
1/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp Old Bay ™ crab seasoning

Directions:
Pre heat oven to 400 degrees.
Toss frozen potatoes together with oil in a large bowl.
Add Old Bay™ crab seasoning and toss to coat.
Place on foil lined baking sheet and bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until crispy.
While fries are baking make the cheese sauce:
Place milk and Old Bay ™ in a heavy bottomed sauce pan over low heat. When milk begins to steam and little bubbles begin around the edges, add the diced cheese. Stir gently and frequently until all cheese is melted. Note: the sauce will form a "skin" on the surface when left standing. Gently stir and it will melt.
Serve immediately, on the side, as a dipping sauce with hot fries.

Description: 
My version of our local Chickie & Pete's restaurant Crab Fries. No crab meat is in the recipe, just the seasoning.  These were created for the customers missing crabs in the month's crabs were not available.
