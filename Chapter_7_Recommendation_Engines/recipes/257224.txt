Ingredients:
Dipping Sauce:
1/3 cup vegetarian hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon water, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek (chile paste), or more to taste
Seasoning Sauce:
1 tablespoon vegetarian oyster sauce
1 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek (chile paste) (optional)
1/2 teaspoon mushroom seasoning
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
Wraps:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 slices ginger
5 ounces fried tofu, diced
4 ounces jicama, peeled and diced
3 fresh shiitake mushrooms, diced
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
8 large butterhead lettuce leaves
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds, or to taste

Directions:
Mix hoisin sauce, 1 teaspoon water, and 1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek together to make dipping sauce.
Mix oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon water, 1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek, mushroom seasoning, sesame oil, sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl to make seasoning sauce.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tofu, jicama, shiitake mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper; cook and stir until mushrooms are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and seasoning sauce; cook and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
Place 1 to 2 tablespoons of tofu mixture in the center of each lettuce leaf. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Add 1 teaspoon dipping sauce; roll up lettuce to enclose tofu mixture. Repeat with remaining tofu mixture and lettuce leaves. Serve remaining dipping sauce alongside.
