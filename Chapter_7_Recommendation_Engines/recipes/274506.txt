Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound kielbasa sausage, sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms (optional)
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch crushed red pepper, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 cup frozen peas
3 leaves fresh basil, julienned, or more to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil for pasta.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a deep skillet. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil and saute just until tender, about 5 minutes. Add kielbasa to the skillet and cook and stir until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, mushrooms, sugar, balsamic, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. Reduce heat and let sauce simmer while you cook pasta.
Add penne to the pot of boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, stirring peas into pasta during last 2 minutes of cooking time.
Drain pasta and transfer to sauce. Stir to combine and add basil. Heat over medium-low heat so pasta can absorb liquid from sauce, about 5 minutes. Stir in Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese and serve.

Description: 
Inspired by several recipes here, I created this pasta skillet with what I had on hand, and everyone loved it! Nice change from regular pasta and meat, have to try it with fresh tomatoes when they are ready from the garden!
