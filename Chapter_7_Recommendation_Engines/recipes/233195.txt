Ingredients:
10 small fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1 serrano pepper, halved
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (12 ounce) jar HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce, divided
4 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 1-inch chunks
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas, warmed
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cooked and shredded
1 avocado, peeled and sliced
8 slices Swiss cheese
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
Sour cream

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Roast halved tomatillos and halved serrano pepper on grill, turning to brown on all sides, about 8 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Reserve 2 ounces of the tomatillo verde cooking sauce for serving. Place roasted tomatillos, serrano pepper, onion, garlic, salt, chicken broth and 10 ounces verde cooking sauce into blender. Blend for 15 seconds. Add chunks of Swiss cheese. Blend again. (If the sauce tastes too spicy, add 1 tablespoon of sour cream.) Pour 1/4 cup of enchilada sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish to coat the bottom.
Divide chicken among the tortillas, and roll them up. Arrange in baking dish, seam side down. Pour enchilada sauce over rolled tortillas. Lay Swiss cheese slices on top of sauce and top with avocado slices. Sprinkle the casserole with shredded cheese.
Cover with foil and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes; uncover and bake 10 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with the reserved sauce. Top with sour cream or Mexican table crema.
