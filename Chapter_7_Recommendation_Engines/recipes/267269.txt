Ingredients:
1 pound extra-lean ground beef
1/4 medium onion, diced
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 head cabbage, shredded
3 carrots, shredded, or more to taste
3 (16 ounce) packages wonton wrappers

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add cabbage and carrots. Cover and steam, stirring occasionally, until cabbage and carrots are limp, about 20 minutes. Remove filling from heat.
Place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of a wrapper using 2 spoons. Fold wonton wrapper in half to form a triangle. Seal edges by moistening with a little water and pressing edges flat. Bring 2 opposite corners together and moisten to seal one over the other.
Mandu can be steamed, boiled, pan-fried, or deep-fried just like any other dumpling.

Description: 
Easy Korean dumplings that will disappear in a flash. This is the basic recipe. If you are a more experienced chef, you can experiment with other spices or meats, use scallions in the place of onion, etc. You can freeze these or cook them right away by frying, steaming, or adding to simmering soup. Serve with soy sauce for dipping.
