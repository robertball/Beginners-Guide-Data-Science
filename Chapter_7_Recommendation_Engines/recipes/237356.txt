Ingredients:
2  cooked chicken breast halves, shredded
⅓ cup honey
¼ cup freshly squeezed lime juice
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (14 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
½ cup heavy whipping cream
12  corn tortillas
2 cups shredded queso asadero (white Mexican cheese)

Directions:
Place shredded chicken in a bowl.
Whisk honey, lime juice, chili powder, and garlic together in a bowl; pour over chicken and toss to coat. Marinate chicken in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix enchilada sauce and cream together in a shallow bowl. Dip 1 tortilla in enchilada sauce mixture and place in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat dipping tortillas and arranging in the dish until bottom of dish is covered.
Spread 1/2 the chicken mixture over dipped-tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1/3 the queso asadero over chicken layer. Dip more tortillas in enchilada sauce mixture and arrange over queso asadero layer. Spoon 2 to 3 spoonful enchilada sauce mixture over tortilla layer. Repeat layering with remaining chicken, 1/3 queso asadero, ending with a layer of dipped tortillas. Pour any remaining enchilada sauce mixture over tortillas. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 queso asadero over enchiladas.
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is melted and golden, about 30 minutes.
