2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar, or to taste
2 Tbsp white vinegar, or to taste
Salt and black pepper to taste

In a large mixing bowl,  add shredded cabbage, sliced cucumbers, thawed peas and green onion and toss lightly to combine.
Drizzle salad with 3 to 4 Tbsp oil, 2 Tbsp cider vinegar, 2 Tbsp white vinegar and toss to combine. Before serving, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste (start with ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp black pepper and go up from there). You can also add more vinegar to taste if your cabbage was larger.
