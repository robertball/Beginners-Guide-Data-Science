Ingredients:
450g Sirloin beef (frozen)
3 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp white sugar
1/2 Tbsp brown sugar
2 Tbsp Korean cooking wine (or mirin)
1/2 an onion
4 stalks of spring onions
2 cloves of garlic crushed
1 Tbsp crushed ginger
1 Tsp Kiwi pulp
1 Tsp Sesame oil

Directions:
Cut the frozen beef in an angle and try to cut the slices as thin as possible. This is easier when beef is frozen.
In a bowl, mix soy sauce, sugars, garlic, ginger and rice wine together. Add the beef and mix well. Add the kiwi and mix again. (The kiwi will make your beef very tender, do not use more than a tsp) Then add the onions and leave to marinate for a few hours in the fridge.
After the meat has soaked up a bit of the mariande add the sesame oil and mix well. (do not add the oil at the beginning as it prevents the flavours to soak into the meat).
Leave to marinate over night.
Heat a wok or a large pan with some oil and add the beef. Stir fry it until it's cooked. You do not need to discard the marinade.
Serve over steamed rice.

Mmmmmh, I enjoyed my mum's cooking for many many years, having moved away from home, I needed to learn cooking Korean dishes asap. I experimented a little bit, knowing what the basic ingredients for Bulgogi was and voila! This is a delicious, melt in your mouth beef dish, perfect with steamed rice!
