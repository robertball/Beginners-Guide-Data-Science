Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup flour
3 Tb powdered sugar
1 stick margarine
Pie Filling:
4 cups cantaloupe puree (about 1 large ripe canaloupe)
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup flour
1/3 cup cornstarch
1/4 tsp salt
3 egg yolks
3 Tb water
1 Tb margarine
Topping:
8 oz Neufchatel cream cheese
1/2 cup sugar
1 Tb milk
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
1) Combine flour and powdered sugar.  Cut in margarine until crumbly.  Press on bottom and up sides of 9" deep-dish pie plate.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.  Cool and set aside.
2) Place cataloupe in medium saucepan.  Combine sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt and stir into the cantaloupe (it does need that much flour and cornstarch).  Cook and stir until it comes to a boil and is thickened.  Beat egg yolks with water in small bowl; stir in a few spoonfuls of cantaloupe filling; pour all back into saucepan.  Cook and stir 2 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Stir in 1 Tb margarine.  Cool slightly, then pour into cooled pie shell.
3) Cream the Neufchatel and sugar.  Beat in milk and vanilla.  Spread over cantaloupe layer.  Chill pie well before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of a not-often heard of recipe, but it is one of the best pies I have ever eaten.  The crust melts in your mouth and the pie is scrumptious.  Wonderful for a summertime dessert.
