Ingredients:
-1 3/4 cups Quick-Cook Quaker Oats (uncooked)
-1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
-3/4 cup brown sugar
-1/2 cup chopped nuts (I used pecans, but anything you prefer should do fine)
-1/2 tsp. baking soda
-1/2 tsp. salt
-3/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)
-2 cups fresh/frozen blueberries (fresh is better if you can find it)
-1/2 cup sugar
-3 tbsp. water
-2 tbsp. cornstarch

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Line an 8X10 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, (nuts), baking soda and salt in a bowl.
Add melted butter, mix just until crumbly (some bigger crumbs are OK).
Divide the crumbled mixture in half, pressing one half of the mixture onto the bottom of pan.
Bake for 10 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine the blueberries, sugar and 3tbsp. water.
Bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 minutes (uncovered) stirring occasionally. Add 2 tbsp. cornstarch into blueberry mixture and stir for about 30 seconds, or until thickened.
Spread blueberry mixture over partially baked base. Sprinkle with the remaining oat mixture, pressing the topping down into blueberries slightly.
Bake for another 18-20 minutes, or until topping is golden brown.
Cool on wire rack, then cut into bars and store tightly covered.

Description: 
These blueberry oat bars taste just like the ones you can buy at Starbucks, but they are homemade, and they taste even better! I found this recipe online some time ago and tried it out for myself (with a few tweaks). Much to my surprise, it's quite easy to do, and the results are fantastic!
