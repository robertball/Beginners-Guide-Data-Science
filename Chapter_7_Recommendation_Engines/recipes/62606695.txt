Ingredients:
1 Bunch Fresh Curly Parsley (Minced)
¼ cup fresh finely grated Carrots
¼ cup grated Mozzarella Cheese
2 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil
2 2/3 cups whole-wheat flour (DO NOT use white Flour)
2 Tablespoons unprocessed bran flakes (Crushed)
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ cup + 2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a small bowl mix the parsley, carrots, cheese and oil together.  In a mixing bowl stir together the flour, bran and baking powder. add the vegetable mixture and stir well.
Gradually add 1/2 cup of water and mix well.  Adding a little more water if needed to make the dough moist.  (I usually need the extra 2 tablespoons of water).  Kneed dough for one minute.
Roll out the dough to ½ inch thickness.  Using a small dog bone cookie cutter, cut out the 36 biscuits.
Bake in the warmed oven for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.
Leave the biscuits on the cookie tray for 5 minutes, before moving to a cooling rack.  (Biscuits will harden as they cool).
Once cooled, store in an airtight container.
