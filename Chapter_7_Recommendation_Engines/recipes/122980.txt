Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 acorn squash, halved and seeded
3/4 cup raisins
4 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Combine brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg; spoon into the squash halves. Sprinkle with raisins. Top each with 1 tablespoon of butter. Wrap each squash half individually in heavy-duty foil; seal tightly. Pour water into a slow cooker. Place the squash, cut side up, in slow cooker (packets may be stacked). Cover and cook on high for 4 hours or until the squash is tender. Open foil packets carefully to allow steam to escape.

Description: 
'Working full-time, I found I didn't always have time to cook the meals my family loved. So I re-created many of our favorites in the slow cooker,' notes Carol Greco of Centereach, New York. 'This cinnamony treatment for squash is one of them.'
