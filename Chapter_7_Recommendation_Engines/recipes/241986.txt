Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
4 teaspoons cocoa powder
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups quick cooking oats

Directions:
Stir sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa powder together in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, to dissolve sugar completely, 90 seconds to 2 minutes. Remove saucepan immediately from heat.
Stir peanut butter and vanilla extract into the milk mixture until smooth; add oats and stir to coat. Spoon the mixture onto a sheet of baking parchment and let sit until the mixture holds together, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I love these cookies! The only problem I have encountered in the past with making these, is that they seem to fall apart due to dryness. Adding more milk and less oatmeal (as this recipe directs), takes care of that problem.
