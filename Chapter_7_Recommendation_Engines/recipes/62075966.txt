Description: 
The easiest and tastiest recipe for  tortilla soup, Arizona style. Get the right kind of Rotel (in the blue can) -- it makes all the difference!  If you can't find it in the store, you can order it from texmex.net.  You can also add cooked chicken and/or avocado, but the basic version with only four ingredients is delicious.
