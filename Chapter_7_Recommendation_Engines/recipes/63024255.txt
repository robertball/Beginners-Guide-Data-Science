Ingredients:
The NEST
1 1/2 C wild rice
3 C boiling water
1 C brown rice
1 C chopped onion
1 C sliced carrots
3/4 C chopped celery
3 - 14.5 oz cans chicken broth
1/2 t thyme
1/4 t marjoram
1/2 t salt
1/4 t pepper
The HENS
3/4 C apple jelly
1 1/2 t cinnamon
6 Rock Cornish Game hens, halved

Directions:
The NEST
Soak wild rice in boiling water in heavy saucepan for 30 minutes. Drain; rinse thoroughly.  In Dutch oven or large skillet combine all nest ingredients.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat, simmer covered until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (50-60 minutes). Place into a 3 quart microwavable serving dish.  Serve immediately OR refrigerate until 10 minutes prior to serving. To reheat, microwave on HIGH, covered until heated through (approx 10-12 minutes).
The HENS
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In small saucepan, combine 1/4 C apple jelly and cinnamon.  Heat, stirring until jelly is melted, set aside.  Place hen halves, skin side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Sprinkle with salt. Roast 20 minutes.  Brush with jelly-cinnamon mixture. Roast 25-35 minutes longer until browned and tender.
Spoon rice onto individual plates, place hen half over the rice.

Description: 
Our Christmas Eve tradition - Cornish Game Hens over a bed of wild rice - pretty presentation!  The wild rice may be prepared a day ahead of time and warmed in the microwave just prior to serving.  My grocery store meat department splits the game hens when called 2 days prior to pickup.  NOTE-this recipe serves 12.
