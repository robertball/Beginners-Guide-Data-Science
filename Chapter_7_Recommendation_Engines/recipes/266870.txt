Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained
2 tablespoons pesto
1 clove garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups shredded provolone cheese, divided
1 loaf Italian bread, sliced in half lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine butter, tomatoes, pesto, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until thoroughly combined and tomatoes are chopped. Scrape into a bowl and stir in 1 cup shredded provolone cheese.
Grill bread on the preheated grill until toasted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Spread butter mixture equally onto cut sides of both halves of bread and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Grill bread, cut-side up, over indirect heat with grill covered, until toping melts, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly; cut into slices using a serrated knife. Serve warm.
