Ingredients:
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups low-fat buttermilk
3 tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1 cup wheat bran (also known as millers bran)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons flax seeds
2 tablespoons dried currants (or raisins)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a muffin pan with nonstick spray or line muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix applesauce, egg, buttermilk, oil, vanilla, salt, dry milk, and SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener together in a large mixing bowl using a wire whisk.  Stir until well blended.  Add remaining wheat bran, flour, baking soda, and cinnamon.   Stir well.  Add remaining ingredients and stir until well mixed.
Fill muffin cups with batter.  Sprinkle tops with some bran flakes as a garnish, if desired.  Bake in preheated 350 degrees F oven 20-25 minutes.  Muffins will spring back slightly to the touch when done. These muffins are best served warm!
