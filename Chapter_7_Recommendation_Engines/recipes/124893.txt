Ingredients:
1 quart strawberries, sliced
1 cup sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground nutmeg
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs, separated
2 cups sweetened whipped cream
fresh mint

Directions:
In a bowl, gently stir strawberries and 1/2 cup sugar; chill. Meanwhile, in another bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt and nutmeg; cut in butter until crumbly. Combine milk and egg yolks; mix well. Add to crumb mixture, stirring just until moistened. Divide and pat into two greased 9-in. round cake pans. In a small mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; spread over dough. Sprinkle with remaining sugar. Bake at 300 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. (Layer will be thin.) Cool completely. Place one cake layer on a large serving plate; spread with half of the whipped cream. Spoon half of the strawberries over cream. Repeat layers. Garnish with mint if desired.

Description: 
I love to pick strawberries in the morning, then make this shortcake in the afternoon. This pretty dessert really hits the spot on a hot summer day.
