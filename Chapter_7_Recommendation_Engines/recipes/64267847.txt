Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 pounds mixed wild mushrooms, such as porcini, morels, oyster and hen-of-the-woods, quartered if large
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
2 shallots, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup chicken stock

Directions:
In a very large skillet, melt the butter in oil.
Add the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.
Cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until tender and just browned, about 7 minutes.
Add the shallots, garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the wine and cook until nearly evaporated, about 2 minutes.
Add the chicken stock and season the ragù with salt and pepper; keep warm over low heat until Gnocchi or pasta is ready to marry.
