Ingredients:
3 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (7 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced into strips
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup sliced green onions
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 (11 ounce) container refrigerated soft breadsticks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir chicken, cream of chicken soup, roasted red peppers, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and chili powder together in a 12x8-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove dish from oven and stir.
Separate the breadsticks into 16 strips. Arrange the strips, lattice-style, over the chicken mixture, overlapping strips as necessary to fit the dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until breadsticks are golden, about 15 minutes more.
