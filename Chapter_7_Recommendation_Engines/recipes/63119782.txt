Ingredients:
1 cup day-old bread crumbs
1 lb of ground pork
1 onion, finely chopped
salt 'n' pepper to taste
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 cup milk
1/8 tsp ground cloves
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Soak your breadcrumbs in the milk for about 5 minutes.
Mix all of the ingredients together and cook over a low heat, stirring often so that it won't stick to the bottom of your pot for 1 hour or until the pork is no longer pink and the mixture is quite thick.
Pour into a greased square pan.
Refrigerate overnight.

This is very good for a toast spread or alongside an omelette breakfast. I make it quite often.
