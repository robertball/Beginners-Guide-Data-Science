Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten;
3/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 Tblsp fresh parsley, chopped (or 2 tsp dried parsley)
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
2 lbs ground turkey
1-1/2 tsp olive oil
3 cans cream of mushroom soup (could sub one for cream of chicken)
3 cups water
3 envelopes turkey gravy mix
1 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp pepper
1 pkg sliced fresh mushrooms (8 oz?)...I prefer cremini
3 cloves garlic, pressed

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, combine eggs, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, pepper and garlic powder. Add ground turkey and mix well.  Shape into 1-1/2 inch meatballs.  (I normally end up with 22-24 meatballs.)
2. In a large skillet, brown meatballs on all sides...probably need to do in two batches.  Drain meatballs and add to crockpot. (I prefer to prep the meatballs in advance and freeze in a single layer overnight.)
3. Meanwhile, press garlic into skillet and add mushrooms. Saute mushrooms and garlic until mushrooms are softened and beginning to brown.  Remove from skillet and add to crockpot (or refrigerate overnight).
In a large bowl, combine soup, water, gravy mix, thyme and pepper. Pour into crockpot over meatballs and mushrooms. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours.
Serve with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes.
