Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine
1 cup mashed potatoes (prepared with milk and butter)
1/3 cup milk
1 egg

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine potatoes, milk and egg; stir into the crumb mixture until a soft dough forms. Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently 10-12 minutes or until no longer sticky. Gently pat or roll dough into a 9-in. circle about 3/4 in. thick. Cut into 10-12 wedges. Separate wedges and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
'These pretty biscuit-like wedges are very moist and flavorful,' notes Judie Anglen, Riverton, Wyoming. 'They're tasty slathered with butter, honey or jam...or use them as a base for creamed dishes,' she suggests.
