Ingredients:
6 fresh tangerines - cut in quarters lengthwise
4 cups brown sugar
2 cups water

Directions:
Wash and cut tangerines in quarters lengthwise (like a lemon wedge). Remove stems and seeds if visible - otherwise, the seeds don't really hurt anything.
In small pot pour sugar and then water, stirring thoroughly.
Add tangerines and then simmer on low heat for 40 minutes.
Cool the mixture and store tangerines in a jar in the refrigerator (it keeps for many weeks). You may want to store the extra syrup in a smaller separate bottle to flavor tea, cocktails, sauces, etc.

Description: 
This is a staple recipe meant to keep on hand for spontaneous creativity in the kitchen. Candied citrus fruits in their own simple syrup can be used in so many different ways and can add WOW factor to anything from cocktails to cranberry sauce.  Candied orange peel is also a staple in Persian cuisine. This recipe is an adaption to a traditional Persian orange recipe because tangerine rind is difficult to separate off of the pith.  The whole tangerine comes out delicious and there is no bitter flavor that comes from the white pith under orange rinds!
