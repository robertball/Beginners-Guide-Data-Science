Description: 
Outstanding 'non-heavy' dessert for when you want guests applauding! I have yet to make this recipe without rave reviews.  Flavors blend perfectly. It has become my signature recipe.  Not difficult to make, but allow enough time to make.  I make it the day before.  You may garnish with semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate shavings or curls if you like.
