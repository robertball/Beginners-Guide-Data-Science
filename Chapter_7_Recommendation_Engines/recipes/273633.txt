Description: 
My nieces often describe this as having a tall, cool glass of raspberry lemonade in a bread form! The sweet and tart fresh lemon flavor combines well with the natural sweetness of the black raspberries! This has become a family favorite during berry-picking season! Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.
