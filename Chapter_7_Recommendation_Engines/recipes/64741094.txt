Ingredients:
1/2 small onion
6 Tablespoons butter, divided
1 jumbo/ 2 small eggs
1 6 oz can crab meat (or any type that you like)
1/4 Cup crushed pretzels ( I like to crush up left over pretzels in my food processor and use them just like bread crumbs.  They have more flavor than regular plain bread crumbs and you can add your own spices to them as you wish.)
Use more or less of the following to your taste:
1 Teaspoon garlic powder
1 Teaspoon black pepper
1 Teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Saute onions in 3 Tablespoons of the butter and set aside
Mix spices into pretzels
Add crab meat and eggs
Add onions
Mix all together and form into small palm sized patties
Melt the other 3 Tablespoons of butter (you can use olive oil if you want) and cook the patties until golden brown (about 4 minutes per side).
All done!! Enjoy!!
