Ingredients:
12 ears of fresh young corn, (butter and sugar is my favorite) peeled and cleaned completely.
1/4 cup olive oil
4 tbl butter
1 tbl minced garlic
1 tbl parsley
1 tbl salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
preheat grill to moderate - high heat, while waiting for grill to preheat use a saucepan and put all ingredients except corn in  pan. Then over low heat stir until butter is melted and begins to bubble, remove from heat and take it with the corn to the grill. While hot, clean the grill grates with a wire brush. Put the ears of corn directly on the grates and brush tops completely with the garlic mixture. As grill marks appear, 1-3 minutes turn all ears 1/3 rotation and again apply the garlic mixture to tops of all ears. Then in 1-3 minutes turn for the last time and coat with garlic mixture. when grilled to your liking 1-2 minutes longer they are ready to be eaten.  Already seasoned and plate ready!
