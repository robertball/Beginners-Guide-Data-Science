Description: 
My potato-topped pie combines vegetables both fresh and frozen to make this comforting dish. I like to make a mushroom gravy to serve with my dish. Nothing like a slice of white bread with butter to suck up the gravy with a scoop of pie. This can be made ahead of time and popped in oven when your ready to eat.
