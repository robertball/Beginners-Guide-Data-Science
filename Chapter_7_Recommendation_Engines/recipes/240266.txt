Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened, divided
1 1/2 loaves gluten-free bread
1 pound ground turkey
3 tablespoons sage
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, diced
1 apple, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1/2 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, diced
1 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Spread butter onto both sides of each bread slice; arrange on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until bread is toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Crumble bread into a large bowl; mix in sage, celery salt, and black pepper.
Heat remaining butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, apple, celery, and mushrooms in the hot butter until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir onion mixture into bread mixture; add turkey, chicken broth, and cream. Gently stir until mixture is evenly combined; spread into the prepared baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and cook until top is browned, about 20 minutes more.

After trying several gluten-free stuffing recipes, none to my daughter's liking, I decided to try my hand at creating my own. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
