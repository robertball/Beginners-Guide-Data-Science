Ingredients:
1 pound unsalted butter (such as Kerrygold®

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function.
Melt butter in the cooker until transparent bubbles are formed and you're able to see the bottom of the pot, 8 to 9 minutes. Turn off the cooker. Ghee will continue to cook as the pot cools down for 2 to 3 minutes. Let cool completely, 10 to 15 minutes.
Strain ghee using a strainer or cheesecloth into a clean, dry glass jar.

Description: 
Ghee, a staple in Indian cooking, is popular for its high-smoke point and nutty, toasted flavor. The best and purest ghee is the one that is homemade from grass-fed, organic, unsalted butter. Store at room temperature or refrigerate for an extended shelf life.
