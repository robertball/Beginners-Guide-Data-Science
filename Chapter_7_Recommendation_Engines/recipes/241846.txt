Ingredients:
Salmon:
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®), or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
4 teaspoons white wine, or to taste
8 slices fresh lemon
2 teaspoons capers
4 sprigs fresh rosemary
Sauce:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon zest
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Season salmon with seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Arrange salmon in the center of a large piece of aluminum foil; add lemon juice, 4 teaspoons olive oil, and white wine. Top each fillet with 2 lemon slices, capers, and a fresh rosemary sprig. Fold three of the sides of the foil toward the middle, creating a foil bag.
Whisk mayonnaise, mustard, 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon zest, chopped rosemary, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.
Cook salmon on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve sauce alongside cooked salmon.

Description: 
This is my favorite salmon recipe that I put together in college. This can be done on the grill or in the oven. By pairing salmon with rich/tangy lemon, rosemary and garlic sauce, this is a great summertime meal. Serve with grilled/baked veggies (I prefer broccoli, Brussels sprouts or green beans). Enjoy!
