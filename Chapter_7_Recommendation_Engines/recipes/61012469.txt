Description: 
This one pot dessert is quick and simple to make.  I reduced the amount of milk down to 1 cup from the 2 cups the original recipe calls for to make this an extra creamy dessert.  Use regular raisins instead of the golden, and store-brand rice to cut the cost of this recipe down to less than $2.50.Modified from: Creamy Rice Pudding
