Description: 
My brother's girlfriend made this dip for our Christmas gathering.  I think we all turned up our noses at the way it looked and the thought of the beans. I am the one who will try anything that is different. After the first bite I was ranting and raving over it. It disappeared quickly! Serve with corn chips.
