Ingredients:
2.5 cup chopped croissant
1/8 cup olive oil
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
Chop croissants into 1" cubes using serrated bread knife and place into a medium mixing bowl.
Drizzle olive oil over bread and toss to evenly coat.  Stir in garlic salt and parmesan cheese.
Spread bread cubes onto a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Make sure to spread them out so that they all toast evenly.
Bake for 13-15 minutes until lightly golden brown.
Let cool and add to your favorite salad or soup.  Store leftover croutons in airtight container at room temp.
