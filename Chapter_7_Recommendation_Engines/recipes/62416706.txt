Ingredients:
3 racks of baby back ribs
1 bottle of Stubb's Pork Marinade

Directions:
Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil.  Cut the ribs into manageable serving portions and put them in the dish.  Pour Stubb's over the ribs and  wrap foil over to form a "packet".  Marinate for two hours if you have time.  If you don't have time, they still turn out great.  Bake them still covered with foil at 280 degrees for 3 hours.  Take them out and throw them on the grill just long enough to dry them a little bit and get that "grilled feeling."

Description: 
These baby back ribs are awesome and so simple. My family fights over the last rib! The Stubb's Marinade has just the right amount of spiciness to make them perfect.
