Ingredients:
1/2 cup unbleached flour
8 ounces ricotta cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1 tsp Orange Peel finely grated
1 tsp Lemon Juice
bay leaves (optional you can substitute chopped nuts or poppy seeds)
1/2 cup honey (orange is the best, but any quality honey will do. Traditionally the honey is drizzled on top,  but I like it better this way. Try it both ways and see what you like.)

Directions:
Whip together cheese and eggs.
Beat in honey, Lemon juice, and orange peel.
Add flour and mix well.
Spray a 10 inch spring form pan with olive oil.
Arrange bay leaves on bottom of the pan.
Slowly pour batter over the leaves, being careful to not disturb them too much.
Heat the oven to 425Â° F with a small  bowl of water inside the oven (this helps prevent the cake from craking.
Bake for 35-40 minutes until golden-brown.
Allow to cool and release from the spring form pan.
Invert on a plate and serve warm or cold either way is good.
