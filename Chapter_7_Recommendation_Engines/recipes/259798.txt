Ingredients:
8 large Idaho potatoes, skin-on, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed
1 pint heavy whipping cream
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup chopped white onion
1 cup chopped green onions
1 (1 pound) package bacon

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Combine boiled potatoes, chicken broth, processed cheese, heavy cream, sour cream, cream cheese, white onion, and green onions in a slow cooker.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and let cool, about 5 minutes. Crumble into the slow cooker.
Cook on High, stirring occasionally until potatoes disintegrate, about 2 hours. Switch to Low; cook until soup is thickened, about 1 hour 30 minutes more.
