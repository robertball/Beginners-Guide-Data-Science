Ingredients:
1 cup All-Bran速 Original
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup skim milk
2 egg whites
6 cups water or chicken broth

Directions:
In large bowl, combine Kellogg's(R) All-Bran(R) cereal, flours and salt. Mix in milk and egg whites, adding enough extra flour to make a stiff dough, if necessary.
Roll dough on well-floured surface to 1/16-inch thickness. Let dry 1 hour. Cut dough into 3-inch strips. Flouring dough slightly, if necessary, layer 4 or 5 strips  on top of each other. Cut each stack, crosswise into 1/4-inch noodles. Spread  noodles loosely on floured surface. Let dry about 2 hours.
Drop noodles into boiling water or chicken broth. Cook, uncovered about  10 minutes or until tender. Drain. Serve hot.
