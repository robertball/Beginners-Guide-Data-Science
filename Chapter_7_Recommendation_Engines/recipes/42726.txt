Ingredients:

½ teaspoon rice vinegar
¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons frozen limeade concentrate, thawed
¼ teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 head red leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
¼ cup golden raisins
¼ cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a jar, combine lime juice, sugar, lime zest, rice vinegar, and mustard. Shake well, and set aside. In a small bowl, mix chicken with limeade concentrate and pepper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir chicken 4 to 6 minutes, or until no longer pink, and juices run clear.
Divide lettuce onto 4 salad plates. Top with mandarin orange segments, golden raisins, and walnuts. Place cooked chicken on top, and drizzle lightly with dressing.
