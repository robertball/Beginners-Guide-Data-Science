Ingredients:
4 teaspoons olive oil
3/4 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons vodka
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, undrained
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute; add vodka, bring to a simmer, and cook until mostly evaporated, about 10 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, basil, sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper with the garlic and vodka in the saucepan; bring to a boil and cook until most of the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.
Stir milk and butter together in a bowl until smooth; pour into tomato sauce and stir until the color is even.
Place saucepan over medium-low heat, bring sauce to a simmer, and cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
