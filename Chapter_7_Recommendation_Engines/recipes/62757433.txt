Ingredients:
12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs or 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thawed (I used thighs)
1 cup brown sugar firmly packed
1/4 tsp. pepper (I used a dash)
3 garlic cloves, minced (I used 1/2 tsp. chopped garlic)
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
2/3 cup white wine vinegar (I used white balsamic vinegar)
1/4 cup lemon-lime soda (I used Sprite)

Directions:
Put the chicken into a greased 4 qt. slow cooker.
Cover with the brown sugar, pepper, garlic, and soy sauce.
Add the vinegar and pour in the soda. It will bubble!
Cover and cook on low for 6-9 hours, or on high for 4-5 hours. The chicken is done when it is cooked through and has reached the desired tenderness. (The longer you cook it on low, the more tender your chicken will be.)
Serve over rice with a ladle full of broth.
