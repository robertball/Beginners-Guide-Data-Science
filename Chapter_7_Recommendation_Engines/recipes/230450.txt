Ingredients:
25 thin asparagus spears, cut into 3-inch pieces
3/4 cup cream cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 pound thinly sliced deli roast beef
25 whole chives

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Drop asparagus into boiling water and cook for 2 minutes; drain. Immediately plunge asparagus into a bowl of iced water.
Mix cream cheese, horseradish, parsley, and chopped chives in a bowl. Lay thinly sliced beef onto a large sheet of waxed paper. Spread cream cheese mixture over each roast beef slice. Place one asparagus spear onto each slice so the tip overlaps an edge. Roll beef slice around the the asparagus. Secure by tying a chive around the wrapped asparagus.
Arrange rolls on a plate and cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
