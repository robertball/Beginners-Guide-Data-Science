Description: 
A refreshing drink that everyone will love. Can be used with other fruits, too. Has a cool spring flavor to it. Hope you enjoy. You can add to this or take away from it if you want to change the number of servings. Really great spring drink. I like to add a small piece of honeydew and a slice of lime to the side of my glass.
