Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).  Lightly butter a 9 inch diameter circle in the center of a baking sheet.
In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut the butter into 1/2 inch cubes, and distribute evenly over flour mixture.  With a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into the flour mixture.  Stir together buttermilk, egg, and extract; add to the flour mixture, and stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips and hazelnuts. The dough will be sticky.
Spread the dough into an 8 inch diameter circle on the baking sheet.  Cut with a serrated knife into 8 wedges.
Bake for 17 to 19 minutes, or until the top in lightly browned.  Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes.  Transfer scones to the wire rack to cool, and cut into wedges.  Serve warm, or cool completely and store in airtight container.
