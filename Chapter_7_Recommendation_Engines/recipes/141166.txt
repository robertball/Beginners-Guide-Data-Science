Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package chicken apple sausage
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 bay leaves
1 1/2 cups long grain rice
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/3 cup white wine
3/4 cup canned crushed tomatoes
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3/4 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1/2 cup diced fresh pineapple
1/2 cup diced mango
1/2 cup diced apple

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish with lid.
Place the flour in a shallow dish. Dip the sausages into the flour to coat evenly.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the sausages, turning to brown all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Using the same skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Stir in the onion, green pepper, garlic, and bay leaves; stir and cook until tender, about 2 minutes. Combine the rice with the pepper mixture; stir and cook until the rice turns opaque, about 3 minutes. Stir in the thyme, salt, chili powder, white and black peppers, red pepper flakes, wine, tomatoes, and chicken broth. Add the sausages; increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Transfer the rice mixture to the large pot and cover.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove pot from the oven. Stir in the shrimp, pineapple, mango, and apple; blending thoroughly with the rice mixture. Cover and bake until shrimp is cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.
