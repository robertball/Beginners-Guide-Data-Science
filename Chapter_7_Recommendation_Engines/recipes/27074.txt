Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package seashell pasta
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
4 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 10 inch casserole dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in the flour and cook until a roux forms.  Stir in the milk, salt and pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is smooth and thick and coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in cheese.
Combine cooked pasta and cheese sauce; transfer to prepared dish.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until heated through.

Description: 
This is a marvelously smooth mac and cheese with a bit of a bite.  My family loves this.  I got the idea from a recipe made on a popular cooking show, and adapted it to my own recipe and tastes.  Delicious contrast if served with a 'sweet' main dish.
