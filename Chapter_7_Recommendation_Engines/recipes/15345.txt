Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 slices white bread, toasted and cut into cubes
1 cup raisins
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 1/2 cups shredded Colby longhorn cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, heat sugar until it liquefies. Insert a candy thermometer and cook sugar without stirring until it reaches  320 degrees F (160 degrees C). It will be a clear, amber colored syrup.
Add the water, cinnamon and cloves. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer. Stir in vanilla.
Layer in prepared casserole dish: half the toast, half the raisins, half the nuts, half the syrup, and half the cheese. Repeat layers. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Serve warm.
