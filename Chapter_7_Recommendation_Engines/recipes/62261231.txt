Description: 
Sharda, a wonderful lady from work, brought me this soup to sample. It was so fantastic that I asked her for the recipe. She not only went through the trouble of writing the recipe, but also brought me the ingredients - A generous gesture from a caring person. Sharda is strict vegetarian by religion, so this is a complete soup for the body and for the soul.
