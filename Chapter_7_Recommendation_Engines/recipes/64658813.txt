Ingredients:
1/2 cup Greek yogurt
1/2 cup butter (softened)
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat white flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup sprinkles
frosting
1/2 cup butter
3 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a mixer, combine butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add in eggs, Greek yogurt and vanilla and mix until combined.
Add in the flour, baking powder and baking soda and mix until combined. Fold in the sprinkles.
Using a cookie scoop, scoop out even amounts of dough, roll them into a ball and place on a cookie sheet. Use your hand or a glass to flatten the balls.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the edges get lightly golden. Remove to a cooling rack and repeat with remaining dough. Allow them to cool completely.
To prepare the icing, cream the butter until light. Add in the powdered sugar and mix until combined. Add in vanilla and stir. Add a splash of cream if needed to thin the icing.
Spread the icing over the cookies using a knife. Add sprinkles if desired.
