Ingredients:
1 8-ounce tube crescent rolls
1/4 cup butter, melted, divided
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Apply butter to an 8- or 9-inch round cake pan.
Pop open the can of crescents rolls. Pinch the dough seams together to make one large rectangle.
Brush half of the melting butter over the dough. Sprinkle it with brown sugar & cinnamon. Roll it up tightly on the long side of the rectangle.
Using a serrated knife, cut the dough into eight rolls. Place them into a prepared pan, swirly side up.
Bake the cinnamon rolls for 10-12 minutes or until the tops of the rolls are lightly browned.
In a bowl, stir together the rest of the butter, powdered sugar, and 2 tablespoons milk to make the icing. Stir it thoroughly until all ingredients are combined & smooth. If it is too thick, you may wish to add more milk; too thin & you can add in a tad bit more sugar.
Spoon the icing over the rolls right after they come out of the oven. Serve the cinnamon rolls when they are warm.
