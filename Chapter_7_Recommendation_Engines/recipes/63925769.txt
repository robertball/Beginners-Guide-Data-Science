Ingredients:
4 cucumbers, thinly sliced
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Toss together the cucumbers and onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for one hour.  Drain excess water. Combine the vinegar, water and sugar and pour over the cucumber and onions. Stir in dill, cover, and refrigerate until cold. This can also be eaten at room temperature, but be sure to allow the cucumbers to marinate for at least 1 hour.
