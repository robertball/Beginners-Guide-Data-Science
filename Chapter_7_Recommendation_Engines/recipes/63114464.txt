Ingredients:
1 (8 oz.) square of cream cheese
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
1 box of chocolate cake mix-preferable a moist or fudge type cake
1 tsp. vanilla extract
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup small marshmallows

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until smooth.
Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.
Once smooth, beat in the cake mix slowly.
Mix in semisweet chocolate chips and small marshmallows until evenly distributed.
Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours until firm, or to speed up the process, place in the freezer. The point of placing it in the refrigerator/freezer is to make the dough easy to roll into balls.
Roll batter into tablespoon sized balls and place onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 10-12 minutes.
Cool completely.
The cookies will remain soft and may seem slightly under baked, but the bottom will be crispy and hold its form.
