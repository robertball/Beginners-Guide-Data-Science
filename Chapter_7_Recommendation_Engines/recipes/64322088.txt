Ingredients:
1/4 cup(s) juice, tomato
3/4 pounds beef, flank steak
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 small onion(s), yellow finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon pepper, black ground
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 clove(s) garlic minced
peppercorns, black freshly ground, to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the steak in a 13" x 9" glass baking dish. Combine the tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion, lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and salt. Pour the mixture over the steak. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, turning once.
Place the steak on the broiler rack and brush with the marinade. Broil 3" from the heat for 5 minutes. Turn, brush with the marinade, and broil for 3 minutes or until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 145Â°F (for medium-rare). To serve, cut diagonally across the grain into thin slices.
