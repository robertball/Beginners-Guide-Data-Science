Ingredients:
1/2 lb. fresh asparagus
4 tbsp. butter
3 tbsp. olive oil
1 lb. veal or thin chicken cutlets
2/3 cup flour
6 oz. Fontina cheese
1/3 cup dry Marsala
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Trim asparagus.
Put 2 tbsp. butter and all of the olive oil into a frying pan and turn heat to high.
While butter is melting, dredge meat lightly in flour.
When butter is melted and foam subsides, place as many cutlets as will fit easily in pan and cook about 30 seconds on each side for veal and a bit longer for the chicken.
Remove from pan and add remaining cutlets.
Preheat oven to 400.
Line a large cookie sheet with foil and transfer cutlets to pan.
Sprinkle with salt and pepper then place 3-4 asparagus pieces on each of the cutlets and sprnkle lightly with salt.
Cut Fontina into thin slices and cover each cutlet with pieces of cheese.
Pour fat from cooking pan and add Marsala along with and juices from resting pate, if any.
Cook on high, scraping up any browned bits, until Marsala is reduced to about 3 tbsp.
Spoon a little sauce over each of the cutlets, then dot with remaining 2 tbsp. of butter.
Cover pan tightly with foil and cook for 15 minutes.
Serve immediately.
