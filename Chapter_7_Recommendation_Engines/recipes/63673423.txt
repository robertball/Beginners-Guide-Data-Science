Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup margarine, melted
3/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup flour
1/4 cup margarine, melted
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Grease 24 mini-muffin cups.
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup margarine, and nutmeg in a large bowl.
Stir in the milk, then mix in the baking powder and flour until just combined.
Fill the prepared mini muffin cups about half full.
Bake at 375Â° until the tops are lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
While muffins are baking, place 1/4 cup of melted margarine in a bowl.
In a separate bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon.
Remove muffins from their cups, dip each muffin in the melted margarine, and roll in the sugar-cinnamon mixture.
Let cool and serve.
