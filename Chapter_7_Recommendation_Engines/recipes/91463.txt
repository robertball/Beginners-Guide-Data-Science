Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked wild rice
1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
1/4 cup water
1/2 pound andouille sausage, diced
1/2 cup diced sweet onion
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the wild rice, chicken broth, water, sausage, onion, mushrooms and garlic. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from the heat, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup. It's that easy!
