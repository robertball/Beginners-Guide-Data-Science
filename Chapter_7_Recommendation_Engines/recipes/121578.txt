Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pound beef round steak, cut into thin strips
2 cups fresh or frozen snow peas
1 medium green pepper, julienned
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; remove half and set aside. Add beef to remaining marinade; cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes. In a large skillet or wok, stir-fry vegetables in oil for 2 minutes; remove and keep warm.
Drain and discard marinade. In the same skillet, stir-fry beef until no longer pink. Add the oranges and reserved vegetables. Combine the cornstarch and reserved marinade until smooth; add to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over rice.

Description: 
This colorful stir-fry from Anne Drouin of Dunnville, Ontario is pretty enough to double as a centerpiece. 'The crispy veggies contrast nicely with the tender beef and juicy oranges,' she informs. 'Even the most finicky eaters in our family can't resist it.'
