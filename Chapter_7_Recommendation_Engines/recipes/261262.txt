NA
Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen cauliflower
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
2  cooked boneless chicken breast halves, chopped
1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste, divided
1 envelope onion soup mix
1 tablespoon minced garlic

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer cauliflower to a food processor; process using the shredding blade. Transfer cauliflower to the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Refill steamer with water and return to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, about 5 minutes. Arrange broccoli on top of the shredded cauliflower. Cover with cooked chicken.
Combine Alfredo sauce, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, onion soup mix, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until hot and melted, about 2 minutes. Spread sauce over the chicken. Top with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly on top, 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe that uses riced cauliflower rather than real rice. Since I have diabetes, I needed a good, hearty, low-carb casserole that my whole family would love. This was it! They do not miss the rice.
