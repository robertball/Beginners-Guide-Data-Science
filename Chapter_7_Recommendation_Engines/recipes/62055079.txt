Ingredients:
1-2 pounds fresh/frozen purple-hull peas
4 oz. bacon or ham
3 tsp. sugar
1/8 tsp. baking soda
8 oz. whole okra (optional)
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Place peas in a large pot with 6-8 cups of water and bring to a boil.
If desired, add okra.
Boil for 2 minutes, stirring twice.  Add baking soda.
Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add bacon or ham, sugar, and salt & pepper.
Cover and let simmer for 1 1/2-2 hours, until peas are tender, stirring occasionally.
You can use dried peas for this recipe but will need to prepare them for cooking according to the package directions.  Black-eyed peas can also be used if purple-hull peas are not available.
