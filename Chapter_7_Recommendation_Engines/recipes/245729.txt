Ingredients:
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 canned chipotle pepper, diced
3 cooked pork cutlets
3 naan breads
2 tablespoons water
3 slices Gouda cheese
3/4 cup shredded lettuce
3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine mayonnaise with diced chipotle pepper in a small bowl; mix well to make chipotle mayonnaise.
Place pork cutlets and naan bread on separate baking sheets. Sprinkle water over naan bread.
Heat pork cutlets in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Top each cutlet with 1 slice of cheese and continue to heat until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven.
Warm naan in the preheated oven until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven.
Spread chipotle mayonnaise over each naan bread; place a pork cutlet on top. Top with shredded lettuce and green onions; fold sides of naan over pork.

Description: 
I created this while trying to use up leftovers. It is made with pork cutlets, but any meat would be good. Use any toppings you would like.
