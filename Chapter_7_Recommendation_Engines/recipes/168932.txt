Description: 
This is SO delicious! I put this together after an x-ray because I wanted to eat something high in antioxidants and honey (for its antibacterial properties). What I ended up was a salad SO tasty, I just had to share it here. I'm sure that even the pickiest bean hating eater will love this dish! This is my new favorite and I can't wait to go and make some more!
