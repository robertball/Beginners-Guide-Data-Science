Ingredients:
1.5 cups unsalted, raw mixed nuts (for example: 1/3 cup almonds, 1/3 cup hazelnuts, 1/3 cup cashews, 1/4 cup pecans,  1/8 cup walnuts, and 1/8 cup brazilian nuts).
1 liter filtered water
Pinch of salt, optional
1 Tbsp honey or agave, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Put the nuts on the lined baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes. Shake the tray to flip the nuts and continue baking for another 5 minutes.
Turn off the oven but leave the nuts inside the oven for another ten minutes or until the nuts have slightly cooled, but are still warm.
Add the warm nuts to a large bowl and pour in one liter of filtered water. Cover and allow to rest about 30 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the nuts and put them into a blender. Add one cup of the soaking water and blend on low for about 30 seconds. Add another cup of the soaking water and blend again for about 1 minute. Add the rest of the water. Blend 30 seconds on medium.  Allow to rest about 10 minutes.
Pour the mixture through a sieve or process through a nut bag. Pour the milk into a glass container then add the remaining soaking water. Close with a hermetic lid and refrigerate.
If desired, add a pinch of salt and honey before refrigerating. Use within a week.
