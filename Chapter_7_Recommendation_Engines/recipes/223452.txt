Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
1 cup cold mashed sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, pepper, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir sweet potatoes and cream into the flour mixture until the dough is soft.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead the dough, turning over about 5 times. Roll to about 1/2-inch thick. Cut 2-inch circles out of dough and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
