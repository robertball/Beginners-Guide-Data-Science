Ingredients:
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon baking soda
7 slices cooked and diced bacon
2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer until well combined. Add egg and baking soda; beat until smooth, 1 minute. Fold in bacon. Form dough into walnut-sized balls.
Pour 2 tablespoons white sugar into a bowl; roll balls in the sugar until coated. Arrange coated balls on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
Peanut butter and bacon combine to make these delicious treats! My husband thought the recipe sounded like a waste of perfectly good bacon but loved the outcome and requests them often.
