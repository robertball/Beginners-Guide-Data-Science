Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Rinse fish and pat dry. Sprinkle fish with lemon juice and salt. Coat an oven-safe handled large skillet with a drizzle of EVOO and a little softened butter. If your skillets all have rubber handles, coat handle twice with tin foil and it should be fine in the oven. Set
portioned fish into skillet.
Heat a small skillet over medium high heat. Add a drizzle of EVOO and the bacon. Render the fat in the bacon 3 minutes then add onions. Sweeten and soften onions and garlic 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Add bread crumbs to the pan and turn them to coat them in drippings. Add parsley and capers combine. Top fish with coating of onions, bacon and bread crumbs. Bake 15 minutes. Transfer fish to dinner plates and top with chopped tomato.
