Ingredients:
1 Medium Eggplant
Salt
2 Tbsps Olive Oil
1 cup Finely Chopped Celery
1 Medium onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1-1/2 cups canned plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely chopped
12 Green olives, pitted and coarsely chopped
1-1/2 Tbsp drained capers
2 Tbsp red vinegar
1 Tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp minced oregano
1 tsp salt
Ground black pepper to taste
minced fresh parsley
Toasted sliced bread

Directions:
Peel and cut the eggplant into 1/2 inch cubes. Salt and let sit for 30 minutes.  Rinse and pat dry.
In the meantime, heat 2 Tbsps Olive Oil in skillet and add the chopped celery.  Cook, stirring often until softened, about 4 minutes. Add onion and garlic and continue to cook, stirring until onion is soft and lightly colored, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl.
Add to the skillet 2 Tbsp Olive oil.  Add Eggplant cubes and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 5-7 minutes.  Add the celery mixture along with the next  9 ingredients.  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 15 minutes.  Taste and adjust seasoning with additional salt, pepper and the vinegar, if needed.  Remove to a serving bowl and garnish with parsley.  Serve with toasted crusty bread.  Enjoy!
