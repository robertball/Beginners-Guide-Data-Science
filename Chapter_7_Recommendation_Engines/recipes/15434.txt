Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
1/2 cup sliced carrots
1 cup barley
2 1/2 cups water
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 leek, sliced

Directions:
In a large pot combine the chicken, carrots, barley, water, bouillon and salt and pepper to taste. Bring all to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside. Skim broth as needed.
Remove chicken from pot and add leeks. Bring back to a boil; reduce heat, cover and let simmer another 15 minutes or so, until thickened.
Meanwhile, skin and debone the cooked chicken. Return chicken meat to thickened stew and cook for about 5 minutes to heat through. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is a Scottish dish that is traditionally a thick soup. I prefer it as a thin stew and have adapted my recipe accordingly. I use the entire leek (needs to be cleaned very carefully), but the green tips tend to be a bit tough so you might want to add them earlier in the process if you want to soften them up.
