Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter, softened*
1 egg
2 tablespoons dark corn syrup
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Sliced almonds

Directions:
Combine sugar and butter in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy.  Add egg, corn syrup, water and vanilla; beat until well mixed. Reduce speed to low; add remaining ingredients except almonds.  Beat until well mixed.
Divide dough into thirds.  Shape each third into 1/2-inch thick square.  Wrap each square in plastic food wrap.  Refrigerate until firm (1 to 2 hours).
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out dough on lightly floured surface, one-third at a time (keeping remaining dough refrigerated), to 12x10-inch rectangle.  Cut into 2-inch squares using pastry cutter or sharp knife; cut squares diagonally in half to form triangles.  Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Lightly press almonds into center of each cookie.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until edges are lightly browned and cookies are set.
