Ingredients:
4 ears fresh corn
2 cups water

Directions:
Shuck the corn and remove the silk.
Pour water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and insert the steamer basket. Place 2 ears of corn in the basket. Stack the other 2 ears on top, perpendicularly to the first 2. Close and lock the lid. Close the vent.
Select Meat/Stew setting and set timer for 2 minutes; allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.

Description: 
This method probably isn't any faster than the traditional method of boiling corn, but I can put everything in the pot and walk away, which is a bonus when I'm preparing several other dishes.
