Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3 lemons, juiced
14 fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup sherry wine
3 pounds trout fillets
salt to taste
cracked black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a shallow baking dish with foil.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; pour in lemon juice. Cook and stir mushrooms until tender, about 5 minutes; stir in sherry. Place trout fillets with skin sides down into prepared baking dish; sprinkle with salt and cracked pepper. Pour the mushroom mixture over the fish.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce reduces and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This year I learned to not only catch my own fish, but to clean, cook and eat them as well. Thrilling. This recipe is my recreation of a dish that was made by a man named Botsy, years ago, in the Rocky Mountains. It's delicious and enhances fresh trout without overpowering it. These could also be prepared in foil packets on a camping trip over an open fire. Although we camp, I don't often include a bottle of sherry in my kitchen box. When you add the sherry, pour a glass for yourself.
