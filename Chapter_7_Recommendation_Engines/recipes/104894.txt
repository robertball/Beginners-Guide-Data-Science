Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg
1 cup milk, plus more if necessary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon artificial sweetener
1/2 cup blueberries

Directions:
Sift together flour and baking powder, set aside.  Beat together the egg, milk, salt and artificial sweetener in a bowl.  Stir in flour until just moistened, add blueberries, and stir to incorporate.
Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, and spray with cooking spray.  Pour approximately 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan for each pancake.  Cook until bubbly, about 1 1/2 minutes.  Turn, and continue cooking until golden brown.

Description: 
The blueberries in these whole wheat pancakes are so sweet and moist that they don't even need butter when eaten while hot!  This is our Saturday breakfast, healthy for me; yummy for husband and kids.
