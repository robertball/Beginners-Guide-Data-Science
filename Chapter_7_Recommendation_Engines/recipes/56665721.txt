Authentic, No Shortcuts, Louisiana Red Beans and Rice Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 pound dried red beans, soaked overnight
10 cups water
1 pound andouille sausage, sliced into 1/4inch rounds
1 large sweet onion, chopped finely
1 green bell pepper, chopped finely
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon Creole or Cajun Seasoning
6 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1 ham hock
4 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Place the beans and water into a slow cooker. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the sausage in the skillet; remove from the skillet with a slotted spoon and transfer to the slow cooker. Reserve drippings. Add onion, green pepper, jalapeno pepper and garlic to the drippings; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer everything from the skillet to the slow cooker.
Season the mixture with pepper and Creole seasoning. Add the fresh basil leaves and ham hock. Cover and cook on low for about 8 hours, or until beans are tender. If the bean mixture seems too watery, take the lid off the slow cooker and set heat to High to cook until they reach a creamy texture.
