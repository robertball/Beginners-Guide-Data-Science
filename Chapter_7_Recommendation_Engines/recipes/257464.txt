Ingredients:
1 teaspoon shortening, or as needed
1 ¼ cups white sugar
½ cup butter, softened
2  eggs
½ cup coconut milk
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon tamarind paste
1 teaspoon durian extract
2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon guava juice, or as needed (optional)
5  strawberries, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with shortening.
Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in eggs, one at a time, until well blended. Mix in coconut milk, lime juice, tamarind paste, and durian extract.
Combine flour, poppy seeds, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into the creamed butter mixture until batter is just moistened. Add guava juice, 1 teaspoon at a time, if batter needs more moisture. Carefully fold strawberries into batter; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes on a wire rack before removing. Cool completely before slicing.

Description: 
This bread is delicious! The lime and tamarind add a sourness to the berries that can't be beat.
