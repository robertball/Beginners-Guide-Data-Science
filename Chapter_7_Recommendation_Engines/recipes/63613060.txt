Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar
1 large egg
2 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp. ground nutmeg
1 medium banana, mashed (about 1/3 cup)
1 1/2 cups grated zucchini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners and set aside.
Melt butter in a microwave-safe mixing bowl. Add sugars, egg, and vanilla, and stir to combine.
Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup and level with a knife. Add to mixing bowl, but do not stir. Sprinkle baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg over flour. Using a whisk, lightly stir dry ingredients together and then use a rubber spatula to stir just until flour mixture is incorporated into batter. Add mashed banana and zucchini and stir until combined.
Divide batter evenly into muffin cups, filling about 3/4 full. Bake 15-20 min or until a toothpick comes out with only small crumbs attached.
