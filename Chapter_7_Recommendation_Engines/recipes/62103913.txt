Ingredients:
4 C. unsifted flour
3 packets dry yeast
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 C butter
1/2 C finely diced onion
8 oz. can tomato sauce
1/2 C water
2 eggs (1 at room temp.)
1/2 lb. grated sharp cheddar

Directions:
Sautee onion in butter.  Add tomato sauce and water to pan and adjust temp. to 120-130 degrees.
Combine in heavy-duty mixer bowl:  1 C flour, sugar, salt & yeast.  Gradually add onion/tomato mixture to bowl and beat for 2 minutes.
Add room temperature egg and 1 C flour to bowl and beat on high for 2 more minutes.
Gradually add the remaining 2 C flour to make a soft dough and knead on high for 6-8 minutes (or by hand for 10 min).
Cover bowl, brush or spray top of dough with oil and let rise at least 2 hours in a warm place until doubled, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours until doubled.
Punch down dough and turn out onto floured board.  Divide dough in 1/2 and roll dough into 2 rectangles.  Cut each rectangle into about 10-12 3" squares.
Put 1 scant tablespoon of cheese in the center of each square and bring opposite corners of dough up to overlap and pinch tightly in the middle.  Place on a greased cookie sheet and let rise until doubled again - at least an hour depending on dough temp.
Prepare egg wash by placing 1 slightly beaten egg in a small bowl and mix in 1 teaspoon of water.
Brush the rolls lightly with egg wash and bake at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes until done.  Note: due to the orange color, these will look only slightly browned when done.

Description: 
These unique rolls are easy cheesy - the tomato sauce adds a bit of tang and turns the dough an orange color.  I use my heavy-duty electric mixer for this, so I don't have to knead it by hand.  Also, with the extra yeast, dough can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before forming and baking.
