8 large fresh whole mushrooms
1 medium onion, cut into chunks
1 medium green pepper, cut into chunks

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first nine ingredients; mix well. Pour 1/4 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; cover and refrigerate remaining marinade. Add beef to the bag. Seal and turn to coat; refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.
Drain and discard marinade. On metal or soaked wooden skewers, alternately thread beef and vegetables. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until beef reaches desired doneness, basting frequently with reserved marinade and turning once.

Description: 
My aunt gave me this recipe years ago. When my boys were young, they weren't very fond of beef, but this was a sure way to entice them to eat.
