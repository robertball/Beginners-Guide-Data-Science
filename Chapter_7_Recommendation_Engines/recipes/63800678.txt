Ingredients:
2 acorn squash
Salt
1 stick butter
1/2 cup brown sugar (firmly packed)
2 Tbsp minced fresh rosemary
1/4 tsp chili powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Cut the acorn squash in half from top to bottom using a sharp knife. Scoop the seeds and stringy pulp out of the squash cavities and discard. With a small sharp knife, score the flesh of the squash with a crisscross pattern to allow the butter mixture to penetrate. Place the halves, skin-side down, in a baking dish. You may need to use strips of foil around the base of the squash to keep them from tipping. Sprinkle lightly with salt.
Combine the butter, brown sugar, salt, rosemary and chili powder in a bowl and mix into a paste. Smear the paste all over the squash. Make sure the paste is really covering the exposed squash area or it dries out.
Roast in the oven for 60 minutes. .
Scoop out the flesh into a serving bowl or give each individual a half.
