Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato, peeled and halved crosswise
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
1/4 cup butter
9 fresh sage leaves
salt to taste

Directions:
Cut sweet potato into spaghetti-like ribbons with a spiralizer.
Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sweet potato ribbons; cook, stirring often and adding more oil to prevent sticking, until starting to soften, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Heat butter in the same skillet until melted and foaming, about 1 minute. Add sage leaves; swirl until butter is a rich caramel color and leaves are crisp and dark green, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove sage leaves from the butter. Add sweet potato; stir to coat well.
Season sweet potato with salt and garnish with crisp sage leaves.

Description: 
Fabulous and simplistic dish for those who don't like 'sweet' sweet potatoes. You can easily substitute butternut squash in this dish. Makes 3 large helpings or 4 medium-sized helpings.
