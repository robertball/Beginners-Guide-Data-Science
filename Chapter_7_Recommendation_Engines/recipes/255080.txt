Description: 
I was looking to try someone else's recipe for pork neck bones, but when I didn't find one I decided to add my own. A Southern keep-you-warm recipe that's great for the fall and winter or making a dollar stretch. My family loves it over rice with collard greens, corn bread, and candied yams.
