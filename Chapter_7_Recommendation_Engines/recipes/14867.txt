Description: 
May be served in a bowl or... I like to slice the top of a green bell pepper off, clean the seeds out, then scoop in the cream cheese mixture. Serve with crackers around it.  It looks so pretty. You can slice the green pepper up, and also eat it with the spread. If you prefer, you can also make this with turkey or ham.
