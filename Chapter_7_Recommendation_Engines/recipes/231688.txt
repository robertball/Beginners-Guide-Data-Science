Ingredients:
1/2 cup lentils, rinsed
1 cup water, or as needed to cover
1 salmon fillet
1 slice Black Forest-style bacon (optional)
1/4 red onion, diced
5 small fresh mozzarella balls (boccaccini), cut into quarters (optional)
1/4 cup diced cucumber, or to taste
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Put lentils in a small pot with enough water to just cover; cook on medium heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Set lentils aside to cool.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Cook salmon under the preheated broiler until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.  Chop salmon and set aside to cool.
Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat; cook bacon in skillet until crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Chop bacon and set aside to cool.
Mix cooled lentils, salmon, bacon, red onion, mozzarella, and cucumber together in a large bowl.
Whisk balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; drizzle over the lentil mixture and stir gently to coat.
