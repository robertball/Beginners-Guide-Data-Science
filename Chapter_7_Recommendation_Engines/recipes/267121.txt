Ingredients:
5 large very ripe bananas, or more to taste
5 eggs
1 cup plain 2% yogurt (such as Fage®)
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 stick butter, melted
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup oat flour
1 cup almond flour
1/2 cup sucralose and brown sugar blend (such as Splenda®)
1/2 cup ground chia seeds
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg (optional)
1 1/2 cups toasted chopped pecans
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Puree bananas in a blender. Add eggs, yogurt, applesauce, and vanilla extract; briefly blend until smooth. Drizzle in melted butter while blender is running and mix until combined, about 10 seconds.
Whisk oats, oat flour, almond flour, brown sugar blend, chia seeds, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Add liquid mixture from the blender; mix until no dry spots remain. Add pecans and chocolate chips and mix until evenly incorporated.
Pour batter into 2 loaf pans and spread out evenly to the corners.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dark golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out with tiny crumbs attached, 70 to 80 minutes.

Description: 
This is a heavier, more filling banana bread than others. Don't let the long list of ingredients scare you - it comes together quickly! The almond flour, oat flour, and chia or hemp seeds may be found in your grocery store's organic or gluten-free section, at Trader Joe's®, or online. My family isn't gluten free (my sister is!), but we all prefer this recipe to any others.
