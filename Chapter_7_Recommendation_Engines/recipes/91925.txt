Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 cup crushed saltine crackers
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a foil-covered wire rack over a foil-covered lipped cookie sheet. Use a fork to pierce foil on rack all over.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions in oil until tender and golden, about 5 minutes.
Break up ground beef in a large bowl. Mix in cooked onions, eggs, milk, cracker crumbs, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and salt and pepper.  Divide meat mixture into 2 portions. Place on foiled-lined wire rack, and form into 2 oval loaves.
Mix together brown sugar, mustard, and ketchup in a small bowl. Brush mixture over each loaf.
Bake until cooked through (160 degrees on a meat thermometer), about 45 to 50 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes to cool, slice, and serve.
