1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

4 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potatoes, garlic powder, black pepper, celery seed, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt into a zip-top bag. Shake to coat evenly.
Pour entire contents of bag onto a large baking sheet and spread evenly. Drizzle with olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes reach desired crispness, turning frequently to brown evenly, 40 to 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven. Let cool slightly and pour into a serving dish.

Description: 
I created this recipe by accident. After already starting dinner one night I realized I didn't have enough potatoes on hand to make mashed, so I improvised and came up with these baked potato slices. It's quick and easy and they are delicious. Just line your cookie sheet with nonstick foil and clean up is a snap! Enjoy!
