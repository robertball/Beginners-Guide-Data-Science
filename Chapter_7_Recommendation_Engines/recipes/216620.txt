Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (3 1/2) pound pork shoulder roast
4 cups beef broth
2 bay leaves
1/2 large white onion, cut into large chunks

Directions:
Combine the garlic powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Thoroughly rub the spice mixture over the pork.
Place the roast in a pressure cooker with the beef broth, bay leaves, and onion over medium-high heat. Seal the cooker, and bring to full pressure; reduce the heat to maintain high pressure, and cook for 45 minutes.
Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to drop naturally. Transfer the pork to a serving bowl and shred the meat with forks.

Description: 
This amalgamation of recipes produces a very mild shredded pork taco filling: tasty, but not as intensely Mexican as one might prefer. I suggest using this as a basis and adapting to suit with the addition of various peppers, sauces, spices, etc. The true beauty of this recipe is that it can be made in a pressure cooker in about an hour. Serve in corn or flour tortillas.
