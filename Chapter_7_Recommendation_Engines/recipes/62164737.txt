Ingredients:
Seasoning Mix
•2 tspn. dry mustard
•2 tspn. paprika
•1 1/2 tspn. salt
•1 1/2 tspn. dried thyme leaves
•1 1/2 tspn. dried sweet basil leaves
•1 tspn. black pepper
•1 tspn. garlic powder
•1 tspn. onion powder
•1/2 tspn. white pepper
Ingredients
•8 slices bacon, diced
•1 1/2 cups chopped onions
•1 cup chopped green bell pepper
•1 cup chopped celery
•4 bay leaves
•3/4 cup tomato juice
•1/2 cup evaporated milk
•1 1/2 pounds ground beef
•1/2 pound ground veal
•2 eggs, lightly beaten
•1/2 cup unsalted saltine cracker crumbs (about 13 crackers) Vegetable oil cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine the seasoning mix ingredients thoroughly in a small bowl. Makes 1/4 cup.
1. Cook the bacon in a 10-inch skillet over high heat until brown and crispy, about 7 to 9 minutes. If the fat starts to smoke before the bacon is brown, lower the heat to medium. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Add the onions to the skillet and cook until the onions are golden brown, about 5 - 6 minutes. Add the green peppers, celery, bay leaves, and 2 Tablespoons of the seasoning mix and cook, stirring and scraping occasionally, about 4 minutes. Add the remaining seasoning mix and cook, stirring often, about 5 - 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove and discard the bay leaves.
3. Combine the tomato juice, evaporated milk, and the cooked bacon in a large bowl. Add the cooked vegetable mixture and blend well. Gently combine the meat, eggs, and cracker crumbs in another large bowl. Add the vegetable mixture and, being careful not to pack to tightly, incorporate everything thoroughly. If the meat mixture seems a bit moist at this point, add a few more cracker crumbs.
4. Spray a 13 by 9 inch loaf pan or rectangular casserole dish with cooking spray. Turn the meat mixture into the pan and mold it into a thick loaf. Bake 30 minutes, turn the pan around, and bake another 15 minutes. Cut into slices about 3/4 inch thick and serve
