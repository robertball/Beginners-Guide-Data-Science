Ingredients:
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
2 Tbsp Butter
1 Onion, diced
6 slices Bacon (Optional) chopped
3 Stalks of Celery, diced
2 Bay Leaves
1/2 tsp Thyme Leaves, dried
3 Carrots, chopped
4 cloves Garlic, pressed or finely minced
1/2 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp Pepper
6 cups Chicken or Vegetable Broth
1 lb Green Split Peas, rinsed and sorted (unsoaked)
1 tsp Liquid Smoke (Optional) for vegetarian version

Directions:
Turn the pressure cooker on to the Sauté function. Let it warm up and add the olive oil and butter.
Add the onion, celery, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion starts to turn translucent.
Add the carrots, garlic, bacon, if using, and salt & pepper. Cook for a minute.
Add the broth (Add liquid smoke, if using, for vegetarian method). Let come to a simmer.
Stir in the split peas.
Place the lid on the pot and lock it in place. Set the steam release knob to the Sealing position.
Cancel the sauté function and Choose Pressure Cook/Manual, and use the + or - or dial to choose 18 minutes. It will take a few minutes for the pot to come to pressure.
When the cooking time has finished, let the pot sit undisturbed for 15 minutes to naturally release some of the pressure. Then turn the steam release knob to Venting to quick release the remaining pressure.
When the pin in the lid drops down, carefully open the lid, facing away from you. Remove the bay leaves.  Taste and adjust the seasonings as desired.
