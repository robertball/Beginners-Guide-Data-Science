Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, broken into florets (large stems discarded)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 cups vegetable stock
1 1/2 cups water
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread cauliflower florets into a 9x13-inch baking dish and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle cumin over the cauliflower.
Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower is lightly browned and softened, about 30 minutes.
Transfer roasted cauliflower to a soup pot over medium heat and stir in vegetable stock and water.
Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until cauliflower is very tender, about 30 minutes.
Use an immersion blender to puree the soup in the pot; season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This is one of my husband's favorites.  The type of vegetable stock used can easily alter the flavor, so use your favorite brand. I like this soup with goldfish crackers and green salad.
