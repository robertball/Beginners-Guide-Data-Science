Ingredients:
4 to 6 lamb chops
olive oil
1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 to 1 Tablespoon fresh rosemary, crushed well
fresh ground black pepper
sea salt
mint jelly

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut away excess fat from the lamb chops (some fat does add flavor).  Coat each lamb chop lightly in olive oil. Dust lamb chops with garlic, rosemary, pepper and salt.  Place lamb chops in a cast iron skillet and bake uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes or until done.  Remove from oven and cover tightly with foil and rest for 8 to 10 minutes. Serve with mint jelly on the side.

Description: 
Never having lamb before I didn't think I liked lamb.  When your MIL is 100% Greek you know you will have to fix it for her son!  I asked her to show me one night and wrote it down. This is so easy and tender, perfect for when you don't have a crowd to feed!
