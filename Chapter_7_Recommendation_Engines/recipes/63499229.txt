Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice, cooked and cooled
2 eggs
1 onion, chopped small
1- 8oz. can tomato sauce
1 Tbsp. dried parsley
2 tsps. garlic powder
1/2 cup Sargento Artisan Blends Shredded Parmesan
1/2 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, or as needed, plus extra for rolling balls into
Salt and pepper, to taste
4- 1oz. sticks of Sargento String Cheese, cut into 6 pieces each (24 total pieces)
Marinara sauce or ranch dressing for dipping, optional

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, except cheese cubes, in a large bowl; mix well.
Spoon about 1 to 1-1/2 Tbsps. rice mixture into the palm of your hand and flatten out slightly.
Place 1 mozzarella cheese cube into the center and wrap the rice mixture around it to enclose it completely.
Roll into a ball and into seasoned breadcrumbs to coat.
Continue until all rice mixture/cheese cubes are used.
Heat deep fryer or large pot filled w/ oil to 350 degree.
Fry rice balls, a few at a time, until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
Place on rack or paper towels to drain.
Serve immediately w/ a side of marinara sauce or ranch dressing for dipping.
Enjoy!
