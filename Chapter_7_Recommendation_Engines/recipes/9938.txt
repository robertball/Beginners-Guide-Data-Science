Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup butter, softened
12 ounces any flavor fruit jam

Directions:
Mix cream cheese and butter well in large bowl until well blended and creamy.
Add in flour slowly, beating well after each addition.  Roll dough into 1-inch balls and wrap well in cellophane.  Store in fridge overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Roll out dough balls flat and place a 1/2 teaspoon full of the jam in the center.  Fold sides over and place on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake for 13-15 minutes until brown and the jam starts to bubble hard.  Cool for 3 minutes and place on cooling rack.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.
