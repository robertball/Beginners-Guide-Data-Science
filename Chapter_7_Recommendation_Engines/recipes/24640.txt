In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix mayonnaise and dry Italian-style salad dressing mix.

Description: 
These little open faced cucumber sandwiches are always a hit, and I never leave a party without getting asked for the recipe several times! Allow the mayonnaise mixture to sit overnight in the refrigerator if you have the time -- it will taste even better.
