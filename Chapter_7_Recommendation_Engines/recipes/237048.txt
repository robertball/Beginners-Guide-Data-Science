Ingredients:
6 slices lower-sodium bacon
1/2 large white onion, diced
30 Brussels sprouts, halved lengthwise
2 cloves garlic, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, retaining grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon.
Cook and stir onion in the bacon grease over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts; cook and stir until Brussels sprouts are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season Brussels sprouts mixture with salt and pepper.
Sprinkle bacon over Brussels mixture and stir. Remove skillet from heat, transfer Brussels sprouts mixture to a serving bowl, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a simple yet delicious recipe that takes little time to put together. It's a tasty way to incorporate a healthy, and often snubbed, vegetable into one's diet. I've been cooking Brussels sprouts this way for years. I'm not sure where I got the recipe. Using fresh Brussels sprouts is preferred naturally, but if not readily available, frozen Brussels sprouts may be used instead. If using frozen Brussels sprouts, you may have to drain any excess liquid that is rendered while cooking the sprouts.
