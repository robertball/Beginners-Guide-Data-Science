Ingredients:
Ice cubes
1 (6 ounce) can pineapple juice
3 limes, juiced
2 tablespoons almond syrup, such as Torani
6 ounces coconut milk
club soda
3 pinches nutmeg
Garnish: lime wheels, mint sprigs, umbrellas

Directions:
Add a few ice cubes to pitcher.
Add pineapple juice, lime juice, almond syrup and coconut milk and stir to chill. Strain and portion across 4 small glasses.
Top each glass with club soda; mocktails will foam up. Add a dusting of fresh-grated nutmeg, garnish with lime wheel, a sprig of mint and an umbrella.
Cook's notes: Add more almond syrup or honey if you desire a sweeter drink. You may add 2 ounces of rum, if you like.
