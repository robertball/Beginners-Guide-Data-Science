Description: 
Recipe from my dad, Chef Gerard (now deceased). He trained in France and Germany. He developed this recipe as assistant chef at Waldorf Astoria Hotel in NYC many years ago. He later used this at Blackstone Hotel in Kansas City, Drake Hotel in Chicago, and when he was Executive Chef at the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City (where he was featured in Gourmet Magazine). This recipe won countless awards and was in national cooking magazines. Not as easy as other Caesar dressing recipes, but worth the effort! I guarantee it! Julia Child has a great Caesar dressing recipe, but this recipe beat hers in one contest. Chef Gerard suggested letting this dressing stay in the refrigerator for 2 days for better flavor. Optional, but suggested.
