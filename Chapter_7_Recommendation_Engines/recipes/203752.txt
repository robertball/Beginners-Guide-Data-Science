Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package fusilli (spiral) pasta
1/4 cup margarine
1 tablespoon minced onion
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
4 ounces processed cheese food
1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles
1/4 cup cubed Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fusilli, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
Melt the margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook the onion in the melted margarine until translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk the flour into the onion mixture; cook 1 minute more. Slowly pour the milk into the mixture while whisking until the milk is entirely incorporated. Add the cheese food, blue cheese, Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and mustard; cook and stir continually the cheese has melted and the mixture is thick; fold the pasta into the mixture. Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top begins to brown, about 20 minutes.
