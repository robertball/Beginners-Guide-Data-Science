1 C sugar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In another bowl, combine eggs, oil, & strawberries. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened.
For filling, beat cream cheese. Add the egg, sugar, flour and extract; beat well. Spoon half of the batter into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Spread the filling over batter and then top with the remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F for 65-70 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cover loosely with foil if top browns to quickly. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack. Store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
adapted from strawberry ribbon bread by taste of home submitter Carol Wilson. I reduced it to one loaf, used whole wheat flour, and increased the amount of filling.
