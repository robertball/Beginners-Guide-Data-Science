Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (15 ounce) can sliced beets, drained and finely chopped
4 eggs
2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or as needed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Allow the potatoes to cool.
While the potatoes are cooking, place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel and dice once cold.
Place the potatoes, beets, eggs, and mayonnaise into a bowl, mix well, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is a great recipe my aunt used to make while I lived In Costa Rica. It is a typical Costa Rican dish believed to have originated in Russia. Peas are optional but I prefer without. It's an easy Russian salad with a very pretty color.
