Description: 
I have been making this dish since I was in my early teen years. Instead of using regular bread crumbs, I use a packaged cornbread stuffing to make a more crispy/crunchy coating. The Parmesan cheese  may be increased or decreased depending on your personal taste.  Try switching out the American cheese.  I have made this with Swiss cheese and served sauteed mushrooms and onions to put over the top. I usually serve with steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes.
