Description: 
This is very similar to the dipping sauce served with the Awesome Blossom at Chili's restaurants.  I add a pinch of garlic powder simply because we are garlic fanatics. I usually double this recipe because as soon as the first batch of onions are done, the fam starts without me and by the time the last batch of onions are done, there is no sauce left for me. Think about it!
