Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large white onion, minced
6 cups chicken broth
6 cups tomato juice
2 cups canned diced tomatoes
1 cup water
2 white potatoes, cubed
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup diced celery
2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 cup elbow macaroni

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion in the oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir chicken broth, tomato juice, diced tomatoes, and water into the pot; bring to a boil.
Stir potatoes, cauliflower, celery, herbes de Provence, sugar, salt, black pepper, and bay leaves into the pot; reduce heat, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.
Return soup to a boil, stir in macaroni, and cook until macaroni is tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Remove soup from heat; let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Nothing fancy here, just a simple, great comfort food for a long Canadian winter. I used to come inside to this piping hot soup after a day on the outdoor rink. Serve with bread or crackers.
