Ingredients:
2 cups orange juice
1 cup vanilla ice cream, softened
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup diced mango, or more to taste
4 ice pop molds

Directions:
Pour 1/2 cup fruit juice into each ice pop mold and freeze until mostly set, enough so that the next layer can easily be poured on top, at least 2 hours.
Combine vanilla ice cream and oats in a bowl and pour on top of the frozen layer of fruit juice. Push in fruit pieces. Add popsicle sticks to mold and freeze until solid, about 5 hours.

Description: 
This is always a good summer treat for the kids, and adults will love it to. I first thought of this when I was setting up a BBQ party we had one summer. Me and a few friends all had kids the same age and were all pretty young back then, so we hadn't experimented with kid-friendly foods all that much. We wanted a refreshing treat on the healthier side, and this recipe was born.
