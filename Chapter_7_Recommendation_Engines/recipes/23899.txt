Ingredients:
1 pound ground sausage
2 (12 inch) prepared pizza crusts
12 eggs
3/4 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1 (3 ounce) can bacon bits
1 small onion, minced
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Place pizza crusts upside down on cookie sheets and bake for 5 to 7 minutes. Do not allow to brown.
Beat eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Scramble eggs until firm.
Remove crusts from oven, turn right side up, spread 1/2 can of cream of celery soup on top of each crust.  Spread 1/2 of egg mixture on each crust. Sprinkle bacon bits on one pizza and cooked sausage on the other. Cover each with onions and peppers.  Top each pizza with 2 cups of cheese.
Bake in preheated oven, for 25 to 30 minutes, until cheese is golden brown.

Description: 
This recipe will make two pizzas.  I came up with it by accident by throwing a bunch of ingredients together.  We make it on the weekends at the lake for breakfast/brunch.  You can modify toppings.  I usually make one sausage and one bacon.  Each  pizza will serve 3 to 4 people.
