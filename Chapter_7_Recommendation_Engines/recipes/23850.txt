Ingredients:
8 tablespoons butter, divided
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and pepper to taste
6 ounces button mushrooms, sliced
¾ cup Marsala wine, divided
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
¾ cup heavy cream
½ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
¼ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 (12 ounce) package uncooked linguine pasta

Directions:
Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and add to skillet. Cook until halfway done and golden brown on both sides, about 4 to 7 minutes each side. When browned, remove chicken to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Set skillet aside, reserving drippings.
In a separate skillet, melt the 2 remaining tablespoons of butter over medium high heat and saute mushrooms. Add 1/4 cup of the wine and stir; let reduce over low heat for 5 minutes. Set mushrooms and drippings aside, keeping warm.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Add cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup to reserved chicken/drippings skillet. Mix soups well with drippings, making sure no lumps remain. Slowly add cream, stirring constantly, then add remaining 1/2 cup wine; season with rosemary and thyme.  Adjust amount of wine as needed to make a nice, thick gravy consistency. Let mixture simmer over medium heat until bubbly, then add reserved mushroom mixture and stir together.
Pour soup/mushroom mixture over chicken in baking dish, cover and bake in preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes.
About 15 minutes before serving chicken,  bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Serve chicken breasts and sauce over the hot cooked pasta.

Description: 
A thick, creamy mushroom sauce served over golden brown chicken breasts and linguini.  Easy and satisfying. Crusty bread is always good for dipping in the sauce as well.
