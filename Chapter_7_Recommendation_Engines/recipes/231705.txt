Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound cooked ham, cut into strips
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups thinly sliced potatoes
1 cup bite-size carrot pieces

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add ham and brown sugar. Cook and stir ham until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove ham with a slotted spoon to a plate, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Stir cream of mushroom soup, evaporated milk, water, onion, salt, and pepper into the reserved drippings in the skillet; add potato slices and carrot pieces. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook mixture at a simmer until potatoes and carrot are tender, about 35 minutes. Return ham to skillet and continue cooking until ham is hot, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This has a sweet and salty taste balanced out by the creamy potatoes. My kids have loved this dish from an early age, and still love it as teenagers.
