Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut butter (I use crunchy for added texture)
1/2 cup honey
2/3 cup oats
2 and 1/2 scoops protein powder
2 tbsp water (if needed)
1/3 cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
1. First, heat the peanut butter and honey in a pot on medium to low heat until it’s thin. Then remove from heat, add your protein powder and oats, and mix up. You may need to add a little water as the mixture will get super thick. Only add a tsp at a time until it reaches a consistency that is relatively hard but will be easy to mold. I put the mixture into a 9×9 glass dish and press it out into a square. Heat up your chocolate chips (I use 30 sec intervals in the microwave mixing in between- usually takes 90 secs total), and cover the top of your protein bars with chocolate. I throw them in the freezer for 30 mins to an hour to harden then cut six lines down and one across for a total of 14 bars.
