Ingredients:
3/4 cup buckwheat flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup almond meal
1/3 cup oats
1/4 cup coconut flakes
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup yogurt
1/4 cup grapeseed oil
3 tablespoons milk
1/3 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 8x12-inch baking pan.
Combine buckwheat flour, sugar, almond meal, oats, coconut flakes, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in coconut oil with a pastry blender until dough is well-mixed and crumbly.
Mix yogurt, grapeseed oil, and milk together in a bowl. Add to buckwheat flour mixture. Fold in blueberries until just combined. Spread into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This was based off a chocolate chip recipe, but it isn't at all like it! It only lasts two nights in our house, it's that good. The yogurt makes it deliciously moist.
