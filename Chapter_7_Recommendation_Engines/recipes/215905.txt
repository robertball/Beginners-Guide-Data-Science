Ingredients:
2 tablespoons rosemary, minced
1/4 cup Spectrum Organic Extra Virgin Frantoio Olive Oil
1 pound asparagus, trimmed
1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 teaspoon Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt
Freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a saucepan, heat rosemary in Spectrum Organic Extra Virgin Frantoio Olive Oil over medium-low heat until fragrant and sizzling. Remove from heat and let steep for 20 minutes.
Strain Spectrum Organic Extra Virgin Frantoio Olive Oil, reserving rosemary, and toss potatoes in 2 tablespoons of Spectrum Organic Extra Virgin Frantoio Olive Oil in a large bowl. Transfer potatoes to a roasting pan and roast for 20-30 minutes, until they are slightly browned and yield to a knife but still resistant.
Toss asparagus in remaining Spectrum Organic Extra Virgin Frantoio Olive Oil and add to potatoes.
Roast for another 8-10 minutes (less if asparagus are very thin), turning frequently, until potatoes are golden and asparagus are tender.
Season to taste with Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt and fresh ground pepper.
