Ingredients:
100 grams mafalde pasta
1 tbsp olive oil
1 boneless skinless chicken breast
1 small yellow onion
1 small red bell pepper
1 small yellow bell pepper
1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves
1 tsp grated lemon zest
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
8 cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup Italian green olives
1/4 cup grated pecorino
1/4 cup Grana Padano

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Cook the mafalde pasta until flexible but not soft, about half the time written on the package. Preheat the oven to 185Â°C.
Meanwhile, dice the onions and bell peppers. Cut the chicken into strips.
In an oven and stove top-safe casserole dish, heat the oil on medium high heat. Add the chicken strips and brown, add onions, bell peppers, thyme, lemon zest, pepper flakes, cherry tomatoes, and olives. Stir and cook until the onions have begun to look translucent. Turn off the heat. Add the half-cooked pasta, and stir it into the vegetables.
Top with both cheeses. Bake until bubbly and the cheese on top has melted and browned. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Vegetables, chicken breast, pasta, and Italian cheeses are baked until bubbly for a delicious one pot dinner for two. I like to serve this with a light salad and crisp white wine.
