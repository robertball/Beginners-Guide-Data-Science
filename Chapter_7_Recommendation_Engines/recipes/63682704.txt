Ingredients:
2 lbs 80/20 ground beef
2 whole eggs
1/2 cup ketchup divided
1/4 cup A-1 steak sauce
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 1/2 tsp S & P mixture (Make this by mixing 7 parts kosher salt to 1 part coarse ground pepper - reserve the rest for future use)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl, reserving some of the ketchup to glaze the meatloaf. Shape into a loaf and place in a shallow baking dish. If you end up using all the ketchup, just squeeze some more from the bottle on top of the meatloaf and spread it over before you bake. Bake for 1 hour and let rest, covered with foil, for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
