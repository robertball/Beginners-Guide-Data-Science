Image:

Ingredients:
2 (16 oz.) Pillsbury refrigerator chocolate chip cookie rolls
2 (8 oz.) packages of cream cheese, softened
2/3 cups of sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat and grease 9x13 inch pan. Slice well chilled dough into 1/4 inch slices and spread in bottom of prepared pan.
Combine cream cheese, sugar, eggs and vanilla with electric mixer.
Spread cream cheese mixture over cookie dough (I suggest you chill so the next layer is easier and more even to apply at this point, but not necessary.)
Place remaining dough slices over cream cheese mixture.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes until crust is golden brown. Chill completely. Cut into squares. Refrigerate leftovers.
