Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1/2 large red onion, chopped
2 Anaheim chile peppers, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 pound Muenster cheese, shredded
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix the ground beef, sausage, onion, chile pepper, garlic, Muenster cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and chili powder in a mixing bowl until evenly combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix again. Form the meat mixture into 8 patties.
Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
