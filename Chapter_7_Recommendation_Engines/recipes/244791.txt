Description: 
You'll love it! Better than any store-bought you can get. I've visited many bars in Buffalo, NY, and this recipe is just as good. 

This recipe does not address the wings themselves...since it really doesn't matter how you cook them (bake, fry, grill). Just put them in a bowl when they're cooked and drench them in this sauce!
