Ingredients:
1 c all purpose flour (wheat flour works well, but you will require the 1/4 c milk below.)
1 c vanilla yogurt drink
1/4 c milk (optional)
1 egg
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 c cappuccino mix powder
1/8 c chocolate milk mix powder
1/8 tsp cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, etc. (optional)
4 T melted butter (optional)
2 T butter or non-stick spray for pan

Directions:
PREP 1:
In a medium sized bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients:
Flour, baking powder, baking soda, cappuccino powder, chocolate milk powder.
PREP 2:
In a separate bowl, stir together remaining wet ingredients:
Vanilla yogurt drink, egg, milk if using, and butter if using.
PREP 3:
Combine well the dry ingredients into yogurt mixture and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
Batter will get light and bubbly.
Preheat a non-stick skillet on medium heat and coat lightly with non-stick spray to bottom of pan if necessary, before adding the batter.
Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, measure out 1/4 cup of batter and pour into skillet.
When bubbles around the sides and edges of the batter remain open and dry, flip pancake over and continue to cook, about 1 minute per side, watching carefully.  Keep an eye on underside of pancake while cooking.  The second side usually finishes more quickly than the first side.
***Subsequent pancakes will cook faster, as the pan will be hotter.  Adjust pan's heat accordingly.  This is normal.

Description: 
All toppings work with this pancake recipe.  For kids, I fill them like cannoli with whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.  Another fun one is to thinly brush them peanut butter followed by a light dusting of cinnamon, before rolling them up.  These pancakes are so light, fluffy, balanced and cook evenly all the way through, every time.
