Ingredients:
5 small red potatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups 2% milk
1 cooked salmon fillet, flaked
1 1/4 cups frozen peas
1 1/4 cups frozen corn
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Swiss cheese
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1 green onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion and celery in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add flour, salt, and pepper to onion mixture and stir until well-combined.
Slowly whisk milk into onion mixture; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes, flaked salmon, peas, corn, and dill; cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Stir Swiss cheese and Cheddar cheese into chowder until cheese is melted and heated through, about 5 minutes. Ladle chowder into bowls and garnish with green onion.

Description: 
So simple and delicious! My hubby and I love it! It's delicious and a great way to use up leftover salmon! To make this even easier, plan ahead and grill extra potatoes in foil while grilling the salmon. Then just toss the cooked potatoes in the same time as the salmon.
