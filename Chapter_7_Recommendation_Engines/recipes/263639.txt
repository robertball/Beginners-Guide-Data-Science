Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 small white onion, finely chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped, divided
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
1/3 cup fresh oregano leaves
6 flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a large pie pan with olive oil.
Combine black beans, bell pepper, onion, 1 jalapeno pepper, taco seasoning, and salt in a frying pan. Cook until juices are released, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in green onions, oregano, and remaining jalapeno pepper.
Fill a tortilla with 1/6 of the black bean mixture and wrap into a burrito. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. Place burritos in the prepared pie pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until crisp and slightly brown, about 10 minutes.
