Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 (18 ounce) jar creamy peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (2 pound) package confectioners' sugar
2 cups flaked coconut
6 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup shortening

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, butter, peanut butter and vanilla until smooth. Beat in sugar. Stir in coconut if desired. Form rounded tablespoonfuls into egg shapes. Place on waxed paper-lined baking sheets. Chill for 30 minutes.
In a microwave-safe bowl or heavy saucepan, melt chocolate chips and shortening: stir until smooth. Dip eggs until coated; place on waxed paper to harden.
For more decorative eggs, place about 1/4 cup melted chocolate in a small plastic bag. Cut a hole in the corner of the bag; pipe chocolate over tops of eggs. Store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
These easy-to-make confections are a must for me at Easter. Have youngsters help shape the eggs, then reward them with some of the chocolaty candies.                                 --Ethel Charles, Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania
