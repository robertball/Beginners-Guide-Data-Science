Ingredients:
1 cup Gluten Free oats
1/2 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 large egg whites, room temperature
1 tbsp unsweetened vanilla almond milk
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
pinch of sea salt
1/2 tsp almond extract
1 cup strawberries, washed & hulled
2 tbsp dairy free dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat a skillet to medium-high heat and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
To a blender or food processor, add all ingredients and process until batter is smooth. It should be slightly runny.
To the skillet, add 1/4 cup of batter at a time to form a pancake. Cook 3-4 minutes until pancake begins to bubble then flip with a spatula and cook another 2-3 minutes on the other side.
Place pancakes on a cooling rack as you cook remainder of the batter.
Serve and top with more fresh berries and dark chocolate.
Keep in an air tight container for up to a week.
