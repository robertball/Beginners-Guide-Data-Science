Ingredients:
2 cups canned pumpkin puree
2 tablespoons butter, room temperature
2 eggs, lightly beaten
4 egg whites, lightly beaten
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup low-fat plain yogurt
2 cups polenta or yellow cornmeal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
In a blender or food processor, blend pumpkin, butter, eggs, and egg whites. Mix in the brown sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Blend until smooth, and transfer to a medium bowl.
Mix yogurt and polenta into the pumpkin mixture. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly before slicing.

Description: 
The grainy texture of polenta and the marriage of flavours of pumpkin and sweet spices create a unique versatile loaf. Can also be made with cooked sweet potato or butternut squash instead of pumpkin. Serve warm or cold with savoury or sweet dishes.
