Ingredients:
1 lb ground pork
1 lb ground beef
2 cups cubed (uncooked) potatoes
1 onion finely chopped
1 tsp seasoned salt
water (see instructions below)
1/2 box Bell's Stuffing Mix
2 boxes pre-made pie crusts (i.e. Pillsbury)

Directions:
Combine beef, pork, onion, potatoes & salt in a pot over medium-high heat. Add just enough water to cover mixture.
Bring mixture to a boil for approx. 1/2 hour. Stir occasionally - mixture should not have big chunks of meat.
Remove from heat and add Bell's Stuffing Mix. If mixture seems dry, add a little water. Mixture should be moist.
Arrange 2 pie plates. Place 1 pie crust in bottom of each. Divide mixture between 2 pies. Place remaining 2 pie crusts on each of the pies. Cut 3 small steam holes on top of each pie.
Bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for approx. 45 minutes.
