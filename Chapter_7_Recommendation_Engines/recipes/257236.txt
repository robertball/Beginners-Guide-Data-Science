Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 cup chopped dark chocolate
1/4 cup chopped milk chocolate (such as Dairy Milk)
3 pinches ground ginger
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste

Directions:
Pour milk into a double boiler over simmering water; heat until hot and steaming. Reduce heat to very low. Add dark chocolate and milk chocolate bit by bit, whisking gently to melt into the milk. Add ginger and cayenne once chocolate is velvety smooth with no unmelted bits.
Pour melted chocolate into espresso cups or other small-sized cups. Wipe steam off the bottom of the pan to prevent it from dripping into the cups as you pour.
