Ingredients:
3 1/2 ounces dried Thai-style rice noodles, wide (such as Chantaboon Rice Noodles)
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 pound pork (any cut), thinly sliced
1 serrano pepper, minced, or more to taste
30 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup bean sprouts

Directions:
Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak until white and softened, about 1 hour. Drain the noodles, and set aside.
Heat 1 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in a wok or large skillet over low heat, and cook and stir 2 minced garlic cloves until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the soaked noodles, 1/2 teaspoon of thick soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons of sugar, and cook and stir until the noodles have absorbed the soy sauce and turned brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the noodles from the skillet.
Heat the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in the wok over low heat; stir in the remaining 2 minced garlic cloves, and cook until brown and beginning to crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high, and stir in the pork, serrano pepper, basil, 1/2 teaspoon thick soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until the pork is no longer pink and the edges of the meat are beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Return the noodles to the wok, and stir in the bean sprouts. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 more minutes.

Description: 
Pad Kee Mao translates to 'Drunken Stir Fry' in English. This is one variation of many such 'drunken' dishes that are commonly hawked by street-side vendors in Bangkok. The 'drunken' description comes from the fact that it originated in late-night revelers' kitchens after stumbling home from the nightclubs in the wee hours of the morning.
