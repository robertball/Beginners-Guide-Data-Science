https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 medium zucchini
1 medium yellow squash
1 large carrot
1 cup small broccoli florets
1 small red pepper
1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil
Juice from ½ lemon
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut all vegetables—except the broccoli—into matchsticks. Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add all the vegetables to the pan and sauté until almost tender. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle the oregano over the vegetables; toss to coat.
When vegetables are tender—don’t overcook or they will get soggy—turn off the heat, pour the lemon juice evenly over the vegetables, and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
