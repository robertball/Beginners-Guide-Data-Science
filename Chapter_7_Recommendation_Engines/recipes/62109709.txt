Ingredients:
8 ounces fresh sliced white mushrooms
8 ounces fresh sliced portabello or shitake mushrooms
1 generous cup chopped vidalia onion (about 1 large onion)
16 ounces seitan, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
16 ounces nonfat sour cream
14 ounces vegetable broth
1/3 cup tomato paste
1-2 Tablespoons flour
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large frying pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.  Chop onion into small pieces and add to heated pan.  Clean mushrooms and add them to the frying pan as well.
Once the onions are tender, add the seitan and garlic, cooking about 1 minute longer.
Lower the heat and add the vegetable broth.  Finally, mix in the sour cream and tomato paste.  Allow to heat about 5 minutes on low heat, stirring often.
Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour.  If sauce requires additional thickening, add another tablespoon.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve hot over whole wheat egg noodles.  Enjoy!
