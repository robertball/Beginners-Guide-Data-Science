Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white whole-wheat flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk
2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
12 (6 inch) bamboo skewers
1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled and halved horizontally
3/4 cup low-fat frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ® Lite), thawed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray.
Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; cut in cold butter using a pastry blender or your hands until crumbly.
Stir buttermilk and applesauce together in a separate bowl; pour into the flour mixture until dough comes together and is sticky. Using 2 spoons, drop dough into about 1/2 tablespoon-size mounds onto the prepared baking sheet, making 36 total mounds.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are slightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool biscuits.
Thread 3 biscuits onto each skewer, alternating with 3 strawberries halves, until all the ingredients are used. Top each skewer with whipped topping.
