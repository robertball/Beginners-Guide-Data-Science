Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package fresh meat-filled tortellini
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 (4 ounce) package finely chopped pancetta
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1/2 tablespoon tomato puree
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 cup fresh green peas
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pancetta and saute until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Ladle in the reserved pasta water; simmer for about 1 minute. Add tomato puree and continue to simmer until reduced by about half, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add cream; simmer until sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tortellini and peas, tossing to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley and serve immediately.
