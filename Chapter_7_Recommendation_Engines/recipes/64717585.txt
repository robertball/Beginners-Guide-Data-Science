Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground allspice
1/3 cup toasted walnuts, chopped
1/3 cup chopped apricots
1/3 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 cup buttermilk
1 large egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin or line with paper liners.
Spread oats on a rimmed baking sheet and place in the preheating oven until toasted and fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes.
Mix toasted oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and allspice in a large bowl. Add walnuts, apricots, and dates.
Whisk melted butter, buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour over the flour mixture and mix briefly until batter is combined.
Scoop batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in the tin. Transfer to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
Toasting oats adds such great flavor to these muffins. I've tried them with chopped fresh apple and raisins too. Feel free to change up the fruits and nuts based on what you have on hand.
