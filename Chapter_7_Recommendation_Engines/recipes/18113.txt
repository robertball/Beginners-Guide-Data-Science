Ingredients:
1 large eggplant
1/3 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
2 teaspoons kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to broiler setting.
Wash eggplant thoroughly, then pierce skin with a fork in several places. Place on a baking sheet and broil in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, until soft. Turn eggplant over and broil for an additional 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and slice in half.
Scoop out eggplant pulp with a spoon and place in a medium bowl. Mix in onion, olive oil, dill, salt, and pepper. Serve hot or cold.
