Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
¼  sweet onion, cut into small dice
1 stalk celery, cut into small dice
1 (5 ounce) can chicken chunks, shredded
½ teaspoon granulated garlic
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
¼ cup chicken broth
¼ (1 pound) package processed cheese food (such as Velveeta(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), cut into cubes
2 tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or more to taste
½ (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix
4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir sweet onion and celery in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken, granulated garlic, and seasoned salt; continue cooking until chicken is warmed, about 3 minutes.
Stir cream cheese, chicken broth, and processed cheese food into the chicken mixture. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and cook until the cheeses are melted, about 5 minutes.
Stir blue cheese salad dressing, chile-garlic sauce, and ranch dressing mix into the cheese mixture; cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the mixture; cook until melted, 1 to 2 minutes more.

Description: 
I came up with this dip when I was in the mood for Buffalo chicken dip, but didn't have the necessary ingredients. It is a creamy cheesy dip with a nice bit of back-end heat. I don't usually measure when I cook, so feel free to adjust any measurements to fit your taste. We ate this with sliced french bread, pretzels, and chips.
