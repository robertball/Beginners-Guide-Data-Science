Ingredients:
cake:
1 2/3 c flour
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 c pumpkin puree (fresh is preferred)
1/3 c whole milk
1 egg
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp allspice
2 tsp vanilla extract
topping:
3/4 c brown sugar
1/2 c melted butter
2 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
Combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and allspice.
Add egg, pumpkin, whole milk, and vanilla. Stir until smooth.
Rub some butter on a 9 inch square metal baking pan to grease it. Transfer batter into the pan.
Combine topping ingredients and "crumble" on top of batter. The brown sugar will melt into the batter and caramelize.
Bake for 20-25 minutes.
