Ingredients:
2 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1 tbsp. dried mustard
1 tbsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. pepper
8 lbs. pork ribs
Chicken broth (optional)
1 1/2 cups barbecue sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Combine spices.
Place ribs on a double layer of foil and sprinkle rub all over ribs.
Wrap each rack individually and then place on baking sheets.
Bake for abut 2 hours (3 hours if not baby back ribs.)
Carefully unwrap ribs and pour any juices into a container to save for later.
Let ribs cool completely the re-wrap ribs and chill for later - this develops the flavor and also makes then easier to handle.
Add broth or water to  saved juices to measure 1 1/2 cups.
Whisk juices into barbecue sauce.
Grill ribs, basting with sauce, turning frequently.
Grill until lacquered and charred in places and completely heated through - about 7-10 minutes.
Cut between ribs to serve and serve with additional barbecue sauce if desired.
