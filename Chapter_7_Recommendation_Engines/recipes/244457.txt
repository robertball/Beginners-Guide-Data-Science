Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
½ cup butter
½ cup bread crumbs, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a skillet or large pot over low heat. Add bread crumbs and stir until coated in butter. Mix noodles into bread crumbs mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until a crust forms on the bottom, about 30 minutes; season with salt.
