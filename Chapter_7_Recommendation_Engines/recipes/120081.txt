Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
3 tablespoons chopped onion
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1 tablespoon lemon juice
BISCUITS:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons shortening
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon diced pimientos

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute green pepper and onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually add milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened. Whisk in soup until blended. Stir in the ham and lemon juice; heat through. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese, milk and pimientos just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead gently 4-5 times. Roll to about 1/2-in. thickness; cut out six biscuits with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Arrange biscuits over ham mixture. Bake 18-22 minutes longer or until biscuits are golden brown. Serve in individual dishes.
