Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons shortening
3 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted, divided

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt; cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk, tossing with a fork until a ball forms.
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 5-6 times. Roll or pat to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/2-in. biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet. Brush tops with 1 tablespoon butter. Bake at 450 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with remaining butter. Serve warm.

Description: 
I CREATED this recipe in a larger quantity to enter in the Kentucky State Fair. It won first place! Since biscuits are best fresh out of the oven, I sized my recipe down to yield four - perfect for two. I make them whenever biscuits fit into the menu. -Bessie Hulett, Shively, Kentucky
