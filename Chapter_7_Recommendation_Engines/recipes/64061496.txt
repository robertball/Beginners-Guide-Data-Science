Ingredients:
8 medium-size potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1-inch chunks
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (divided)
6 slices of bacon, cooked and chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup sour cream
Green onions or parsley for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the chopped potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook them over medium-high heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender. Then, drain the potatoes. (You could also bake the potatoes in the oven and then cut them into chunks.)
Put the potatoes back in the saucepan and toss with the bacon.
In a separate bowl, mix the salt, pepper, 1 1/2 cups of cheese, sour cream, and onion. Then, add this mixture to the saucepan with the potatoes and toss thoroughly.
Grease a 2.5- to 3-quart casserole dish with cooking spray, and then spoon the mixture into the dish.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, then top the dish with the remaining cheese and garnish and let it bake for another 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.
Enjoy!
