Ingredients:
1 cup almond butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup shortening
1/3 cup vegan margarine
1 overripe banana, mashed
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)
3 ounces dark chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup white sugar
36 whole blanched almonds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix almond butter, brown sugar, shortening, and margarine together in a bowl until creamy. Stir in mashed banana.
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir into almond butter mixture. Stir in water if dough appears too thick. Fold in dark chocolate.
Pour white sugar onto a shallow dish. Form dough into 1-inch balls and roll in sugar. Arrange 2 inches apart on baking sheets; flatten with a fork. Top each cookie with an almond.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
