Ingredients:
3 tablespoons poppy seeds
3 eggs
2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons white sugar
12 thick slices white bread
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl whisk together the poppy seeds, eggs, milk, vanilla, nutmeg, and sugar.
Heat a griddle or large frying pant over medium heat. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in the frying pan.
Dip one slice of the bread into the egg batter, then quickly take it out. Continue dipping bread slices, stirring the batter frequently so all the poppy seeds don't sink to the bottom, and laying the bread on the frying pan until no more bread will fit.
Cook the slices for about 2 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown. Repeat with remaining bread. Serve hot.

Description: 
I like to use the semisoft, inexpensive french bread or italian bread found at supermarkets, but other breads work well, too. The amount of butter for frying is approximate; use as much as you need. Serve the french toast with maple syrup.
