1/2 cup natural peanut butter (such as NuttZoÂ®)
1/4 cup mild honey

1/2 cup fresh raspberries
1/4 cup golden flaxseed meal
1 tablespoon chia seeds

Directions:

Line an 8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
Press oat mixture into the prepared baking dish, using your fingers to flatten into the corners. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours. Cut into bars.
