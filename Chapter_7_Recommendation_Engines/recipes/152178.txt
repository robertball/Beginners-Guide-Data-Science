Make a dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, sugar, and vinegar in a small bowl. Stir in the poppy seeds; set aside.

Description: 
I stopped at a deli and ordered a meal that came with this salad. The salad was so different that I didn't even want to try it. I did try it and loved it! I created my own version at home. Everyone loves it! You can use spinach leaves entirely if you prefer, or mix in any kind of greens you like.
