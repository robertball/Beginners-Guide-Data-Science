Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/3 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/8 teaspoon fine salt
1/2 cup whole milk
Sauce:
1 1/2 cups water
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (optional)
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish. Set aside.
Combine flour, brown sugar, peanut butter, canola oil, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Beat using a hand mixer on medium speed to incorporate ingredients, about 30 seconds. Beat in milk slowly and mix for 1 1/2 minutes more. Spread batter evenly into the prepared dish using a rubber spatula. Place the dish onto a larger baking pan with sides at least 1/4-inch deep to catch potential spills.
Microwave water in a microwave-safe measuring cup until boiling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract, and salt; stir until sugar and cocoa have dissolved. Pour onto top of cake batter; do not stir. Carefully place into the oven.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Remove carefully from the oven and place onto a cooling rack to cool and thicken up, at least 20 minutes, before spooning out.
