Ingredients:
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
2 (4 ounce) packets saltine crackers
1/2 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Insert a knife 3/4 of the way below the head of 1 shrimp and cut down the center of the shrimp's back to the tail. Open shrimp with your fingers so it lies flat. Repeat with remaining shrimp.
Pour flour onto a shallow plate. Whisk eggs and water together in a small bowl to make egg wash.
Place saltine crackers in a large resealable bag. Crush into fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Pour crumbs onto a plate.
Coat each shrimp with flour. Dip in egg wash; roll in cracker crumbs on both sides. Transfer to a large plate. Refrigerate shrimp for 2 hours.
Heat 1 inch vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.

Please try it, I promise you won't be disappointed. I'd love to hear some comments. Please be easy on me, this is my first post, but I'm sure you'll be happy making these babies! They rock!
