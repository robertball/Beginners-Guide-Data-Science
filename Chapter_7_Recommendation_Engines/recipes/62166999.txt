Ingredients:
1 can buttermilk biscuits (regular, not jumbo or grand size)
1 jar Ragu Homestyle pizza sauce
10 slices pepperoni
Shredded mozzerella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Lightly spray muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray.
Press biscuits, one at a time between hands to flatten.
Place biscuits in pan, one per hole, pressing to bottom and up sides of pan.
Let sit 5 minutes, biscuit will settle and rise slightly.  Press in place again.
Spoon 1 Tablespoon pizza sauce in each biscuit.
Top with 1 slice pepperoni (I like to cut the slice in two and place both pieces in tin.)
Top with 1 Tablespoon (more or less) cheese.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove each pizza from tin and place on baking rack to cool for a few minutes.
Enjoy!
