Description: 
This easy, low-carb fig salad with creamy Gorgonzola and peppery arugula is a beautiful and elegant dish that's perfect for a light lunch or a summer salad. Makes for easy summer entertaining if you prep everything in advance and assemble just before serving. I didn't feel the need to toss this salad as I was afraid of damaging the gorgeous figs.
