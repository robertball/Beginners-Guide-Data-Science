Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can plain pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
3 eggs
3/4 cup granular sucrolose sweetener (such as Splenda®), or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (18.25 ounce) package sugar-free yellow cake mix
1 cup chopped nuts
1 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Mix pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, eggs, granular sweetener, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Pour into the baking pan.
Sift dry cake mix over pumpkin mixture. Sprinkle nuts on top; press down lightly. Spoon melted butter evenly over nuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes. Invert onto a serving platter and peel off parchment paper.
