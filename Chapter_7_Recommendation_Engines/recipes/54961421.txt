Ingredients:
1 cup fresh raspberries
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Spray an 8 inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
Combine raspberries and brown sugar in a bowl.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.  Combine sour cream, butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and egg, and add to flour mixture.  Stir just until moist.  Spoon 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan.  Spread raspberry mixture evenly over the batter.  Spoon remaining batter over raspberry mixture.  Top with almonds.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.
Combine confectioners' sugar, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir well.  Drizzle glaze over cake.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
