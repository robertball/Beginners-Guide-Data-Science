Ingredients:
6 kiwi fruits, divided
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup fresh lime juice

Directions:
Cut 5 kiwi in half crosswise and scoop flesh from skins with a spoon. Blend with sugar and lime juice in a blender until pureed, about 15 seconds.
Transfer to a measuring cup with a spout and pour into 6 (3-ounce) flat ice pop molds, dividing evenly.
Peel remaining kiwi and thinly slice crosswise into 12 slices. Submerge 2 slices in each mold, arranging them so 1 slice presses against each of the mold's wider sides. Cover molds, insert sticks between the slices, and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours and up to 2 weeks.
