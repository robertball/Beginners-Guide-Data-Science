Ingredients:
12 oz. Pasta (Penne is recommended)
3 Tbsp Flour
3 Tbsp Butter
2 Cups Whole Milk
Two Shallots, diced
8 oz. Goat Cheese
10 oz. Baby Spinach
2 Tbsp Chopped Chives
2 Tbsp Basil Leaves, chopped
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
Eight Large Carrots, sliced
Salt and Pepper to taste
One Pot of Water

Directions:
Pour some water in a large pot and get it boiling!
In a smaller saucepan, melt the butter and mix in diced shallots. Cook the shallots until they are golden-brown, then add flour and mix it in to form a roux.
Add some whole milk, mix it in until the mixture thickens, and then add some more milk and continue mixing. Repeat until you’ve used all 2 cups of milk.
Once all of the milk is mixed in and the mixture thickens to form a white sauce, add goat cheese and mix it in. Once the goat cheese has melted into the sauce mixture, chop up, add, and mix in some fresh chives and basil.
Cover the sauce and set it aside (keep it warm).
Once the water in the larger pot is boiling, add pasta and cook as the package directs (approx. 12 minutes for penne).
In the meantime, slice up the carrots and sauté them in olive oil until the pieces get softer and start to brown (this should take 10-15 minutes). Add salt and pepper to taste.
Once the pasta is al dente, add spinach a handful at a time, and boil it with the pasta for about a minute. Afterwards, strain the pasta and spinach.
Place the pasta and spinach on a plate and top with white sauce. Add the sautéed carrot pieces to the center and serve!
