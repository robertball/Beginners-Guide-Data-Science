Ingredients:
1 Devils food cake mix (prepared & baked as directed)
1 pint whipping cream
1 8 oz. Cream cheese (softened)
2 cups confectioners sugar
1 large Hershey chocolate almond bar (freeze until needed)

Directions:
Prepare cake mix and bake in two 9” round pans (actually best in 3 pans for easier layering). Let cool.
Place metal mixing bowl in freezer for at least 30 minutes beforehand. Whip the whipping cream on high speed into “cool whip” consistency. In separate bowl, blend the cream cheese with confectioner’s sugar. Fold in whip cream and whip thoroughly together.
Layer the cake with the frosting and grate the almond bar on top of each layer. Be sure to keep in fridge any leftovers (if you’re lucky enough to have any!).

Description: 
This cake could be done with store bought cool whip to save time, but this is the spruced up version of this fabulous cake. Im showing the recipe with boxed cake mix, but its even better with the recipe for homemade chocolate cake. You can also substitute with other favorite candy bars, such as Heath or Butterfinger.
