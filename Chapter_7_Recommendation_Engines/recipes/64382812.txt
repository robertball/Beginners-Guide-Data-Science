Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until lightly browned. Place sausage in the pot, and pour in broth.

Description: 
Very good flavor. Sometimes I use crushed tomatoes with garlic, onion, or basil now that they're available. Turkey smoked sausage is great in this recipe!Modified from: Cabbage and Smoked Sausage Soup
