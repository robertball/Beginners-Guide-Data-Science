Ingredients:
3 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups dried cranberries
1/2 cup pine nuts/pignoli

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the flour, wheat germ, oats, brown sugar, egg, butter and salt; stir well to combine. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Deflate the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in the cranberries and pine nuts. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
