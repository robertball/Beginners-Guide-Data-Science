Ingredients:
2 teaspoons dried red chile pepper, crushed
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
1 ½ teaspoons garam masala
1 ½ teaspoons salt
1 ½ teaspoons minced ginger
2 cloves garlic, crushed
5  Roma tomatoes, seeded, diced
½ cup plain yogurt
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 2-inch cubes
½ cup butter
2  red bell peppers, sliced
2  onions, thinly sliced
¼ cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander

Directions:
Mix the ground red chile peppers, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, garam masala, salt, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, and yogurt in a large bowl. Stir the chicken pieces into the yogurt mixture, and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.
Melt the butter in a large skillet on medium heat and cook the bell pepper slices and onion until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the chicken and marinade to the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly, 5 to 10 minutes until the chicken firms and is no longer pink in the center.
Turn up heat to medium-high and mix in the cream and coriander. Cook until mixture just begins to boil, stirring continuously. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a North Indian style of chicken curry. Serve garnished with sprigs of fresh coriander. If possible, purchase dried red chile peppers or ground red chile powder from an Indian grocery store, instead of using American-style chili powder in this dish.
