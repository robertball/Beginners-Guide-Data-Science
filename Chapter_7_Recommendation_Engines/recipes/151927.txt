Ingredients:
1 whole (10 pound) Cinderella pumpkin
1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, sliced into 1/2 inch pieces
3 carrots, peeled and sliced
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 large onion, peeled and chopped
3 cloves garlic - minced, or amount to taste
2 cups parsnips, peeled and cubed (optional)
2 cups rutabagas, peeled and cubed (optional)
2 cups cabbage, coarsely chopped (optional)
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
2 zucchini, cut into chunks
1 1/2 cups canned or frozen corn
2 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 cups cooked white or brown rice (optional)
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 (1.25 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
1/2 (1 ounce) packet dried Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
Cut around the top of the pumpkin to make a lid. Use a large metal spoon to scoop out the inside membrane and seeds.
Place the pumpkin on the prepared baking sheet, and place in the preheated oven. Cook for 1 hour, then lower heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Meanwhile, place the sausage in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, turning frequently, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. If desired, stir in the parsnips, rutabaga, and/or the cabbage; cook until the vegetables are almost ender, about 5 minutes. Add the red and green peppers, broccoli, zucchini, and corn. Pour in the chicken broth, add the rice, and cook 5 minutes more. Stir in the parsley, red pepper flakes, onion soup mix, and Italian seasoning. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Keeping the pumpkin on the baking sheet, spoon the vegetable-sausage mixture into the pumpkin, and replace the lid. Loosely cover the pumpkin with aluminum foil.
Cook the pumpkin in the preheated oven until the flesh is tender, about 4 hours. Scoop some of the pumpkin flesh away from the sides to combine with the  vegetable mixture. To serve, place the pumpkin on a serving platter, and remove the lid to ladle out the contents.

Description: 
This gorgeous pumpkin creation will make your step sisters turn green with envy. It's chock full of seasonal veggies and will feed a hungry crowd at any holiday table. The Cinderella pumpkin is a variety that is flattened and deeply ribbed. They usually grow 25 to 30 lbs. Mine was more like ten pounds and it was still wider than a cookie sheet. I think the recipe would be quite doable with several small pumpkins like the sugar ones, for individual servings or for a smaller group. I prepared the veggie filling prior to filling the pumpkin.
