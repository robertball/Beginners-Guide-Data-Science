Ingredients:
3 cups chopped cabbage
1 unpeeled red apple, cored and chopped
1 unpeeled Granny Smith apple, cored and chopped
1 carrot, grated
1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
2 green onions, finely chopped
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste

Directions:
Put cabbage in colander and sprinkle a little salt over it.  It will remove the excess water from the cabbage.  Let sit for 30-60 minutes.  It gives you a very crisp cabbage.  In a large bowl, combine cabbage, red apple, green apple, carrot, red bell pepper, and green onions. In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, brown sugar, and lemon juice. Pour dressing over salad.
If it's too sweet, add l t. vinegar.
