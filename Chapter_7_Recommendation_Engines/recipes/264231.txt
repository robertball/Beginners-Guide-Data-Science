Ingredients:
4 cups room-temperature water
1/2 cup coarsely ground coffee beans
2 cups almond milk, or to taste

Directions:
Combine water and coffee grounds in a large carafe. Stir and cover. Let sit at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 12 to 18 hours.
Pour the coffee into a bottle through a coffee filter or cheesecloth to catch the grounds.
Fill an ice cube tray with the cold-brewed coffee and freeze until cubes are set, 6 hours to overnight. Store frozen cubes in a resealable plastic bag until ready to use.
Fill 1 glass with coffee ice cubes and top with almond milk.
