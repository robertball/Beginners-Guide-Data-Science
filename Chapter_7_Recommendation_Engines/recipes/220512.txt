Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups cooked white rice
1 teaspoon chicken soup base (such as Better than BouillonÂ®)
6 ounces cooked corned beef, thinly sliced
1 egg, beaten
6 fresh spearmint leaves, cut into thin strips

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a wok over medium-high heat.
Cook and stir rice and chicken paste in hot oil until combined, about 2 minutes.
Stir corned beef into rice mixture until rice begins to brown, 2 to 4 minutes.
Remove the wok from heat and clear a hole in the center of the rice to cook egg.
Pour the beaten egg into center of the rice. Tilt the wok around to spread the egg into the rice, allowing the residual heat to completely cook the egg.
Portion the fried rice into 2 bowls and top with fresh mint.

Ireland meets the Orient? Nah, that's too corny. Truth is, I just came up with this one night while searching for a late night snack to eat. It was so good I thought I'd share it with everybody. Hope you enjoy!
