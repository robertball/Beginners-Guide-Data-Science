Ingredients:
3 carrots, coarsely chopped
1 head garlic, split but not peeled
1 (5 pound) leg of lamb
1 1/4 cups red wine
1 1/4 cups lamb stock
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Place carrots and garlic in a roasting pan large enough for the leg of lamb. Place lamb on top. Pour in wine and lamb stock. Place roasting pan on the stove and heat over medium-low heat until liquid is boiling. Cover the roasting pan tightly with aluminum foil, using oven mitts to protect your hands, and place in the oven.
Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium, about 7 hours. Remove from the oven.
Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer lamb into a second roasting pan.
Roast lamb uncovered until skin is crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rest before slicing.
While lamb is resting, pour cooking juices from the first roasting pan into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer until reduced into a gravy, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
If you're slow-roasting lamb, it comes out so tender you don't need a knife to cut it. And when I say slow, I mean slow - 7 hours. And I am roasting the leg of lamb in the oven, not in a slow cooker. Tastes great served with Dauphinoise potatoes or mashed potatoes and vegetables.
