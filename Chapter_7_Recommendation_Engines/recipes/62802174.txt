Ingredients:
3 large bone-in chicken breasts boiled and deboned
14 ounces dry bread stuffing mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of celery soup
1 1/4 cups chicken broth (from boiling the chicken)
1 1/4 cup evaporated milk
3 ounces melted butter

Directions:
Boil chicken bone side up in water until tender about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.  Debone chicken and reserve broth.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Layer the deboned chicken meat in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle stuffing mix over the chicken layer.
In a large bowl mix together the soups, broth and evaporated milk. Stir well. Pour this mixture over the stuffing mix, making sure it gets to the bottom of the baking dish (poke around with a fork to let it saturate into the bottom layer). Bake in the preheated oven for 30.  Remove from oven and drizzle butter on top then continue baking another 15 - 20 minutes or until it starts to bubble in the center.
