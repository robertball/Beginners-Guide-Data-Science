1 1/2 pounds ripe bananas
1/2 pound ripe strawberries

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Peel and slice bananas and place on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour.
Place strawberries in a blender and pulse a few times until blended but still chunky. Pour blended strawberries into a bowl and set aside.
Combine frozen banana slices, tahini, vanilla extract, and brown sugar in a blender; blend until smooth.
Fill each ice pop mold 1/4 full with blended strawberries. Add banana-tahini mixture until molds are 3/4 full. Sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top. Insert sticks and freeze 4 hours or until frozen solid.
