8 Oz cream cheese

3 Tbsp Jello ( I use peach but you can use strawberry or whatever you want.)

Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Add egg, milk and vanilla. Mix flour,baking powder and salt together. Add to first mixture to form dough. Pat dough into a greased pizza pan. Bake at 375 for 10 mins or until slightly golden. Cool.
