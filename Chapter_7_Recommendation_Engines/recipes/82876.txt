Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey sausage
1 tablespoon butter
6 stalks chopped celery
2 onions, chopped
1 1/4 loaves SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread, cubed
1 1/2 teaspoons sage seasoning mixture
salt and pepper to taste
2 eggs
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Place the celery and onions in the saucepan, and slowly cook and stir until tender.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish coated with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine the sausage mixture and bread, and season with sage, and salt and pepper. Beat the eggs in small bowl, and mix into the sausage mixture. Stir broth into the mixture. Use more broth if needed. The stuffing should be moist, not mushy. Spoon into prepared baking dish, and cover with foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil, and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes to crisp the top.
