Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground turkey, 93%
1/2 large onion, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped
2 oz. pepperoni (about 50 slices), cut in half
1 (15 oz) can pizza sauce
1 tsp. dried oregano
10 slices mozzerella string cheese
10 - 100 calorie whole wheat tortillas

Directions:
Cook turkey in pan until it's almost done.  Toss in onion and pepper and cook for about 5 minutes or until ground turkey is no longer pink.  Add pepperoni slices, oregano and pizza sauce and simmer for a couple of minutes to warm.  Add about 1/2 cup pizza mix on tortilla.  Place 1 piece of string cheese along the middle on top and roll. Place seam side down in 9 x 13 pan.  I was able to put 9 in the pan, we just stuck the 10th one on a tortilla the next day for lunch.  Bake in oven at 350 for about 15 - 20 minutes until cheese is melted.
