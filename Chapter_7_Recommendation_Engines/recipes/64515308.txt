Ingredients:
1/4 cup melted butter
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 cup cranberries
2 cups flour
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Lightly oil or line baking sheet with parchment
Cream butter and sugar
Add eggs
In separate bowl (or not if you cheat like me) mix dry ingredients
Fold into wet
Dust hands with flour and shape onto baking sheet
Bake 25-30 min
Transfer to cutting board and cut
Lay back on baking sheet on sides
Bake 5 min on side
Flip, bake 5 more min
You can leave them in oven on low until crisp
DO NOT STORE IN AIRTIGHT CONTAINER! This will make them lose their crunch. A paper bag maybe?
