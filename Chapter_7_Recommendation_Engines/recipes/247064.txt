Ingredients:
1/4 cup almonds
12 Medjool dates, pitted
1 (11 ounce) bottle So Delicious® Dairy Free Culinary Coconut Milk
1/2 cup fresh raspberries
1/2 cup sliced fresh strawberries

Directions:
Chop almonds in a food processor and add medjool dates. Blend until smooth.
Reserve about 1/8 cup of date mixture and set aside.
Prepare two individual-sized tart pans with oil or line with parchment. Divide the date mixture among the two pans and press along the bottom and sides.
In a mixing bowl, whip the culinary Coconutmilk with a hand mixer for a minute or so before adding the reserved date mixture and about 5 berries. Stir to combine.
Spoon the coconut mixture into the tart crusts and pop in the freezer for at least 2 hours.
Remove the frozen tarts from the pans. Garnish with raspberries and sliced strawberries.
