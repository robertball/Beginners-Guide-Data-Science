Ingredients:
1 tablespoon ancho-chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon kosher salt

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and oil the steaks as in the previous recipe, coating each side with 1 teaspoon of the chili rub. Follow the instructions above for grilling steak, bearing in mind that the steaks should be placed farther from the hot center of the fire, as the ancho-chili powder has a tendency to burn. (Do not use fresh garlic or coarsely ground chilies -- they will scorch and become bitter.)
