Description: 
Don't remember the first time I had this as a kid, but after my mother made it once, it became my requested dish every birthday. Serve with shredded sweet coconut, chopped dry-roasted peanuts, pineapple tidbits, raisins, chopped bacon, chutney, chopped egg, or chopped tomato. Because this recipe calls for condiments of choice, every plate will be customized and taste a bit different by all at the table.
