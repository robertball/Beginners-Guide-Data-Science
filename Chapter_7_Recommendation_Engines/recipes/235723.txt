Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 (16 ounce) package frozen chopped broccoli, thawed
1 cup bread crumbs
1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
3  eggs
½ teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with oil.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil; add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Let broccoli cool at room temperature until cool enough to touch.
Transfer broccoli into a large mixing bowl. Add bread crumbs, Cheddar cheese, eggs, basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the broccoli; mix. Shape into nuggets or fun shapes and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated for 15 minutes, flip, and continue baking until heated through and beginning to firm, 10 to 15 minutes more.
