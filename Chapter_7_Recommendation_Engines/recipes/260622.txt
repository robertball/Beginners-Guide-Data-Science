Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2/3 cup milk
1/3 cup butter
1 large egg
2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a baking sheet.
Combine flour, Cheddar cheese, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder in a bowl.
Combine milk, 1/3 cup butter, and egg in a separate bowl. Mix into the flour mixture until chunky; be careful not to over-mix the batter.
Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Brush melted butter on top and continue baking until golden brown, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I made these with baked potato soup and loved it. Great addition! I gave them to a friend and he said they tasted just like the ones at Red Lobster®. The recipe will yield more if made into smaller biscuits. They are best served fresh out of the oven.
