Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced
1 goat horn pepper, or other hot green chile, sliced
16 slices salami
16 slices pepperoni
4 Italian-style hoagie buns, split lengthwise
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese, divided
1/4 cup garlic basil spread, divided (see footnote for recipe link)
1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Place marinara sauce in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until sandwiches are ready.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, and goat horn pepper in the hot oil until onion softens and begins to turn golden, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove onion mixture to a plate and set aside.
Place salami and pepperoni in the hot skillet and cook until crisp, about 2 minutes per side.
Spread each hoagie bun with 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese and 1 tablespoon garlic spread. Top each roll with 4 slices salami and 4 slices pepperoni. Sprinkle with onion mixture and mozzarella cheese.
Place sandwiches onto a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bread is toasted, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1/2 cup warm marinara sauce over each sandwich.
