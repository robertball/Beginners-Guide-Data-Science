Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup wheat bran
1 cup roasted, no-salt sunflower seeds
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup honey
Dash of salt

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Spray a 11x7 baking pan with cooking spray (other pan sizes will also work).
Spread oats and wheat bran on two separate shallow baking pans and toast in preheated oven until fragrant and beginning to brown.  Watch carefully, so as not to burn them (the wheat bran will be done more quickly than the oats).
Mix toasted oats, wheat bran, sunflower seeds and cranberris in a medium-sized bowl.
Put the honey and salt in a pan large enough to accomodate the oats mixture and heat it over medium-high heat until large (3/4" or larger) bubbles form across the complete surface.
Remove the honey from the heat, add the oats mixture and stir until completely combined.
Spread the mixture in the prepared pan and press down firmly with a heat-resistant spatula coated with cooking spray or other similar utensil.
Cool completely and cut into 20 bars.
Wrap each bar separately and freeze or refrigerate.
