Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) carton frozen whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), divided
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple
3 cups milk
2 (2.5 ounce) box instant vanilla pudding mix
1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries
2 bananas, sliced
chocolate syrup, or to taste
12 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, pecans, and butter in a bowl; press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.
Mix 1 1/2 cups whipped topping, cream cheese, and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; spread over cooled crust. Layer pineapple over cream cheese mixture layer.
Beat milk and pudding mixes together in a bowl until thickened and creamy; fold in bananas and spread over pineapple. Layer strawberries over pudding mixture; top with remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate until completely chilled, about 2 hours.
Drizzle chocolate syrup over whipped topping layer and arrange the cherries equally apart from each other so each piece gets 1 cherry.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created based on another dessert I once ate. It is a really fun dessert to make with your kids because there is very little actual 'cooking'.
