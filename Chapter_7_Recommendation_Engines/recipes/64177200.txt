Ingredients:
1 pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie
300 g fresh wild berries
100 g white sugar
30 g all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (or more to taste)
55 g butter, cut into small pieces
15 ml milk
2 apples
1/4 cup oatmeal

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust pastry into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan.
2. Stir wild berries, 1 apple cut in slices, sugar, flour, oatmeal and cinnamon together in a large bowl and then coat. Pour the wild berries and apple mixture into the prepared pie crust. Cut the second apple in slices and put it on top of the mixture. Dot the wild berries and apple mixture with butter pieces. Top with second pie crust cut in slices, crimping the two crusts together. Brush top crust with milk. Wrap the edges of the pie with aluminum foil to avoid burning.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until wild berries and apple filling are bubbling and crust is browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool before serving.

Description: 
This is the first I've ever made by myself. I liked the idea of apples and wild berries together and this pie reminds me of autumn with all its colors. It has a great  scent and it would be nice with a hot tea. Hope you enjoy!
