Ingredients:
1 c. flour
1/2 c. milk (2% or skim is just fine)
2 TBSP. Peanut Butter
1/4 c. Parmesan cheese (grated)
1 egg white
1 TBSP. chicken broth or stock
1 tsp. baking powder

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees and lightly spray or grease a baking sheet.
In a mixing bowl, add the first 6 ingredients and stir. Once you’ve gotten them mixed well, add the baking powder. Continue mixing until everything’s combined.
Using a tablespoon, drop spoonfuls of the mix onto your greased cookie sheet.
Pop them into the oven for 15-20 minutes or until they’re a nice golden brown.
Cool and serve!
