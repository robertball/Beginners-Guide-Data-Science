Ingredients:
9 oz semi sweet chocolate chips
9 oz white chocolate chips
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup confectioners sugar

Directions:
Stir semi-sweet and white chocolate chips together in a large bowl. In small saucepan over medium-high heat bring cream almost to a boil; pour over the chips. Whisk the cream/chocolate mixture until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Add confectioners sugar and whip with an electric mixer until icing is again smooth. Mixture will be thin. Place in refrigerator.
When cooled and thickened, about 90 mins, again beat with electric mixer until fluffy and light brown in color. Frost cake; store in fridge until ready to eat.

I've never liked the heavy texture of buttercream icing, so I came up with this as a smooth and rich alternative. It always gets rave reviews!
