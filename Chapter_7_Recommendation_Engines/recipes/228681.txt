Description: 
I was looking for a light meal for brunch and decided to toss every type of fruit I had in the house into a yogurt-based salad for lunch. It went over well with my lunch guest who is a fussy eater. My sister actually asked for seconds. The nice thing about this is you make what you need at the time and don't have to bother with leftovers. However, it does keep well for a few days as long as it is refrigerated. Serve in individual dishes with crackers.
