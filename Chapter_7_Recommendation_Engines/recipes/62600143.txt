Description: 
Really good dish; my friends love it.  I actually never measure the seasonings; so use according to your taste.  If you like it more spicy you can add some chopped up jalapenos on top of the salsa.  I also use low fat Mayo and sour Cream. This is so good I usually double it and make up my own pie crust and put into a 8x13 (?) size pan.
