Ingredients:
16 ounces linguine pasta
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
12 cherry tomatoes, halved
1 onion, diced
1/2 green pepper, diced
1 (4 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1 cucumber, diced
Dressing:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons celery seed
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; rinse with cold water and drain.
Stir linguine, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, green pepper, red peppers, onion, and cucumber together in a large bowl.
Blend sugar, vinegar, ketchup, onion powder, celery seed, Worcestershire sauce, salt, ground mustard, paprika, and garlic powder in a blender. Pour the vegetable oil in a steady stream into the blender while the mixture is blending. Mix a few seconds longer until the salad dressing is thick and creamy.
Pour dressing over pasta mixture and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
