Ingredients:
•	36 ounces sweet Italian Turkey and or Pork sausage (bulk, or links with casings removed)
•	1 medium onion, chopped to equal about 2 cups
•	1 20-ounce can pineapple tidbits in juice (divided)
•	2 28-ounce cans seasoned diced tomatoes with green chili
•	2 15-ounce can black beans, rinsed and drained
•	1 6-ounce can tomato paste
•	3 tablespoons chili powder
•	4 teaspoons ground cumin
•	2 cloves garlic, minced
•	½ cup Sriracha
•	¼ cup brown sugar
•	1 Hot Pepper (I used ghost chili, but can use Jalepeno, etc..)
•	¼ cup olive oil

Directions:
1.	In a non-stick skillet over high heat, heat up the olive oil and then add hot peppers of choice.  Fry peppers on each side until charred then remove from the oil and discard.  (purpose of this is to extract the hot oils from the pepper)
2.	In the hot oil you just prepared cook the sausage and onions, stirring to crumble sausage. Once sausage is cooked through, transfer the sausage and onions to your slow cooker juices and all.
3.	Add pineapples (juice and all), tomatoes, black beans, tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, Sriracha, and garlic to the slow cooker.
4.	Stir everything to combine.
5.	Cook on low (6-8 hours)
6.	Serve topped with cheese, sour cream and hot sauce, if desired.
