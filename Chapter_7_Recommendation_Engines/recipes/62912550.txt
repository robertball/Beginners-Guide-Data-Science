Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 large onion, sliced
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cube frozen cilantro, or 1-2 tablespoons fresh
3 tablespoons lime juice (1 lime)
2 large cloved garlic, minced
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 avocados - peeled, pitted and sliced
2 ripe tomatoes, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 10 slices and/or Pepper Jack Cheese

Directions:
Mix olive oil, cilantro, lime juice and garlic in a plastic Ziplock bag. Add chicken and marinate 6-8 hours (overnight for best results) in the fridge.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Warm skillet and add chicken and a little marinate sauce. Cook 15 minutes or until chicken is browned and just about done. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Place chicken in a casserole dish and top each breast with 1 to 2 slices of tomato and 2 to 3 slices of cheese. Place in oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until cheese melts.
While chicken is baking, carmelize the onions in some olive oil.
After 15 minutes remove chicken from the oven.  Add some carmelized onions and 2 to 3 slices of avocado (on top of each breast).  Serve immediately.
