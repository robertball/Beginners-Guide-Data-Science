Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, cut diagonally into thin slices
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons Splenda
1 clove garlic, grated
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 dash cayenne pepper
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add carrots, and continue to boil until just tender, about 2 minutes. Rinse with cold water, drain well, and set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, Splenda, and garlic. Season with cumin, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir in carrots and raisins, and toss with dressing. Cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.
