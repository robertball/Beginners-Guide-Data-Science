Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter at room temperature
2/3 cup dark brown sugar
3 1/2 tablespoons whole milk
1 egg
3/4 cup peeled and chopped Granny Smith apples
1/2 cup chopped dates
1/4 cup toasted walnut peices
3/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/3 cup of flour (all purpose)
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare an 8x8 cake pan either with non-stick cooking spray or line with parchment paper.
Cream the butter and brown sugar together.  Mix in the milk and egg.
In a seperate bowl, combine all the dry ingredients including the spices and sift to combine.  If you don't have a sifter, you can whisk these together, but make sure they are well combined and there are no lumps in your flour.
Add the dry ingredients in two or three batches to the wet ingredients and stir until just combined.  Add the apples and dates and fold in.
Fill the pan and bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Description: 
This is a recipe I made for my neice, Autumn.  Autumn is my favorite time of year and the flavors of this brownie like bar really capture the season for me.  The pecans can be omitted for those who have allergies or simply don't care for nuts.
