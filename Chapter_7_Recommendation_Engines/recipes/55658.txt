Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package washed spinach leaves
1/4 pound turkey bacon, chopped
1 cup finely chopped red onion
1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn kernels
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
4 teaspoons sugar
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
2 cups purchased fat-free croutons

Directions:
If desired, stack spinach leaves and cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Mound spinach equally onto plates.
In a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over high heat, stir turkey bacon until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Spoon equal portions of the bacon over spinach.
To pan, add onion, corn, vinegar, and sugar. Stir mixture until onion is limp, 3 to 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer onion and corn onto spinach, then spoon cooking liquid over salads.
Arrange blue cheese equally on salads and add croutons.
