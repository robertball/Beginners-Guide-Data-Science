Ingredients:
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1 (16 ounce) package asian pasta
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup light soy sauce
1/3 cup rice vinegar
1/3 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat
1/3 cup chopped green onion
2 carrots, shredded
1 cup bean sprouts
3 cups shredded cabbage
1/4 cup green onion tops, reserved

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add sesame seeds, and cook stirring frequently until lightly toasted. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain pasta, transfer to a large bowl.
In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, sesame seeds, ginger, and pepper. Shake well.
Pour half of sesame dressing over pasta, and toss to coat evenly. Gently mix in chicken, and veggies.
Refrigerate.  Before serving toss with remaining dressing and green onion tops.
