Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/3 cup honey / brown sugar
3 cups bread flour
3 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup powdered milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 tsp salt
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and 1 tbsp honey or brown sugar. Let stand.
Combine 3 cups white and 3 cups wheat flour, powdered milk and salt.
Stir 5 cups dry with warm liquid mixture.
Add remaining honey or brown sugar, warm yeast mixture and melted butter. On speed 2 mix for 2 minutes.
Add remaining flour to make dough 2 minutes.
Knead for an additional 2 minutes on speed 2. NOTE: Dough may not form a ball on hook due to oil or butter. Do not add more flour or bread will be dry.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover with a dishtowel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled.
Punch down, and divide into 2 loaves.
Place in greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.
Bake at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes; do not over bake.
Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 2 tablespoons melted butter when done to prevent crust from getting hard.
Cool completely on wire racks.
