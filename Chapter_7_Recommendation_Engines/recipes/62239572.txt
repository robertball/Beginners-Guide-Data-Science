Ingredients:
4 Poblano or Anaheim peppers, fresh is best but canned will work.
6 eggs
4oz cream cheese
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Monterrey jack cheese
8oz can of enchilada sauce

Directions:
Blister your fresh peppers in a deep fryer until 50 to 75% blistered and put into a paper bag and fold over. Let them rest for 15 minutes.
remove blistered skin and core out the top of the pepper. Remove the seeds and placenta and rinse well.
Mix the cream cheese and cheddar in a bowl and stuff the peppers. Don't worry about splitting them, they will still work.
Mix 5 egg whites with one whole egg. Whip until meringue like, the more air the better.
Pour the egg mixture on a hot griddle like a pancake, lay a stuffed pepper on one side and fold over like an omelet just browning them lightly on both sides, don't over cook.
Place chili relleno on one side of an oven proof plate and add refried beans and spanish rice to the other side, pour some enchilada sauce over the chili and sprinkle the Montery jack cheese over the chili and the beans. Place in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for about 15 mins, or until the cheese is melted. Double plate them for serving, the plates will be hot.
Serve with salsa, sour cream and guacamole.

Description: 
I developed this recipe after observing how it’s done in a variety of restaurants. A nice part of my job in Point of Sale equipment is all the kitchens I get to see. I’ll put this recipe up against any in the valley, and it’s so easy I don’t even write it down. Do it once and you’ll never forget.
