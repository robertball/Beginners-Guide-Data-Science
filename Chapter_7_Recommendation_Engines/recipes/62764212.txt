Ingredients:
Crust:
3/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted and chopped
12 whole graham crackers (1 cup crumbs)
1/4 cup sugar (or less)
6 tbsp butter, melted (85g)
Filling:
3 8oz. packages cream cheese, room temperature
1 1/4 cup sour cream
3/4 cup sugar
2 1/2 tbsp triple sec
2 1/2 tbsp tequila
2 1/2 tbsp fresh lime juice
4 eggs
Topping
3/4 cup sour cream
1 tbsp fresh lime juice
1 tbsp sugar

Directions:
Crust: Position rack in centre of oven and preheat to 350F.
In food processor, chop crackers. Add chopped nuts, sugar and butter.  Blend until crumbs stick together.
Press into prepared pan.
Bake 10 minutes.  Cool crust on rack.
Filling: Using mixer, beat cheese in large bowl until fluffy. Beat in sour cream, then sugar, triple sec, tequila and lime juice. Beat in eggs.
Pour filling into crust. Bake until outside 2 inches are set and centre moves only slightly when pan is shaken, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven; turn off oven.
Topping: Whisk sour cream, lime juice and sugar in small bowl to blend. Spread evenly over cheesecake. Return cheesecake to hot oven. Let stand 45 minutes or less (cheesecake will look very soft, but will set up when chilled.) Refrigerate cake until well chilled, up to 1 day.
Run knife around pan sides. Remove pan sides. Place cake on platter. Arrange lime half-slices and peel around top edge of cheesecake.
