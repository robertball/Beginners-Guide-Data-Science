1/2 package fresh, pre-washed spinach

3 T cream cheese
2 T butter
2 garlic cloves, minced
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in large pan over medium heat.  Stir mushrooms and garlic for about a minute.
Add spinach.  It will seem like a lot, but it shrinks down.
Once the spinach is wilted, add eggs.  Season with salt and pepper.  Let sit until the eggs start to firm and flip over.  Be careful not to let the eggs brown!
Break up cream cheese into small pieces and distibute throughout pan.  Cook until the cream cheese starts to soften.
