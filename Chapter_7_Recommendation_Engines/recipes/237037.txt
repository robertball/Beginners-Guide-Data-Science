Ingredients:
Steak:
2/3 cup milk
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups crushed saltine crackers
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
6 (5 ounce) beef cube steaks
Gravy:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup minced onion
2 3/4 cups milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Beat 2/3 cup milk and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk crackers, 3/4 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a shallow bowl.
Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Dip each steak into the milk-egg mixture; transfer to cracker mixture and press to coat evenly.
Fry coated steaks in the hot oil until browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer cooked steaks to a serving platter, retaining drippings in the skillet.
Stir 1/2 cup flour into steak drippings until dissolved and pasty, 3 to 4 minutes. Cook and stir onion into flour mixture until evenly coated, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour 2 3/4 cup milk into onion mixture; cook and stir until gravy is smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add 1/4 cup oil to gravy; cook and stir until incorporated and gravy is boiling, about 1 minute. Season gravy with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper; serve alongside steak.

Description: 
That delicious old-country taste right at home. Always a big hit. Whip up some mashed potatoes and even some peas and carrots and you've got a whole meal ready to go! Amount of left-over mixture depends on how evenly and how thoroughly you coat each steak. Tweaking and experimenting will be required to nail down a better proportion ratio so that there is less mix left over.
