Description: 
'A co-worker gave me this recipe when we were discussing quick-and-easy ways to use leftover turkey,' recalls Cherry Williams of St. Albert, Alberta. 'The mild cheesy casserole is a hit with my family. And it doesn't get much easier than this...you don't even have to cook the macaroni first!'
