Ingredients:
6 Tbls butter
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup chopped onions
1 bay leaf
1 whole clove
2 cups whole milk
2 (10 oz) bags ready to use fresh spinach

Directions:
Melt 4 tbls butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add flour and stir until light golden, about 7 minutes.  Stir in the onion, bay leaf and clove.
Gradually whisk in milk.  Whisk until the mixture boils and thickens, about 10 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and simmer 5 minutes longer, whisking frequently (sauce will be very thick).  Remove the bay leaf and clove.
Cook spinach in large pot of boiling water just until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes.  Scoop spinach out into a large bowl filled with ice water to cool.
Drain spinach onto a kitchen towel and squeeze as much liquid out as possible.
Transfer spinach to a food processor and chop finely.
Add spinach to warm sauce, simmer over low heat until spinach is heated through, stirring often, about 5 minutes.
Stir in 2 remaining tbls of butter.  Season to taste with salt & pepper.
