Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Elbows
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, chopped

1 cup heavy cream
Salt and black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded fontina cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water and cook the pasta 1/2 of the cooking time. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp of olive oil and set aside.
Meanwhile in a large skillet saute garlic in remaining olive oil for 1-2 minutes or until slightly yellow in color. Add the Barilla Tuscan Herb sauce and bring to a simmer. Add the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a 13x9 casserole combine the pasta with the sauce and fold in the Parmigiano cheese. Top with fontina and bake in a 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until bubbly and brown. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.
