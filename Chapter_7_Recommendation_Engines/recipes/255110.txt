Pour 1/2 cup of batter onto the preheated iron and bake until crisp and golden, according to manufacturer's instructions, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
A great way to change up breakfast and even make it healthier without them knowing! Getting anyone in this house to eat yogurt or milk that doesn't come from cows is sometimes a challenge. This is my way of sneaking in better options. Store leftovers in a freezer-safe bag and reheat in the oven or in a toaster. Will keep in the freezer for up to 1 month.
