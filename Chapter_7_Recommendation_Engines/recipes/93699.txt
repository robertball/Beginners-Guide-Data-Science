Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Salt and ground nutmeg
1/2 cup flour
2 tablespoons Filippo Berio Extra Light Olive Oil
6 thin slices cooked ham
6 thin slices Swiss Gruyere cheese
1 cup Marsala wine
Crusty Italian Bread

Directions:
Lay the chicken breasts, smooth side down, on a work surface. Loosen the tenderloins and open them like a book. With a scaloppine pounder or heavy skillet, flatten the breasts to 3/4-inch thickness. Season both sides with salt and a dusting of nutmeg.
Place the flour on a large sheet of waxed paper. Lay an empty sheet of waxed paper beside it. Dip the chicken in the flour to coat both sides. Shake off excess and place the chicken on the empty sheet.
Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until the foam subsides. Add the chicken in a single layer. Cook for about 4 minutes each side, or until well browned. Top each chicken breast with a slice of ham and a slice of cheese. Add the Marsala to the pan. Bring to a brisk simmer.
Cook, swirling occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until it no longer smells of alcohol. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center. With a spatula, place the chicken breasts on dinner plates. Drizzle with the wine sauce. Serve the bread on the side.
