Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, finely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 orange, juiced
1 orange, juiced and zested
3 tablespoons sour cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, and stir in the butternut squash cubes, orange juice, and orange zest. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the squash cubes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour back into the pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Whisk in sour cream until smooth, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat over medium-low heat until almost simmering, and serve hot.

Description: 
This is a recipe given to me by my mother before she passed away. As with anything involving butternut it's a little time intensive but it's well worth it! So creamy and delicious! Garnish with croutons and/or parsley, and serve with garlic bread.
