Ingredients:
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup steel cut oats
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1 tablespoon chia seeds
8 large dandelion blossoms, yellow petals only
1/8 teaspoon dried lavender flowers
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet or line with parchment paper.
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, flax, chia seeds, and dandelion petals in a bowl. Crush lavender flowers with fingers; add to flour mixture. Stir in vanilla extract and enough water to create a moist dough that holds together when squeezed. Portion dough into 6 cookies and arrange on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until cookies are dry and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Allow to cool before removing from baking sheet.
