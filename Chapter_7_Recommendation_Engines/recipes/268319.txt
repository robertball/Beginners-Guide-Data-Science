Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 onion, diced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon mustard seeds
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
1/2 cup vegetable broth
2 small potatoes, cut into small cubes
1 carrot, cut into small cubes
1/4 pound frozen peas
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg, lightly beaten
Curry Sauce:
2 cups mayonnaise
2/3 cup sour cream
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup horseradish
2 tablespoons curry powder, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion, curry powder, mustard seeds, and cumin seeds; cook for 3 minutes. Add broth and potatoes; cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrot and peas, cook 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and allow filling to cool.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Roll puff pastry out on a work surface and cut into 16 thin rounds. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling on each round. Cover edges of pastry with beaten egg and press edges together using a fork to close. Place samosas on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
While samosas are baking, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, sugar, lemon juice, horseradish, curry powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate sauce until needed. Serve with samosas.

Description: 
These samosas have a unique twist, they have curry and a dip. You can add chicken or ground beef and make it a meal. Good to double and triple for leftovers, and with these you don't know how many everyone will want, they are really good. At the age of 12, I alone ate 10 small ones. I was so full!
