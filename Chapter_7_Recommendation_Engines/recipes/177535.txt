Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, cut in half
1 pound bulk pork sausage
3 cups Prego® Roasted Garlic & Herb Italian Sauce
1 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup heavy cream
16 ounces uncooked frozen cheese tortellini
1 (10 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Five Cheese Garlic Bread
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F for the bread.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook until it's golden brown.  Remove the garlic from the skillet and reserve.  Add the sausage and cook until it's well browned, stirring often.
Stir the sauce in the skillet and heat to a boil.  Stir in the garlic, peas and cream.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook and stir for 5 minutes or until the mixture is hot and bubbling.
Cook the tortellini according to the package directions.  Drain the tortellini well in a colander.
Meanwhile, bake the bread according to the package directions.
Stir the tortellini in the skillet. Sprinkle with the cheese.  Cut the bread into 2-inch diagonal slices.  Serve the bread with the tortellini.
