Ingredients:
all-purpose flour for coating
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, pierced with a fork or quartered
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon oregano, or fresh parsley/basil
1/2 cup red wine
Optional
carrots
potatoes
2 cups fresh mushrooms
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the flour, salt and pepper in a plastic bag. Dredge chicken pieces in egg, then coat with flour mixture. Heat the oil in a large skillet (one that has a cover/lid). Fry the chicken pieces until they are browned on both sides. Remove from skillet.
Add the onion, garlic and bell pepper to the skillet and saute until the onion is slightly browned. Return the chicken to the skillet and add the tomatoes, oregano and wine. Cover and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes over medium low heat. If adding carrots and potatoes, precook and add halfway through cook time.
Add the mushrooms and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 10 more minutes.

Description: 
Many food names reflect various occupations or trades. 'Cacciatore' literally means 'hunter' in Italian, and this 'hunter style' dish makes good use of mushrooms (easily available to hunters trekking through forests!), onions tomatoes and herbs.  If desired, serve over hot spaghetti noodles.Modified from: Mom's Chicken Cacciatore
