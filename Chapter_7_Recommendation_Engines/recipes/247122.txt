Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups dried Great Northern beans
2 red bell peppers, seeded and sliced
1 1/2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
Dressing:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley

Place Great Northern beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain.
Place beans in a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender, about 45 minutes. Drain and run beans under cold water to cool.
Combine red bell peppers and asparagus in a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, parsley, shallot, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Combine beans, red bell pepper, and asparagus in a bowl; pour 2/3 of the dressing over mixture and toss gently. Add more dressing if desired.
