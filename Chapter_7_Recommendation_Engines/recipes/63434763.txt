https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/930969.jpg
Ingredients:
3 boxes of cream cheese (full fat is of course the best but not mandatory)
1 bunch of green onions, greens finely chopped
1 small can finely chopped black olives
1 small can mushrooms, finely chopped (I stopped buying canned because of all the scary info on canned mushrooms and now buy fresh and chop and sauté them myself but let them cool before adding!)
1 jar dried beef, finely chopped
¼ tsp Accent

Directions:
Put all the ingredients into a big bowl and start squishing! Wear gloves when possible.
Then you can place your big nasty mess into a pretty serving dish.
Serve after it has been allowed to chill in fridge at least 3 hours, overnight is best for the flavors to come together.
Put on Ritz cracker or whatever tickles your fancy
