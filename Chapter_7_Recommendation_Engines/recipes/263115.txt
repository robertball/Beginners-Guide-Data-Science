Ingredients:
The Burgers:
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1 tablespoon finely chopped chives
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon smoked salt
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package ground beef
The Extras:
2 hamburger buns, split
2 leaves lettuce
1 large tomato, thinly sliced
2 slices Monterey Jack cheese
2 teaspoons ketchup, or to taste
2 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste

Directions:
Pour water to the fill line of a sous vide cooker (such as SousVide Supreme(R)) to make the water bath. Preheat to 134 degrees F (57 degrees C).
Mix garlic, chives, paprika, salt, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper thoroughly into the ground beef. Form mixture into 2 patties and press into 2 chef's rings. Place into a food-grade cooking pouch and vacuum-seal.
Submerge the pouch in the water bath and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and oil the grate thoroughly.
Remove patties from the pouch and chef's rings. Pat dry with paper towels.
Grill patties until surfaces are lightly charred with grill marks, 30 to 45 seconds per side.
Place patties on burger buns and top with lettuce, tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, ketchup, and mayonnaise.

Description: 
The great thing about cooking burgers sous vide is that you don't have to worry about overcooking or undercooking. You get moist, juicy, flavorful burgers every time. To get that nice grilled exterior, you can just sear them on the grill at the very end. Serve with sous vide onions confit. Recipe courtesy of Vicky McDonald.
