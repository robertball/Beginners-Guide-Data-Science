Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
20 slices pepperoni sausage
8 ounces pepperoni sausage, chopped
4 slices mozzarella cheese
1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 pinch garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pound chicken breasts flat with a meat mallet. Season to taste with garlic powder, salt, pepper and Italian style seasoning.
Place 4 to 5 slices pepperoni on each breast and top each with a slice of cheese. Roll up breasts and fasten with toothpicks.
Fry the pepperoni in a medium skillet until it has released most of its oil. Remove pepperoni from skillet and set aside. Brown chicken rolls in pepperoni oil about 5 to 10 minutes each side. Place chicken in a baking dish. Combine spaghetti sauce and sliced pepperoni and pour over chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
I looked for a chicken pepperoni recipe for years, and when I finally found one I didn't really much care for it - so I made up my own. It got rave reviews from my hubby and kids! Serve over your favorite pasta.
