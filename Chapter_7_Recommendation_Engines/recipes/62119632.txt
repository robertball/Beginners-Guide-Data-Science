Ingredients:
1 c. white corn syrup
1 c. white granulated sugar
1 1/2 c. peanut butter (I prefer chunky, but smooth is delicious as well)
5 c. Special K cereal
1 c. semisweet chocolate chips
1 c. butterscotch chips

Directions:
Bring the first two ingredients to a boil, stirring so that the sugar doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Add the peanut butter. Combine the peanut butter mixture with the cereal and press into a buttered pan. Melt the semisweet chocolate and butterscotch chips together, mixing well until smooth. Spread over the top of the bars.
