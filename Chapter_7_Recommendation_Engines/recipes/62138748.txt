Ingredients:
For Squash:
1 Spaghetti squash, halved
2 Tbsp butter or butter alternative
1/2 tsp ground sea salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp sweet basil
For Sauce:
1 Tbsp sweet basil
1 tsp marjoram
6 oz shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
4 oz low-fat evaporated milk
4 oz fat-free cream cheese
1 Tbsp Brie or Brie spread
1/2 cup skim milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Fill a baking sheet with about 1/4" of water, add a pinch of salt to the water.
Scoop out the seeds of the spaghetti squash and put half of salt, pepper, butter, and basil in each half.
Once the oven is preheated, place the squash halves cut-side down on the baking sheet and cook for about 40 minutes.
In a sauce pan, combine evaporated milk, spices, and cream cheese. Heat on low until cream cheese is melted.
Add cheddar cheese, Brie, Romano and skim milk. Stir constantly until cheeses are blended. If too thick, add more skim milk until desired consistency is met.
When squash is done, remove "spaghetti" strands from the shell by scraping with a fork. Stir squash into Alfredo sauce and serve!
