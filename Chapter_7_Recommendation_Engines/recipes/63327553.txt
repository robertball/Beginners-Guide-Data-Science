Ingredients:
1-2 lbs frozen chicken of your choice.
salt

bay leaves
Dumplings -
2 cups flour
1/2 Tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
buttermilk

Directions:
Boil chicken in large pot with 4 cups of water. when cooked, remove chicken and skim the broth to remove fat on top.  Add salt, pepper and bay leaves to flavor.
Pull chicken apart and set aside.
Dumplings:
Mix first four ingredients together in a large bowl adding enough buttermilk to make a stiff dough. Place dough ball on floured surface and knead 6 to 8 times (too much kneading makes them tough)  Roll out thin; cut into 2" squares. Drop them in hot chicken broth and cook about 2 hours on very, very low heat.  Add cooked chicken when dumplins are almost done, just long enough to heat chicken thoroughly.
