Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh or frozen rhubarb, thawed
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup frozen sliced sweetened strawberries, thawed
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 tablespoon milk
3 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place 1 cup of sugar into a saucepan, and mix in the rhubarb; add butter, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the rhubarb is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the strawberries, and set aside. Let cool to lukewarm. Beat the eggs in a bowl until frothy, and mix into the rhubarb mixture.
Unroll the pie crusts, and line an 8-inch pie dish with a crust; pour the filling into the bottom crust. Place the second crust on top of the pie, and press the edges together. Crimp edge with a fork to seal. Cut 4 1-inch slits in the top of the crust with a sharp knife. Pour milk into a small bowl, and brush top crust with milk; sprinkle pie with 3 more tablespoons of sugar.
Bake the pie in the preheated oven until the crust is golden and the filling is set, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow pie to cool before cutting. Refrigerate leftovers.
