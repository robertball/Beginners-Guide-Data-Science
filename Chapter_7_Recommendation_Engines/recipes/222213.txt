Ingredients:
2 cups elbow macaroni
2 ripe tomatoes, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 cucumber, chopped
1 green onion, chopped
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water until macaroni is cooled.
Place macaroni into a large salad bowl and stir in tomatoes, green bell pepper, cucumber, and green onion.
Whisk sugar, vegetable oil, ketchup, vinegar, salt, paprika, and black pepper, stirring in a bowl until sugar has dissolved. Pour dressing over macaroni and vegetables and toss to coat.

Description: 
Quick and easy. Tastes best when it sits for a while before serving. I change up the veggies every time I make it, with whatever I have on hand. Carrots and celery work well.
