Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 large ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles, drained
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
garlic salt to taste
black pepper to taste
1 large ripe avocado, peeled and pitted

Directions:
In a bowl, beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add two avocados, green chiles, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and pepper; beat until fairly smooth.
Gently mix in remaining avocado, leaving it a little chunky. Serve immediately or store in refrigerator covered with plastic wrap, pushing the wrap down so that it is touching the entire surface of the guacamole.

Description: 
This old family guacamole recipe is perfect with corn chips.  For family holidays, parties, barbecues and get togethers, we always have this made. It's great this way - but you can also add onions or tomatoes or whatever you like.
