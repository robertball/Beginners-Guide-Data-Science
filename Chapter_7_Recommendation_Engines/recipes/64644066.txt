Ingredients:
600 grams ube (purple yams)
1 tsp Sriracha salt
2 tsp olive oil
1/3 cup sour cream
2 tsp Sriracha (or more to taste)

Directions:
Wash and peel the yams. Cut them with a French fry cutter or a knife. (If using a knife, try to keep the size of the fries to a uniform size, between 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch.)
Preheat airfryer to 160°C.
Put the cut yams in a bowl. (Do not rinse or soak with water beforehand.) Sprinkle the Sriracha salt over the yams and drizzle the oil over them. Toss to coat evenly.
Put the yams in the basket of the airfryer. Cook the yams for 16 minutes.
Shake the basket. Turn up the heat to 200°C and cook for another 5 minutes.
While the yams are cooking, mix together the sour cream and Sriracha sauce.
Serve the fries with the sauce on the side.

Description: 
Purple yams are tossed in Sriracha salt and olive oil then airfried until crispy. A simple combination of cool sour cream and Sriracha complements the sweet yam. The procedure for cooking yams in an airfryer is different than cooking potatoes.
