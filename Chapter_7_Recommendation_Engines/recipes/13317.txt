In a food processor or blender, puree soup until smooth.  Add cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, all spice, cloves and nutmeg.  Transfer to a stock pot and return to heat.  When soup is just beginning to boil, stir in onion soup mix.  Simmer until thickened and then just before serving season to taste with lemon juice and salt.
