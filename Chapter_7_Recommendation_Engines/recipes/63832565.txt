Ingredients:
6 Tbsp grass-fed butter
2 Cups honey
3 Tbsp yogurt
Sea Salt

Directions:
In a saucepan melt butter on medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring very frequently. When the bottom of the pan starts to show brown butter (it's very distinctive, in little bits) immediately take the pan off the heat. Then add the honey and place back on heat for about 5 more minutes. Then add the yogurt. Stir well and constantly for 10 minutes. If it starts to get very dark brown or starts to smell burnt immediately take off heat and pour into glass dish. Let cool. Sprinkle lots of sea salt all over. Cut into desired shapes & eat.
