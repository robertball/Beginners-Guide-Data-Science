Ingredients:
1/2 cup bread crumbs, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pork chops
olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix bread crumbs, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, and black pepper in a large bowl; rub onto pork chops to coat completely.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated pork chops in hot oil until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, flip, and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
