Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) bags fresh spinach
1 (12 ounce) can corned beef, broken into pieces
2 (10 ounce) cans coconut milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Make a layer of spinach leaves in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with some of the corned beef, then keep repeating layers of spinach and corned beef until you run out of spinach. Don't worry about how full the dish is because the spinach will shrink as it cooks. Pour both cans of coconut milk over the dish, pressing the leaves down with a spoon. Cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until spinach has completely wilted and the sauce is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Palusami is a main dish from Samoa made with coconut milk. In the islands of Samoa, we use taro leaves and the Samoan corn-beef but here in America, my family can not live with out it so we use other substitute you can buy at the grocery store.
