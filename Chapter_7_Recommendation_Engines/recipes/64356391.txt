Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups spelt flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups water

Directions:
Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and pour in the water.  Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy. If you have time, mix all but the baking powder and let sit for 1/2 hour or so then add baking powder and cook.
Heat a non-stick griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
