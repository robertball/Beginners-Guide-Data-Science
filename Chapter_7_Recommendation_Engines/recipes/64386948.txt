Ingredients:
3/4 cup panko
2 t canola oil or butter
2 t taco seasoning
1 egg
1/2 cup cream cheese
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeds and ribs removed, minced
4 chicken breasts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 and place a cooling rack on a baking dish; spray with cooking spray.
In a small skillet over medium heat, combine the panko with the canola oil.  Cook, stirring often, until the panko is golden and crispy, about 5-6 minutes.  Place in a shallow dish.  Add the taco seasoning and stir to combine.
In another dish, lightly beat the egg.
In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and jalapenos.
Cut a slit in each chicken breast, almost all the way through.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and then divide the cream cheese evenly between each breast's pocket,  Use a toothpick to secure if necessary.
Dip the chicken pieces into the egg, then into the panko mixture, coating the chicken completely.
Place the chicken on the prepared pan and cook for 25-35 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
