Ingredients:
1 cup precooked shredded potatoes
1 shallot, chopped
1 teaspoon honey mustard
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 teaspoons mayonnaise
4 tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Combine shredded potatoes, shallot, honey mustard, red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Spread each portion of fish with 1 teaspoons mayonnaise and top with 1/4 the potato mixture, pressing onto the fish.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place fish in the skillet, potato-side down and cook until crispy and browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn fish over gently, reduce heat to medium, and continue cooking until fish flakes easily using a fork, 4 to 5 minutes more.
Serve fish with lemon wedges.
