Ingredients:
1/4 c lightly packed chopped cilantro leaves
1 pkg (8oz) cream cheese
2 c shredded monterey jack cheese, divided
1 medium onion (2/3 c chopped)
1 can (28 oz) enchilada sauce
18 corn tortillas
3 c diced or shredded cooked chicken
1 small can sliced olives
Cilantro leaves for garnish

Directions:
Place cream cheese in bowl and warm until soft.  Add cilantro and 1 1/2 cup shredded cheese.
Chop onion and set aside. Pour 2/3 cup enchilada sauce in bottom of 9x13 pan.  Pour remaining sauce in a stainless steel mixing bowl and set aside.
To assemble lasagna, dip 6 tortillas into enchilada sauce in bowl and arrange in a layer over sauce in bottom of 9x13 pan, overlapping if necessary.  Scoop half of cream cheese mixture over tortillas and spread.  Top with 1 cup of chicken and 1/3 of onion.  Repeat layers one time.  Dip remaining 6 tortillas into sauce and arrange over second layer. Top with remaining chicken and onion.  Pour remaining enchilada sauce over lasagna and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese.  Top with olives.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or cover and freeze.  Defrost before baking.

Description: 
This dish is amazing, and always a huge hit for our big family!  I find it easier than rolling up enchiladas, and quick to prepare if you have chicken on hand.  I like to use the leftover chicken from my crockpot chicken tacos or a rotisserie chicken.
