Ingredients:
3 1/2 lbs Alaska snow crab cluster, thawed if necessary
8 oz dry fettuccine
3 TBL melted butter
1/2 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1/4cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup cooked peas
1 cup diced tomatoes
2 TBL lemon juice
2 tsp dried basil
1 clove garlic, pressed

Directions:
Reserve four Alaska crab clusters to garnish plates. Remove crabmeat from remaining crab clusters. Cook pasta according to package directions. While pasta is cooking, place crabmeat on microwave-safe plate. Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on high power for two minutes, until hot. Drain pasta and toss with butter, ricotta and Parmesan. Toss with crabmeat and remaining ingredients except snow crab clusters. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Steam remaining crab clusters 4 to 5 minutes and serve alongside pasta.
