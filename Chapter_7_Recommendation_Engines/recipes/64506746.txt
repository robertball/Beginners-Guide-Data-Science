Ingredients:
2 ancho
2 cascabel
2 mulato
2 guajillo
6 piquin or 6 cayenne
3 chipotle
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp sweet paprika
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp lemon grass
1/4 tsp fennel seeds
1/4 tsp Ceylon cinnamon
1/4 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
In a well-ventilated area, blend all together until pulverised. Doing this in pulses helps maintain a powder form. Be aware of the dust that will kick up, protect your eyes and mouth as not to burn them.
Sub Mexican Oregano for the oregano, lemon grass, and fennel.
Use cayenne or piquino. With cayenne it tastes more like the ready made versions in the store, not necessarily a bad thing, just different.
