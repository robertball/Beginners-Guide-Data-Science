Potato Bacon & Corn Chowder! Recipe

Ingredients:
12 strips of bacon cut into 1" pieces
6 average sized potatoes cut into 1" pieces
1 large onion diced
2 cups milk
1 cup sour cream
1 10oz can cream of chicken soup
1 cup frozen corn (canned corn is suitable as well)
1 tsp tyme
salt/pepper to taste

Directions:
fry bacon until crisp (if you under cook it, it will be too soft and appear "raw" in the final soup)
Pour bacon grease into a large heavy pot and add potatoes and onions.  Cook until potatoes are a crisp tender.  (You don't want them to be so soft they turn to mush in the final soup)
When you are happy with the consistancy of the potatoes, add the cooked bacon and remainder of the ingredients.  Stir over a medium heat until all ingredients melt together to form a smooth consistancy.  Let it simmer for 15 minutes to allow flavours to mingle.  You can add a little more milk at this point if you would prefer your soup to be a little thinner.
This recipe serves approximately 4 adults.  It can be doubled very easily. Serve in bowls or mugs with fresh bread.
*please note:  I have used cream of mushroom soup in a pinch, and although it is still okay, it is quite different from the taste of the cream of chicken soup.

Description: 
I challenge you to find someone who does not like this soup!  We think this soup is one of a kind and has been enjoyed by everyone we have ever served it to. We use it as a pot luck item when we attend outdoor functions since it is so thick it can be spooned into a coffee cup to warm us up and is extremely filling!
