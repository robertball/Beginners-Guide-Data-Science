Ingredients:
3/4 pound ground beef
1/4 pound ground pork
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon Pimenton de la Vera (smoked Spanish paprika)
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix the ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, milk, egg, onion, ketchup, salt, Pimenton de la Vera, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper together in a large bowl until well combined; divide the mixture into 12 equal ball shapes. Place in refrigerator for 3 hours to allow the flavors to meld.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the meatballs in the skillet, flattening them with the back of a spatula as they cook, about 7 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).
