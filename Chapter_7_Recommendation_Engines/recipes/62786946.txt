Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon or 2 cloves of garlic, finely minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
optional:  seasoning of your choice (for example, fresh dried sage from your herb garden will add great flavor)

Directions:
Place cauliflower in a steamer basket; place in a saucepan over 1 in. of water. Bring to a boil; cover and steam for 8-10 minutes or just until fork tender.  Do not over cook or cauliflower will turn mushy and mashed cauliflower will be runny or too thin.
Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor. Add the garlic, butter, salt and pepper and any additional seasoning of your choice.   NOTE:  Do not add any milk or other liquids as the cauliflower will absorb water during the steaming process.
Cover and process until blended. Transfer to a bowl. Serve immediately.  Let leftovers cool completely, then cover and refrigerate. You can reheat leftovers in microwave.

Description: 
This is my go-to substitute for mashed potatoes.  I am not generally a fan of cauliflower, but do enjoy it prepared this way.   Added benefit - it is low calorie and low fat, but delicious and filling.Modified from: Whipped Cauliflower
