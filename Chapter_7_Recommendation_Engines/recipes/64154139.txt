Ingredients:
4 pounds firm, ripe peaches
1 2/3 cups light brown sugar
1 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons minced fresh peeled ginger
1 small red onion, slivered
12 cardamom pods, lightly cracked
2 to 4 dried hot red chiles, such as cayenneÂ—stemmed, seeded and thinly sliced
Salt

Directions:
Peel the peaches, then halve them and remove the pits. Cut the peaches into 3/4-inch dice.
In large pan, combine the brown sugar with the vinegar, ginger, onion and cardamom; stir to dissolve the sugar. Simmer over moderately low heat until the onion is slightly softened, about 8 minutes. Add the peaches, chiles and a pinch of salt and simmer over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the peaches are very soft and translucent, about 1 hour.
Ladle the chutney into five 1/2-pint canning jars, tapping lightly on a flat surface to release any air bubbles. Seal the jars and refrigerate for up to 6 months.
