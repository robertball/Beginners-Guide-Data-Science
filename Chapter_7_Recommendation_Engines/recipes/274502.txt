Ingredients:
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lime, zested
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
4 medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Whisk lime juice, olive oil, garlic, lime zest, salt, brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and cumin together in a small bowl. Place chicken in a large plastic bag or a bowl and add lime marinade. Seal the bag or cover the bowl and place in a refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes to 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place chicken breasts on the preheated grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and skin is golden and lightly charred, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Slice and garnish with cilantro.
