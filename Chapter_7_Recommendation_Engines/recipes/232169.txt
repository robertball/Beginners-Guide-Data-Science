Ingredients:
1 cup plain yogurt
1  red onion, finely chopped
1  lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
3 cloves garlic, crushed
¾ teaspoon garam masala
¾ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine yogurt, red onion, lemon juice, ginger, garlic, garam masala, cumin, cayenne, and turmeric in a bowl. Place chicken breasts into yogurt mixture and flip to coat; cover bowl with plastic and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray.
Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and thread onto skewers. Discard used marinade. Lay skewered chicken into baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is browned with a few blackened spots and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). [See Note for grilling instructions.]
