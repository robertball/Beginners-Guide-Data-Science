Carve or cut with cookie cutter the pear into a shark

Description: 
I hand carved the shark from a pear, but a fish shaped cookie cutter would work as well on a slice of pear or apple.  The green gelatin helps hide some of the imperfections.  The seaweed is dill. Sure to please the most critical Pirate or Sea Captain in your house!
