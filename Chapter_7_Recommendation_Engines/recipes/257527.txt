Ingredients:
3/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup orange juice
1 1/2 cups rice flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 teaspoons dry egg replacer (such as Ener-GÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix raisins and orange juice together in a small bowl.
Combine rice flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, allspice, and xanthan gum in a large bowl.
Mix carrots, oil, water, and dry egg replacer together in a separate bowl. Fold in raisin mixture.
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in carrot mixture. Mix until batter is moistened. Spoon batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
