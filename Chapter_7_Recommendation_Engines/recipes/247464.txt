Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, divided
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup diced white onion
8 ounces portobello mushrooms, stemmed and sliced
8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, sliced
8 ounces oyster mushrooms, sliced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon
3 (16 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 large baking potato, peeled and diced into small cubes
2 tablespoons fresh thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat until butter melts, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add onion; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup butter, portobello mushrooms, baby bella mushrooms, and oyster mushrooms, and tarragon; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir chicken broth, potato, thyme, and oregano into the pot. Bring to a boil; let soup simmer until potato is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove soup from heat and puree with an immersion blender until smooth.
Return soup to heat and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Had this cream of mushroom soup at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island during a wedding; came home the next day and recreated it to the best of my abilities. After tasting it and then adding the cream, I decided in the future to just remove the cream altogether! It is a fantastic soup that works well on cold winter days.
