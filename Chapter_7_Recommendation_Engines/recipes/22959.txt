Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
9 tablespoons white sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups biscuit baking mix
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
2/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.
In a separate bowl, stir together baking mix and cornmeal. Blend this mixture into the butter/egg mixture, alternately with the milk; stir just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden.
