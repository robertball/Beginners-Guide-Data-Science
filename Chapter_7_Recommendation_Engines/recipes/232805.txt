Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
2 large apples - peeled, cored, and diced
vegetable oil, or as needed, divided
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Combine milk, flour, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in apples.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls into the pan and cook until the edges are dry and the bottom is browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
Dust pancakes with confections' sugar.
