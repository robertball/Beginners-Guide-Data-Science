Ingredients:
1 lb ribeye steak, sliced thin
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
flour
olive oil
pizza dough
1/4 lb sliced deli provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Season ribeye with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the beef and cook until brown, shredding the beef with tongs or a spatula as you go. Once cooked, remove from the heat and allow to cool before making the Stromboli.
On a clean, dry work surface sprinkled with flour, roll out the pizza dough. Once the dough is rolled out, lightly oil it and season with salt and pepper. Layer the sliced cheese, leaving a 2-inch border on all sides and top with the cooked beef. Roll jelly roll style and place on a sheet pan. Bake until brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut and serve.
