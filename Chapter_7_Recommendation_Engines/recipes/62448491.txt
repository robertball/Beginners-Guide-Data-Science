Ingredients:
3 Granny Smith, Jonathan, or Jonagold apples
1/2 cup apple cider, divided
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
2 cups yellow squash, diced
1 tbsp butter or margarine

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Slice the apples in half, and core them.  Use a spoon to scoop out some of the flesh to make a "bowl" shape.  Reserve the apple pieces.
Place the apple bowls in an oven-safe dish.  Mix 1/4 cup cider with the brown sugar and cinnamon; pour over the apples.  Place in the oven and bake, covered, for 30 minutes.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the reserved apple pieces and squash and saut√© over medium heat until soft, adding the remaining cider as you cook.
Process the squash mixture in a food processor or blender until it reaches the consistency of apple sauce.
Spoon the finished squash mixture into the apple bowls.  Using a turkey baster, drizzle the apples with any juice in the baking dish.  Sprinkle with additional cinnamon and/or brown sugar if desired.  Serve hot.
