Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup butter, softened
6 tablespoons brown sugar
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 large egg, beaten
1 fresh lime
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
2 cups finely shredded coconut, divided, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray 2 cookie sheets.
Combine butter, sugars, and egg in a bowl using a wooden spoon, not an electric mixer. Grate lime zest into the mixture. Stir in 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon lime juice.
Combine flour, white chocolate chips, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix in butter mixture until a stiff dough forms. Fold in 1 cup coconut.
Place remaining coconut on a flat dish. Roll dough into ping pong ball-sized balls; roll in coconut. Arrange dough on the prepared cookie sheets; do not press down.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes.
