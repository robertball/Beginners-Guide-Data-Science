Ingredients:
4 inch long slice of French bread (sliced horizontally, in two halves)
3/4 cup shredded lettuce (romaine is my favourite)
1 egg
1/4 cup marble cheese
1/2 cup bacon
1/3 cup mayonaisse
1/2 clove garlic (crushed)
Grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Toast french bread, keep warm. Mix mayonaisse garlic and parmesan and set aside. In a seperate  bowl,  prepare lettuce, cheese and bacon.
Fill a saucepan with warm water. Place egg in and boil water. DO NOT BOIL BEFORE PUTTING EGG IN. Once it begons boiling, wait for 45 sec and turn off. Run egg under cold water and take shell off egg.
Generously spread mayonaisse sauce onto each half. Put lettuce and egg onto one half, and place the bacon and cheese on the other. Put the sandwich on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high for 30 sec.
Put two halves together and let cool. Enjoy!
