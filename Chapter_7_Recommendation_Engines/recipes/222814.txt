Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil, or as needed
1 (10 ounce) package egg roll wrappers

Directions:
Heat a wok over medium heat until very hot and pour vegetable oil into hot wok. Let oil heat until the surface shimmers. To test heat, lower the tip of a wooden chop stick into the oil; if it bubbles vigorously, oil is heated enough.
Cut egg roll wrappers into 1-inch strips and gently lay strips into the hot oil, 2 or 3 at a time. When strips start to brown on one side, gently flip over and brown the other side until the strips are crisp and golden brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, working in batches. Remove crisp noodles with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.

Description: 
These light and airy strips add a great garnish to soups or when cut wider, can be a great alternative to regular chips at a Chinese-themed dinner. I love to use them in my chicken corn egg-drop soup! You can vary the amount by cutting only the amount of strips needed for the number of guests. Serve with duck sauce and Chinese mustard sauce for dipping.
