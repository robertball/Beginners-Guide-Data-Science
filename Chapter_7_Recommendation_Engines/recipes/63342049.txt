Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
1-1/4 cups (300ml) skim milk
1-1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
5 large pinches of brown sugar
Optional:
1/2 packet of protein powder or meal replacement shake powder (vanilla or banana flavors work well)
1/8 cup skim milk (extra liquid needed if powder is used)

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of pot when stirring.
Reduce to low/medium heat and simmer for approximately 8 minutes, stirring constantly.  Keep stirring until oatmeal is thickened, but still slightly less thick than you would ultimately like when serving.  Pour into a bowl - oatmeal will continue to thicken as it cools.
