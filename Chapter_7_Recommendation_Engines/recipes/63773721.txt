Ingredients:
2 cups evaporated cane juice (sugar)
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (no pulp or zest - it will burn)
2 tablespoons water
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 tsp salt (more (up to 1/2) if you wanted salted caramel)

Directions:
Wash & thoroughly dry applies to remove wax and dirt. Stick a stick into the center of each apple and rest it on a cookie sheet that is lined with a slipat. Bring apples to room temp. (I've read apples at room temp help the caramel stick).
In a large (3.5 qt) heavy bottomed pot, stir the water and lemon juice together then add sugar. Shake the pot to evenly distribute sugar. Turn on the heat to med-high and set timer for 5 minutes. DO NOT STIR. Let it bubble. After 5 (or 7) min. the caramel should be a medium to dark amber color and should be about 315 degrees.
Remove from heat and slowly stir in cream & butter (it will spatter & steam). Stir until smooth.
Return to med-high heat and cook WITHOUT STIRRING until thermometer reaches 245-250. Watch closely it burns fast!
Once at 250, immediately remove from heat and float pot in an ice water bath to stop cooking. Add in vanilla and salt (if using) until combined.
When caramel has cooled to the point that it coats the back of the spoon (~100 degrees)then dip your apples.
Allow the caramel to set on the apples in the fridge then top apples with ganache or course salt if you salted the caramel.
Uneaten apples can be stored in the fridge.
