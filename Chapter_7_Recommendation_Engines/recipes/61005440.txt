Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon cajun seasoning
Juice from one large lemon or 1 1/2 tablespoons
2 pounds fresh or frozen and thawed shrimp, peeled and deveined
skewers

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the garlic, olive oil, cajun seasoning and lemon juice.  Add shrimp to the bowl, and stir until evenly coated. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, stirring once or twice.
Preheat grill for medium heat. Thread shrimp onto skewers, piercing once near the tail and once near the head. Remove any pieces of minced garlic stuck to the shrimp to prevent bitter burnt pieces of garlic on your shrimp. Discard marinade.
Lightly oil grill grate. Cook shrimp on preheated grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until opaque.  You can also cook these shrimp on the stove top in a lightly oiled saute pan.

Description: 
These shrimp may have a little spicy kick to them but they are simple and delicious serve on there own or tossed onto a salad or made into shrimp tacos.  I left out the tomato sauce, red wine vinegar, and basil from the original recipe to keep the flavors a little less complicated as well as keeping the overall cost of the recipe down.Modified from: Marinated Grilled Shrimp
