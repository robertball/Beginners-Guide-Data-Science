Ingredients:
3 tablespoons clarified butter, divided
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1/2 inch pieces
3 tablespoons garam masala

Directions:
Melt clarified butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Sprinkle one side of chicken pieces with garam masala and place seasoned side down in hot butter. Sprinkle top of chicken pieces with more garam masala and saute for 5 minutes.
Turn chicken pieces, adding more butter as needed, and saute for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.

Description: 
We love chicken shwarma, and have been trying to duplicate it ever since our area's Middle Eastern restaurant closed. The closest we have been able to come is by using garam masala, a spice mixture you can find in some specialty grocery stores.
