Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 egg
3 tablespoons Italian bread crumbs
1 onion, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
8 ounces fresh mushrooms
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper using your hands. Shape into 6 patties about 1 inch thick.
Fry the patties in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until browned. Drain off grease, and remove patties to a platter; keep warm.
Melt the butter in the same skillet, and add the onions and mushrooms. Cook and stir until tender. Sprinkle the flour over, and mix in until blended. Stir in the milk, broth and Worcestershire sauce. Cook and stir over medium heat until smooth and starting to thicken. Return the patties to the gravy and cook over low heat, uncovered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
