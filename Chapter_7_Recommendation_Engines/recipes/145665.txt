Pineapple-Rhubarb Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
1 1/3 cups white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 cups chopped rhubarb
1 cup drained crushed pineapple
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. Refrigerate the other crust until needed.
In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, orange zest and salt. Combine the rhubarb and pineapple; stir into the dry ingredients until evenly blended. Pour into the prepared pie crust. Place the remaining crust on top and crimp the edges to seal in the filling. Cut a few holes in the top pastry to vent steam.
Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and rhubarb is tender when pierced with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
This pie has a wonderful flavor and is unlike those on the site, it does not contain tapioca. It is an old recipe and is easily made. Using young rhubarb makes this recipe unbeatable in taste and texture. I am frequently asked for this recipe.
