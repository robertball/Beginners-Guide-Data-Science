1/4 cup olive oil
1 pinch Greek seasoning, or to taste
1/3 cup crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Trim a little skin off each zucchini piece so it will lay flat on the grill. Brush olive oil on top and sprinkle with Greek seasoning. Top with feta cheese. Grill to preferred level of doneness, about 10 minutes.
