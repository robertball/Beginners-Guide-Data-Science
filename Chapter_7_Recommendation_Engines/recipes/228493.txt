Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 white onion, chopped
1/2 cup diced carrot
1/2 cup diced celery
4 large cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
6 cups water
3 tablespoons chicken soup base
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 cup peeled and cubed potatoes
1/2 cup fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped (optional)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 bunch kale, stemmed and chopped

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, and celery until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, parsley, thyme, rosemary, and dill weed; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour water into onion mixture and bring to a boil. Stir chicken base into the boiling water until dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with green chiles, potatoes, and green beans; bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Add browned mushrooms to the soup. Stir heavy cream and kale into soup; cook until kale is tender and soup is heated through, about 5 minutes.
