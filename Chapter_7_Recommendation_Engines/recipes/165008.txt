Ingredients:
4 Mission® Low Carb Soft Taco Size Flour Tortillas
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
1 pound tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 cups mixed greens
Chipotle Cream Sauce
2 canned chipotle chiles in adobo (minced and seeded)
1 cup non-fat sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix the Chipotle Cream Sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
In a skillet set at medium-high heat, add the seven ingredients from the olive oil through the cilantro. Saute those ingredients for 5 minutes.
After the 5 minutes, add the tilapia and cover and cook for 3 minutes or until fish is fully cooked. Then add in lime juice and let cook for 1 additional minute.
Heat the tortillas according to the package instructions. Lay each of the warmed tortillas on a cutting board and place one-quarter of both the field greens and fish on the center of each tortilla. Then top each with equal amounts of the Chipotle Cream Sauce.
Fold the tortillas over to form tacos and serve.
