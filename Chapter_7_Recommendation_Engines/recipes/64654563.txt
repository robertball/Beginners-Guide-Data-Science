Ingredients:
2   9" Standard pie shells
1 pound Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage (I have been using the regular, because of the grands, might be really good with hot!)
1 1/2 C  Grated Swiss Cheese
1/4 C Green Bell Pepper (or more to your taste)
1/4 C Red Bell Pepper (or more to your taste)
2 T  Chopped Onion (or more to your taste)
6 Eggs lightly beaten
1 C  Light Cream (half and half)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Cook sausage with bell peppers and onions until done, drain...I rinse mine off with warm water quickly.  Mix cheese and sausage and spoon into each pie shell evenly.
Lightly beat eggs in a bowl and add the cream.  Mix lightly and pour over sausage mixture in pie crust.  There have been a couple of times that I have had to pour a little out, but I fill as full as I can.
Back at 375 for 40-50 minutes, I think it is better when I do not cook it too long.  It is usually ready right at the 40 minutes for me.  Leftovers are very good warmed up again.
