Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked fettuccine
2 large apples - peeled, cored and chopped
1 shallot
1 tablespoon basil
1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 boneless pork loin chops
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 red onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 cup chopped fresh broccoli
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Place the apples, shallot, basil, and red wine in a blender, and puree.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, season with nutmeg and pepper, and sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cook about 4 minutes, then mix in onion and garlic. Continue cooking 4 minutes, or to desired doneness.
Mix sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli, and red bell pepper into the skillet. Continue cooking until broccoli is tender. Stir in the apple mixture, and cook until heated through. Serve over the cooked pasta.

Description: 
This is something I just hacked together based on the desire for pork and apples. I made fresh taglitelle with durum semolina and eggs, but you can substitue pretty much any pasta you like, although I'd recomend the strand variety. The garlic is optional, as I don't think it added too much.
