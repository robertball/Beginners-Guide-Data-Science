Ingredients:
4 cups pineapple juice
1/2 gallon pineapple sherbet
1 liter lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage

Directions:
Scoop all of sherbet into a large punch bowl.  Add pineapple juice and soda on top of the sherbet.  When adding soda the punch will foam, so make sure to stir constantly so the foam can go down. Serve immediately.
