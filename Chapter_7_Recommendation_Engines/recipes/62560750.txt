Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons cold stick LAND O LAKES® Fresh Buttery Taste® Spread, cut into chunks
3/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries
3/4 cup shelled pistachios or pecans, chopped
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons freshly grated lemon peel
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Cut in Fresh Buttery Taste® Spread with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cranberries, pistachios, eggs, lemon peel and almond extract; stir until mixture begins to form a dough.
Turn mixture onto lightly floured surface; knead lightly just until combined. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 14-inch log. Place logs onto large greased cookie sheet. Flatten each log to 2-inch width.
Combine egg white and water; brush on top of logs. Sprinkle with sugar.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until set. Cool on cookie sheet 15 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Place logs on cutting board. Cut each log into 3/4-inch slices with serrated knife. Place onto same cookie sheets, cut-side down. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn slices over; continue baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire rack.
