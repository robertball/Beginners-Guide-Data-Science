Ingredients:
1 pound medium shell pasta
1/4 pound Genoa salami, chopped (I sub Hillshire Farm summer sausage)
1/4 pound pepperoni sausage, chopped (I cut into quarters)
1/2 pound Asiago cheese, diced (1 sub Feta cheese)
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained and chopped
1 red bell pepper, diced (whatever you have works, too!)
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 tomatoes, chopped (I sub grape tomatoes cut in halves)
1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese (I probably use 5x this amount!)
salt and ground black pepper to taste (I also use Mrs. Dash!)

Directions:
Cook the pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain, and cool under cold water.
In a large bowl, combine the pasta (sprinkle with a bit of parm cheese), salami, pepperoni, Asiago or feta cheese, black olives, red bell pepper, green bell pepper and tomatoes.
To prepare the dressing, whisk together the dry Italian dressing mix, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Pour dressing over the salad, and mix well; refrigerate at least 1-2 hour prior to serving.
