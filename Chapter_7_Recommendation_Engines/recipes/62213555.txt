Ingredients:
2 can cut green beans
2 can cut yellow beans
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup sour cream
1 to 2 tsp curry powder
2 cups cooked leftover chicken diced
20 minute rice or 5 minute rice ( Or bulgar wheat, my favorite)

Directions:
Place green,  yellow beans and cubed chicken in pan, combine soup with sour cream and curry powder and add to pan with chicken, bean mixture. Heat over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with brown rice or bulgar wheat. Great reheated the next day.....you can adjust the curry to whatever you like, I use a bit more than I wrote for in this recipe as I like LOTS of curry. Enjoy!!
