Ingredients:
4 mild Italian sausage links
1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta
4 tomatoes, diced
1/2 pound baby portobello (cremini) mushrooms, chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/2 cups red wine
1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary
1 tablespoon crushed dried oregano
1 tablespoon crushed dried thyme
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil; cook the sausages in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. Cut the sausages into bite-sized pieces.
Fill a large pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Stir the penne into the water and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well.
Combine the tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, garlic, wine, rosemary, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until the liquid is reduced to about half its original volume, about 10 minutes. Add the sausage and the drained pasta to the mixture and continue cooking until the liquid is reduced to about one-quarter its original volume, 10 to 15 minutes more. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the dish to serve.
