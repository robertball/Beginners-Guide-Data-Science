Cheater Corn Tortillas (Cornmeal Crepes) Recipe

Ingredients:
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup milk
2 Tbsp milk
1 and 1/2 tsp corn oil
1/4 tsp of salt, or to taste
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 tsp oil for the crepe pan

Directions:
In a medium-sized mixing bowl add the egg, 1/2 cup of water,  1/4 cup of milk, and the vegetable oil. Whisk well.
Add the salt to the flour and mix well, then add it to the egg mixture little-by-little stirring constantly until all the flour is incorporated uniformly and there are no lumps.
Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit for at least thirty minutes.
After thirty minutes, mix the batter with a fork. It should be very runny, a bit less than a pancake batter. If it doesn't have this consistency, then add the remaining milk a bit at a time until the correct consistency is achieved.
Heat an 8" crepe pan over medium/high heat. Add a few drops of oil to keep the batter from sticking. Add a scant 1/3 cup of batter  to the hot crepe pan and swirl the pan around to allow the crepe to form evenly. Cook the crepe on one side until the edges brown, approx. 1-2 minutes. When the crepe becomes dry and brown around the edges, flip the crepe and cook until browned and the crepe is loosened easily.
Serve immediately or leave in a steamer or tortilla dish until time to serve.

Description: 
Living in an area without access to corn tortillas or masa harina, I created a cornmeal crepe to use for fajitas, tacos and enchiladas. These taste similar to a tortilla thanks to cornmeal being the only flour used and they hold up to your juiciest fillings! Depending on the grind of your cornmeal, you may need to adjust liquids.
