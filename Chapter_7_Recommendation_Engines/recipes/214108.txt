Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh spinach -- cleaned, stemmed, and dried
2 large stalks of rhubarb, cut diagonally into thin slices
water to cover
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons sweet red wine vinegar
6 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Arrange the spinach leaves on a platter.
Place the rhubarb in a skillet with enough water to cover by 1 inch; add the sugar. Bring the rhubarb to a gentle boil over medium-low heat and simmer until the sugar has dissolved and the rhubarb is lightly cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove the rhubarb with a slotted spoon and distribute over the spinach.
Stir the vinegar into the liquid left in the skillet, raise heat to medium, and bring to a boil. Return heat to medium-low and cook until the liquid has reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the olive oil, and pour the hot dressing over the spinach and rhubarb to wilt the lettuce. Divide salad between 2 plates; serve warm.

Description: 
This is a sweet, tangy salad with slightly wilted spinach.  It comes together super fast and easy, with great results! I used a cranberry sugar vinegar that I made, but you could try red wine vinegar, too.
