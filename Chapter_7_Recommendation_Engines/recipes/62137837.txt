Ingredients:
1 turkey breast carcass, mostly picked clean
4 (15 oz) cans of low sodium chicken broth
1 medium onion, quartered
1 stalk celery, chopped in 2 inch pieces
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 cups cooked, chopped turkey breast
1 (16oz) bag of frozen mixed vegetables
1 cup uncooked long grain white rice
1 (15oz) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
salt and pepper to taste
1 Tablespoon dried oregano
1 Tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot. Pour in the 4 cans of chicken broth, making sure the carcass is mostly covered with liquid. Add the onion, celery, and garlic. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to hold the mixture at a simmer. Simmer for 2 hours, turning the carcass occasionally.
Remove the carcass from the stock and allow to cool. Meanwhile, also remove the onion, celery and garlic from the stock. Place in a blender along with a few tablespoons of the stock. Puree until somewhat smooth. Add the mixture back into the stock. Pick the carcass totally clean and add that meat to the stock as well.
Place the turkey breast meat, frozen mixed vegetables, rice, beans, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and paprika into the stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to allow the soup to simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through. Serve hot.
