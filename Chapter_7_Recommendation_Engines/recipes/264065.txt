Ingredients:
3 1/2 ounces 70% dark chocolate, chopped
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7-inch baking pan and line with parchment paper.
Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale. Stir in melted chocolate and olive oil with a spatula until well combined. Combine almonds, flour, and cinnamon in a second bowl and add to chocolate mixture. Stir until well combined. Pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool completely before slicing and serving.
