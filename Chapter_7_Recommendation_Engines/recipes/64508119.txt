Description: 
Avocado is used in place of mayo.  It’s a heart-healthy way to get a nice creamy coating to your chicken salad without the guilt!  Wrapping these in lettuce instead of bread or tortillas makes them a fantastic grain-free alternative for lunch.  The crunchiness of the fresh veggies and the zesty tang of the citrus and garlic will keep you coming back for more!
