Ingredients:
Dough:
1/3 cup milk
1 1/2 tablespoons shortening
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup very warm water
1 tablespoon yeast
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cups all-purpose flour
Topping:
4 tablespoons packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or to taste
Filling:
2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or to taste

Directions:
Combine milk and shortening in a microwave-safe measuring cup and heat in a microwave until milk is warm but not too hot, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Add brown sugar and salt. Pour mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Combine warm water and yeast in the measuring cup and allow to proof until frothy, about 1 minute.
Meanwhile, add pumpkin, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the milk mixture in the mixing bowl.
Add proofed yeast mixture to the mixing bowl. Mix in 1 cup flour until fully incorporated. Add another 1/2 cup and mix. Continue adding flour until dough can be touched with your knuckle and it comes out clean. Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with a damp cotton towel. Let sit and rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine brown sugar, honey, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat for topping. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Pour into the bottom of a greased 9-inch square baking pan and sprinkle chopped pecans on top. Set aside.
Transfer risen dough to a clean, floured work surface and punch it down. Knead 10 to 12 times; roll dough out to 1/2- to 3/4-inch thickness. Spread butter for filling over the surface of the dough to the corners. Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl and sprinkle over dough. Sprinkle 1/4 cup pecans on top.
Roll dough into a log shape, and use a piece of unflavored dental floss to cut into rolls that are 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Place rolls into the baking pan on top of pecans. Cover rolls with a damp towel and allow to rise again for 30 to 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake risen rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow to sit in the pan for 3 to 5 minutes before turning out onto a piece of aluminum foil.
