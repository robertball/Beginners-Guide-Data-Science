Description: 
I've made this recipe on MANY occasions, and have been asked by virtually everyone, just HOW to make it. Even people who proclaim they do not like hominy, simply LOVE this dish! 

This is a LARGE recipe, but perfect as a contribution for a Pot Luck. You'll be surprised when there's none left!

It is a perfect side dish to just about any meat that's being served. From Steak, to chicken, to Bar-B-Que, it's a great accompaniment.
