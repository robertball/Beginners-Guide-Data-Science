Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4  eggs
1  red apple, diced
3  green onions, chopped
½ cup sweet pickle relish
½ cup mayonnaise
3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 cup chopped pecans
fajita seasoning to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add chicken and cook until thoroughly cooked and no longer pink inside, approximately 20 minutes.  Drain, cool and chop.
Meanwhile, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice.
In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, sliced eggs, apple, onions, relish, mayonnaise, celery, pineapple (with just a little juice for flavor), cilantro, pecans and fajita seasoning to taste.
