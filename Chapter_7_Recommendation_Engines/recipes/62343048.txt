Ingredients:
1½ cups uncooked brown rice
2 (4 oz) links fresh Italian sausage
2 TBS cooking oil
1 cup chopped onion
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup diced green pepper
1/2 cup diced sweet red pepper
1 (14.5 oZ) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 TBS lemon juice
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp hot pepper sauce
1/2 tsp chicken bouillon granules
1/4 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp dried thyme
1¼ teaspoons salt, divided
1 cup diced fully cooked ham
1 cup frozen cooked small shrimp, thawed (optional)
3 TBS minced fresh parsley
1 (6 lb) roasting chicken
1 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook rice according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a skillet, cook sausages in oil. Remove sausages, reserving drippings. When cool enough to handle, cut sausages in half lengthwise, then into 1/4". pieces; set aside.
Saute onion, garlic and peppers in drippings until tender, about 4 min. Add the next nine ingredients and 1 tsp salt; cook and stir for 5 min. Add to the cooked rice. Stir in ham, shrimp if desired, parsley and sausage; mix lightly.
Just before baking, stuff the chicken with about 3½ cups stuffing. Place remaining stuffing in a greased 1½ qt. baking dish; cover and refrigerate.
Place chicken on a rack in a roasting pan; tie drumsticks together. Combine paprika, pepper and remaining salt; rub over chicken. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 1½ hours, basting every 30 min. Cover and bake 1½ hours longer or until juices run clear. Bake additional stuffing for the last 40 min of baking time, uncovering during the last 10 min.
