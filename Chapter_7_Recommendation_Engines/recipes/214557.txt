Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons raspberry extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
Mash the butter and sugar together in a bowl with a wooden spoon until the mixture is creamy and well blended, and beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir in the raspberry extract, almond extract, and milk. In a separate bowl, stir the flour and baking powder together until thoroughly combined, and gradually beat into the butter-egg mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips, and drop by spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned at the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.
