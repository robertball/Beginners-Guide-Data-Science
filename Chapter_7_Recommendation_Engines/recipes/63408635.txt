1/4 teas. salt
1 egg

Mix the egg, water and vinegar together. Pour this into the crumb mixture and blend with a fork to form a dough ball.

1/4 cup of flour
1/2 cup of brown sugar
1/2 cup water
2 8 1/2 oz boxes concord foods Apple Crisp (usually found in produce)
1 stick butter

Description: 
I put this together for a family get together! This could be made into three 9inch pies but I put it in one large heavy duty rectangular (food service) foil pan. It takes 3 sticks of butter in all but this serves 24!
