Ingredients:
1 cup crushed ice
1 fluid ounce rum
1 fluid ounce coconut flavored rum
1 fluid ounce vodka
1 fluid ounce gin
1 fluid ounce triple sec (orange-flavored liqueur)
2 fluid ounces orange juice
1 fluid ounce pineapple juice
1 fluid ounce grenadine syrup
1 fluid ounce 151 proof rum
1 orange slice (optional)
1 lime slice (optional)
1 maraschino cherry (optional)

Directions:
Fill a hurricane glass with ice. Pour in the rum, coconut rum, vodka, gin, triple sec, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine. Stir well with a bar spoon, then pour the 151 rum over the back of the spoon to float the liquor on top of the drink. Garnish the glass with orange, lime, and a cherry.
Sip with a straw from the bottom for a 'sneak up on you' punch or sip from the top for a 'knock you down' twister.

Description: 
This beverage is known for its 'sneak up and blow you away' power.  There are many different versions, but I believe you will find mine a very good blend of rums, other alcoholic beverages and fruit juices. If you can walk after two of these...well...you just think you can.  Everything is bigger and better in Texas -- just try this and see.
