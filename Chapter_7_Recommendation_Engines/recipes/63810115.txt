Ingredients:
4 oz salt pork, trimmed of rind & cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 oz bacon (2 slices), cut into 1/4-inch pieces
1 medium onion, chopped fine
1/2 cup  mild molasses
1 T mild molasses
1 1/2 T brown mustard
1 pound dried small white beans (about 2 cups), rinsed and picked over
Table salt
1 teaspoon  cider vinegar
Ground black pepper

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 300 degrees.
Add salt pork and bacon to 8-quart Dutch oven; cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and most fat is rendered, about 7 minutes.
Add onion and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 8 minutes.
Add 1/2 cup molasses, mustard, beans, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 9 cups water; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil.
Cover pot and set in oven. Bake until beans are tender, about 4 hours, stirring once after 2 hours.
Remove lid and continue to bake until liquid has thickened to syrupy consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 hours longer.
Remove beans from oven; stir in remaining tablespoon of molasses, vinegar, and additional salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
