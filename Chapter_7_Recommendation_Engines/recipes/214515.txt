Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package rotini pasta
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon lime juice

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Remove 1/3 cup of the water from the pot and set aside. Drain the pasta.
