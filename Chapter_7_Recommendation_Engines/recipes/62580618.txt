Ingredients:
8 oz Alfredo Sauce
1/2 pound Dry or Fresh Fettuccine
1/2 pound Smoked Salmon, skin removed and chopped in 1" squares (I use the chunk kind, not the lox)
3 tbsp Capers, rinsed and dried
1 Medium Tomato, small chop (prefer roma)
5 tbsp Parsley and/or Cilantro, minced
Fresh Ground Pepper to taste
Fresh Parmesan, to taste
Crushed Red Pepper, optional

Directions:
Prepare fettuccine to package directions.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat Alfredo, salmon, pepper, and capers on low.  Do no let boil.
When fettuccine is done, drain well and add to skillet with sauce.  Turn off heat and add tomato and parsley or cilantro and mix well.
Serve immediately and top with fresh Parmesan and crushed red pepper if desired.
