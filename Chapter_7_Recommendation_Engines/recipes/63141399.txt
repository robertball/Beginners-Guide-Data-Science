Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup wheat bran
1/4 cup milled flax seed
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup chocolate chips (optional)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup honey
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, mix together the oats, brown sugar, wheat germ and bran, milled flax seed, cinnamon, flour, raisins and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the honey, eggs, oil, peanut butter and vanilla. Mix well. Pat the mixture evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bars begin to turn golden at the edges. Cool for 5 minutes, then cut into bars while still warm. Do not allow the bars to cool completely before cutting, or they will be too hard to cut.
