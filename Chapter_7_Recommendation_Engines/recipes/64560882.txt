Ingredients:
5 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1-5oz jar of Frank's Red Hot Original
1-15oz jar of T. Marzetti's The Ultimate Blue Cheese Dressing (in the refrigerated section)
1-8oz block of cream cheese
1-8oz bag shredded mozzarella cheese (whole milk melts better)
Tortilla chips for dipping

Directions:
Boil chicken breasts until fully cooked, ~30 minutes.
Shred chicken- I use a kitchenaid mixer on '2' for a minute, 2-3 breasts at a time.
In a 9x13 pan, smooth cream cheese on the bottom until even.
In a separate bowl mix the buffalo sauce, blue cheese dressing, shredded chicken, and half the bag of mozzarella.
Pour the contents of the bowl on top of the cream cheese.
Top with the remaining mozzarella.
Bake at 350 until bubbly, ~25 minutes.
