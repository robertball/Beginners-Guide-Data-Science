Ingredients:
4 cups sliced carrots
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon molasses
2 teaspoons salt
8 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Place carrots in a saucepan and cover with water; cook until tender. Drain and place in a blender or food processor. Add eggs and 1/2 cup water; puree until smooth. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in remaining water. Add carrot mixture. Stir in oil, sugar, molasses, salt and 5 cups flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down.
Shape into 48 balls. Place 2-in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until browned.

Description: 
These rolls have a nice flavor...folks usually don't guess that carrots are one of the ingredients. My family really likes them; see if yours will, too!
