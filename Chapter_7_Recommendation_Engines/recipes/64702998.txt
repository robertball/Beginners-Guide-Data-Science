Description: 
When I was in college, one of my best friends Lisa and I went to Tennessee and stayed with my Great Aunt Blanch. This was one of the recipes she made for us and was happy to share her recipe. If you have never had Cool Whip style icing before, I'm pretty sure you'll thank me after trying this one. 
Enjoy!
