Ingredients:
10 slices bacon
1 cup water
2 cups frozen cut green beans
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring water to a simmer. Add green beans and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain beans, reserving cooking liquid. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon.
Heat 3 tablespoons of the reserved grease. Stir in flour until blended and nutty in color. Add reserved cooking liquid and cream, whisking constantly until smooth and thick, about 5 minutes. Fold in beans and Cheddar cheese. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Cover with bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until hot and bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. Sprinkle bacon on top before serving.
