Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon MortonÂ® Plain or Seasoned Salt Substitute
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/2 teaspoon dried basil

Directions:
Arrange chicken in shallow casserole or baking dish. Combine all other ingredients; pour over chicken, turning once to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate to marinate, turning chicken occasionally, at least 1 hour
Bake* at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes (boneless breast) or 45 minutes to 1 hour (bone in), or until chicken is tender and juices run clear.

Submitter: 
Morton Salt
Description: 
A lemon juice and herb marinade helps to tenderize the chicken breasts before they are grilled or baked. Buttery mashed potatoes and a green vegetable would be perfect accompaniments to this juicy, mouthwatering main dish.
