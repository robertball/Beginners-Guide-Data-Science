Chicken Nuggets (for Sweet and Sour Chicken) Recipe

Ingredients:
16 oz. of chicken, boneless, skinless, cut into 2"x1" pieces as best as possible
1/2 cup of cornstarch
1/2 cup of flour
1 teaspoon of salt
1/4 teaspoon of sugar
1/8 teaspoon of pepper
1/4 cup of water
4 egg yolks, beaten
2 cups of oil (for frying)
Plus a little extra flour for dusting

Directions:
Cut up the chicken as directed.
Heat oil in wok, or fryer of your choice on medium heat.
Meanwhile, combine the cornstarch, flour, pepper, sugar and salt in a bowl.  Then whisk the egg yolks and water in a separate bowl, then pour the flour-cornstarch mixture into the egg-water bowl GRADUALLY.  Stir until a smooth and non-lumpy texture is achieved, about the same texture as pudding.
Now take a little of the extra flour( about 2 handfuls) and quickly dip each piece of chicken in flour and then add the piece to the flour-egg mixture.  Once all of the chicken is in the flour-egg mixture and evenly coated, you are now ready to fry.  Try to dip one at a time in the oil, if possible.  Once they reach a nice golden color, remove them and place them on paper towels.  For a crispier nugget, once all the chicken is fried, I set my oven to 400 degrees, pre-heat and once the oven is ready, line the nuggets on a baking sheet and bake for 3-5 minutes.
(The oven baking directions are the same for re-heating leftover nuggets.  NEVER microwave!!!)
Serve immediately.  ENJOY!!!

These are similar to those nuggets served at Chinese restaurants.  Fun-shaped, and delicious too!  See my profile for the Sweet and Sour Sauce recipe.
