Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup Marshmallow fluff
6 Pull n' Peel Twizzlers

Directions:
1.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
2.	In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.
3.	Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Cool on wire racks.
4.	Spoon 1 Tablespoon of marshmallow fluff on the bottom of one cookie. Place a second cookie on top and lightly squeeze together to create a sandwich.
5.	Pull apart Twizzlers and cut into 2 inch strips. Stick 8 into the marshmallow fluff to create the Dinomite’s “legs”
