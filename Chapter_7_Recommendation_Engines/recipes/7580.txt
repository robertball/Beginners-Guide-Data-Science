Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
2 egg whites
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine sugar, water, salt, and vinegar in a saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat just until clear.  Then cook without stirring until syrup spins a long thread when dropped from tip of spoon, or to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C).
Beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add syrup in a very thin stream, beating constantly.  After all syrup is added, continue beating until frosting will hold its shape.  Mix in vanilla.
