Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu
1 cup honey mustard sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat your oven to broil.
Cut the tofu cake into 4 pieces. Slice each piece very thinly, then lay the tofu strips on a paper towel and blot them dry to remove excess moisture. Place the dry strips in a bowl and cover them with the honey mustard sauce. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Broil for 5 minutes, then flip the tofu and broil for another 5 minutes, or until the tofu is hot.

Description: 
This recipe is for marinated tofu. You can marinate the tofu in any marinade that you please. Barbecue, honey soy sauce, and honey mustard sauce are just three sauces that have been successful; be experimental!   You can cool the tofu and place in an air tight container in the fridge.  Makes a nice, chewy sandwich filling.  If the tofu is diced small and marinated with a smokey BBQ sauce, it can be used as a vegetarian replacement for pork in fried rice!
