Ingredients:
1 pound dry black-eyed peas
water
2 slices salt pork
2 TBSP Canola oil or bacon drippings
salt to taste

Directions:
Look through peas and dicard any that are bad.  Put peas and water in a 4 quart sauce pan and bring to boil on stove top.
Turn off heat and let sit uncovered for 1 hour.  After the hour turn stove back on and boil about 30 minutes.  Add salt pork, salt, and oil.  Continue cooking for about 45 minutes until tender.  May need to re-add water to keep from burning.  I personally don't like a lot of liquid left in mine but others do so use your judgement.  Once the peas are tender coil until liquid evaporated to desired amount.
