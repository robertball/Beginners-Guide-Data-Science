Description: 
This is a recipe that I have created by trying many different banana breads and tweaking until I get the perfect HEALTHY banana bread recipe. It tastes better than any other fattening banana bread I have ever had. It is not too dense and not too light. Perfect amount of moistness and flavor, and it has much less oils and butters.
