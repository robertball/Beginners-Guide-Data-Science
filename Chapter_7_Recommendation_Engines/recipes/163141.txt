Ingredients:

1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
2 tablespoons dill pickle juice
1/2 cup kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 lime, juiced
6 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers vodka (optional)
6 dill pickle spears
1 fresh lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
In a large pitcher, stir together the Bloody Mary mix, horseradish, dill, hot pepper sauce, and dill pickle juice. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired.
In a shallow dish, stir together the kosher salt, pepper and celery seed. Pour the lime juice onto a saucer. Dip each glass into the lime juice to coat the rim, then into the spice mixture. Fill each glass with ice. Pour one shot of vodka into each glass if using. Fill with the Bloody Mary mixture. Garnish each glass with a wedge of lime and a dill pickle spear.
