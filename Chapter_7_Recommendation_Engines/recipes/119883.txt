Description: 
'When I switched from regular to low-fat cottage cheese, I was disappointed with the taste, says Traci Hirstein of Western Springs, Illinois. 'So I pulled out this recipe my mother gave me years ago. With this jazzed-up version of light cottage cheese, I don't miss the fat at all. Serve it with canned tuna and a few crackers for a great light lunch.
