Ingredients:
1 pasteurized egg
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup milk
1 cup half-and-half cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup rock salt
1 pound crushed ice

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar, instant pudding, milk, half and half and vanilla. Pour the mixture into a 12 ounce size coffee can. Cover the top with plastic wrap, and then the plastic lid. Place the filled coffee can into an empty  34.5 ounce coffee can (the big ones). Fill the empty space with crushed ice, sprinkle generously with rock salt, and cover with the plastic lid.
Roll the cans around on the floor for about 20 minutes. If the center of the ice cream is still soft, place the containers in the freezer to harden.
