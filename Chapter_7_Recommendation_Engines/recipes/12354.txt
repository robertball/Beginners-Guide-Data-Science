Ingredients:
1/2 cup cream cheese
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Soften cream cheese and butter and mix together incorporating flour a little at a time.
Roll out with a rolling pin between 2 wax papers. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate and prick with fork before half-baking to prevent shrinkage. Bake for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
