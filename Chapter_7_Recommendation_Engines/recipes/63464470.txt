Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package sliced smoked ham
25 green onions
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

Directions:
1. Clean green onions.
2. Take ham out of package.
3. Spread a thin layer of cream cheese on 1 slice of ham.
4. Roll green onion up in the ham/cream cheese slice, with white part covered all the way, and most of the green part sticking out of the bottom of the ham. (The ham is the *rose* and the green stalk is the *stem*).
5. Continue with the rest of the green onions.
6. Chill for one hour.

Description: 
I'm not sure where this recipe came from or how they were named, but my Mom used to make these every Christmas. I usually use the Carl Buddig variety of ham.
