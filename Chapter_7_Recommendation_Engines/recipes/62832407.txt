Ingredients:
4 large artichokes
1 cup quinoa, uncooked
2 cups water
1/4 cup sun dried-tomatoes
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 large lemon

Directions:
Boil the artichokes until tender
Cutt off the top inch of each artichoke, as well as the stem. Peel off the outer tough leaves and cut away all spikey edges.  Separate the outer leaves to loosen them, as well as the inside leaves to make the lighter leaves around the heart visible.  Pull out the lighter-colored leaves and remove the choke with a spoon.
For the stuffing: Bring the quinoa and water to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the water is soaked up and the quinoa is soft.
Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, salt and pepper, then squeeze the juice from the lemon onto the quinoa.  Mix.
Preheat the oven to 375 F.  Scoop 1/4 to 1/2 cup quinoa stuffing into each artichoke and around the sides in the gaps in the leaves.  Place in the oven to heat for 5-8 minutes.  Serve.
