Ingredients:
3 cups frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 1/2 cups frozen broccoli cuts, thawed
4 eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Press the hash browns onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate, forming a shell. Sprinkle with broccoli. In a bowl, beat the eggs, sour cream and salt; stir in cheese. Pour over broccoli. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-65 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
