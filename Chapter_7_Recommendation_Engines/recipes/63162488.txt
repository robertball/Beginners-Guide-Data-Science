Ingredients:
•1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts
•1 egg, lightly beaten
•1 c. tortilla crumbs, or gluten free bread crumbs
•28 oz. pasta sauce
•1/2 c. shredded mozzarella cheese
•1/4 c. shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
1.If the chicken breasts are large, cut them in half. Place the thicker half inside a plastic freezer bag (a cereal bag works too) and pound it with the flat side of a meat mallet until it is the same thickness as the thinner half. If keeping the breasts whole, just pound the thicker end.
2.Dip each piece of chicken in the egg and then coat it with the tortilla crumbs. Place the pieces in a greased baking dish.
3.Bake the chicken at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.
4.Pour pasta sauce over and around the chicken pieces. Top each piece with the cheeses.
5.Bake an additional 10 minutes or until the chicken is done.
6.Serve with hot cooked pasta.
