Description: 
My mother always made this when we were little, and when she passed we had no record of the recipe. But here not to long ago I found it in a old church cookbook, and I made it instantly! This recipe is not only great for the obvious, but is also very good in making a pizza. I usually double this recipe and freeze a large portion to pull out when we need it.
