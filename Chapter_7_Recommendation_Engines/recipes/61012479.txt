Greek Rice Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked long grain brown rice
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 vine-ripened tomato, diced
3/4 cup diced cucumber
1/8 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/8 cup sliced black olives
1/8 cup chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes; remove from heat and allow to cool, fluffing occasionally with a fork.
Put the tomatoes, lemon juice, cucumber, onion, feta, olives, mint, olive oil, lemon zest, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl; lightly toss the mixture until evenly combined. Fold the cooled rice gently into the mixture. Serve immediately or chill up to 1 hour; the salad does not last well for more than a day as the tomato and cucumber begin to release their juices and the salad becomes watery.
