Ingredients:
1 package of Wheat or Flour tortillas
one or two packages of softened cream cheese (depending on the quantity of sandwiches your making)
1 teaspoon of lemon juice per package of cream cheese
lettuce
tomato
black olives
onion
bacon (or your favorite lunch meat, leftover chicken or go veggie style)
avocado

Directions:
Slice or dice your veggies.  Mix cream cheese and lemon juice until thoroughly blended.  Spread cream cheese on tortilla.  Add your favorite sandwich toppings. (I use the precooked bacon because it cuts prep/cooking time to nothing). Roll it up or fold it like a taco.

Description: 
I had to get creative one day when feeding the grandkids 'cuz they all like different stuff.  So I came up with this new style sandwich.  They love it 'cuz they get to make their own and use their own ingredients. Grandpa likes it too!  A nice taco style, or rollup sandwich that can be altered for your tastes.  Use meat or eat it veggie style!
