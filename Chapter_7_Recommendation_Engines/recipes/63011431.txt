Ingredients:
9 cups chicken broth, divided (or I use 9 cups of water and 3 Tbsp chicken bouillon)
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 1/2 pounds mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 large onion
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 cups Arborio rice
sea salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup finely chopped dry chives
1/3 cup butter
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
**Can substitute 2/3 cup dry white wine for the broth.

Directions:
In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.
Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.
Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the onion and garlic. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesean. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This authentic Italian-style risotto is cooked the slow, painful way, but it's oh so worth it. It's the perfect complement for grilled meats and chicken dishes.Modified from: Gourmet Mushroom Risotto
