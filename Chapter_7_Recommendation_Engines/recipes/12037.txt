Ingredients:
1 cup seashell pasta
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1/2 cup iceberg lettuce, rinsed and chopped
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup creamy Italian salad dressing, or more to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in seashell pasta, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Place green onions and lettuce in a large bowl. Add pasta, tuna, peas, and grated Cheddar cheese; mix well. Stir in dressing; toss to coat.
