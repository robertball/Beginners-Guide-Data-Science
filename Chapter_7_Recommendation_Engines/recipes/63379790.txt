Ingredients:
1 cup jalapenos or other hot peppers, seeds and membranes removed, finely diced
1/2 cup red pepper, seeds and membranes removed, finely diced
2 cups apple cider vinegar
6 cups sugar
2 3 oz envelopes liquid pectin

Directions:
Prepare jars according to package directions. Do not put seeds in jelly, to increase heat place seeds in a piece of cheesecloth but REMOVE before adding pectin. In large pot, combine peppers, vinegar and sugar. Bring to boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to medium high and bring to full boil, stirring constantly. Add pectin, return to boil; stir constantly for one minute. Remove from heat. Immediately ladle into jars, leaving an inch of head room. Wipe rims before screwing on lids. Process jars for 10 minutes. Wait 30 minutes, turn to distribute peppers evenly. IF FREEZING: no need to process, just allow jelly to cool completely before freezing.
