Ingredients:
2 pounds small red potatoes, quartered
1/3 cup cold water
1/2 cup mayonnaise or salad dressing
1/4 cup dry white wine or chicken broth
2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Place potatoes and water in a 2-qt. microwave-safe dish. Cover and cook on high for 10-15 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through; drain. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  Add potatoes; stir gently to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Drain, reserving marinade. Thread potatoes on metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill, covered, over hot heat for 6-8 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown. Turn and brush occasionally with reserved marinade.

Description: 
Here's a unique way to prepare red potatoes. Cooking them in the microwave ensures they're tender inside, while grilling gives them a crisp outside.                                        --Sarah Steinacher, Geneva, Nebraska
