2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small leek, thinly sliced
20 kale buds, flowers removed for garnish
1/2 lemon, juiced and zested
2 cups cooked quinoa
2 tablespoons lemon-flavored olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive olive in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add leek and cook, stirring often, until leek has softened without browning, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add kale buds and lemon zest. Cook and stir until kale buds are wilted and just starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Do not let them brown. Mix in lemon juice and remove from heat. Allow to cool.
In a bowl toss quinoa, olive oil, salt, and pepper until well combined. Mix in leek and kale buds; toss to combine. Garnish with kale flowers. Serve right away or refrigerate until ready to serve. Let come to room temperature before serving.
