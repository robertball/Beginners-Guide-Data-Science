Description: 
My husband and I came up with these open-faced sandwiches when we didn't have much in the refrigerator. They've been a favorite ever since, particularly when we need a quick dinner. You can easily double the recipe when company drops by.                                                   --Tessa Edwards                                                                     Provo, Utah
