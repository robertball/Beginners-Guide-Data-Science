Ingredients:
2 (7 ounce) New York strip steaks
pink Himalayan salt to taste
2 cups arugula
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 grape tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese
1/4 red onion, sliced (optional)
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season both sides of each steak with Himalayan pink salt.
Place steaks on the preheated grill and cook for 4 minutes. Flip steaks over and grill 4 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile place arugula in a bowl and drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil. Add tomatoes, cheese, and red onion; toss to coat.
Thinly slice the steaks. Divide the steak and salad between two plates. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar over each salad and serve immediately.

Description: 
Sometimes simple really is the best and this recipe is one of those times. The peppery arugula salad compliments the steak perfectly without stealing the show.
