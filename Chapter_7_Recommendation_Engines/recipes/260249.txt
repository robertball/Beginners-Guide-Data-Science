Ingredients:
2 cups warm milk
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package quick-rise yeast
3 1/2 cups rice flour
1 1/2 cups cornstarch
3 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
3 teaspoons white vinegar
4 teaspoons canola oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 pizza pans or baking sheets well.
Whisk milk, sugar, and yeast together in a bowl. Set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Sift rice flour, cornstarch, xanthan gum, garlic powder, and oregano together in a large bowl.
Mix vinegar and oil together in a bowl. Whisk into the milk-yeast mixture, then pour the liquid into the flour. Knead until the dough comes together.
Split the dough in half. Spread the dough thinly over the prepared pans using your fingers and fists.
Bake on the lowest rack of the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
After about 3 years of experimentation and countless pizza dough recipes and big-name dough mixes, this is the closest I have come to real pizza dough. This recipe will yield two 16-inch pizzas. Remove baked crusts from the oven and top as desired; place back in the oven for approximately 15 minutes. I did not include the ingredients for the toppings as that is very subjective based on your preferences.
