Ingredients:
2 large chicken breasts, skin on and with bone
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 lime, juiced and zested
1 1/2 tbs olive oil
1/4 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp cumin
salt to taste
pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees; line baking sheet with foil.  Pat chicken breasts dry and gently pull skin partially away from meat to create a pocket; in a small ramekin, whisk together the 3 cloves of garlic, the lime juice/zest, the olive oil and salt/pepper.  Put this under the skin of the chicken.  Rub the chicken with paprika, cumin, salt/pepper and 1/2 tbs olive oil.  Place onto foil lined baking sheet and roast for about 40-45 minutes until golden and the juices run clear.  Allow chicken to rest for about 10 minutes then gently pull the bone from the meat to remove and slice each breast into 6 pieces (3 slices per person)
