Ingredients:
3 to 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 medium onion finely chopped
1 clove garlic minced
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
1 cup dry white wine such as Pinot Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan plus more for serving

Directions:
1. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.
3. Add the wine, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is absorbed.
4. Add the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently when you first add it and waiting until it is completely absorbed before adding more. This should take about 30 minutes total.
5. Remove from heat. Add the salt, pepper, Parmesan, and remaining butter, and stir until the butter melts.
6. Spoon the risotto into bowls. Sprinkle with the zest and parsley (if using).
