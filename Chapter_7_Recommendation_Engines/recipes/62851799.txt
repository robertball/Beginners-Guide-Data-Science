Ingredients:
Cake:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour (about 3 1/3 ounces)
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
1 (2 1/2-ounce) jar carrot baby food
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/4 cups finely grated carrot (about 4 ounces)
1/2 cup golden raisins
Cooking spray
Frosting:
1/3 cup (3 ounces) 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, sifted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup flaked sweetened coconut, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°.
To prepare cake, lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour and next 5 ingredients (through salt) in a food processor; pulse 6 times or until well blended. Place flour mixture in a large bowl. Combine granulated sugar, canola oil, baby food, and eggs; stir with a whisk. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moist. Stir in grated carrot and raisins. Spoon batter into an 8-inch square baking pan coated with cooking spray.
Bake at 325° for 40 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
To prepare frosting, combine cheese and butter in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer at high speed until creamy. Gradually add powdered sugar and vanilla, beating at low speed until smooth (do not overbeat). Spread over cake; sprinkle with coconut. Cover and chill.
