Description: 
This is a twist of Broccoli Chicken Casserole III. I have been on a quest to use fat free evaporated milk in recipes and it works well in this one. My husband and I don't like  canned soup in anything due to the sodimm taste but like it spicey. The noodles are higher in protein and fiber than normal noodles.
