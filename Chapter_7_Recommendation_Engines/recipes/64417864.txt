Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato - baked and de-skinned.
1.5 bananas
6 eggs
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup coconut flour
1/3 cup almond flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, mash the flesh of the sweet potato with the banana.  May also use a hand mixer on low speed
Mix in the eggs and vanilla extract to the mashed sweet potato and banana.
In separate bowl mix all dry ingredients: coconut flour, almond flour, baking power and cinnamon
Combine wet and dry ingredients.  The mixture will be a little thicker then most pancake recipes.
Heat skillet to medium heat or medium/low heat or 325 degrees if using an electric skillet. Because these pancakes are thick, they need to cook for longer then most on a lower heat
Pour 1/4 to 1/3 cup of pancake mixture onto greased skillet.  Flip when edges harden and press down on pancake to flatten after flipped.
