To Make Frosting:   In a small saucepan, stir together brown sugar and water. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar spins a thread when dropped from a spoon. In a large bowl, beat together remaining 2 egg whites until foamy. Slowly pour brown sugar liquid into egg whites while beating.  Beat until frosting forms stiff peaks.  Unroll  cake and apply frosting in an even layer. Roll cake back up and refrigerate.
