Ingredients:
1/2 small onion
1 medium tomato (like a large plum would be fine)
2 cloves of garlic (or 1 tsp paste/minced)
1 jalapeno
1 large bunch of Cilantro
juice from 1/2 lime
2 tbs olive oil
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
1 tsp salt
1 tbs sugar
1 large bunch of green onions

Directions:
1. Rough chop the onion, tomato, garlic, and jalapeno and place in a food processor.
2. Cut off the stems of the cilantro bunch just below where the leaves start, but don't worry about removing all of them. Add to the food processor.
3.  Add the juice of 1/2 lime, the 2 tbs olive oil, the 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tbs sugar.  Pulse until the mixture resembles a very rough pesto, like in the photo.
4. Finely chop the green onion and mix in.
**Please note that this salsa can turn out great with more or with no jalapeno, it just depends on your preference.  However, because the spiciness of jalapenos is VERY unpredictable, I HIGHLY recommend leaving it out,  transferring the salsa to a bowl, and then adding the finely chopped jalapeno gradually. I even throw mine in a small magic bullet style blender with a little olive oil and turn it into a paste so I can add it very carefully.  This also allows you to separate it into mild and spicy batches.

Description: 
A tangy fresh Colombian-style salsa which can be made delicious either mild or XXX hot! Goes GREAT with grilled meats, empanadas, and tostones, but I put it on everything... even my eggs! There seem to be several variations of this; some watery, some oily, some saucy, some chunky, but my mom is from Barranquilla, Colombia and this is how she makes it.
