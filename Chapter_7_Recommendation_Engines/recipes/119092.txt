Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm buttermilk (105 to 115 degrees F)
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
4 cups all-purpose flour
GLAZE:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add buttermilk, sugar, shortening, eggs, salt, baking soda and 2 cups flour; beat until blended. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Divide into 18 pieces. Roll each into a 9-in. rope; coil the ends of each rope toward center in opposite directions to form an S shape. Place 3 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 40 minutes.
In a small, beat egg and water; brush over rolls. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
In my house, a meal isn't complete unless a basket of rolls is passed around. Just one rising time makes these fluffy rolls easy to prepare.                                        --Harriet Stichter, Milford, Indiana
