Ingredients:
Graham Cracker Crust
3 cups Graham Cracker Crumbs
2/3 cups of granulated sugar
12 tablespoons real butter
Pie Filling
1 8 oz package cream cheese at room temperature
½  cup granulated sugar
1 15 oz can pure pumpkin
1 8 oz cool whip topping
½ teaspoon nutmeg
½ teaspoon pumpkin spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix together graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter until well-combined.  Press mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a cheesecake spring form pan (can use a deep dish 9 inch pie plate as well but spring form works well).    Bake the crust for 10 minutes or until lightly brown.  If using a spring form put a cookie sheet underneath in case any butter goes through.   Allow to cool.
For pie filling:  Cream the cream cheese with the sugar, mix in the pumpkin then fold in the whipped topping.  Add spices.
Pour the pie filling in the cooled crust and allow to cool overnight.  Take out of the spring form pan.

Description: 
This is a wonderful light whipped pumpkin pie.  My husband doesn't like traditional pumpkin pie but loves this recipe I came up with.  The cream cheese adds a wonderful flavor with a traditional pie taste but light/whipped.  It is made with a home made graham cracker crust.
