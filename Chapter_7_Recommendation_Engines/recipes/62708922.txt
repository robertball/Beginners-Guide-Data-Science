Cream of Potato Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
3 slices bacon, diced
1/3 onion, chopped
1/2 stalk celery, chopped
1/2 carrot, cubed
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
3 1/2 cups chicken stock
3 to 4 potatoes, cubed (depending on size)
1/4 cup instant mashed potato flakes (optional)
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 t pepper
1 bay leaf
pinch of ground mustard

Directions:
Cut bacon into bits, saute, and remove from pan (leave grease in pot).
Saute onion, celery & carrot in bacon grease until nicely browned.  Add garlic and saute for 30 to 45 seconds (do not brown).
Check to see if you have enough grease in pan to make roux (if not, add a T of butter or so), add flour, and saute along with veggies for 2-4 minutes.
Add chicken broth and bring to a low boil.
Stir in bacon mixture, potatoes, spices, and instant potatoes (if using).
Simmer for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender, then blend in half and half.
If thicker soup is desired (and not using instant potatoes), remove about a cup or two and puree in blender.
May eat now, but is best if allowed to simmer for at least an hour - flavors will become much more pronouced the longer it sits.
