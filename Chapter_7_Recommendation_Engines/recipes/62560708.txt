Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets, about 3 cups
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 ounce butter-flavored spray
1/2 cup fat-free half & half or 1-2% milk
Sea Salt &  freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Place cauliflower and garlic cloves in a microwave steamer.  I typically add about a 1/4 inch water to help it “steam”.  Steam or microwave the cauliflower until soft, about 7-8 minutes.
Drain cauliflower/garlic mixture well and place in a large food processor.  Puree in a food processor, adding the butter spray and the half-and-half. Season with salt and pepper.
