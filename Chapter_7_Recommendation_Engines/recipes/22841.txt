Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup salted peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites and salt until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Fold in the vanilla and chocolate chips. Add peanuts if desired. Spoon onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Place the cookies into the preheated oven, shut the door and turn off the oven immediately. Let cookies sit in the turned off oven for 5 to 6 hours or overnight.
