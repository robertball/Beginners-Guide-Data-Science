Ingredients:
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 cups raisins
3 eggs
1 cup lukewarm milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed

Directions:
Dissolve sugar in lukewarm water in a large bowl and sprinkle yeast over the top. Let yeast activate until it forms a creamy layer on top of the water, about 10 minutes.
Rinse raisins and pat dry with paper towels. Stir raisins into yeast mixture; beat eggs, lukewarm milk, and salt into yeast mixture. Beat flour into liquid ingredients until dough is smooth. If dough is too sticky, beat in 1/4 cup more flour. Cover dough and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Heat vegetable oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a large saucepan or deep fat fryer.
Scoop up dough by tablespoon and drop, a few at a time, into the hot oil. Fry until lightly browned; drain on wire racks set over paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
