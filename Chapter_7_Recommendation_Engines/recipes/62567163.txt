Ingredients:
1 cup (2 sticks) of softened butter (not margarine)
2 cups flour
4 heaping Tbsp of powdered sugar
2 cups finely chopped walnuts or pecans
6 cups powdered sugar in a large bowl

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Mix together the butter, flour, and powdered sugar until a golden dough.  Then mix in the nuts.  *The finer the nuts, the better.*
Roll the dough into small balls about the size of a large marble and place onto ungreased baking sheet.  (They don't expand alot, so you can place them relatively close together.)
Bake until a light golden brown and then roll them into the powdered sugar.  Set them aside and let them cool.  The most important step is rolling them a second time in the powdered sugar once they are cooled.
They taste great at room temperature, in the fridge, or in the freezer.
