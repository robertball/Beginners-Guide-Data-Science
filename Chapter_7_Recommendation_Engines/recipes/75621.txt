Ingredients:
1 cup light mayonnaise
2 tablespoons canned Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup sweet pickle relish

Directions:
Place the mayonnaise and chipotle peppers into a food processor, and process until well blended. Add a little bit more of the sauce if desired, I like to add about 1/2 teaspoon. Transfer to a serving bowl, and stir in the green onion and sweet pickle relish. Chill until serving.

Description: 
Chipotle mayo relish is the perfect compliment to fish tacos. My absent minded friend gave this one to me. Creamy with a subtle kick. People were actually eating it as a dip!
