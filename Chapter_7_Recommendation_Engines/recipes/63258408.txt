Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems and leaves
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons water
1/4 cup toasted cashews (pieces are fine)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and ground black pepper
2 pounds teres major steaks
Vegetable or canola oil

Directions:
Heat a grill to high.
In a blender, combine the cilantro, olive oil, water, cashews and Parmesan. Blend until smooth, or as smooth as you prefer. Season with salt and pepper, then blend again. Set aside.
Season the steaks with salt and pepper.
Soak a crumpled paper towel with oil. Clasping the paper towel with tongs, oil the grates of the grill. Add the steaks and cook over high heat for 5 to 8 minutes per side for medium-rare.
Remove the steaks from the grill and allow to rest for 8 to 10 minutes. Thinly slice the steaks across the grain and top with the pesto.
