Ingredients:
1 red onion
3 carrots
3 parsnips
1 cup mushrooms
1 celery stalk
2 cups roughly chopped kale
1 garlic clove
1 pinch Finely chopped sage & oregano
2 lbs leg of lamb, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 cup lentils
1 tbsp butter
4 cups vegetable broth
2 lemons, juiced
1 tbsp cardamom pods
1 whole nutmeg
6 whole star anise
1 tbsp white peppercorns
1 pinch cinnamon
1 pinch coriander
1 pinch cumin
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Grind all the spices in a spice grinder. (If you don't want to grind them yourself, just buy pre-ground spices.)
Place the cubed lamb in a large bowl and liberally season with the spice rub.
Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil, reduce heat to medium, add the lentils, and cover.
Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven. Add the red onion and a pinch of the finely chopped sage and oregano.
Add the lamb to the pan along with another pinch of sage and oregano.
Allow the lamb to brown on all sides, stirring often.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in the mushrooms.
Add the carrots, parsnips, and celery. Mix well.
Pour in the vegetable broth and lemon juice.
Increase the heat to medium-high and mix in the lentils (along with their cooking liquid).
Cover and allow the stew to simmer on low for about 2 hours.
Stir in the kale and it's ready to serve!
