Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (10 ounce) package peanut butter chips

Directions:
Place oats in a blender or food processor and pulse until oats resemble flour. Transfer oats to a large bowl and stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Beat butter, milk, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in another bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract with the last egg; stir in oat mixture until well blended. Fold in peanut butter chips, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drop 1-inch spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until cookie centers are set, 10 to 12 minutes.
