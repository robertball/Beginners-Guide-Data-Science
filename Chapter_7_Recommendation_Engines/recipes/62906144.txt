Cooking spray
1 (18.25 oz) box yellow cake mix
2/3 cup quick oats
2/3 cup nuts (walnuts or pecans)

1/2 cup oil (or 1/4 cup oil and 2 tbsp. water)
6-8 cups apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
1/4 cup caramel topping or melted caramels

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 F. Spray a 13X9 in pan with no-stick spray.
Combine cake mix, oats, nuts, cinnamon, and oil and mix until crumbly; mix in apples. Spread evenly into prepared pan.
Bake 45-50 minutes or until top is light golden brown. Heat caramel topping in a microwave-safe bowl 10 seconds on HIGH. Drizzle over baked crisp. Serve warm with vanilla yogurt or ice cream if desired.

Description: 
This is a recipe I adapted from an old Pillsbury cake mix box. Cake mix is used in place of the flour and sugar giving a wonderful flavor and texture to the apple crisp. The caramel tops it off wonderfully.
