Ingredients:
1/2 cup white rice flour
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup Oat flour (or use amaranth, millet or sorghum)
1/4 cup tapioca starch
1/4 cup potato starch
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 cup water
2 tsp active yeast
1 tsp raw sugar or maple syrup
1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup non dairy yogurt (I used coconut milk yogurt), or use full fat coconut milk
1/2 cup water

Directions:
In small bowl, add warm 1/4 cup water, sugar and yeast. Mix and let sit for 5 minutes or until frothy.
In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients and whisk very well.
Add the liquid to the dry mix. Add the oil, yogurt and 1/2 cup warm water to the bowl as well. Mix to make a thick batter.
Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Let the batter sit near the warm oven for 10 minutes.
Mix the batter and Drop a 1/4-1/3 cup of the batter or large spoon fulls on parchment lined sheet. Spray water on the batter, flatten and shape into flat 1/2 inch thick rounds. (wet your hands in water to reduce sticking). Sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Let the shaped breads sit in a warm place for 10 minutes. Spray water on top. Place another parchment sheet on top so it just sits lightly on the buns. (This is important to keep all the moisture from escaping the buns)
Bake for 11-12 minutes. Remove from oven, remove the top parchment and let cool for 5 minutes before removing the buns from the sheet. The buns taste best fresh or well toasted.
The buns keep well up to 4 days refrigerated. Toast or grill to refresh. Freeze separated by parchment in ziplock or air tight container. Thaw and Toast to refresh.
