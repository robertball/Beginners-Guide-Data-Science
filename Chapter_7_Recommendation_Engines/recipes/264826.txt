Ingredients:
1 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon dried mint
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 large orange, juiced
2 pounds chicken thighs

Directions:
Combine yogurt, garlic, onion, turmeric, cinnamon, paprika, tarragon, mint, red pepper flakes, and orange juice in a bowl. Stir to combine.
Dip each chicken thigh into yogurt mixture and place on a plate. Cover with foil and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking dish and place chicken thighs inside.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 50 to 55 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
