Little Gem Mini Muffins Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dried blueberries
1/2 cup chopped dried cherries
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 large eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the blueberries and cherries.
In a separate bowl, stir together the milk, butter, eggs, and vanilla. If you like, cover both bowls and refrigerate the egg mixture overnight.
Heat the oven to 400° and spray or grease a mini-muffin pan or two. Stir the egg mixture if it was refrigerated overnight (the butter will have risen to the top), then add it to the dry ingredients and stir until just moistened. Spoon the batter into the pan.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into a muffin's center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Let the muffins cool for 5 minutes before removing them from the pan. Makes 36.

Description: 
Brown sugar and vanilla give these bite size muffins a rich flavor,  while the jewels  dried blueberries and cherries  offer a delightful burst of sweetness. Feel free to sub in other dried fruits you have on hand, such as cranberries or chopped mango or for a special treat substitute mini chocolate chips.
