Ingredients:
2 teaspoons chicken-flavored bouillon granules
1 tablespoon hot water
24 ounces cream cheese -- softened
1 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
salt and pepper -- to taste
2 large eggs
1 cup finely chopped cooked chicken
1 can chopped green chiles -- (4.5-ounce size) drained
shredded Mexican cheese -- optional
sliced green onions -- optional

Directions:
Dissolve bouillon granules in hot water. Set aside. Beat cream cheese at high speed of an electric mixer until creamy. Add chili powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Beat well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add bouillon mixture. Beat well. Stir in chicken and chiles.
Spoon mixture into a lightly greased 9-inch springform pan. Bake at 300 for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and partially open oven door; leave cheesecake in over 1 hour.
Remove cheesecake from oven, and let stand 15 minutes. Place cheesecake on a serving platter. Carefully remove sides of springform pan. If desired, top cheesecake with shredded cheese and sliced green onions. Serve cheesecake warm with tortilla chips.
Note: To serve cheesecake chilled, remove from oven and let cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Cover and chill several hours. Carefully remove sides of springform pan when ready to serve.
