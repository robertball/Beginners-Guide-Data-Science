Ingredients:
3 lbs pork shoulder
4 pasilla peppers
4 bell peppers
8 tomatillos
1 garlic clove, minced
1 onion, diced
1 pinch brown sugar
1 pinch kosher salt
1 pinch cumin

Directions:
Cut the pork shoulder into cubes, add to a large pot, and simmer over medium heat for 2-3 hours.
Place the pasilla peppers and bell peppers on a preheated grill and cook until charred on the outside.
Transfer to a ziptop bag and let stand for several minutes. (This makes it easier to remove the blackened skin.)
Remove the seeds and blackened skin from the peppers and place in a blender.
Remove the husks from the tomatillos, cut into quarters, and place in the blender.
Add the garlic and blend until smooth.
Pour the sauce over the pork, stir in the diced onion, and season with a pinch of brown sugar, salt, and cumin.
Simmer on low heat for 2-3 hours.
Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!
