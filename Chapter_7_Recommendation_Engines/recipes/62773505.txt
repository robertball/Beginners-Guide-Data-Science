Ingredients:
4 ears of corn, scraped with milk
3 slices bacon
1 small sweet onion, finely diced
1/3rd red bell pepper, seeded and finely diced
1 hot chili pepper, pierced and left whole (for spicier version, you may dice and add with the onions and pepper)
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut bacon in to small 1/3" pieces.
In large skillet, cook bacon until browned.
Remove bacon pieces and set aside; leaving 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pan.
Add onions, sugar, salt and chili until the onions are softened.
Add pepper and cook for 3 minutes more.
Add corn and cooked just till warmed through.
Remove the hot chili (if desired).
Remove from heat and crumble the bacon on top and combine.

Description: 
The original recipe starts by rendering bacon but is wonderful if you choose to leave out the bacon and melt down the vegetables in canola oil.  The ladies in Barbados use palm oil.

This recipe can be served hot or cold.  If serving cold, add three tablespoons of cidar vinegar combined with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar (dissolved in the vinegar) poured over the mixture.

We've also added our leftovers to a small boxed cornbread mix (not with vinegar) for a spiced up corn bread; although left overs are rare.
