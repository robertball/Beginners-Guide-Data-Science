Ingredients:
Dough:
1 1/8 tsp active dry yeast
2 Tbsp warm water
1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp warm milk
2 Tbsp butter, melted
1 egg
2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
Caramel:
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1/4 cup milk
Toppings:
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Additional milk

Directions:
In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.  Add 1/2 cup and 2 Tbsp warm milk, 2 Tbsp butter, egg, 2 Tbsp sugar, and 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat on medium speed with an electric mixer for 3 minutes.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough.
Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
For the caramel, bring the brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and 1/4 cup milk to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring frequently.  Cook and stir 3 minutes.  Pour half of the caramel into a greased 10-inch fluted tube pan; sprinkle with half of the pecans.
Punch dough down and shape into 20 balls.  In a shallow bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon.  Place additional milk in another bowl, about 1/4 cup.  Dip balls into milk, then roll in the cinnamon sugar to coat.
Place 10 balls of dough in the pan; cover with the remaining caramel and pecans.  Top with 10 more balls of dough.  Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 350* 30-35 minutes or until gold brown.  If top begins to brown too quickly, cover loosely with foil.  Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before inverting on a serving place.  Serve warm.
