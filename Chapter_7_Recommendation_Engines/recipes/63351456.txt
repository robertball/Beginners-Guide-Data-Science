Ingredients:
4 eggs (beaten)
2 Cups Sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1 cup vegetable oil
1 can Libby's Pumpkin
2 tsp. cinnamon
2 cups flour
(I add nutmeg)
____________________________________________
Frosting: (Janet doubles this)
3 oz. cream cheese (I use 1 entire package of cream cheese)
3/4 stick of butter (I use 1 1/2 sticks of butter)
1 tsp. milk
1 tsp. vanilla
1 3/4 cups powdered sugar (I start with this doubled, but add more because of the increased butter and cream cheese)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients well. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes in greased and floured cookie sheet.
(I always sift the flour and use cake flour)
