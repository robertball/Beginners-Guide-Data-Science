Ingredients:
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup mirin
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp sugar
3 chickebn breasts, boneless and skinless 1/4 inch thick

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350*F. Cut 3 longer skewers in half to make 6 and place them in water and cover for about 30 minutes before grilling. Prepare a grill or broiler.
Combine, in a small saucepan over medium heat, the soy sauce, mirin, cornstarch and sugar and cook, whisking, until the sugar has completely dissolved and the liquid just begins to turn syrupy, 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat and pour a little into a small bowl. The  small bowl will be to baste the finish chicken.
Cut each piece of chicken directly down the center creating 6 strips. Thread one chicken strip onto the skewer, it should look like partially cooked bacon.
Baste the skewers with the marinade inside the saucepan and place on a baking sheet with tinfoil, basting 3-4 times during cooking. Cook until chicken is done, about 15 minutes, and finish with a light basting of the glaze from the small bowl. Serve.
