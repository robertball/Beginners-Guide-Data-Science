Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
2T olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1T basil
2t oregano
1t sugar
1/2t salt
1/8 - 1/4t black pepper
1/8t cayenne pepper, McCormick (Trust me)
29oz tomato sauce
8oz shell* pasta
16oz lowfat cottage cheese, small curd
1 egg, slightly beaten
8oz Italian blend cheese, divided
1/4c shredded Parmesan cheese
5oz turkey pepperoni slices
Paprika
Parsley

Directions:
In 3qt saucepot, over mediumhigh heat, saute onion in oil until softened, 3 - 5 minutes.  Stir in garlic; then add basil, oregano, sugar, salt, black pepper & cayenne.  Cook & stir one minute.  Reduce  heat to medium.  Add tomato sauce.  Bring to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce to simmer.
While sauce simmers, cook pasta al dente.
While pasta cooks, prepare cheese mixture by combining cottage cheese, egg, 1 1/2c Italian blend cheese & Parmesan cheese.
Brush oil on bottom & sides of an 8x8 - 8x11 or so.  Be sure it isn't too low - or place on foil in case of a sputtering spill.  Attempt to spread 1/4 - 1/3c sauce on bottom of dish.  There will be sauceless places.  It's okay.  ;)
Stir in some sauce with the pasta.  It should not be enough to be saucey; just enough to be sauced.  :o  Are ya with me here?!  :D
Pour half the pasta in prepared dish.  Spoon on almost half the sauce.  Dollop on half the cheese mixture.  Top with remaining pasta, sauce & cheese mixture.  Sprinkle with reserved 1/2c Italian blend cheese, paprika & parsley.
Place turkey pepperoni slices closely together on top.
Place foil dome** over dish.  Do not seal.  Just do what you can to have it loosely covered.  Bake in 350 oven for 30 minutes.  Remove foil & bake an additional 15 minutes, or until bubbly.  Waiting 15 minutes before serving isn't a bad idea.  There will be more cheese on your plate & less stuck to the spoon.  :)
*The shells are medium shells, not the small salad shells or manicotti/jumbo shells.  They are about an inch long before cooking.  In a pinch, I've used rotini.  Since the sauce doesn't cling to rotini as well as shells, I thickened the sauce with 1 1/2t cornstarch, after gentle boil.  Be sure to stir occasionally.
**An easy way to make a foil dome is to place baking dish on a sheet of foil larger than the dish.  Wrap the foil up the sides, but do not fold over.  Carefully remove foil from bottom of dish & you have a foil dome!  Wooo.  ;D
