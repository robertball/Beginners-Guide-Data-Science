Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon finely shredded lemon or orange peel
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3 tablespoons margarine or butter, softened
1/4 cup refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed
1 cup raspberries or thinly sliced apricots or nectarines
raspberries or thinly sliced apricots or nectarines (optional)
sifted powdered sugar

Directions:
Coat a 9x1-1/2-inch round baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, lemon or orange peel, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a medium mixing bowl beat the 3/4 cup granulated sugar and margarine or butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until combined. Add the 1/4 cup egg product and vanilla. Beat on low to medium speed for 1 minute. Alternately add the flour mixture and buttermilk to egg mixture, beating just until combined after each addition. Pour into prepared pan.
In a small mixing bowl beat the cream cheese and the 1/4 cup granulated sugar on medium to high speed until combined. Add the 2 tablespoons egg product. Beat until combined. Arrange the 1 cup raspberries, apricots, or nectarines over batter in the pan. Pour cream cheese mixture over all.
Bake in a 375 degree F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted near center comes out clean. Cool slightly on wire rack. Serve warm. If desired, top with additional fruit. Dust with powdered sugar.
