Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
3/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
2 eggs
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large muffin pan with cooking spray.
Combine ground beef, blue cheese, onion, bread crumbs, spinach, eggs, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl until well blended. Divide meat mixture evenly into the prepared muffin pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
Moist, flavorful and absolutely one of the best meat loaf recipes yet!  Using a large muffin pan allows the mini meat muffins to cook faster and makes portion sizing easier. I like to serve this with sweet potatoes or butternut squash.  I think the mini meat loaves taste great the next day as they are easy to put away and re-heat.  Try making a meat loaf sandwich out of them too.
