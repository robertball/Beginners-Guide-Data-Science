Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese
6 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place cottage cheese, eggs, flour, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a food processor. Process until smooth. Mix spinach, cottage cheese mixture, and 2 cups of Cheddar cheese in a bowl, then spread into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Top with the remaining 2 cups of Cheddar cheese and continue baking until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.
