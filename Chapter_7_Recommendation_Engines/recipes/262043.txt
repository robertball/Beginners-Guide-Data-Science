Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons minced ginger (optional)
1/2 cup finely chopped kimchi
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 cup day-old cooked white rice
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons kimchi brine
1/2 tablespoon sesame oil
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add red onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high and add chopped kimchi and vinegar. Stir in cooked rice, soy sauce, sugar, soy sauce, kimchi brine, and sesame oil. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes; scrape the bottom of the skillet to prevent sticking. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite vegan recipes to use leftover jasmine rice. The key to Korean fried rice is to use one-day-old, leftover rice; freshly cooked rice causes the fried rice to be sticky and soggy in texture. 
I usually present this dish on a square plate. Garnish with green onions, cherry tomatoes, sesame seeds, and cilantro to bring color and provide an extra visual of texture and crunch.
