Ingredients:
1-1/2 Cups Masa Harina (corn tortilla flour)
3 tablespoons flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 water
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup shortening, melted
Vegetable Oil for frying

Directions:
In bowl combine masa harina, flour, salt.  Stir in water and egg.  Add melted shortening, mix well.  Gently knead dough until its moist but holds its shape.  Cover and chill for 1 hour.
Divide dough into 12-15 portions.  Roll one portion of the dough into a ball (keep remaining dough covered to prevent drying out; if it dries out add a little water) On floured surface pat ball into 3" round and form a shell by pinching up the edges of the round to make a ridge.  Repeat until dough is all done.
Pour oil into skillet about 1/2" deep.  Heat to 365 degrees.  Fry shells a couple at a time.  About 1-2 minutes per side until crisp.  Turning only once.  Using slotted spoon remove shells from oil and place on paper towel to drain excess oil.
