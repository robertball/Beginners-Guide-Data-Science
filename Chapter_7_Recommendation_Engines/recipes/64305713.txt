Ingredients:
1/2 cup stone-ground cornmeal (or can use all GF flour)
2 Tbsp ground almonds (for color - or use teff, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts)
6 Tbsp brown rice flour (or other GF flour)
1-2 tsp sea salt
1-2 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp garlic powder
2 Tbsp smoked paprika
1/4-1/2 tsp ground thyme
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp dried basil
1-2 Tbsp sugar
dried chili peppers (opt - ground to a powder)
rosemary (opt)

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.  Use more or less seasonings/spices according to your tastes.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge or freezer until needed!
To use: Chicken drumsticks/thighs - put into heavy bag and shake single pieces until coated.  1/3 cup of mixture was too much for just 3 drumsticks...
Pork - pour mixture into a shallow dish and press both sides into mixture to coat or dredge to coat.  Beef can be used too!
Place pieces of meat onto/into a cooking dish/sheet.  Cook according to type of meat used.
Throw out any unused mixture that was used to coat the meat pieces.
Cook chicken drumsticks @ 400F for 50 mins.  Thighs will take longer.

Description: 
An excellent, almost copy-cat version of the traditional 'shake'n'bake', but gluten free!  Some things are worth copying - especially for our kids! :)
