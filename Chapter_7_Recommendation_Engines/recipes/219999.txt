Cook for 15 minutes, and cool the eggs under a stream of cold water in the sink, 10 to 15 minutes.
Peel the eggs and slice in half lengthwise.
Scoop the egg yolks into a bowl, and mash them with a fork.
Mix in the ranch dressing, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, yellow mustard, celery seed, and black pepper until thoroughly combined.
Spoon the filling into the egg white halves.

Description: 
Kind of different than the usual deviled egg, so I renamed it. Creamy and easy to make. Delicious too!
