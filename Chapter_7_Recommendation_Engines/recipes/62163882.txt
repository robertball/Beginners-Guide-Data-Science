Ingredients:
1/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1 cup flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup milk
2 cups fresh blueberries OR frozen.  See note at bottom.
Crumble:
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup flour
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a bowl, beat together shortening, sugar and egg until creamy (using an electric mixer helps).  Beat in flour, baking powder, salt and milk until well blended and smooth.  Spread dough into a greased or parchment paper lined 9 inch square pan.  Spread blueberries overtop of dough.
In a small bowl, mix together all crumble ingredients with a fork until it resembles small crumbs.  Spread evenly over blueberries.
Baked in a preheated oven, 350 degrees F (180C) for 35 minutes.  Serve warm and eat within a day as the crumble topping with softening and turn mushy.
Side note:  If you use frozen berries, I prefer to thaw them and drain some of the moisture away.  Otherwise your crumble will be very wet.
