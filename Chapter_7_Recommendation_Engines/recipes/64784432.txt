2-3# boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes
2-3 TBL sesame oil
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1 tea dark soy sauce
2 TBL honey
3 TBL brown sugar
2 cloves garlic minced
2 tea grated fresh ginger
2 TBL rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
1/4 tea red pepper flakes
1 TBL tomato paste
2 TBL hoisin sauce
1 TBL cornstarch

Directions:
1. Turn Instant Pot to saute mode, high heat.   Add sesame oil. Saute onion, garlic and ginger for 1-2 minutes.
2.  Dust chicken with cornstarch and add to Instant Pot.  Stir and brown for 5 minutes.   Scrape the bottom of the pot to make sure nothing is stuck.
3.   Add all other ingredients except cornstarch and water.  Stir together.
4.  Switch to high pressure mode and set timer to 5 minutes.   Close the lid and allow to pressurize and cook.
5.  Wait until the natural release cycle is complete, remove lid and switch back to saute mode.    Remove chicken from Instant Pot and set aside.
6.  In small bowl, whisk the cornstarch and water together and pour over the sauce and stir.  Cook for about 2 minutes until the sauce thickens, then add chicken back to the Instant Pot.  Turn off Instant Pot and stir chicken into sauce.
7.  Garnish with sesame seeds and serve over rice.
