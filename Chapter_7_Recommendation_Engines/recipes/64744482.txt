Description: 
After looking around, I found a pair of great recipes here that I could merge and alter to suit my tastes for this dish. This takes Sonrisa'sThree Cheese Manicotti II recipe and combines it with Ashley's Slow Cooker Spaghetti Sauce, puts them together and adds a couple tweaks.
It's a two-stage process, but well worth the result.
