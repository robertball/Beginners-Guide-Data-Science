Description: 
This dip is really good. Whenever I have dinner parties I always make it for everyone and I make special ones for the kiddos. Subtract the spinach and cut the artichoke really small. I cook it in mini-tart pans and add an olive smile and chips for hair. It makes the kids happy.Modified from: Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II
