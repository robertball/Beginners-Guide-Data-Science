Ingredients:
2 pieces tilapia fillet
1 Tbsp good real mayonnaise
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 jar roasted artichokes packed in oil, drained (save liquid) & chopped
1 tsp capers
1 Tbsp parmesan cheese
Fresh lemon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.  Whisk the mayonnaise and Dijon together in a small bowl.  Place tilapia fillets in a casserole or baking dish with 2 Tbsp of artichoke liquid.  Divide Dijonnaise between each tilapia fillet.
Paint the Dijonnaise all over each fillet with the back of a spoon. Top fillets with artichokes and capers, scattering about whole dish. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over top.
Bake about 20 minutes until just cooked through.
Squeeze lemon over fillets and serve.

Description: 
You could use most any white fish fillet for this preparation.  The hint of Dijon complements the richness of the roasted artichokes, while the capers   add a taste of saltiness along with texture. The splash of lemon adds  just a bit to refresh.
