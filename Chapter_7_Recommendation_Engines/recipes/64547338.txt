Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken thighs
1 lb. butternut squash, cubed
1 15 oz. can diced tomatoes in juice
½ cup chicken stock
1 medium yellow onion sliced
4 crushed garlic cloves
2 tbsp. paprika
2 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp cracked black pepper
2 ½ tsp kosher or more
3-4 sprigs fresh marjoram or 1 tsp dried thyme
Corn Tortillas, lime wedges, sour cream, chopped cilantro

Directions:
Pre-heat your oven to 300degrees Fahrenheit.  Layer all ingredients except the tomato's in an enamel covered cast iron dutch oven.  Pour tomato's over the top of everything.  Cover and place into your preheated oven for 2 hours.  Remove the lid for the final 30 minutes of cooking.  Shred the chicken with 2 forks and don’t worry that most of the squash has melted into the sauce.  Serve with warm Corn tortillas and a side of rice, and garnish with lime, chopped cilantro & sour cream.
For the Crock Pot, simply cook everything on low heat for 6-7 hours.
