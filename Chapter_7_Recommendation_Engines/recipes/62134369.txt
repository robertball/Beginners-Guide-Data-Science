Ingredients:
2-3 lbs Korean Style Short Ribs
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cloves garlic, chopped
3 stalks green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons pure sesame oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
With a wire whisk, mix together soy sauce and sugar until dissolved.  Add pepper, garlic, green onions, sesame oil and sesame seeds.  Mix for a few minutes.
Add marinade to ribs and make sure the ribs are evenly coated.  Refrigerate for 1 hour.  Mix ribs again.  Refrigerate an additional hour.
Grill ribs on medium heat about 5 minutes per side.  Tip: Because of the sugar content, meat might have a tendency to flare up on the grill, so have a water bottle ready.
