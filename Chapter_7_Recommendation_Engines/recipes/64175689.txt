Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 onion
1 clove garlic
6 large potatoes
2 cans cream of chicken soup
1.5 c shredded mild cheddar cheese
2/3 c finely shredded Dubliner Irish cheese.
Salt and pepper to taste
Oil for frying
2 T olive oil
1 c panko bread crumbs
2 T butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Slice potatoes into medium rounds. Fry potato rounds until starting to turn brown. Remove from oil and place on paper towel lined plate. Set aside.
While potatoes are cooking, heat olive oil in frying pan. Chop onions and garlic and cook in olive oil until turning translucent. Add the ground beef and cook until no pink remains. Drain.
In a large bowl, combine beef mixture and cream of chicken soup. Add cheddar cheese and stir until combined. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Melt the butter in a separate bowl and combine with the panko bread crumbs and 1/3 of the Dubliner cheese.
Spray a 2 quart baking dish with cooking spray and spread half of the potatoes in the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle with 1/3 of the Dubliner cheese. Cover potatoes with half of the beef mixture and repeat with remaining potatoes and beef mixture. Top with panko mixture.
Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe I threw together one night and everyone loved it. Casseroles are usually so bland, but the Dubliner cheese really gives this casserole a big punch of flavor.
