Ingredients:
12 ounces large whole-wheat pasta shells
2 tablespoons slivered almonds, (1/2 ounce)
1 tablespoon curry powder, preferably Madras
1/2 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1/2 cup low-fat plain yogurt, or reduced-fat sour cream
1/3 cup mango chutney
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Pinch ground cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 cups cooked chicken, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped scallions, (4 scallions)
1/2 cup diced celery
Salt & freshly ground pepper to taste

Directions:
1. Cook pasta in a large pot of lightly salted water until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain and rinse. Set aside.
2. Toast almonds in a small dry skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Return the pan to the stovetop and add curry powder. Toast, stirring constantly, over low heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in mayonnaise, yogurt, chutney, turmeric, cinnamon and ground red pepper.
3. Combine chicken, raisins, scallions, celery and the reserved pasta in a large bowl. Add the dressing and toss to coat. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper and ground red pepper. Garnish with the toasted almonds.
Tips & Notes
* Tip: To poach chicken breasts: Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a medium skillet or saucepan and add lightly salted water to cover; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer gently until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes.
