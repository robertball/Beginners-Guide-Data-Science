Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in cream. Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead 10 times. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a 2-1/4-in. round biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.

Description: 
Since there is no shortening to cut in, these light, airy biscuits are quick and easy to make. Time the baking so that they're out of the oven when you sit down to eat. -Linda Murrow, Aurora, Colorado
