Ingredients:
2 red potatoes, diced
1 yellow onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup frozen corn
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
6 corn tortilla shells
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
lime wedges

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400.
In a bowl, drizzle 1 tablespoon oil and garlic powder over the chopped potatoes and mix. Lay out the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes or until cooked.
In a skillet, warm the remaining oil. Add the onions, red pepper, jalapeno, corn, salt and pepper. Cook on medium low until just slightly soft, about 10 minutes.
When the potatoes are done, warm up the taco shells on a griddle, flipping to warm evenly.
Once on a plate, fill the taco shells with potatoes and the corn and pepper mixture. Top with cilantro and green onions. Serve with a lime.

Description: 
Tacos were one of the first dishes for which I had to find a vegan alternative. Now, we make these potato tacos on a regular basis. Spice them up with some red pepper flakes or hot sauce. Add avocado if you want a flavor explosion.
