Ingredients:
1 box stuffing mix (such as Stovetop)
3 stalks of celery
1 white onion
1 cup walnuts
1/4 cup butter
1 large pinch garlic salt
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop celery and onion finely while melting the butter, garlic salt and pepper over medium heat.   Add celery and garlic, saute for five minutes or until onion begins to soften.  Add 3/4th of the walnuts, crushed.   Add water according to the directions on instant stuffing and bring to a boil.   Remove pot from heat, mix in stuffing, cover, and wait for five minutes.   You can serve at this point, if you chose.   However, you can also place in a casarole dish, and sprinkle the top with the remaining walnuts.   Place in a 350 F oven until you are ready to serve, or until the top of the stuffing begins to turn a golden brown.
