Ingredients:
2 cups of water
1 T ground cinnamon, or 1 cinnamon stick
1 round Mexican chocolate bar, Nestle or Abuelita brand
1/2 can evaporated milk
1/2 c sugar, or to taste
2 T cornstarch
1/2 cup cold water

Directions:
Place the 2 cups of water and cinnamon into a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil and let boil for about 7 minutes, on medium high heat.  If using cinnamon stick, remove at this time and discard.  Drop in the chocolate round and stir in boiling water until dissolved, about 5-6 minutes.  Let the mixture heat through, bringing temperature down to medium.  Heat for about 2 minutes.  Meanwhile, put cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl with lid and shake until mixed well.  Set aside.
To the chocolate mixture, add in sugar and evaporated milk.  Stir.  Heat for a few minutes.  Add in cornstarch/water and stir well.  Simmer for about 3 minutes, until slightly thickened.  Serve hot alone or you can top with whipped cream and dust some cinnamon over it.  Sugar can also be less or more, suited to taste.

Description: 
I loved this drink growing up.  It is very delicious and great on a cold chilly day.  My Mexican grandmother used to make this for us when I was a kid and now I make it for my kids.  Very delicious.
