Ingredients:
(depending on your chocolate chip preference) 8 to11 1/2 ounces of Milk Chocolate Chips
1 Cup Butter or Margarine(softened)
3/4 Cup of Sugar
3/4 Cup of Brown Sugar(packed)
2 Large Eggs
2 Teaspoons of Vanilla
2 1/4 Cups of Unsifted Flour
1 Teaspoon of Baking Soda
1/2 Teaspoon of Salt
1 Cup Nuts Walnuts, Pecans, etc(optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375*F
Stir flour with baking soda and salt; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with sugar and brown sugar until creamy and lightened in color(I use a metal fork you can use a mixer at medium speed as well). Add eggs and vanilla, one at a time. Mix until incorporated(I use a metal fork, but you can use a mixer at low speed). Gradually blend dry mixture into creamed mixture. Stir in nuts(optional) and chocolate chips. Mold into balls the size of a golf ball onto a ungreased cookie sheet(I put foil on the sheet it prevents the cookie's bottoms from getting burnt). Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. I got it online from the Ghirardelli site. The cookies are delicious. They are creamy with a good buttery flavor.
