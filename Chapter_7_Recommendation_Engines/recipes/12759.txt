Ingredients:
1 cup dark beer
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 pounds cod fillets, cubed
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
20 (6 inch) corn tortillas
5 cups shredded cabbage
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup salsa
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, whisk together beer, flour, and salt.
Rinse fish, and pat dry.  Cut into 10 equal pieces.
In a large saucepan, heat 1 inch oil to 360 degrees F (168 degrees C).  Using a fork, coat fish pieces in batter.  Slide coated fish into hot oil in batches; adjust heat to maintain oil temperature.  Fry until golden, about 2 minutes.  Lift out with a slotted spoon, and drain briefly on paper towels; keep warm.  Repeat to fry remaining fish.
Stack 2 tortillas.  Place a piece of fish and 1/2 cup cabbage in the center of the tortillas.  Garnish with mayonnaise, lime wedges and salsa

Beer battered, fried fish tacos served with all the fixings. The fish of choice is cod, but haddock is also a good bet.
