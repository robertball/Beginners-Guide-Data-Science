Ingredients:
.5 - 1 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic
1 bag frozen broccoli, steam-able
2 cups baby spinach
dried basil
dried marjoram
salt
pepper
1 cup nonfat cottage cheese
2 eggs
3/4 cup egg whites
3/4 cup nonfat evaporated milk
1 tbsp flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Spray 9-inch pie plate (or similar) with nonstick spray.
Use nonstick spray on a sautee pan and cook onion and garlic for a few minutes.
Meanwhile, steam the broccoli.
Add the spinach.
Once spinach is wilted, add the broccoli, basil, marjoram, salt, and pepper to taste.
Put them in the pie plate.
Cover with 1 cup nonfat cottage cheese.
Beat eggs, egg whites, nonfat evaporated milk, and flour together and pour over vegetables and cottage cheese.
Bake for about an hour. It is hard to tell when it's done, but the middle shouldn't be too soft. The top might crack and it might rise a little. It will fall when it cools down.
