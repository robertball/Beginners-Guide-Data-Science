Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
8 ounces andouille sausage, sliced
8 ounces smoked ham, cubed
1 onion, chopped
2 1/2 cups water
1 (8 ounce) packages jambalaya mix (such as Zatarain's速)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL速), drained
1 cup frozen peas

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, ham, and onion in hot oil until the meat and onion is browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour water, jambalaya mix, and diced tomatoes with green chile peppers into the pot; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer until the water is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender, about 25 minutes. Add the frozen peas, stir, and let stand about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.
