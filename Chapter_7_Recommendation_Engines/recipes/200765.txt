Ingredients:
6 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 (16 ounce) jar sliced jalapeno peppers, with liquid
2 onions, thinly sliced
1 cup vinegar

Directions:
Place the carrots in a saucepan with enough water to cover and cook over medium heat until nearly boiling, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately drain the carrots and set aside to cool.
Divide the cooled carrots into two 1-quart glass jars. Alternate layers of onion and jalapeno peppers atop the carrots until the jars are full.
Mix the liquid from the jalapeno peppers and the vinegar in a saucepan; bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Remove from heat and pour the liquid into the jars until full. Seal the jars with lids. Place the jars in the refrigerator until cold, at least 8 hours.

Description: 
I'm from Southern California. You can not find a restaurant that does not have these hot carrots. Being on the East Coast now, I have had to come up with my own version to duplicate the hot carrots of home.
