Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 cake mix (any flavor)
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
Tray or cardboard (18x14 inches), covered with paper or foil
2 (16 ounce) containers Betty Crocker速 Rich & Creamy vanilla frosting
Green gel food color
Assorted yellow round candies (candy-coated chocolate candies, candy coating wafers, chewy round candies)
Chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease 2 (8- or 9-inch) round cake pans with shortening or cooking spray. Make and bake cake mix as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pans to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
Cut 1 cake in half lengthwise, making 2 half-circles. Sculpt 1 half-circle into a head and the other half-circle into a tail (see diagram). For body, cut 1-inch slice from edge of remaining whole cake. From cut edge, cut out a small inverted U-shaped piece. Place body on tray; arrange head and tail pieces next to body.
Spoon frosting into large bowl. Stir in enough food color until desired green color. To 'crumb-coat' cake, spread thin layer of frosting over cake pieces to seal in crumbs. Freeze cake 30 to 60 minutes.
Frost cake pieces with remaining frosting. Decorate with yellow candies. Add chocolate chips for eyes.
