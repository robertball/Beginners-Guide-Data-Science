Ingredients:
1- 6 oz box Uncle Ben's Brown Rice & Quinoa Roasted Red Pepper flavored grains (or 3 cups cooked, leftover rice)
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup grated fresh mozzarella
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 large eggs
1-2 cups bread crumbs
salt
4 cups oil
1 cup jarred or home made marinara sauce

Directions:
Cook rice according to package directions. Allow to cool, in the pot, until comfortable to handle.
Add in Parmesan cheese, black pepper, mozzarella, garlic powder and one egg. Mix all ingredients together until well blended.
Place flour in a small bowl and set aside
Place two remaining eggs in a bowl, beat until creamy and set aside
Place bread crumbs in a bowl and set aside.
Divide rice mixture into 24 equal portions about the size of a golf ball. Roll each portion into a ball and coat with flour.  Place on cookie sheet. (Mix will be sticky)
Dip each rice ball in the egg wash and then dredge in bread crumbs.  Set rice balls on the cookie sheet.
Refrigerate 15 minutes.
Give each rice ball another quick roll in your hands to tighten up and smooth out the surface.
Heat oil to 375 in a large sauce pan.
Add 4 balls at a time to the hot oil.  Gently stir with spoon.  Cook for approximately 2-3 minutes and rice balls are golden brown.
Place cooked rice balls on a paper lined cookie sheet and lightly salt.
Serve hot with marinara sauce.
