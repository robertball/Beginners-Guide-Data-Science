4  eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
Â¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup peanut butter
8 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet chocolate

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 11x 7 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, combine eggs and sugar.  Mix until light. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir this into the egg mixture until well blended. Pour into prepared pan, spread evenly, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.
While still warm from the oven, spread the peanut butter over the top of the bars. Then cool in the refrigerator.
Melt the chocolate candy bar in the microwave or over a double boiler. Spread the melted chocolate over the cooled peanut butter layer and refrigerate again until chocolate is set. Cut into squares.
