Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/4 onion, sliced
1/2 cup Korean soju

Directions:
Heat the olive oil and butter in a skillet over high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, then place in the skillet in the hot oil; cook until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove pork chops from the skillet, and set aside. Add the sliced onion to the skillet; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and soju, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer until liquid as reduced, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and drizzle the sauce over the pork chops for serving.
