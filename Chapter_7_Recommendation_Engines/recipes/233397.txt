Ingredients:
Dressing:
1 1/4 cups mayonnaise, or more if needed
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons ketchup
1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 lemon, juiced
1/3 cup chopped fresh dill
Salad:
1 (12 ounce) package small pasta shells
1 pound cooked, peeled, and deveined small shrimp - cut in half
1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper
3/4 cup diced celery
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch paprika, for garnish
3 sprigs fresh dill, or as desired

Directions:
Whisk 1 1/4 cup mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; add lemon juice and 1/3 cup chopped dill. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate.
Bring a pot of well-salted water to a boil and stir in pasta shells; cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water to cool pasta slightly; drain again. Transfer to a large bowl.
Toss shrimp with pasta; add red bell pepper, celery, and dressing to pasta and shrimp. Mix thoroughly to coat and fill shells with dressing. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 3 hours.
Stir salad again before serving and season to taste with more salt, black pepper, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper if desired. If salad seems a little dry, mix in a little more mayonnaise. Garnish with paprika and sprigs of dill.

Description: 
When I want to make a macaroni salad just a little bit extra-special, nothing does the trick like some small, sweet shrimp. This is one of my favorite summer salads, and it's oh-so-easy.
