Ingredients:
2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 green apples - peeled, cored, and cut into thick slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt to taste
6 cups chicken broth
1 russet potato, cut into 8 pieces
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Spread parsnips and apples out onto prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the top and sprinkle with kosher salt. Toss to coat.
Roast in preheated oven until parsnips and apples are tender and caramelized around the edges, about 30 minutes.
Stir apple-parsnip mixture, chicken broth, and potato together in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
Puree apple mixture with an immersion blender until soup is smooth. Stir cream into soup and season with cayenne pepper and salt; cook until heated through, 2 to 5 minutes.
