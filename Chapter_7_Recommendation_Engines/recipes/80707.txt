Ingredients:
1 large head cabbage, cored and shredded
3/4 cup white sugar, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1 teaspoon celery seed
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the shredded cabbage into a large glass baking dish or other glass dish. Do not use metal or plastic. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of white sugar and the salt.
In a separate microwave safe bowl, combine the remaining sugar, oil, vinegar, mustard, celery seed and pepper. Stir to blend in the sugar, then heat until boiling in the microwave, about 3 minutes. Immediately, but carefully pour the boiling mixture over the cabbage. Toss with a wooden or plastic utensil to evenly coat the cabbage.
Let stand out on the counter for several hours, stirring occasionally. Cover and refrigerate. Toss before serving, and serve with a slotted spoon.

Description: 
Wonderful slaw recipe passed down from my Grandmother's cook, Vernell.  It's similar to a sweet and sour cabbage recipe, and will keep for 2 weeks in the refrigerator.  Great served with beef brisket. Best made a day or more before serving.
