2 large tomatoes, cut into wedges
6 oz crumbled blue cheese
1 small red onion, thinly sliced into rings

Description: 
This recipe is my gift to you, and makes a gift for your hostess.  By far, this is my most requested salad recipe.  I think the blue cheese and pepper flavors make this a great accompanyment to beef, but my friends tell me it tastes terrific with anything!
