Ingredients:
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 cup white wine
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti
1 pound clams
2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1 pound shrimp
1 pound scallops
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Mix in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, sugar, salt, oregano, red pepper, and bay leaf. Simmer uncovered 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place spaghetti in the pot, cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Place the clams in a pot fitted with a steamer basket over boiling water, and steam until opened. Discard clams that do not open. Stir into the sauce.
Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the shrimp and scallops 2 minutes, or until opaque. Mix in garlic. Stir into the sauce. Serve sauce with seafood over the cooked spaghetti, and top with Parmesan cheese.

Seafood combined with a savory red sauce over pasta will tease your senses! I serve mine with fresh garlic bread and a green garden salad. YUM!
