Description: 
This recipe came from a military wife almost 30 years ago (thanks Elise) and it couldn't be much easier. Simply combine all ingredients and cook for 3 hours, then shred the meat. Serve it on buns of your choice...and then sit back and take in the compliments! Everyone loves this recipe, and I've used it at fund raising events with great success! Excellent with potato salad or coleslaw.
