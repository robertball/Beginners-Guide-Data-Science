1/2 pound curly kale (about one small bunch, or half of a larger bunch)
1 pound Brussels sprouts sliced thin with stems removed
1/2 pound green Napa cabbage (about half a medium head or a quarter of a large one)
3 green onions sliced thin

1 to 2 small cans mandarin oranges sliced in half
Strawberries (optional)
¾ cup toasted pepitas
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper
1 bottle Poppy seed dressing (Marie Callendars)
3 tbsp. orange juice concentrate

Directions:
Mist the pumpkin seeds with a light spray of Olive oil and then toss with the salt, pepper, and cayenne (if you’re using).
Toast lightly on medium low heat.
Remove and allow the pepitas to cool.
Chop and assemble the salad:
Chop all of your ingredients and place them in a large salad bowl along with the pepitas, green onions, mandarin oranges, cranraisins, and optional strawberries.
Combine the dressing and orange juice until blended.
Pour the dressing over the salad and toss really well to combine.
Taste and adjust to your liking.
Eat immediately after adding the dressing.

Description: 
Hale and hearty, this kale salad is a powerhouse of nutrients that is very easy to eat! The salad bursts with the flavor of mandarin oranges, sweet and tart strawberries and has a pleasant poppy seed dressing. When mangoes are in season, you can substitute them for the mandarin oranges or walnuts, pomegranates  and apples in the fall for different flavors.  The possibilities are endless!
