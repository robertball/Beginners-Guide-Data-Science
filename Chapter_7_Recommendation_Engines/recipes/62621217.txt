Thai Sweet Chili Sauce Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tbsp chili garlic sauce
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup water
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp water

Directions:
Boil first three ingredients together.
Combine the cornstarch and the water to make a slurry. Whisk it into the boiling mixture, and continue to simmer for another minute. The cornstarch will help thicken the sauce slightly, causing a nice suspension of garlic-pepper bits.
Let cool completely before storing in a glass jar and refrigerate.
If you want to make a large batch of this (5-6 times this recipe), the best thickener to use is Clearjel (a pre-gelatinized starch).
