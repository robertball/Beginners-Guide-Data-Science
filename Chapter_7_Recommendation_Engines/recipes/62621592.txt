Ingredients:
Pudding Mixture:
12 slices white sandwich bread, cubed (staled overnight in a covered bowl, preferably)
4 eggs
1 stick unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1/2 c granulated sugar
1/2 c light brown sugar
1/2 c milk
1 (15 oz.) can pumpkin puree
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
2 Tb real maple syrup, optional
Crumb Topping:
1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 c flour
3/4 c light brown sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 c chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a casserole dish or 11x7 pyrex dish. Combine all ingredients for pudding mixture except for the bread with whisk. Fold in bread with spatula, a little at a time until mixture is absorbed but moist, not soupy or dry. You may not need all the bread.
Pour into casserole dish or pan. Prepare crumb mixture in a small bowl. Crumb together flour, light brown sugar, butter and cinnamon with fingers. Add nuts once combined. Sprinkle over bread pudding.
Bake in oven 1 hour, putting foil over the top if crumb topping begins to brown too quickly.
