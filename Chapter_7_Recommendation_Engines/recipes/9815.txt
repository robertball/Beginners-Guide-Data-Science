Description: 
A friend gave me this recipe several months ago.  I have tried several variations including using a carrot cake mix with white chocolate chips and chocolate cake mix with butterscotch   chips - the variety is endless! Note: I haven't had a great deal of   success in storing these cookies more than one or two days.  They seem to toughen up rather quickly.
