Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs, with skin (either bone-in or boneless is fine)
6 thyme sprigs
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper

Directions:
Place the oven rack in the middle to upper third of the oven and preheat to 475Â°F.
If necessary, rinse chicken thighs with cool water and pat dry with clean paper towels.
Place the chicken thighs on paper towels, skin side down.
Season (meat side up) with salt and pepper.
Heat the skillet over medium heat.
Add the vegetable oil to the skillet and swirl around to coat the sides and bottom of the pan.
Once the oil is hot, carefully place the chicken thighs, skin side down, into the skillet. (BE CAREFUL OF OIL SPLATTER.)
Place the sprigs of thyme on top of the chicken thighs.
Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and roast (uncovered) for 8 minutes, until the skin is golden brown.
Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and flip the chicken thighs skin side up.
Return the skillet to the oven and continue roasting for 5 minutes.
Serve 1-2 thighs alongside your favorite side dishes and enjoy!
