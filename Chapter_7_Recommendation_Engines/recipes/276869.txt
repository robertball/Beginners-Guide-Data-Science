Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
3 medium skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
2 large green bell peppers, diced
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/4 cup red wine
1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
25 slices fresh mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned on each side, 5 to 7 minutes total. Remove from the skillet and arrange on the bottom of a 9x13-inch clear glass baking dish. Place mushrooms on top and set aside.
Place bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the same skillet and cook over medium heat until onions are translucent, adding more oil if necessary, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, wine, brown sugar, basil, and oregano. Reduce heat and let simmer for at least 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over chicken and mushrooms.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and arrange mozzarella slices on top. Continue to bake until bubbly, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
When I learned that I was gluten intolerant, I had to adjust many of my recipes to meet my own dietary needs. With a few changes to my mother's original baked chicken cacciatore recipe, I was able to enjoy this childhood favorite food. Serve with pasta or polenta.
