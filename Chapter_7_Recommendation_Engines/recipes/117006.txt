Ingredients:
6 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
1 (4.5 ounce) jar sliced mushrooms, drained
1/2 cup sherry or chicken broth
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Place the chicken in a 5-qt. slow cooker. In a small bowl, combine the soup, mushrooms, sherry or broth, butter, tarragon, Worcestershire sauce and garlic powder; pour over chicken. Cover and cook on low for 4-5 hours or until chicken juices run clear.
Remove chicken and keep warm. Place the flour in a small saucepan; gradually whisk in cooking liquid until blended. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve over chicken.

Description: 
Round out this saucy seasoned chicken with some rice or pasta, suggests Mary Kretschmer. 'I often make this dish when my children and grandchildren visit,' she pens from Miami, Florida. 'Using the slow cooker leaves me more time to enjoy their company.'
