Description: 
I love chocolate brownies! These brownies are not only dark, rich, and delicious, but they are also gluten-free, dairy-free and healthier for you, using coconut flour and coconut oil. I can't decide whether I like these better warm out of the oven, or cooled the next day.  Both ways are so indulgent!
