Ingredients:
One Butternut Squash
Two Italian Sausages
One Small Onion, minced
¼ Cup Fresh Basil, chopped
¼ Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
1-2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1/3 Cup Chopped Walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Cut the Butternut squash in half and de-seed it with a spoon, then bake face-up on a foil-lined cookie sheet for 45 minutes.
While the squash is baking, chop two Italian sausages into one-inch chunks and sauté them in olive oil until they are golden-brown. Then, mince and add an onion to the sauté and cook for five minutes.
Place the sauté mixture in a mixing bowl. Add the chopped basil, Parmesan cheese, walnuts (if using), and mix everything together.
Once the squash is done, carefully scoop the flesh out and add it to the mixing bowl.
Mash everything together with a masher, and then mound it into the empty squash shells
Bake for 20 minutes (in a baking dish), and carefully cut the squash into horizontal slices. Serve immediately!
