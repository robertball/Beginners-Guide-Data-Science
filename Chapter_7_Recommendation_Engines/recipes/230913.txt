Ingredients:
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon paprika
2 (4 ounce) smoked sausages, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup 10% cream
1/2 cup water or reduced sodium chicken broth or stock
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (12 ounce) package fresh linguine pasta
1 green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a bowl, toss shrimp and paprika together to coat; set aside.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Panfry sausage slices, for about 4 min or until golden brown; transfer to a plate.
Wipe out skillet with paper towel. Whisk flour into cream and add water.
Return skillet to medium-high heat and add cream mixture along with the garlic, thyme and cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil and add shrimp; simmer for about 4 min until shrimp are pink and firm. Return sausage to skillet and warm through.
Meanwhile, in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook linguine for about 3 min or until tender but firm. Drain well and add to skillet. Cook, stirring on low heat for about 2 min or until sauce coats pasta well.
Serve in shallow soup bowls and sprinkle with green onion.

Description: 
Spicy Cajun flavours kick up this easy sauce, and cream adds smoothness to the heat of the dish. Look for smoked sausages where they sell bacon and other deli meats in the grocery store.
