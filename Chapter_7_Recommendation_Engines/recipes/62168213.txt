Ingredients:
•	3 cups sugar
•	1 cup oil
•	2/3 cup orange juice
•	4 eggs
•	2 cups pumpkin, mashed
•	3 1/2 cups flour
•	2 teaspoons baking soda
•	1 teaspoon salt
•	1 teaspoon cinnamon
•	1 teaspoon nutmeg
•	1/2 teaspoon clove
•	1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Brown sugar Topping
•	1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
•	1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
•	2 tablespoons flour
•	2 tablespoons butter, softened
Caramel icing
•	1/4 cup butter
•	1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
•	2 tablespoons milk
•	1/4 teaspoon vanilla
•	1 dash salt
•	3/4 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a bowl combine sugar, oil, orange juice, eggs and pumpkin. Using a hand mixer beat on low for one minute.
Add dry ingredients and mix on low for one minutes or until moistened.
Spray and flour two 9x5 loaf pans.
Divide mixture between the two pans.
Brown sugar topping:
In a small bowl with a fork blend all ingredients until crumbly.
Sprinkle over the top of the pumpkin mixture and bake for 60 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean.
Caramel Icing:
In a small sauce pan melt the butter, brown sugar and milk. Cook for one minute until everything is melted and mixture starts a slight boil.
Remove from the heat and add remaining ingredients and beat on low until all items are combined.
Cool slightly.
Using a plastic storage bag with the corner cut off or a cake decorating bag drizzle caramel icing across the top of the pumpkin bread.

Description: 
I recently made this. It is super yummy and easily halved to make one loaf (which is what I did). I used a small can of pumpkin and the loaf was really dense and moist. I didn't have nutmeg so I left it out and it turned out fine. I also forgot the crumb topping and it was still faublous.
