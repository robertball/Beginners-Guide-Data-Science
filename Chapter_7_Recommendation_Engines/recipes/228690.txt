Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package linguine-style stir-fry rice noodles (rice stick noodles), about 8 inches long*
1 (9 ounce) pouch Progresso™ Recipe Starters™ creamy Parmesan basil cooking sauce
1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 (14 ounce) package uncooked chicken breast pieces for stir-fry
Garnishes, if desired:
2 tablespoons chopped dry roasted peanuts
Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
Lime wedges (optional)

Directions:
In 3-quart saucepan, heat 4 cups water to boiling. Remove from heat; add noodles (push noodles into water with back of spoon to cover completely with water if necessary). Soak noodles 3 to 5 minutes or until noodles are soft but firm. Drain noodles; rinse with cold water. Set aside.
Meanwhile, in medium bowl, beat cooking sauce, peanut butter, lime juice and soy sauce with whisk until smooth; set aside.
In 10-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook and stir 4 to 5 minutes or until no longer pink in center. Add sauce mixture; heat to boiling, stirring frequently. Stir in noodles until thoroughly mixed. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, tossing with 2 wooden spoons, until heated through. Sprinkle with peanuts and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
