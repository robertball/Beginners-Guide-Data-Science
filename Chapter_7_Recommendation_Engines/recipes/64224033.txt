Ingredients:
2 cup packed brown sugar
2 cup white sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cup butter, softened
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cup flaked coconut
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
4 cups rolled oats
1 bag  (approx 12 oz) dark or semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium mixing bowl cream butter and sugars.  Add eggs and vanilla until blended. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients, keeping the coconut separate until all other dry ingredients are blended.
Add coconut.
Combine the wet and dry ingredients until moist.
Use large scoop (3 TBSP size) and scoop onto greased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 12 minutes or until golden. Remove from oven immediately - even if they don't look done, they are done. Do not overcook.
