Ingredients:
1 large cucumber, peeled and cut into chunks
2 small cucumbers, peeled leaving stripes of skin and sliced
1 large heirloom tomato, seeded and diced
1/3 small onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup champagne vinegar
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons agave nectar, or more to taste
1 pinch sea salt, or to taste
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the cucumber chunks and slices in a large bowl with the tomato and onion. Whisk together the champagne vinegar, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, agave nectar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until frothy. Pour dressing over the vegetables. Gently toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This recipe may be simple but its flavor is big and juicy. I think it would be fabulous alongside spicy Asian curries, quick stir-fries, herb-roasted dinners -- and yes, it would be perfect for picnics. This is a delicious make-ahead picnic salad. Make more than you think you'll need, because you just might want some for breakfast.
