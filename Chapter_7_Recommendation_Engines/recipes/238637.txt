Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large jicama, peeled and diced
1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 cup diced pineapple
3/4 cup golden raisins
3/4 cup diced sweet onion
2 limes, zested and juiced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 jalapeno pepper, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Stir 1/4 teaspoon salt into the water and return water to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and cook until the moisture is absorbed completely, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let pan sit covered for 5 minutes more.
Spread quinoa in a thin later on a platter and refrigerate to cool completely, at least 15 minutes.
Mix jicama, coconut, pineapple, raisins, sweet onion, lime zest, lime juice, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper together in a large bowl; add cooled quinoa and toss. Season salad with salt and black pepper.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until salad is completely chilled, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I threw this together one afternoon after having purchased a jicama and some limes. It turned out to be a nice, fresh, and unexpectedly tasty healthy salad! I knew that jicama is often prepared with lime, but throw in the coconut and pineapple; delicious!
