Ingredients:
2 pcs eggplants
300 grams soy sauce marinated chicken (please watch my previous video for the recipe)

1 tsp sugar
1 Tbsp sesame oil
5 pcs Shiso leaves, sliced thinly

Directions:
Take out the marinated chicken from the fridge about 20 minutes before starting to cook.
Slice the eggplant along its length. Slice vertically with 1 cm width. Soak it in water with salt.
Slice the chicken into bite-size pieces then spread and mix the cornstarch.
Take out the seeds from the umeboshi then mash lightly. Mix it with sesame oil and sugar.
Drain the eggplants then put it on a microwave-safe plate. Place the chicken on top then the umeboshi mixture.
Wrap the bowl with a cling wrap or cover it with a lid. Microwave for 8 minutes using 600W.
Mix then put in a serving plate. Garnish it with the shiso leaves then enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe makes use of my recipe for the chicken marinated in soy sauce. This is very simple. The sour taste of the dish comes from umeboshi or pickled plum.
