Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins or choc. chips
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (white wheat)
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
2 eggs
1 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup oil (1/4  coconut oil and 1/4  apple sauce)
1/4-1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12 cup muffin pan, or line with paper liners.  Place the raisins in a cup, and add enough hot water to cover.  Let stand for a few minutes to plump.
In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Make a well in the center, and put in eggs, pumpkin, oil and honey.  Mix just until the dry ingredients are absorbed.  Drain excess water from raisins, and stir in along with the walnuts.  Spoon into muffin cups so they are about 2/3 full.
Bake for 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the tops spring back when lightly touched.  Cool in the pan before removing from cups.
