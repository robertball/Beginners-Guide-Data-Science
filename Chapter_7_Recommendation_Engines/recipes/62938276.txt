Ingredients:
1 cup diced sweet onion
1 cup diced celery
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 ½ sticks (3/4 cup) of unsalted butter
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
¾ cup flour
1 pint light cream
½ gallon milk
1 ½ cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon chicken base
¼ cup cooking sherry
1 tablespoon Old Bay
1 cup diced potatoes
12 ounces of jumbo lump crab meat
12 ounces chopped clams
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In a large saucepot (at least 6 quarts) combine the onion, celery, garlic, butter, salt and pepper.  Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, or until onion becomes translucent.  Whisk in the flour, and continue whisking and cooking the mixture for an additional 5 minutes to make a rue.
Slowly whisk in the light cream, continue mixing until it the rue is well incorporated.  Continue to whisk the mixture over medium heat for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until it becomes thick.  Add the milk, chicken broth, chicken base, and sherry, and stir until well incorporated.  If need be, add more milk to get to desired consistency.
Reduce heat to medium low.  Stir in the Old Bay, crab meat, clams, and parsley.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally for an hour.
You may need to adjust the seasoning prior to serving, depending on your taste, by adding more Old Bay, sherry, salt or pepper.
