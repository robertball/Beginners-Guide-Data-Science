Ingredients:
1 lb red lentils
2 Tb extra virgin olive oil
1 medium sweet onion- small dice
2 cups small diced celery
1 cup peeled carrots- small dice
5 cloves garlic- minced
3 Qts water
2 tsp minced fresh or 1/2 tsp dried sage
1 tsp minced fresh or 1/4 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt or to taste
Fresh shaved parmesan (optional)
Fresh arugula (optional)

Directions:
In a large stock pot, heat pot on a high flame.  When sufficiently hot, add olive oil and quickly add onions, celery, and carrots.  Saute, stirring frequently until well browned on all sides (about 10 minutes.)
Add minced garlic and cook an additional minute more until garlic is golden or soft.
Reduce heat and add water and lentils and bring to a low boil. Add pepper and herbs, and simmer for 40 minutes until lentils are disintegrated. Add salt (adding this too soon affects how quickly the lentils cook and can lengthen the cooking time substantially). Keep a wooden spoon handy to keep scraping the bottom of the pot at this point, but cook for an additional 10 to 20 minutes at a low boil until thick.
Serve immediately with a garnish of fresh shaved parmesan and arugula leaves.

Description: 
My family eats bowl after bowl of this with a loaf of good Italian bread, while the salad is left untouched. Top it with some shaved parmesan and fresh arugula or have it plain. A warm Autumn and Winter soup, it is as healthy as it is delicious!
