Ingredients:
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1/4 cup shredded carrots
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 tablespoon chipotle pepper flakes
2 cups baby kale, shredded

Directions:
Combine balsamic vinegar, olive oil, lime juice, and soy sauce in a small bowl. Add cherry tomatoes and carrots. Cover and set aside, letting tomatoes and carrots absorb the dressing for at least 15 minutes.
Heat a skillet over high heat. Add canola oil, pine nuts, and chipotle pepper flakes. Cook until pine nuts are crispy and covered with flakes, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Place kale in a serving bowl. Top with tomato-dressing mixture. Sprinkle toasted pine nuts and chipotle flakes on top.
