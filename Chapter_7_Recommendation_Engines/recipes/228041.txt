Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound skinless steelhead trout fillets
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Arrange trout fillets in the baking dish. Mix white wine, Dijon mustard, garlic, lemon juice, dill, and lemon-pepper seasoning in a bowl; spread over the fillets, letting some run underneath the fish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque and flakes easily, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is really yummy - not overpoweringly mustardy! And, after all, any recipe that begins with white wine has to be good! It's not oily or buttery or anything. I've made it with salmon, and it's equally tasty.
