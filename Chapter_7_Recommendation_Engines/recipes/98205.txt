Description: 
Years ago a friend gave me her black-eyed pea recipe that was not your usual black-eyed peas. She called them Cottoneyed Peas. It was a spicy and warm welcome into the New Year. I now get requests for it all the time. You can make it as spicy as you like or, if you don't like spicy, use the peas without jalapeno.
