Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus spears
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs, or more as needed
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, or more to taste
2 teaspoons garlic powder, or more to taste
2 eggs
4 tilapia fillets

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Snap asparagus spears to remove tough ends. Place asparagus on a plate and drizzle olive oil over asparagus; season with salt and pepper.
Mix bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, and garlic powder together in a shallow dish. Whisk eggs together in a separate shallow dish. Dip each fillet in egg, then dredge in breadcrumb mixture.
Cook fillets on grill until golden brown, about 10 minutes per side.
Cook asparagus on opposite side of grill, turning occasionally, until browned and tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes.
