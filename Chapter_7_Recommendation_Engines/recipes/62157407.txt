Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
8 cloves garlic, minced
3 medium sized carrots, cut in slices
2 medium white onions, cut in slices
6 celery ribs, cut in slices
8 chicken bullion cubes
10 cups water
2 pounds dried split peas
1 tablespoon italian seasoning
1 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil.  Add lemon juice, garlic, carrots, onions and celery.  Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, or until the carrots become tender enough to break apart with a fork. Pour the mixture into a bowl and put in the fridge to cool down.  While cooling the mixture, add the water and bullion cubes to the pot.  You could also just use chicken stock instead, but this is the economy version.  Heat the water and stir occasionally to dissolve the bullion.
After about 5 minutes of cooling the vegetables, pour them into a large blender.  Pulse and blend the mixture until it is a puree.  If you have trouble blending the mixture, add a bit of water.  Pour the blended vegetables into the chicken broth.
Bring the mixture up to a boil and then add in the split peas.  Also add in the herbs and seasonings.  Stir occassionally and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the peas reach a desired consistancy.

Description: 
We set out to make some split pea soup and thought the flavor would be improved by adding some curry to it.  It's wonderful on its own or over rice.
