Ingredients:
12 lasagna noodles, or as needed
2 cups shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste
1 (14 ounce) can artichokes in water, drained
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided, or to taste
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons dried basil, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl.
Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture, top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
