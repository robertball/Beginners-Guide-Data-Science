Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed (Thighs worked really well)
2 teaspoons salt (Omitted)
1 onion, chopped (Used more)
2 cloves garlic, chopped (Lots more)
2 carrots, sliced (Used 4 carrots)
2 stalks celery, sliced (Omitted and replaced with 2 potatoes suggest more next time)
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon paprika
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup crushed tomatoes (1 can chopped)
1 cup canned chickpeas, drained
1 zucchini, sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and brown in a large saucepan over medium heat until almost cooked through. Remove chicken from pan and set aside (left chicken in the whole time).
Saute onion, garlic, carrots and celery in same pan. When tender, stir in ginger, paprika, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper and turmeric; stir fry for about 1 minute, then mix in broth and tomatoes. Return chicken to pan, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Add chickpeas and zucchini to pan and bring to simmering once again; cover pan and cook for about 15 minutes, or until zucchini is cooked through and tender. Stir in lemon juice and serve.
