Ingredients:
3 pound pork shoulder (butt portion) roast
Sea salt
Pepper, freshly ground
2 Tbsp olive oil
4 cloves garlic, peeled, crushed with a heavy knife handle and chopped
1 medium yellow or white onion, peeled and sliced into thin rings then halve the rings
2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth
2 tsp liquid smoke, slightly overflowing tsp measures

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325°F. Season the meat with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 4 Qt pot over high heat and sear the meat on all sides till nicely browned. Remove the meat and set aside. Allow the pot to cool down and then sauté the onions and garlic over low heat in the same pot till the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the broth and heat while scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the liquid smoke and top it with the seared roast. Place a lid on top and bake in a preheated 325°F oven for 3 – 4 hours. DO NOT open the oven door during the first 3 hours of roasting time.
Remove meat to a plate, cover it with a foil tent and allow it to rest for 15 minutes. Shred it with a couple of forks into fine shreds. Then return the meat to the broth in the cooker, stir well and use immediately or let it cool to room temperature. Transfer to freezer proof containers and freeze for future use or use immediately for making green chili or carnitas.
Freezing the meat in broth allows the meat to remain tender and moist while in the frozen state, defrosting and reheating. This is an important note to adhere with freezing fresh fish as well, but use water instead of broth.
