Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths
2 carrots, cut into thick strips
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, sliced
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper

Directions:
Place green beans and carrots in 1 inch of boiling water. Cover, and cook until tender but still firm. Drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onions and mushrooms until almost tender. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 3 minutes. Stir in green beans, carrots, salt, seasoned salt, garlic salt, and white pepper. Cover, and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat.
Very good base recipe. Changes I made: -Cooked mushrooms in olive oil and minced garlic until slightly tender -Steam the green beans and carrots to firmness of liking. -Added onions to green beans and carrots to steam for 2-3 minutes to firmness of liking. -Stir veggie mixture with mushrooms, add 2 dashes of seasoning salt, garlic salt, rosemary, and thyme -Cook 1-2 additional minutes to warm if necessary Key is to keep an eye on the steamed veggies.
