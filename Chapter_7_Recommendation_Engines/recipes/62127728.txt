Ingredients:
1 TB butter, plus 2 TB melted
1 pound imitation crab meat chopped
1 onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
1/2 cup grated Parmesan
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 fresh artichokes, trimmed and cleaned
1 cup white wine
1 cup water
Juice from 2 lemons

Directions:
In a large, heavy skillet heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently until the onions are golden. Transfer the onions and garlic to a medium bowl and let the mixture cool slightly. Add the imitation crab meat, Parmesan, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.
Gently pull apart the leaves of the trimmed artichokes to slightly widen the spaces between the leaves. Stuff the Krab mixture in the spaces between the artichoke leaves. Place the artichokes in a heavy, high-sided pan so they fit snugly enough to stay upright. Pour the wine, water, and lemon juice into the bottom of the pan. Pour the melted butter over the top of the artichokes. Place the pan over medium-high heat. Cover the pan and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes, until the artichokes are tender. Remove from the pot and serve immediately.

Description: 
No dipping sauce required here.  You use the artichoke leaf as a spoon and the stuffing as the dip for the artichoke.  You can basically stuff the artichokes with anything that will steam well.  Seafood works great.
