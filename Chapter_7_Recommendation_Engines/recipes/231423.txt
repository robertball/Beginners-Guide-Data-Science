Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) deep dish prepared pie crust
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
2 cups finely chopped broccoli
4 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place pie crust into a 9-inch deep pie dish and prick crust all over with a fork; brush with oil. Place crust onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.
Place broccoli into a bowl and microwave on high until broccoli is bright green and slightly tender, about 4 minutes. Whisk eggs, milk, Dijon mustard, oregano, salt, pepper, and thyme in a bowl; stir broccoli into egg mixture. Pour mixture into crust and sprinkle quiche with Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. Place pie dish on the baking sheet.
Bake until a knife inserted into the middle of the quiche comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting.
