When crust has cooled, spread the cream cheese layer over crust and return cheesecake to the refrigerator.
Dump 2 small boxes of instant lemon pudding  mix into mixing bowl and instead of adding the 4 cups of milk the directions call for, add 3 cups of milk for a much firmer pudding.
Follow insructions for making pudding.
Carefully spread thickened lemon pudding over cheesecake layer.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Top with remaining Cool Whip or whipped cream.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
A sinfully delicious cheesecake on a toasted pecan crust. A wonderful cheesecake layer topped with a luscious lemon layer and finished off with a layer of whipped cream. This is what I call one of my Impressers When you really want to make a great impression, this is the one to go to. If you are in the mood, swap the lemon pudding for Chocolate pudding. Chocolate Cheesecake, yummy!
