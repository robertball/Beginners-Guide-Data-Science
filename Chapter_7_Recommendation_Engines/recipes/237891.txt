Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, finely shredded
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons lime juice
1/3 cup minced fresh chives
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
2 pinches salt, or more to taste
1 1/3 cups chopped hazelnuts
2 ounces crumbled blue cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Remove about 1/4 the Brussels sprouts and thinly cut cross-wise with a knife; add back to the remaining shredded Brussels sprouts.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, lime juice, chives, thyme, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; set aside for flavors to blend, about 5 minutes.
Toss Brussels sprouts and hazelnuts together in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over Brussels sprouts mixture; lightly toss to coat. Add blue cheese; toss to coat.
