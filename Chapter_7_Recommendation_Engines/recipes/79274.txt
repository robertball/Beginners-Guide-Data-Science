Ingredients:
1 large avocado, peeled and pitted
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemons, juiced
1/4 cup sour cream (optional)
1/2 cup chopped seeded cucumber
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the avocado, garlic, lemon juice, sour cream and cucumber. Mash with a fork until smooth. If your avocado is not quite ripe enough, you may wish to use a food processor. Season with red pepper flakes, cilantro, mint, salt and pepper, and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
A colorful California version of this classic Greek sauce. Use on your favorite pita sandwich, gyro, falafel or as a fresh veggie dip. Also try it as a condiment for spicy Indian food and curries. Make it using yogurt in place of sour cream, or even without the sour cream for a great vegan alternative!
