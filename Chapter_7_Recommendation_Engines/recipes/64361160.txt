Ingredients:
1 tsp poppy seeds
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
4 or 5 lg. strawberries, 1/3 cup pureed
1 1/2 tbs honey*

Directions:
Place everything but the seeds in a mini blender and blend until smooth. Pour into a glass container and add seeds. Let rest on counter for an hour and then place in fridge.
I serve this over 12 oz of baby spinach, a handful of dried cranberries and 2 tbs of roasted nuts. I like pine nuts but they are very expensive so I usually use a combo of pine nuts, slivered almonds and pumpkin seeds but feel free to use what works for your family.
*The amount of honey needed will depend on how sweet your strawberries are. Taste and adjust.
