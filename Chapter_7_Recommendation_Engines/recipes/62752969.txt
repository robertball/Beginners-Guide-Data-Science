Ingredients:
Cooking oil
4 cups	diced boiled potatoes (skins on)
6 Italian sausages
1 whole red onion, thinly sliced
1 whole red pepper
1 whole green pepper
salt & pepper to taste
4-6	italian bread rolls (optional)
Condiments as desired (optional)

Directions:
Fry diced potatoes in a heavy skillet using enough oil to get them good and brown. Turn as necessary to prevent scorching or sticking
Meanwhile cook sausages in another skillet, cover and cook over medium heat. Turn occasionally and add just enough water to keep them from scorching
While potatoes and sausages are cooking cut the onion in half and thinly slice it. Cut peppers into thin strips
When sausages are done remove from pan, drain and slice for the one skillet meal as seen above. Stir sliced peppers into potatoes and turn heat to medium.
Top potatoes and sausage with onions and peppers. Cover and cook until vegetables are heated through and slightly tender.
Serve as a one dish meal.
*NOTE* If you prefer a sandwich. Do not cut the sausages. Serve whole sausages on big Italian bread rolls and top with potatoes, peppers and onions. Add condiments as desired.
