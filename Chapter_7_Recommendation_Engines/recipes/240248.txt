Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 wooden craft sticks
12 fun size bars chocolate-coated caramel-peanut nougat candy (such as SnickersÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy; add egg and vanilla and continue to beat until fully integrated.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; gradually mix into the peanut butter mixture until completely integrated into a dough. Divide dough into 12 equal portions.
Insert a wooden stick into the small end of each candy bar. Wrap a dough piece around each candy bar to completely cover. Arrange the cookie pops 4 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to cool completely.
