Ingredients:
4 cups whole wheat flour, freshly ground (divided)
1/2 tsp. Real Salt
2 tsp. yeast (or 1 packet)
1 cup lukewarm water
1/2 cup not milk
2 tsp. honey
3 Tbsp. softened butter
cornmeal, for dusting surface

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour, salt, yeast, water, milk, and honey in the base of a stand mixer.  Mix until combined.  The "batter" will be thin and runny.Cover and let rise for an hour.
Add remaining 2 cups of flour and softened butter and knead for about 5 full minutes and you feel that you have a very smooth homogenous dough.
Turn dough onto a surface sprinkled with cornmeal and roll dough out (I just use my hands) to a 1/2 inch thickness.  Sprinkle the top of the dough with cornmeal as well. Using a biscuit cutter or a juice glass, cut out rounds from the dough.  Continue until all the dough has been cut. Each biscuit should weigh about 210oz and when done you should have 15. Cover muffins, to prevent drafts, and let muffins rise until doubled, which is usually and hour or so (depending on the temperature of your kitchen).
Heat a skillet over medium heat and cook the English muffins (in small batches) on each side until golden brown.
