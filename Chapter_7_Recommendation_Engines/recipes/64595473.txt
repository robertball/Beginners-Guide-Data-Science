Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups teff flour
2 cups water
1/2 tsp baking powder
oil for pan
1/4 tsp salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Place flour in large glass bowl, add water, and stir well. Cover with cheese cloth or towel and leave on counter for 24 hours. Do not agitate or stir batter; leave it be.
After 24 hours, the batter should be alive and fermenting. Bring a pan to medium heat and lightly coat the pan with oil.
Stir the salt into the batter and season to taste.
Stir in the baking powder. Your batter will deflate when you stir.
Pour enough batter into the pan to coat the entire surface and cover with a lid or a cookie sheet. It’s important to keep a lot of moisture in the pan or the injera will crack. You don’t flip injera, and you aren’t supposed to brown it’s underside. Cook about 5-7 minutes. You’ll see the top bubble like pancakes and start to dry out.
When the top is dry, and the edges begin to curl/dry, use a spatula to remove the injera from the pan. Place on a plate and repeat, layering cooked injera with parchment paper until all the batter is used.
Note: This recipe can be prepared without the fermentation stage. Just mix it in a bowl and cook. However, the end product will not have the characteristic sour taste.
Store in an airtight glass container in the fridge.
