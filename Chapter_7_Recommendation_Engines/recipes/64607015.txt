Ingredients:
3 1/2 cup water
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup steel cut oats
1/2 cup pumpkin puree (not pie filling)
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
1. Boil salted water in a small/med sauce pan/pot
2. Add steel cut oats, pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice to boiling water and stir gently until everything is combined and mixture returns to a boil. Boil gently for a minute, then take off the heat,  put a lid on your pan and let sit overnight.
3. In the morning you will notice that the pumpkin has settled on top of the oats. Stir to combine. At this point you can reheat slowly over low heat stirring constantly, or microwave for 1 min, 30 sec. in individual servings.
4. Serve with a splash of milk, toasted walnuts or pecans
(optional) and a drizzle of pure maple syrup or honey.
Note: I store this in my fridge and reheat a single portion as needed. this will last up to a week in your fridge.
