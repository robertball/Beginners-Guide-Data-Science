Ingredients:
3 cups rotini pasta, uncooked
2/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup chopped dill pickles, or more to taste
1 tablespoon mustard
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon celery salt
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse in cold water until rotini are cold and place in a large bowl.
While pasta cooks, mix mayonnaise, pickles, mustard, vinegar, sugar, pepper, celery salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Stir dressing into cold noodles until fully coated. Add additional pickle chunks to taste. Serve chilled.

Description: 
This is a tangy pasta salad that is quick to make and tasty to eat. It's great as a side dish or a light meal. I first made this for my husband and myself because it was too hot in our apartment to cook for any length of time and too hot to want a hot meal!
