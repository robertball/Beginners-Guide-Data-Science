Ingredients:
2 (3 ounce) packages chicken flavored ramen noodles
6 eggs
2 teaspoons butter
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place noodles in a saucepan filled with boiling water, reserving the seasoning packet. Cook until tender, and drain. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and seasoning packets from the noodles.  Mix in noodles.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the noodle mixture, and cook over medium-low heat until firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Cut into fourths, and turn over to brown the other side for 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over the top, and serve.
