Ingredients:
1 bag shredded cheddar cheese (use jack if you prefer)
1 can red enchilada sauce (use green if you prefer)
1 1/2 large, ripe avocados, sliced
1/2 onion, finely diced
3/4 jalapeno or other mild pepper, finely diced (optional, to taste)
1 small can black olives
about 3/4 cup chopped cilantro
any other ingredients you want to add (green onions, etc)
12 corn tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a large pan, heat up enchilada sauce till bubbling.
Lower Heat and place first tortilla in the sauce. When you lift the tortilla with a spatula and the edges sag, it's ready to be taken out. Place to one side of baking dish (be conservative with space, you have to fit 12!) and fill the middle with all your goodies - lots of cheese, hearty slices of avocado, olives, cilantro, chopped onion and jalapeno, and anything else your heart desires.
Fold two sides of stuffed tortilla together.
Repeat with other remaining tortillas.
When you've finished all 12 enchiladas, smother them with any leftover sauce and top with any stuffing leftovers you may have. (Onions, avocado slices, etc.) Stick in your preheated oven until cheese is melted, usually 10-15 minutes. Serve with black beans and Mexican style rice for a complete meal! Enjoy!
