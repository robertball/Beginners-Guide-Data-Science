Ingredients:
1 pound turkey breast cutlets
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup Marsala wine
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Healthy Request® Condensed Golden Mushroom Soup
1/2 cup water
1/2 (16 ounce) package fettuccine, cooked and drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Season the turkey with the salt and black pepper.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the turkey and cook for 2 minutes or until browned on both sides.  Remove the turkey from the skillet.
Reduce the heat to medium.  Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes or until tender, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds.
Increase the heat to medium-high.  Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.  Cook for 1 minute or until the wine is reduced by half.
Stir in the soup and water and heat to a boil.  Return the turkey to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 2 minutes or until the turkey is cooked through.  Serve the turkey and sauce over the fettuccine.  Sprinkle with the parsley.
