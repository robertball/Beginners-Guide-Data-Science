Ingredients:
3 cups self-rising flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
2 cups raisins
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round baking dish.
In a large bowl, cut together the self-rising flour, sugar, and butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the raisins. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg with 1 cup of milk. Lightly mix the milk mixture into the flour mixture until it holds together. Place dough in prepared baking dish, and brush top with 1 tablespoon of milk for a nice golden brown crust.
Place the bread into the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for 1 hour. Let cool before serving.

Description: 
This is my mother's recipe.  She makes it several times a week for some function or another.  My sister loves this so much she has to control herself or she would eat a whole one with a stick of butter!  I usually only make this easy soda bread for events that my mother can't come to! Slice into wedges, butter, and enjoy!
