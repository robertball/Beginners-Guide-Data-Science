Ingredients:
20 oz. ground chicken
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz. cream cheese, softened
8 oz. Italian blend or other suitable shredded cheese, divided
12 manicotti shells
1 c. low-fat cottage cheese
2 c. 1% milk
2 T cornstarch
1/2 t salt
1/4 t ground pepper
1/8 t nutmeg
4 oz. shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook and drain the manicotti noodles while proceeding with additional steps.
Cook the chicken and onion in a medium frying pan until the chicken is cooked through and in small pieces.  Add garlic and cook one minute. Stir in cream cheese and 6 oz. of the Italian blend cheese, mix well and set aside.
Blend cottage cheese, milk, cornstarch, salt, pepper and nutmeg in food processor to make a smooth sauce.  Pour sauce into a sauce pan, add Parmesan cheese and heat over medium heat until cheese has melted and sauce has thickened.
Spray 9 x 13 pan with cooking spray.  Pour enough of the sauce into the pan to cover the bottom.  Stuff each manicotti shell with the chicken mixture and place on top of sauce.  Pour the remaining sauce over the top of the manicotti and top with 2 oz. Italian blend cheese.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes or until heated through.
