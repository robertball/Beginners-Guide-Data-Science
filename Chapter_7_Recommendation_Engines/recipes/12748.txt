Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pound scallops
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
4 large oranges, peeled and segmented
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the red bell pepper, green onions and garlic. Cook, stirring for 1 minute.  Add the scallops, salt and red pepper flakes. Cook until the scallops are opaque and the red bell pepper is tender, about 4 to 6 minutes.
Stir in the lime zest and juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 1 minute. Add the oranges and cilantro, cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
