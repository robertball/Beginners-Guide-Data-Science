Ingredients:
1 cup ketchup
1/3 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon liquid smoke
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1-2 T chipolte sauce

Directions:
Combine the ketchup, white vinegar, molasses, honey, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to a medium saucepot set over medium heat; stir to combine.
Bring the sauce to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to low to maintain the simmer; cook uncovered for 20 minutes.
Add desired amount of Chipolte sauce, then cook an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
To make wings:  Add the oil to a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or electric deep fryer, leaving at least 2 inches of space at the top. Heat the oil to 375Â°F.
Dust wings with a light coating of flour (I used flour with a little cayenne pepper, salt & pepper).
Fry the wings for 10 to 15 minutes or until they are crisp on the outside. Place on a paper-towel-lined plate to drain off excess oil (and cool slightly) before tossing them in the honey-barbecue sauce.  ***NOTE*** we also bake ours in a 400 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes PRIOR to saucing ... just to make sure they're thoroughly cooked.  Nobody wants an undercooked wing.
Toss wings in honey-barbecue sauce, and serve immediately
