Description: 
This is an original recipe for those who like trying something a little different. Using cranberries, walnuts, and golden raisins, you can make a stuffing that sweetens your Thanksgiving meal! I'm not actually sure how well it does when baked in a turkey. I find that putting stuffing in the bird tends to dry the bird.
