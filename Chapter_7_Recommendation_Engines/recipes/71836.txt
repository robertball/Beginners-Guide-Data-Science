Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) chicken
1/2 cup whole garlic cloves, peeled
1 cup olive oil, divided
1 bunch flat-leaf parsley
1 orange, zested
1 lime, zested
1 pound yucca, peeled
2 Spanish onions, thinly sliced
16 fluid ounces sour orange juice
1 cup rich chicken stock
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Cut the chicken in half and debone. Place the garlic in 1/4 cup of the oil and saute until tender. When the garlic is cool, puree half of it with the parsley, orange zest, lime zest, and remaining 3/4 cup of oil. Rub the garlic mixture onto the chicken and marinate for 1 day in the refrigerator.
Cook the yucca in salted water until tender and drain. Slowly cook the onions with a little water until soft. Reserve.
Simmer the sour orange juice over the low heat until syrupy. Add the chicken stock and cook until lightly thickened. Reserve.
Bake the chicken at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes, until cooked through and the juices run clear when pierced with a fork. Saute the yucca in the remaining 3 tbsp olive oil until crispy. Add the onions and the reserved garlic confit.
Drain the yucca mixture well and place on a plate with the chicken. Cover with the orange mixture.
