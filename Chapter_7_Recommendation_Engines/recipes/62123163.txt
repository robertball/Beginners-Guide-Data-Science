Grilled Montreal Flat Iron Steak Recipe

Ingredients:
1 7oz. flat iron steak
1 Montreal Season Blend (I use McCormick)

Directions:
Preheat grill at 350 degrees F.
Remove the steak from the fridge and allow it to sit to come to room temperature for about 1 minute.  You don't want to "shock" the meat.
Sprinkle season blend on steak, coating generously
Grease grill.
Add steak to grill cooking about 6 minutes on each side for medium, or cook until desired "doneness".
Remove from heat, place on your plate and cover with foil.  This will allow the juices to soak back into the steak.  Putting it on your plate rather than a cutting board will also keep the juices from escaping and soaking into a wooden cutting board.
Add any sides you desire, I love corn on the cob with this meal or a baked potato!

Description: 
Quick and tasty is the name of the game here!  No prep time and fast cooking time.  You don't have to marinade the steak.  Grilling time depends on how well done you want your steak.  Works great with London Broil too!
