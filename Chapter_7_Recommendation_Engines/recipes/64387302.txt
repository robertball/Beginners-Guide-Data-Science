Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
4 tablespoons sherry
2 teaspoons dried minced onion
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch garlic powder
2 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloins

Directions:
Place soy sauce, brown sugar, sherry, dried onion, cinnamon, olive oil, and a touch of garlic powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal, and shake to mix. Place pork in bag with marinade, seal, and refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil grate. Place tenderloins on grill, and discard marinade. Cook 20 minutes, or to desired doneness. Slice into medallions, and serve.
You can also brown this on all sides in a cast iron skillet, then bake in the oven @ 350 for about 20 min.
Mix a little cornstarch in the drippings to make a sauce.
