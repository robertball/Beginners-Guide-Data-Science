Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package pastry for a 9-inch double crust pie
1 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced, or more to taste
3 gala apples, peeled and sliced, or more to taste
Topping:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
1 dash vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll 1 pie crust pastry onto a work surface; lightly roll with a rolling pin until crust is a 9x13-inch rectangle, cutting crust if needed. Press crust into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, placing leftover crust pieces in the corners.
Whisk white sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Toss Granny Smith apples and gala apples in sugar mixture until evenly coated. Spread apple mixture evenly over pie crust; pour remaining juices over apples.
Roll the remaining pie crust to 9x13-inch rectangle and place over apple layer, folding edges over apples to completely cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool apple bars slightly, about 20 minutes.
Whisk confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until topping is smooth and desired consistency; drizzle over bars.

Description: 
It has taken me a while to find a good recipe, but finally with some different trials I find this has a great balance of cinnamon and nutmeg. Not to mention it is so much easier than apple pie and I think it tastes better. You can arrange the top crust lattice-style if desired.
