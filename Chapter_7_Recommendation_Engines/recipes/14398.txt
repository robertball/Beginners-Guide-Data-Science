Description: 
This tastes like the salad that is served at a famous Italian restaurant chain in my area. It's perfect with fresh loaf of crusty bread. For the best flavor be sure to use fresh whole-milk mozzarella it puts the packaged varieties to shame. You can find fresh mozzarella in Italian delis, gourmet markets, cheese shops and some grocery stores.
