Ingredients:
2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 14-oz can reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 3/4 cups water
1 cup pearl barley
2 cups cubed peeled butternut squash (3/4-inch cubes)
1/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 tsp freshly grated lemon zest
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 tsp salt, or to taste
freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2-3 minutes.
Add broth, water, barley and squash; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the barley and squash are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 45 minutes.
Add parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper; mix gently.

Description: 
Winter squash contribues a rich, full flavor to a simple barley pilaf.  Gremolata, an Italian mixture of parsley, lemon zest and garlic, gives the dish a lively finish.  The pilaf is an excellent accompaniment to chicken and pork, but would stand on its own with the addition of Parmesan.
