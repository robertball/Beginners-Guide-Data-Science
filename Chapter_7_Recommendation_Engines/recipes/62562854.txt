Ingredients:
2 c. sugar
5 tbsp. cocoa
1/4 tsp. salt
1 c. milk
1 tbsp. light corn syrup
3 tbsp. butter
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 c. chopped nuts

Directions:
How to Microwave Old Fashioned Fudge:
Combine sugar, cocoa and salt in a 3-3 1/2 quart mixing bowl or casserole. Stir in milk and syrup thoroughly. Add butter. Cover. Microwave at high 5 minutes. Mix well. Microwave uncovered 10-14 minutes. Test by dropping a small amount of mixture in ice water. It should form a soft ball when picked up. Cool mixture, without stirring, to lukewarm (120 degrees on edges).
After 10 minutes casserole may be placed in bowl of cool water, if desired. Add vanilla and nuts, beat until mixture is thick and creamy, starts to lose its shine and hold its shape. Pour quickly into buttered plate or 9 x 5 or 10 x 6 inch loaf dish. If fudge is too thick to spread, stir in a few drops cream or milk.
Note: Do not use a conventional candy thermometer while microwaving. However, you may use the thermometer outside the oven to verify your cold water test, or to judge when candy is cool enough to work.
Variation of Old Fashioned Fudge: Penuche: Omit cocoa and substitute 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup granulated sugar. Increase syrup to 2 tablespoons.
