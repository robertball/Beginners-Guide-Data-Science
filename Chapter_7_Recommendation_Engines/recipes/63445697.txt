Ingredients:
3 Tbs. butter
1 large onion, diced
1/3 c. flour
2 tsp. mustard powder
5 cups chicken stock
4 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and chopped
3 cups (10 oz.) grated sharp cheddar cheese
fresh ground black pepper
a few dashes of Tabasco sauce

Directions:
Melt butter in a stockpot over medium heat.  Add onion and saute until tender.  Sprinkle flour and mustard powder over onion and stir to coat.  Continue stirring for 1-2 minutes.
Add chicken stock, stirring until well-blended.  Add 3/4 of the apple to the mixture, cover the stockpot, reduce heat to low and simmer until soup is thickened and apple is tender, about 10 minutes.  Stir in grated cheese and cook a few minutes longer, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and soup has a silky texture.
Using an immersion blender, puree soup until smooth.  Stir in Tabasco sauce and pepper to taste.
Ladle soup into warmed bowls, sprinkle with remaining chopped apple and serve immediately.
