Ingredients:
1 cup water (70 degrees to 80 degrees)
1/4 cup canola oil
1/4 cup honey
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups bread flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup toasted wheat germ
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/4 cup sunflower kernels
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place all ingredients in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed). When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down; cover and let stand for 10 minutes.
Divide dough into 20 pieces; shape each into a ball. Place 2 inches apart on baking sheets coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees for 12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
