Ingredients:
1 cup regular sugar, OR 1 cup 1-1 splenda, OR 1/2 cup splenda 1/2 to 1 ratio
1 pound cold butter (no substitutes)
3 cups white flour
1 cup wheat flour

Directions:
Cut butter and sugar until no lumps are left and it is incorporated together.  Mix both both kinds of flour into the butter/sugar mix until fully mixed. I find it easier to just mix with my hands until it is a nice cookie dough consistancy.   Place 30 grams of  balled dough on cookie tray and flatten with a glass or jar with a flat end dunked in the sugar substitute. Bake in 325 degree preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until the color you like. Usually golden but we preferr ours a little more done.

Description: 
My husband being diabetic, I often have to change recipes due to sugar content. These cookies use splenda 1/2 to 1 ratio. Not the 1 to 1 although I imagine it could work great too. You would need to use the entire amount of sugar if you uise the 1/1 kind. They will litterally melt in your mouth!
