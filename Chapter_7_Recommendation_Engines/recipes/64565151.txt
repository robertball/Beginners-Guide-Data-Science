2 teaspoons cumin

Canola oil for frying

Sweet chili sauce

Directions:
Cover a cookie sheet with wax paper.
Combine the first eight ingredients and mix well with your hands.
Place a wonton wrapper on a cutting board so the square looks like a diamond.
Using a teaspoon, scoop a heaping spoonful of the mixture and spread it into a horizontal line across the bottom third of of the wrapper.
Fold over the bottom corner and roll once.
Fold over the two side corners and roll again to secure the sides.
Dampen the top corner with the cool water.
Roll until the top corner is secure.
Place the rolls on the wax paper in a single layer.
Freeze until you are ready to fry them.
Heat the canola oil to 350 degrees.
Fry the lumpia for 3 minutes.
Remove from oil and cut in half.
Fry again for 30 seconds.
Enjoy with sweet chili sauce for dipping.
