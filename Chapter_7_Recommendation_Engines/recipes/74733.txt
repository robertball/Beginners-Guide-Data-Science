Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown rice
4 cups water
1 (10 ounce) can asparagus tips, drained
1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
2 red apples, cored and diced
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the rice and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until rice is tender. Drain, if necessary, and cool.
While the rice is cooling, place golden raisins in a bowl, and fill with enough hot water to cover. Let soak for 20 minutes to plump. Drain.
In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold in curry powder, lemon juice, salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, stir together the brown rice, asparagus, red pepper, apples, and raisins. Fold into the curry cream, and chill until serving.

Description: 
This is a very tasty brown rice recipe salad. Mmm!! Very different and tasty served with barbeque meats. I don't think this need to be changed at all, it is so perfect the way it is.
