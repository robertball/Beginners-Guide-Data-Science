Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pound chicken, cubed or cut into strips
1 onion, cut into bite-sized cubes
1 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized cubes
12 skewers, or as needed
12 (6 inch) tortillas, warmed
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream, or as needed
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa, or as needed
1 (6 ounce) container guacamole, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine cilantro, oil, vinegar, lime juice, chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a big bowl. Add chicken, onion, and bell peppers and toss vigorously until all vegetables and meat are coated with the seasonings. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Assemble kabobs on skewers with 3 pieces of meat opposite the vegetables.
Cook kabobs on the preheated grill, turning constantly to prevent burning, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
Serve immediately by placing 1 kabob on a plate with a warm tortilla, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.

Description: 
Great recipe to go with a cold margarita or strawberry water. I served these chicken fajita skewers for Cinco de Mayo this year and they were a hit. Great way to combine a Mexican food favorite with the grill outside. Serve with homemade pinto beans and authentic Mexican rice.
