Ingredients:
3-4 lb pork roast
Rub:
2 Tbl. dried basil
2 Tbl. dried oregano
1 Tbl. dried rosemary
2-3 cloves garlic, crushed
salt & pepper, to taste
Sauce:
1 onion, chopped fine
1-2 tomatoes, mashed(sub canned/crushed)
4 oz. can green chilies
3 Tbl. white wine vinegar
1/4. olive oil
salt & pepper, to taste

Directions:
Mix together rub ingredients. Rub entire (uncooked)roast, using all of the rub. Wrap in 3 layers of aluminum foil then place into 2 brown paper bags & seal tightly. Place into a baking pan to catch any juices that may leak. Bake @ 200 for 24 hours. Yes, you read that correctly :)
For sauce: stir together all sauce ingredients & refrigerate overnight. When roast is done, discard foil & bags, shred with forks or cut to desired portion size, heat up the sauce & pour over the meat.

Description: 
My mother in law made this for a family gathering one time. Unfortunately I was not there to experience it but the family has been raving about it so I finally tracked down the recipe. There are parts of the original recipe that are vague so MIL did her best to guestimate.
