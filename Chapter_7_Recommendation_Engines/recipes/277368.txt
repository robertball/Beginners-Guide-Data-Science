Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (10 ounce) bag frozen broccoli rice
3 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons green onion, chopped (green part only)

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, and leave 2 tablespoons bacon grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon when cool enough to touch.
Add onions to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broccoli rice and fry until tender, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Mix in beaten eggs and stir until well combined. Cook until eggs are completely scrambled into broccoli rice mixture. Turn off heat and stir in soy sauce.
Add crumbled bacon just before serving and stir to incorporate. Top with green onions.

Description: 
Frozen broccoli rice is a great alternative for regular rice. Fried in bacon grease for taste and topped with crispy bacon bits for crunch makes this a great side dish.
