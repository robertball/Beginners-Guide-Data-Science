Ingredients:
Kale Pesto:
2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided, or more to taste
1 bunch kale, stemmed
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 clove garlic, chopped
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
Zucchini Pasta:
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 large zucchini, cut into noodle-shape strands
7 ounces frozen petite peas

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil. Add kale and cook uncovered until bright green, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain on paper towels.
Place kale, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and chopped garlic in a food processor. Pulse about 5 times; slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil. Season with salt.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the minced garlic and red pepper flakes until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the zucchini and toss until just tender, about 2 minutes.
Remove the saucepan from heat and add peas and the kale pesto; toss to combine.
