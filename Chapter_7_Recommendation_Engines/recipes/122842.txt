Ingredients:
12 chocolate sandwich cookies with creme filling
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1/2 cup whipped topping

Directions:
Remove cookie top from each sandwich cookie; crush and set aside. Place cream-topped cookies in foil-lined muffin cups, cream side up. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, sugar, cocoa and vanilla until fluffy. Beat in eggs until blended. Fill muffin cups three-fourths full. Sprinkle 1/4 cup reserved cookie crumbs over top (discard remaining crumbs or save for another use). Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until set. Cool completely. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Just before serving, top each cheesecake with about 2 tablespoons of pie filling. Top with a dollop of whipped topping.

As sure as chocolate and cherries go together, so do my family's Yuletides and these no-fuss cheesecakes.
