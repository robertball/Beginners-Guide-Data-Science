Heat up the Pan and enjoy, where did you say you put the Bier again?

Description: 
My Mother was used to cook this kind of sausage for us for lunch. The sausage was not linked when you bought it from the local butcher shop. It was hanging on a butcher hook behind the service counter and you just showed the butcher how long of a piece you wanted and he cut and weighted it for you. In Germany you can eat raw pork, so when my mother came home from shopping and we found out she brought fresh Bratwurst home my brother and I took a part of it removed the casings and spread it on a slice of bread,...yep great food. Lots of memories about food. Add raw onions or mustard if you like.
