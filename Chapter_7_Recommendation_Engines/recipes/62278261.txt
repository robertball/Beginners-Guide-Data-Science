Ingredients:
6 slices of bacon
2 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper
1 pinch of salt
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup oatmeal (instant or old fashioned)
8 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate.
Saut√© bacon until crispy. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together the salt, jalapenos, and cream cheese. Crumble bacon and stir into cream cheese mixture.
In a medium bowl, mix the ground beef with oatmeal. This will keep the burgers together better and prevent the cheese from oozing out.
Divide the ground beef mixture into 16 portions and pat out each one to 1/4 inch thickness. Use a spoon or your fingers to make an indentation in the center of 8 of the patties. This will be the cavity for your cream cheese mixture. Spoon some of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of the patties. Top with the remaining patties, pressing the edges together to seal.
Grill for about 10 minutes per side, or until well done, taking care not to press down on the burgers as they cook. This will make the cheese ooze out. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
