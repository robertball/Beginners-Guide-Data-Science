Ingredients:
1 Pastry for Two-Crust Pie
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon cinnamon
dash of salt
8 cups medium sliced pared apples; (I prefer Jonathans)
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 F.
Prepare pastry.
In a large bowl, stir together sugar, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, walnuts and salt; mix with apples.
Turn into pastry-lined deep dish pie pan; dot with butter.
Cover with top crust which has slits cut in it; seal edges and flute.
Cover edge with 2-3 inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning; remove foil last 15 minutes of baking.
Bake 45-55 minutes or until crust is browned and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust.
