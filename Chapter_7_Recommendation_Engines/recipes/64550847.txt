Ingredients:
Cake:
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
5 eggs
3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
2 tablespoons lime or key lime extract
1 cup lime carbonated beverage (such as Green River)
Glaze:
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup lime carbonated beverage
1/2 teaspoon lime or key lime extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Generously grease a fluted tube pan.
Beat white sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth; add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.
Stir flour, 1 cup at a time, blending well after each addition until batter is smooth; stir in extract.
Mix lime beverage into batter and pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Remove cake from pan after allowing to cool.
Beat confectioners' sugar, soda, and extract together in a bowl until glaze is smooth.
Pour glaze over cake.

Description: 
Also called Green River Cake - this is a lime cake made in the style of a 7-Up Cake but purely lime. It may be difficult to obtain both the key lime extract and the lime soda (in the Chicago area, we have Green River soda available). The extract is sold at The Spice House and available online. This cake, warmed up, pairs perfectly with a nice vanilla ice cream.
