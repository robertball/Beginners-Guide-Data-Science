Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1 tablespoon vinegar, balsamic
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tablespoon mustard, Dijon
1 clove(s) garlic minced
1/2 pounds beef, flank steak
1/2 tablespoon pepper, black ground
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup(s) broth, chicken, fat-free, low-sodium
1/2 medium onion(s), yellow cut into 1/4" thick rings

Directions:
In a large nonaluminum baking dish, combine the oil, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and garlic. Add the steak; turn to coat. Cover; refrigerate for 30 minutes or overnight, turning once.
Coat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Place over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak with the pepper and salt. Brown for 2 minutes per side. Add 1/2 cup of the broth; cook, turning once, for 5–6 minutes per side (for medium-rare). Remove the steak from the skillet; cover the steak loosely to keep it warm. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion slices to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 4–5 minutes per side. Add the remaining broth as needed to prevent the onions from sticking.
Thinly slice the steak across the grain; serve with the onions.
