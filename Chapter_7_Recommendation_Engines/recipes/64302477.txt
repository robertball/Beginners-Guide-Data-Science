Ingredients:
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup fresh ricotta
1/2 cup self-raising flour
1 cup baked or canned salmon, mashed
1 zucchini, trimmed, coarsely grated
1 tbs chopped fresh chives or mint or basil (or whatever you have)
olive oil spray

Directions:
Use a balloon whisk to whisk together the milk, eggs and ricotta in a bowl. Gradually add the flour, whisking constantly, until a smooth batter forms.
Stir in the salmon, zucchini, and herbs.
Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Spoon quantities of the salmon mixture into the pan. Cook for a few minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Repeat, with the remaining salmon mixture, re-spraying the pan between batches.
