Ingredients:
2 tbsp. dark brown sugar
2 tsp. baking powdered
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
1/2 tsp. baking soda
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided

Preheat oven to 450 degree. Generously grease a 10-in. cast-iron skillet with shortening.
Whisk together brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda and 2 cups of the flour in a large bowl. Add the cold butter, and use a fork or your hands to cut the butter into the flour until a crumbly mixture forms.
Add the mascarpone and mix gently with your hands.
Pour in the milk and stir with a wooden spoon until the dough just starts to come together.
Dust a clean work surface with remaining 1/4 cup flour. Transfer the dough to the surface adn pat into a 1-inch thick disk.
Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out the biscuits.
Nestle the biscuits in the cast-iron skillet. Brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle with black pepper.
Bake at 450 degrees for about 25 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.
Cool for 5 minutes and then drizzle honey over the top.
