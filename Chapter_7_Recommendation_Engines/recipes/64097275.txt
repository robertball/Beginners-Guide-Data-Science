Ingredients:
For muffins:2 cups of flour,2/3 cup of sugar,2 teaspoons of baking powder,1/2 teaspoon of baking soda,1/2 teaspoon of salt,1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon,2 large eggs,1 stick of unsalted butter(melted,1 cup of buttermilk,1 tablespoon of grated lemon zest,3/4 cup of fresh blueberries,3/4 cup of fresh raspberries.
For streusel:1/4 cup of flour,2 tablespoons of butter(softened), 2 tablespoons of sugar,2 tablespoons of finely chopped walnuts,1 teaspoon finely grated lemon peel.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a standard 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
To make the topping, in a medium bowl, mix together the topping ingredients until crumbly. Set aside.
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
In a large bowl, beat the eggs with the melted butter. Add the buttermilk and lemon zest and whisk to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir just to combine. (Batter will still be somewhat lumpy; do not overmix.) Gently fold in the blueberries and raspberries so the berries do not break open and pour into the prepared muffin tin. Crumble the streusel topping over the muffins and bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Let cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then remove and cool on wire racks.
