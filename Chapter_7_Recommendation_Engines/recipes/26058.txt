Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
1 egg
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Prepare and bake cake mix according to package directions for a 9x13 inch pan. When done, allow cake to cool and leave in pan. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large saucepan, combine brown sugar, flour, butter and egg. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes, or until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in pecans and vanilla. Spread over cake. Place in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes.
