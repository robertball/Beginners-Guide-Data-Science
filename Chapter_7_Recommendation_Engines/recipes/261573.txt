Description: 
Try this blue cheese broccoli slaw with cheery cherries for a combination of sweet and crunchy and salty and creamy that is just what you were looking for. The recipe is very friendly to substitutions/omissions. It would also be good with dried cranberries (or even raisins!) and feta. You can eat this immediately, but it's much better if you let it sit, covered, in the refrigerator for several hours before serving. Yum!
