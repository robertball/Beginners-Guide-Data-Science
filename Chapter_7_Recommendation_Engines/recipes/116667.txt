In a large nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook chicken over medium heat for 10-12 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Remove; thinly sliced chicken and cool.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard, cumin and cayenne; set aside. In a large bowl, combine the spinach, cucumber, onions and chicken. Drizzle with yogurt mixture; toss to coat. Microwave pita breads for 15-20 seconds or until warmed. Fill each half with 1/2 cup chicken mixture.

Description: 
The tender chicken mixture that's tucked into these pita pockets has a cumin zip and refreshing cucumber-and-yogurt flavor. 'A favorite at my house, this sandwich is great alone or served with soup or salad,' Mitzi Sentiff writes from Alexandria, Virginia.
