Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
1 large carrot, sliced
1 stalk celery, sliced
1/2 cup snow peas
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
3/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
1 pinch black sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to a simmer in a skillet over medium heat; add broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, celery, snow peas, and ginger. Simmer until vegetables are just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain any remaining water.
Mix garlic into vegetable mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Season with soy sauce and sesame oil, cooking until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Stir in toasted sesame seeds.
Sprinkle black sesame seeds over vegetables before serving.
