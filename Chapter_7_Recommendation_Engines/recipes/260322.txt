Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package pineapple cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ® Pineapple Supreme)
1 cup water
3 large eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 pints part-skim ricotta cheese
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup milk
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Blend cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and oil together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Mix ricotta cheese, sugar, 3 eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour evenly over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Let cool, at least 20 minutes.
Mix milk and pudding mix together until thickened. Fold in whipped topping and pineapple. Spread over the cooled cake. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
This cake is similar to the Italian love cake, just made with pineapple. 
Every Time I make this cake, I get rave reviews. It's like a pineapple cheesecake, but better. Very moist, and tastes even better the next day. Enjoy!
