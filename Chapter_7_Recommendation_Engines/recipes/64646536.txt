Ingredients:
4 cups minute rice
4 cups water
1 stick butter, divided
1 TBSP minced garlic
2 eggs
~1 cup soy sauce (I add slowly and mix as I add until the rice takes on the color I want)
pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook rice according to the directions on the box, adding 1/2 stick of butter with the uncooked rice into the water.  Allow to cool completely and refrigerate until ready to use.  Make a day ahead, if need be.  This works best with cold rice.
Melt 1/2 stick butter in frying pan.  When melted, add minced garlic and eggs.  Scramble and chop eggs with a fork until they are cooked through.  Pepper eggs.
Add rice to the pan.  Mix and chop rice in pan until warmed thoroughly and starting to brown a little.
Add soy sauce a little at a time, mixing and judging color until it looks right to your liking.  Pepper rice to taste.
Allow rice to cook and toast up a little more, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
