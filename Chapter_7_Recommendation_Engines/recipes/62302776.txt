Ingredients:
1 cup oat bran
1 egg
1 1/4 cup 1% buttermilk (no substitutes)
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup dried cranberries
2 small apples, cored and diced (unpeeled or peeled)
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup roasted golden ground flaxmeal
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
2 tbs ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 12 cup muffin tin with paper liners.
In a large bowl, whisk together first 4 ingredients. Stir in walnuts, cranberries and apples.
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, flaxmeal, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon.
Add to wet ingredients and mix until combined. Divide batter among the 12 cups, filling right to the top. Whole grain muffins don't rise much, so don't be afraid to fill the cups.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes before placing on wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
Full of good whole grains, but there's no sacrificing flavor, texture or sweetness in these muffins. Do be sure to use roasted flax for the best nutty flavor.
