Ingredients:
6 pounds seven bone roast (or 5 lb. chuck roast)
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
6 garlic cloves
1 teaspoon seasoned pepper
1 green bell pepper
4 potatoes
1 cup baby carrots
3 stalks celery
1 onion
1 8 oz. package mushrooms

Directions:
Section, peel, and insert whole garlic cloves into the roast (1/2-inch deep).  Freeze meat.
When ready to cook, rub roast with seasoned salt and pepper and place in COVERED roasting pan.  Wedge the onion and potatoes. Place veggies alongside the roast, and top with sliced bell pepper.  Pour water into the pan along the sides (so as not to rinse off spices) so that it comes 1/2 to 3/4 inch up the sides of the pan.  Cover and cook on 300F for 2 1/2 to 4 hours.
NOTE:  If you DO forget to put the garlic cloves before freezing, simply use garlic press to press garlic on surface of frozen meat just before cooking.  Rub garlic in with other seasonings and proceed as directed above.
