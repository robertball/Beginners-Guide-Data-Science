Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can figs in syrup
½ cup water
½ cup white sugar
½ cup white vinegar
1  red onion, diced
1  yellow bell pepper, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded 1/2 inch thick
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Remove figs from syrup; cut each fig into quarters. Reserve 1/4 cup of syrup.
Heat water and sugar in a sauce pan over medium-high heat until sugar is dissolved and water begins to simmer. Reduce heat to medium; add white vinegar, red onions, yellow peppers, figs, and syrup.  Return to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken breasts, one at a time, until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from pan to a paper towel-lined plate.
Mix cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Add to fig sauce, stirring constantly until sauce is thickened.
Serve chicken breasts topped with the fig sauce.
