Ingredients:
abalone steak, filet cut trimmed to no more than 1/4 inch and tenderized with tenderizing hammer.
1/4 cp. olive oil
1 tsp. pepper flakes
1 tsp. crushed garlic
1 tabl. vermouth (optional)

Directions:
Place tenderized steaks into a plastic bag.
Put olive oil, pepper flakes, crushed garlic, and vermouth into the bag. Close tight and mix around in the bag to make sure all steaks are covered. Leave in the bag for at least 15 minutes.
To BBQ, spray or brush grill with oil. Place steaks on medium heated grill and turn every 2 minutes - 2 to three times. DO NOT OVER COOK!
I take full advantage of my burning coals to cook either chicken or steak at the same time. These are cooked first and then placed on the outer edge of the grill to keep warm while I cook the abalone since it takes just a few minutes.

Description: 
When it's too hot to cook indoors, this recipe is quick, easy, and keeps the heat outdoors. Barbequing abalone lets the flavor of the abalone come through and not covered in the bread crumbs and frying oil. If there's any left overs, it's excellent to slice in strips and put in a salad. Ingredient quantities are flexible to taste.
