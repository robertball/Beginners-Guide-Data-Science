6 Persian cucumbers, sliced
1/2 c  yellow or white onion, sliced
6 garlic cloves, sliced
1 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup white castor sugar
1/8 tsp each:
curry powder
turmeric powder
ginger powder
mustard powder
black pepper, powdered
3/4 tsp. salt
Sterilized glass jars

Directions:
In a non-reactive microwave bowl, combine all ingredients except for the cucumbers.  Microwave on high for 3 minutes, stir, and add the cucumbers slices.  Stir well, microwave for 4 minutes more, stir, and microwave a final 3 or 4 minutes.  Mixture will begin to turn a yellowy green, and liquid will be at bubbling hot.
Carefully transfer to sterilized glass jars, seal, and store in refrigerator until ready to use.
