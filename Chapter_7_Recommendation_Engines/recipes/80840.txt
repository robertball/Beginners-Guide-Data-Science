Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
12 slices bread, crust removed
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
8 eggs, lightly beaten
3 cups milk

Directions:
Place bacon in a skillet over medium high heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and set aside.
Spread 1 side of each bread slice with about 1 teaspoon butter. Arrange 1/2 the slices buttered side down in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer with the crumbled bacon, 1/2 the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 the Monterey Jack cheese. Arrange remaining bread slices over the cheese, buttered sides up. In a small bowl, mix the eggs and milk, and pour evenly over bread slices. Top with remaining cheese. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bake the chilled Brunch Bake 1 hour, or until cheese is bubbly and eggs are set.

Description: 
Both sides of our family, in-laws and all, eat this Christmas morning. Mrs. Allen gave this recipe to my parents as a wedding gift, as with all my mom's and my dad's brothers and sisters. It is a true family recipe. This recipe is fantastic because you can prepare the night before, then put it in the oven while, say, opening gifts. No work required the day of.
