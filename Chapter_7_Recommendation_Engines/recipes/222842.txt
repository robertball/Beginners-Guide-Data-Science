Ingredients:
4 stalks fresh rhubarb, trimmed and chopped
1 (12 fl oz) can almond-fruit flavored soda (such as Dr Pepper®)
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1 sweet onion (such as Vidalia®), chopped
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring (optional)

Directions:
Combine rhubarb, soda, apple cider vinegar, sweet onion, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, allspice, salt, black pepper, cloves, ground chipotle, garlic powder, and liquid smoke in a saucepan; bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until rhubarb and onion are very soft, about 45 minutes, stirring often.
Pour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and pulse a few times to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches if necessary until sauce is smooth.

Description: 
Since my stepmother is allergic to tomatoes, I needed a good barbeque sauce that has no tomato. So here I am depending on the rhubarb to give me that tang. Makes a unique sauce. Add the liquid smoke flavoring if you aren't grilling with real smoke.
