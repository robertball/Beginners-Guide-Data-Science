Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed
3/4 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
1/2 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
8 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together the luncheon meat, processed cheese, relish, and salad dressing in a bowl. Spoon the filling into the sandwich buns, and wrap each sandwich individually in aluminum foil. Place the sandwiches onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is hot, and the buns have toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.
