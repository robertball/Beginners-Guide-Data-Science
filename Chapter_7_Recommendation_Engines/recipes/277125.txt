Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 pound fresh green beans, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
10 spears fresh asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 carrot, julienned
1 zucchini, chopped
6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
1 tomato, chopped, divided
2 cups chopped baby spinach
1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
While penne is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add green beans, asparagus, and carrot and cook for 3 minutes. Add zucchini, mushrooms, and 3/4 of the chopped tomato; cook and stir until veggies are bright, 4 to 5 minutes. Add spinach and stir until wilted, about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle salad dressing mix over veggies and gradually add cream, stirring until combined. Bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened to desired consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cooked penne and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese; toss to combine.
Plate pasta. Top each serving with remaining Parmesan, remaining tomato, a dash of lemon juice, and pepper.
