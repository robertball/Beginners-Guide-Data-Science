1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into thirds
2 zucchini, thinly sliced
2 yellow squash, thinly sliced
1 cup grape tomatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil

sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place asparagus in a microwave-safe dish with a splash of water; microwave for 3 to 4 minutes.
Spread zucchini, yellow squash, and grape tomatoes out on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic and sea salt.
Roast in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Add asparagus and roast until vegetables are tender, 3 to 5 more minutes. Transfer vegetables to a serving bowl; squeeze lemon juice over the top and season with sea salt.
