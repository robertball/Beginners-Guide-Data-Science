Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups of very warm water
2 Tablespoons yeast
2 Tablespoons coconut oil
2 Tablespoons molasses
3 Tablespoons honey
1 Tablespoon kosher salt (use whatever salt you have)
1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1/4 cup quinoa
1/4 cup flax seed
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup long cooking oats (quick cooking oatmeal would be fine if that’s all you have)
1/4 cup steel cut oats
2 cups white flour
2  3 cups wheat flour

Directions:
Fill a large glass bowl or 4 cup glass measuring cup with the warm water.   Add the molasses and quickly stir to dissolve.  Add the yeast and gently stir in.  Leave to proof about 10 minutes while you add all the other ingredients to the bread maker.  When the yeast mixture has begun to get bubbly, add to the bread maker and turn it on.  (we use the large wheat loaf medium crust setting)
Voila!  In 4.5 hours, you'll have amazing, healthy bread!
