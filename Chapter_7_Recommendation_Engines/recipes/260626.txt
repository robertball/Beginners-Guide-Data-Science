Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons butter, at room temperature
2 large egg yolks
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, melted, or as needed

Directions:
Press 1/2 cup white sugar and butter together in a bowl until crumbly. Add egg yolks and stir until well combined.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. Place 1/3 of the flour mixture and 1/2 the sour cream into the sugar-egg mixture; stir until combined. Mix in the remaining flour and sour cream. Refrigerate dough until ready to use.
Mix 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.
Roll dough out onto a lightly floured work surface to 1/2-inch thick. Cut 9 large circles in the dough; cut a small circle out of the center of each large circle to create doughnut shapes.
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush 1/2 of the melted butter over both sides of the doughnuts.
Place 1/2 doughnuts into the basket of the air fryer; cook for 8 minutes. Paint cooked donuts with the remaining melted butter and immediately dip into the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts.

Description: 
I love hot cinnamon doughnuts, but don't like or have all the oil to make the recipes. This version uses an air fryer. By using less oil, I can use tastier oil, thus my choice is butter. Serve and eat hot. Like traditional doughnuts they are much better hot than cold.
