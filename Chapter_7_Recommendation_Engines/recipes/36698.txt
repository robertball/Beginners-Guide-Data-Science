Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar, divided
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons instant coffee granules
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup 1% low-fat milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
cooking spray
1 cup boiling water
1 1/8 cups vanilla low-fat ice cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, coffee granules, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Combine milk, oil, and vanilla in a bowl; add to flour mixture, and stir well. Spoon batter into an 8-inch square baking dish coated with cooking spray.
Combine 1/3 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons cocoa. Sprinkle over batter. Pour 1 cup boiling water over batter (do not stir). Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched lightly in the center (cake will not test clean when a wooden pick is inserted in center). Serve warm with ice cream.
