Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
To make brownies: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter or margarine and chocolate; take off of heat. Stir in sugar, eggs and vanilla; beat well. Mix in flour, salt and nuts, if desired.
In a greased 8x8 inch baking dish, pour brownie mix.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until toothpick in the center of brownies comes out somewhat clean.
To make Raspberry Coulis: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, cook raspberries for 5 to 8 minutes; turn down to medium.
In a small bowl, combine juice and cornstarch to make a paste; add to raspberries stirring constantly until thickened. Add rind and cool.
Pool coulis on a dessert plate and place brownie portion on top of coulis; serve.

Description: 
Best if slightly undercooked but not quite runny in the center - what the English call 'squidgy'. The raspberry coulis adds a Valentine's Day note. The raspberry juice called for in this recipe should be taken from the leftover juice from the frozen raspberries.
