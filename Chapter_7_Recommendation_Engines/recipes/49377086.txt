Ingredients:
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/2 cup hot chicken broth
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite size pieces
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 egg
2 cups chopped green onions
16 chile peppers, sun-dried

Directions:
To Make Sauce: In a large bowl combine 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water. Mix together. Add garlic, ginger, sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce and white wine vinegar. Then add chicken broth and stir all together until sugar dissolves. Refrigerate until needed.
In a small amount of oil, saute the chicken until golden brown and delicious.
To Make Mixture: Place a small amount of oil in wok and heat until wok is hot. Add scallions and dried chile peppers and stir-fry briefly. Remove sauce from refrigerator and stir. Add sauce to wok. Then add fried chicken and cook until sauce thickens (add cornstarch or water as needed until sauce is as thick as you like it).

Description: 
An Asian chicken recipe without the typical oriental taste. This recipe was voted one of the top 10 dishes in Columbus by Columbus Monthly Magazine, as prepared by Chef Paul Kaewprasart of the Siam Oriental Restaurant. I removed the MSG and modified it to remove breading and frying the chicken. It goes great over white rice as a main dish for any number of people.Modified from: General Tsao's Chicken
