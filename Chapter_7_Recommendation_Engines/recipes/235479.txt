Ingredients:
2 cups Brussels sprouts, trimmed
1 cup large Yukon Gold potato chunks
1 cup large rainbow carrot chunks
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup cubed red beets
1/2 cup shallot chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set an oven rack to the second-lowest level in the oven.
Fill a bowl with lightly salted water. Place Brussels sprouts in salted water and let sit for about 15 minutes; drain.
Stir potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, beets, shallot, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour vegetables in a single layer onto a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until caramelized and cooked through, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter. They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare. I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past 'caramelized' to 'burned.'
