Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked glutinous (sticky) white rice, rinsed
2/3 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
2 leaves Chinese cabbage

Directions:
Place the rice in a bowl with enough water to cover. Allow to soak 2 hours. Drain and pour onto a platter.
Mix the ground pork, water, wine, cornstarch, soy sauce, onion, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl until all ingredients are evenly mixed. Divide and roll the mixture into balls 1-1/2 to 2 inches in size. Roll the meatballs in the soaked glutinous rice to coat completely.
Line a large bamboo steamer with the cabbage leaves. Arrange the meatballs atop the cabbage leaves.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat; place a bamboo steamer over the boiling water. Steam the meatballs until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
These tasty meatballs are easy to make. Wonderful for your Chinese New Year celebration or as an addition to a holiday buffet. Some folks dye the glutinous rice with red or green for a holiday touch. Another serving idea is to whisk together 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and garlic to taste and sprinkle over the meatballs, rice, and some steamed vegetables.
