Ingredients:
1-2 large filets of fish, I use rainbow trout regularly, best if skin is left on.
1 cup dry unseasoned breadcrumbs
1 large handful fresh dill, chopped, about 3/4 cup
1 clove garlic, minced
grated zest of 1-2 lemons
pepper
Optional: minced green onion, onion powder, garlic powder
1/3 cup olive oil, reserving half

Directions:
Combine bread crumbs, dill, garlic, lemon zest, and seasonings, stir.  You can make this part ahead and allow to sit in the fridge for several hours.  Just before baking, add about half of the olive oil to the breadcrumb mixture, stirring until moist.
Coat the fish in olive oil, then salt the skin side only with coarse sea salt (table salt if that's what you've got).  Place fish in a foil lined pan skin side down, and press the mixture evenly over the top, about 1/2 inch thick.
Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes, depending on the size of your filet.  Serve with lemon wedges and the sides of your choice.  Enjoy!
