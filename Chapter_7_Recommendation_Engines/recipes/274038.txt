Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) loaf crusty Italian bread
2 medium tomatoes, cored and cut into sixths
1/2 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 large yellow bell pepper, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 medium red onion, quartered
1/3 cup balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
1 pound leftover turkey, chopped
1/2 cup torn fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Slice or tear bread into 2 1/2-inch cubes and spread in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until just golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in a dry place. Raise temperature in oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss tomatoes, asparagus, bell pepper, and onion with 1/3 cup balsamic vinaigrette in a large bowl. Spread vegetables on a baking sheet.
Roast veggies in the preheated oven until tender, about 35 minutes.
Toss bread, veggies and their juices, leftover turkey, basil, 1/4 cup vinaigrette, garlic, salt, and pepper together on a large serving platter. Top with goat cheese and pine nuts right before serving.
