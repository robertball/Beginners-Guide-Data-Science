Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3/4 cup natural creamy peanut butter
2/3 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup milk, or more as needed
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup peeled and diced apple
1 cup peanut butter chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Melt butter in a small saucepan. Stir in peanut butter and brown sugar. Remove from heat and add milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture, mixing until just blended. Add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the batter seems dry.
Add apple and peanut butter chips, stirring gently to distribute. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

My son had the idea for these one fall Saturday morning after we had gone apple picking. They are delicious! Great for school lunches, too.
