Ingredients:
1/2 cup white granulated sugar
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons low-fat milk
assorted natural food coloring (optional)

Directions:
In a small saucepan combine the white sugar and water and simmer until dissolved, creating a sugar syrup.
In a small bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar and milk until smooth. Beat in almond extract and 2 teaspoons of the sugar syrup until icing is smooth and glossy. If icing is too thick, add more sugar syrup.
Optional: Divide icing into separate bowls, and add food colorings to each to desired intensity. Dip cookies, or paint them with a brush.
