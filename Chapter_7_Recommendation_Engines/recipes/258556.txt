Ingredients:
2 frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts, or more to taste
1/2 cup medium salsa
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup lime juice
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, or to taste
1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
1 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Combine chicken breasts, salsa, tomato sauce, lime juice, olive oil, salt, garlic salt, and pepper in an electric pressure cooker.
Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; cook chicken until no longer pink in the center, 8 minutes for thin frozen breasts and 12 minutes for thick frozen breasts. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Release pressure naturally according to manufacturer's instructions. Open pressure cooker; transfer chicken to a serving dish using tongs. Spoon 1/2 of the cooking liquid over the chicken; top with Mexican cheese.
Stir rice into the remaining cooking liquid in the pressure cooker. Add enough water to equal 2 cups of liquid. Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; cook for 12 minutes. Let pressure release naturally. Serve rice with chicken.
