Ingredients:
One package of fairly thin beef steaks (I use whatever is cheapest-- it's for stewing, so they don't need to be tender)
1 can of chopped tomatoes
1/4 cup flour
salt & pepper
1 Tbsp. Olive Oil
1 envelope dry onion soup mix
1 lb of mushrooms, thickly sliced
2 onions, sliced in thick rings
1 can of light colored beer (Corona works well)

Directions:
Salt and Pepper the steaks and lightly dredge them in flour.
Add the olive oil to the skillet and warm it over medium/high heat.
Brown the steaks in batches, making sure each side gets pretty dark.
Layer the steaks in a crock pot or a dutch oven.  First, put a layer of steak, then 1/2 the can of tomatoes, 1/2 the mushrooms, 1/2 the onions, 1/2 the soup mix.  Then repeat.
Pour the beer over all.
Cover and let cook until meat is tender.  In a crock pot on low, this can take 6 hours.  On the stove top (low heat) it can be about 1-2 hours.
Place the meat on a platter and if the sauce is thick enough, serve along side.  If you would like it a bit thicker, cook it for a bit on the stove, uncovered.  It will reduce.
Serve with rice or mashed potatoes.
