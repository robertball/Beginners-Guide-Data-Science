Ingredients:
One bag (6 oz. or 175 gr) of totopos
1/2 onion
1 can of tomato sauce (not Ketchup!)
2 (or 3) jalapeños
1/2 cup of water
Sour cream
Grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Put the onion (roughly chopped), the tomato sauce, the jalapeños and the water in a blender and blend completely.
Pour this mix into a pot and heat until it boils.
When it does, put in the totopos and leave them alone for a minute so that they soak a little in this sauce.
The totopos will not soak completely, so after a while you'll need to stir a little, but try to do it gently, so that the totopos do not entirely lose their shape.
Serve with sour cream and parmesan cheese on top. Guacamole is also a good accompaniment for this recipe.

Description: 
This is the original chilaquiles recipe that I was taught by my Mexican friends Carla and Adriana some months ago. It's a typical mexican breakfast. They're traditionally made out of home-made totopos (the corn tortilla chips), but the ones one can get at the supermarket are just fine too.
