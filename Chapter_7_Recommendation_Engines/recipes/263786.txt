Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup grated carrots

2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup raisins (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.
Combine butter, sugar, and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in zucchini, carrots, and vanilla extract.
Combine flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Mix into the creamed butter mixture. Stir in raisins and walnuts. Pour batter into the greased muffin cups.
