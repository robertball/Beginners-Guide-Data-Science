Title:
Chocolate Peanut Butter Puff Squares Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 cups puffed wheat cereal
4 cups puffed rice cereal
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup corn syrup
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup peanut butter
6 jumbo marshmallows

Directions:
Place puffed cereals in a large bowl, and set aside. Grease one 9x12 pan.
Grease the rim of a medium saucepan to prevent boil-over. Place the cocoa powder, corn syrup, brown sugar, peanut butter and marshmallows in saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often until mixture comes to a full rolling boil. Remove from heat and pour over puffed cereal, working quickly to evenly coat all the little puffs. Using a buttered spatula, (I usually just oil my hands, but ***careful*** Only do this if you have tough skin, mixture is scalding hot and can result in burns!) press mixture into the prepared pan. Allow to cool, then cut in squares and wrap individually, or store in an airtight container.

Description: 
Great Recipe although I often change it up a little to satisfy the 'chocolate-peanut-butter addicts'.
First, I substitute Peanut Butter for the butter/margarine and add about 6 jumbo marshmallows to the saucepan.
I also like using a mix of puffed wheat and puffed rice cereal.Modified from: Chocolate Puffed Wheat Squares
