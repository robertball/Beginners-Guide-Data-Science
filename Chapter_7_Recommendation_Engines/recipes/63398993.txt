2 c instant milk
3/4 c cornstarch
1/4 c instant chicken bouillon
1 t onion powder
1/2 t dried thyme
1/2 t dried basil
1/4 t pepper

Directions:
Combine these and store in an airtight container.
To use for soup, combine 1/3 c mix and 1 1/2 c water.  Bring to a boil while stirring often.  Add a vegetable for more flavor, such as diced celery (for cream of celery soup), or some sliced mushrooms (for cream of mushroom soup), or some diced broccoli (for cream of broccoli soup).
To use for any recipe calling for a can of cream of mushroom, chicken or celery soup can be replaced with 1/3 c mix and 1 1/4 c water.  Boil for a few minutes, stirring often.
