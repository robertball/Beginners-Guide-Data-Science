Ingredients:
3 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, divided
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine sweet potatoes and oil in a bowl and toss to coat. Lay on a shallow baking sheet.
Roast until slightly charred, about 45 minutes, turning regularly to prevent burning on the bottom.
While potatoes are roasting, combine 1/3 cup brown sugar and flour in a medium-sized bowl. Add 3 tablespoons butter and cut into the dry ingredients. Stir in pecans until evenly mixed. Set crumble mixture aside.
Combine 1/3 cup brown sugar, remaining 7 tablespoons butter, eggs, evaporated milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, cloves, and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Set aside until potatoes are done roasting.
Remove potatoes from oven and reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Transfer sweet potatoes to the brown sugar mixture in the large mixing bowl. Toss until well combined.
Spoon sweet potato mixture into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Top with crumble mixture, distributing evenly to form a crust.
Bake in the hot oven until lightly browned on top, 30 to 40 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
