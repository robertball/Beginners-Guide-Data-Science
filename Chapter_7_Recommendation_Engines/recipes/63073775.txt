Ingredients:
8 oz reduced fat pork sausage
1 small onion, chopped
4 eggs
1 chopped jalapeno
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 tsp salt to eggs
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cheddar cheese soup
1/2 cup shredded low fat Cheddar cheese
2 oz. Mexican Velveeta, cubed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7 x 11-inch baking dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage, jalapeno and onion. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer sausage mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Add the cubes of Velveeta. Whisk together the eggs and milk. Add 1/2 tsp. salt. Stir in the cheddar cheese soup. Pour egg mixture over the sausage, and top with 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the eggs are set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Easy to make breakfast casserole. As my shopping is rather limited where I live, I had to substitute and use cheddar cheese soup and Mexican Velveeta. In making it again, I don't really see a need for the soup. Velveeta and fresh jalapenos are great flavor. Next time, I would add a layer of hash browns for crust.Modified from: Buenos Dias!
