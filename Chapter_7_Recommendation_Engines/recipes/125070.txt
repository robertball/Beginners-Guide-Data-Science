Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Separate dough into 10 biscuits; flatten into 5-in. circles. Press each into the bottom and up the sides of a greased muffin cup; set aside. In a skillet, brown ground beef; drain. In a small bowl, mix ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar and chili powder; stir until smooth.  Add to meat and mix well. Divide the meat mixture among biscuit-lined muffins cups, using about 1/4 cup for each. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from tin and serving.

Description: 
Our daughter's friends all 'plowed' through a batch of these sandwiches at her 'barnyard birthday party'. The tangy barbecue sauce, fluffy biscuits and cheddar cheese make them real kid-pleasers.                                           --Karen Kenney, Harvard, Illinois
