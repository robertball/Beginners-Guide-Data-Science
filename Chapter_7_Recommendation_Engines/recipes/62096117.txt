Ingredients:
1 (8oz) Package of cream cheese, softened
1 (8oz) container of sour cream (I use about 3/4 of container but you can use it all if desired)
1 package taco seasoning
1 medium diced tomato
1 cup shredded cheese
1 cup shredded lettuce

Directions:
In a bowl, Combine cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning until well blended.
Spread evenly on large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan
On top of above mixture, layer shredded cheese, tomato and shredded lettuce until all ingredients are used up.
Refrigerate until ready to serve. It's best to cover it and let it sit in refrigerator overnight for flavors to blend well. Then you can top it with tomatoes etc. Before serving.
Enjoy with your favorite tortilla chips.
