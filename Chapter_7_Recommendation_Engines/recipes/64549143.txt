Cloud Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
3 large eggs, separated
¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
2 ounces cream cheese, very soft
1 Tablespoon sugar

Directions:
Beat egg whites with cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.
Meanwhile, mix together egg yolks, cream cheese and sugar until completely combined (there should be no visible cream cheese left, I mix first with a wooden spoon then use a hand-held egg beater until very smooth).
Fold egg whites into cream cheese mixture, taking care not to deflate egg whites (do not stir)!
Carefully scoop onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper into 5-6 “buns”. Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until cloud bread is lightly browned.
Use as you would with regular bread! I like to top mine with peanut butter and bananas, toast it with jam or with my favorite lunch meat and fillings!

Description: 
Cloud Bread is soft and fluffy - like a cloud! It’s a great substitute for “regular” bread and is carb-free. Although it’s not firm enough to replace bread in a regular sandwich, I like to use one “slice” and top it with my favorites (even lunch meat and toppings)!
