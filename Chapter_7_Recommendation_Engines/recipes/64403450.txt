Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped
1 small eggplant, diced into 1/2-inch cubes
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup cooked brown rice, warm
1 tomato, roughly chopped
1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs
1/4 cup vegetable broth
1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F. Brush an 8-inch square pan with olive oil.
In the meantime, heat over medium-high heat in a large skillet onion and eggplant until soft and lightly browned and vegetables have reduced in size. If vegetables begin to stick, add a little bit of water to the skillet. Stir in garlic and let cook 1 minute more until fragrant. Transfer to a large bowl and add beans, brown rice, tomato, breadcrumbs, vegetable broth, salt, pepper, and basil. Mix and mash the mixture with a large spoon until the mixture holds together. Adjust seasoning to taste.
Transfer the mixture into the prepared pan and pack it down very firmly using the back of a large spoon. It is important to pack it firmly so that it holds together while baking. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix marinara sauce and brown sugar. Pour the marinara sauce on top of the meatloaf and cover the top of the loaf pan with foil.
Bake for 40 minutes, covered, then remove foil, and bake for an additional 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
