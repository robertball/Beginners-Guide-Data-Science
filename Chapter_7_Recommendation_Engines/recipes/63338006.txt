Ingredients:
1 brie wheel
Apricot jam
Almond slices

Directions:
Remove rind from top of brie and place on oven-proof dish. Spread with apricot jam, covering the entire top of the brie. Sprinkle the almond slices on top.
Bake uncovered at 325F for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Serve the brie in a fancy round chafing dish with a lit Sterno underneath.  This will keep the brie nice and warm and gooey!
Serve with nice crackers or sliced baguettes.
