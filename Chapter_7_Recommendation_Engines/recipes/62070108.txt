Ingredients:
1 lb Velveeta Light processed cheese
2 tomatoes (4-5 Romas)
2-3 Roasted Poblano peppers
1 roasted jalapeno
1 roasted red bell peppers
handful of Cilantro
1 medium white onion
1 teaspoon cumin
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 - 1/2 cup half & half

Directions:
Roast poblano, jalapeno and red pepper under broiler until black on all sides. Remove from oven and place in zip lock bag to cool). Cut Velveeta into small cubes and place in slow cooker on low heat. Dice tomatoes, onion, garlic and cilantro and add to cheese. Once peppers are cooled, remove skin, membranes and seeds and finely dice and add to cheese mixture. Add cumin and half and half (using only enough half and half to make mixture slightly runny - better to add not enough at first than too much). Stir occasionally. Queso dip is ready when hot and cheese has melted.
