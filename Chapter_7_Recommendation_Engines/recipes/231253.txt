24 vanilla wafer cookies
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Place a vanilla wafer into the bottom of each muffin cup.
Beat cream cheese, sugar, eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a bowl until fluffy. Spoon mixture into the muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother-in-law many years ago. It's a family favorite and a great treat for potlucks. It's very easy to make but looks like you've spent hours on it.
