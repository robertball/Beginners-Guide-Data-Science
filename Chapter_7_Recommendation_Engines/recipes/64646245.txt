1 (8 oz) can tomato sauce
tomato sauce can of water
1 tsp. all-purpose flour
1 tbls. chili powder
1 tsp. salt
½ tsp. pepper
½ tsp. onion powder
½ tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. cumin
1 can (15.5 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
Pico de Gallo:
2 large tomatoes, diced
½ cup finely diced red onion
1 jalapeño, seeds and ribs removed, minced
½ cup cilantro, minced

Green Chili Queso:
2 Tbls. butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeño, minced
1 generous tablespoon cornstarch
1½ cups milk
4 oz cream cheese, cut into cubes
8 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
1 (4 oz) can green chiles
salt and pepper
Burritos:
4 large (12-inch) tortillas
2 cups Fritos corn chips
sour cream
fresh sliced jalapenos

Directions:
Cook the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through.
Add the tomato sauce, then fill the can with water and add that water. Stir in the flour, chili powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin and drained black beans.
Cook until it starts to bubble, then reduce the heat and continue to simmer until the chili is thick, 30-45 minutes.
In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, red onion, jalapeño and cilantro. Stir in the lime juice and season to taste with salt.
Set aside.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan.
Add the garlic and jalapeño and cook until softened, 2-3 minutes.
Whisk in the cornstarch.
Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly.
Bring to a boil and let cook until slightly thickened 3-5 minutes, then add in the cream cheese.
Cook, whisking constantly, until the cream cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth.
Slowly add in the cheddar cheese, stirring until melted.
Stir in the green chiles. Keep warm.
Working with one tortilla at a time, leaving 1½ to 2 inches of a border on each side, start layering with sour cream, jalapenos, pico de gallo, about ½ cup of Fritos, queso sauce, and then chili.
Fold the edges over the filling, then wrap and roll the sides into a burrito. Serve immediately.

Description: 
I swear I wake up some days with an appetite of a 16-year old boy.  I was craving something spicy and crunchy and Mexican and then I saw some mini bags of Fritos in our “snack” drawer.  I know healthy inspiration.

Well, let’s just say I did a couple of extra yoga classes after I ate this silly, obscenely amazing burrito.   Try this at least once because it’s just that goodand naughty.  And who doesn’t like to be naughty once in awhile?
