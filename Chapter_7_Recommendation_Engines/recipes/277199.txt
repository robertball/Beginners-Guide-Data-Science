Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 pound pecan halves
1/4 cup powdered sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine butter, cream cheese, and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer until well combined.  Add flour and mix until combined.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and set on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on bottom, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool, 8 to 10 minutes more. Place one pecan half on top of each cookie and dust lightly with powdered sugar.

Description: 
So easy to bake (no eggs involved) and delicious--I modified a basic shortbread recipe to jazz it up and it turned out a lot like a pecan sandie, but homemade.
