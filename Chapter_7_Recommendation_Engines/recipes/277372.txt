Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, chopped
10 cups cold water
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 zucchini, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1 medium head red cabbage, chopped
1 medium head green cabbage, chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large (at least 3-quart) pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Add celery, zucchini, and bell peppers. Boil for 7 minutes. Stir in all cabbages and continue to boil until cabbages are as soft as you like, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Carrots double in sugar once they're cooked, so if you're watching your sugars this is a flavorful alternative to conventional vegetarian cabbage soup. A bit of cold sour cream in each spoonful makes an already tasty soup even more delicious.
