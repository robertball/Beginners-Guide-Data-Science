Ingredients:
20 ounces elbow macaroni
1/2 cup butter
3/8 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups milk
1 1/2 pounds shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large pot over medium heat; stir flour into butter until smooth. Stream milk into the butter mixture while stirring; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add Cheddar cheese in small batches, stirring each into the milk mixture and melting until adding the next. Add macaroni and stir to coat. Pour macaroni into prepared baking dish.
Stir bread crumbs and melted butter together in a small bowl; sprinkle over the macaroni.
Bake in preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.
