Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
¼ tsp, baking powder
¼ tsp. salt
2/3 cup sugar
1 cup dried cherries or blueberries
¼ cup finely chopped almonds or pecans
Two beaten eggs
½ tsp. almond, vanilla or anise extract
1 stick of unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Mix dry ingredients and then make a well in the center and add the eggs and butter.  Using a spatula, stir and incorporate the ingredients until a ball forms.  On a stone cookie sheet shape in the dough into a 12 inch log, 1 inch high.  Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes until lightly browned and a toothpick in the center comes out clean.  Remove.
Leave the oven on and allow the cookie to rest for 5 minutes.  Using a sharp, serrated knife, point side down, carefully slice the dough into 1 inch slices.  Turn them carefully onto their sides and bake for 5 minutes.  Remove the pan and turn the cookies over.  Bake five more minutes.
Shut the oven off and let the cookies remain in the oven for 15 more minutes, turning half-way through.  Remove them and turn them over once more.  Allow to cool on a rack.

Description: 
Easy to make, Italian treat.  While they taste delicious with an espresso, my favorite way to enjoy them is by dipping them in a nice glass of Italian red wine--just like my Nana did.
