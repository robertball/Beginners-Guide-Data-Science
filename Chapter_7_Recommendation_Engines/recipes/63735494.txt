Title:
Chicken Rub (For Whole Slow-Cooker Chicken) Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1/2 cup sea salt
1/2 cup onion powder
1/2 cup thyme
1/4 cup garlic powder
1/4 cup sage
2 Tablespoons cayenne (red) pepper (optional)
2 Tablespoons black pepper
Use approximately 1 teaspoon per pound of chicken. My chickens are usually around 4 pounds, thus 4 teaspoons.

Directions:
Combine and mix all ingredients in an airtight container.
When ready to use:
Loosely chop one onion and place it in the bottom of the slow cooker.
Remove any giblets from the chicken and then rub the spice mixture all over (using approximately 4 teaspoons per 4 lbs of chicken). I recommend putting some of the spices inside the cavity and under the skin covering the breasts.
Put prepared chicken on top of the onions in the slow cooker, cover it, and turn it on to high. There is no need to add any liquid.
Cook for 4 – 5 hours on high (for a 3 or 4 pound chicken) or until the chicken is falling off the bone. Don’t forget to make your homemade stock with the leftover bones!
