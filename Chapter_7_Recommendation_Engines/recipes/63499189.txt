Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 cup water
1 envelope taco seasoning mix
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 pound shredded chicken
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (11 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup shredded Mexican-style or cheddar cheese
1 (7.5 ounce) package corn bread mix
1 egg
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.
Mix tomato sauce, water, taco seasoning mix, chicken and chili powder together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Mix in black beans, corn, and soup until thoroughly combined.
Pour chicken mixture into prepared baking dish. Top with shredded cheese. Whisk corn bread mix, egg, and milk in a bowl, and spoon the batter over the chicken mix.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the corn bread topping is browned and set, about 30 minutes.
