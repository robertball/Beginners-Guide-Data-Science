Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup minced onion
1 quart vegetable broth, divided
4 cups chopped kale leaves
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1 cube vegetable bouillon (such as Edward and SonsÂ® Gluten-free)
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1 cup almond milk

Directions:
Spray the inside of a stockpot with cooking spray; place over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in the stockpot until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion and about 2 tablespoons vegetable broth to garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir kale into onion mixture; cook until slightly wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Add chickpeas, remaining vegetable broth, vegetable bouillon, and curry powder; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until heated through, about 15 minutes. Add almond milk and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
A warm vegan soup that my whole family loves. Totally quick and easy, and super healthy to boot! Add more kale if you don't have picky eaters! Four cups of kale and curry is on the mild side, you can always add more to your taste. We've also served this over leftover pasta for the kids. They love it!
