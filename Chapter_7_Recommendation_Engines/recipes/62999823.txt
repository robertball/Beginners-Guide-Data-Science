Ingredients:
4 Large eggs
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
2 tbl. brown sugar
2 tbl. vegetable oil
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 to 2 tsp. cinnamon (depending on your own tastes)
12 slices of thick hearty bread (I recommend Grandpa's Oven brand Cinnamon Swirl) sliced into triangles (cut for presentation purposes only, not necessary)

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients except the bread.  Heat griddle or pan to medium high heat.  Dip slices of bread one at a time to fully coat and immediately place on hot greased or non stick griddle or pan.  Cook as you would basic french toast.  Serve with your favorite toppings.

Description: 
This is the best french toast I've ever had.  It's more like french toast cooked inside a pancake.
