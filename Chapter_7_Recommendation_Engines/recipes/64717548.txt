Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup sugar
¾ tsp. baking powder
¾ tsp. baking soda
½ tsp. salt
½ cup milk
2 eggs
½ cup vegetable oil
1 tsp. grated orange zest
1 cup fresh blueberries
6 tsp. raw sugar (for sprinkling on top)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375.
Grease a muffin pan and set aside. In a large bowl sift together flour, ¾ cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
In a small bowl whisk together milk, eggs, oil, and orange zest. Pour milk mixture into the well and stir just until combined.
Using a rubber scraper, fold in blueberries.
Using a cookie scoop, spoon approximately 1/3 cup of batter into the muffin tins with a cookie scoop. Fill any empty tins with 1 Tbsp. of water so the muffins bake evenly.
Sprinkle each muffin with ½ tsp of raw sugar.
Bake muffins at 375 for 23-25 minutes.
Remove pan from oven. Immediately remove muffins from pan and cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
