Ingredients:
5 slices bread, cubed
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped ham
7 eggs
1/2 cup 2% milk
2 teaspoons mustard
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread bread cubes in a 8x12-inch casserole dish.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, and green pepper; cook and stir until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in ham until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Whisk eggs and milk together in a separate bowl; mix in mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Stir in mushroom-ham mixture and cheeses. Pour into the casserole dish. Stir well to moisten the bread cubes. Cover baking dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, about 25 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until top starts to brown, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe is as good as any classic ham and egg casserole dish. From start to finish, it takes about 1 hour - there's no overnight soak! Delicious, even for the picky eater. Also, a nice way to use up leftover vegetables and ham.
