Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 cup white sugar, divided
1/3 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white chocolate chips
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir 1 cup flour and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl. Mash butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs; press into bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until crusty and golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Sprinkle chocolate chips over the crust.
Beat eggs, lemon juice, and lemon zest together until the eggs are beaten. Stir remaining 1/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup sugar into the egg mixture; pour over the chocolate chips and crust.
Bake until set in the middle, about 15 minutes more. Cool slightly in baking dish set on a wire cooling rack. Sift confectioners' sugar over the bars and cool completely before cutting to serve.
