Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cold butter
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 cup chopped mandarin oranges, well drained
Additional sugar
ORANGE BUTTER:
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons orange marmalade

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flours, sugar, baking powder, orange peel and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  In a bowl, whisk milk and egg. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Stir in oranges.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10 times. Pat into a 6-in. circle. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Cut into eight wedges.
Separate wedges and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, beat butter and marmalade until fluffy. Serve with warm scones.
