https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 1/2 Ounces Unsweetened Chocolate
1/4 cup Evaporated Milk
1/3 cup Sugar

Directions:
1 - Melt chocolate in dbl. boiler or microwave.  (If you microwave it, be CAREFUL not to burn it.  30 seconds at a time and stir between each 30 sec.)
2 - Pour Evaporated Milk into electric blender, add sugar, and start blender.
3 - Pour melted chocolate into milk & sugar.
4 - Blend on low speed until it thickens (about 50 seconds – the sound of the mixer will change).
5 - Pour evenly over cake, brownies, etc.  – may need to use a spatula to get it out of the blender.
For thicker frosting, or for a cake, I double it.  For the Bundt Cake,  add about 1/8 cup more Evap. Milk (just a tiny bit)  so it will run down the cake like a glaze.
Awesome over the "Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake"
