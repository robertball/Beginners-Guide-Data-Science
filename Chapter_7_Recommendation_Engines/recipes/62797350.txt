Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups chicken stock
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1 cup white wine
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (10 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
While the chicken is baking, place the chicken stock, garlic, and onion in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook until liquid is reduced by half. Stir in wine, and continue to cook until reduced and slightly thickened.
Add the mushrooms and artichokes to the chicken stock mixture. Reduce heat, and simmer until mushrooms are tender. Season with salt and pepper, and serve over the baked chicken.

Description: 
Chicken breasts with mushrooms and artichokes in a white wine sauce. This is my personal favorite. Serve with saffron rice, a green veggie of your choice, and the rest of the wine, of course! Enjoy!Modified from: Chicken Jerusalem II
