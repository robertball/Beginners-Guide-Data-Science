Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 cups overripe bananas, mashed (3-4 bananas)
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp maple extract
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 tsp liquid stevia (or 1/2 cup more maple syrup)
1/4 cup maple whiskey (or bourbon)
1/4 cup milk
1 cup walnuts, chopped, optional

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350ºF and lightly grease 4 mini loaf pans (2 cup capacity) or one standard 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a small bowl, stir the flour, salt, and baking soda together. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mash the bananas, and add the yogurt and eggs, stirring until well combined. Add the vanilla extract, maple extract, maple syrup, and liquid stevia, stirring until smooth. Add the whiskey and milk, stirring until smooth. Slowly add the flour mixture, and stir until just incorporated. Fold in the walnuts, if using.
Divide the batter evenly between the 4 mini loaf pans and spread evenly with a spatula (or pour batter into one standard loaf pan).
In the mini loaf pans, bake at 350ºF for 35-40 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.
In a standard loaf pan, bake at 350ºF for 65-75 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.
Allow the loaves to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store leftovers at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
These loaves may be frozen, tightly wrapped, for up to 2 months.

Description: 
Who doesn't love banana pancakes?  Because that’s pretty much why I had to make maple banana bread.  It’s like eating a banana pancake drizzled in syrup, but it’s not as messy, and there are crunchy walnuts involved.. all good things.  The whiskey doesn’t hurt, either.  Pretty much, this is your standard banana bread made 100 times better because of the maple (and the whiskey).
