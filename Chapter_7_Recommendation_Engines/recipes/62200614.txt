In medium saucepan bring first 9 ingredients to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered until sauce reduces by about half (appx. 15 min.) If you don't have the time, you can add a cornstarch slurry to it.
Meanwhile in a large plastic bag, combine the Flour, salt, paprika, cayenne and garlic powder.  Add wings and shake to coat.
Deep fry wings in oil 13 minutes or until juices run clear.  Drain on paper towels. Place in a large bowl and add sauce.  Toss to coat.
