Ingredients:
2 cups bulgur wheat, or cracked wheat
2 cups boiling water
1 1/2 cups chopped parsley
3/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped
1 bunch chopped scallions including tops
4 tomatoes, chopped
Romaine lettuce leaves
1/4 cup high polyunsaturated oil
3/4 cup lemon juice
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pour boiling water over bulgur. Let stand while preparing vegetables. When wheat is soft and no longer hot, stir in vegetables (except lettuce). Mix dressing (last six ingredients) and stir into salad. Chill overnight. Surround it with lettuce leaves and serve.
Note: You may use 3 tablespoons dried mint and 1/2 cup parsley instead of chopped fresh mint.
