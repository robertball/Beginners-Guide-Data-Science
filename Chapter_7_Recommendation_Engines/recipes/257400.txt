Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs
2 tablespoons water
4 cups bread crumbs
2 mangoes, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons mango jam
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
2 shallots, chopped
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Place chicken on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even 1/4-inch thickness.
Pour flour into a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs with water in a separate bowl. Spread bread crumbs on a shallow plate.
Dredge each chicken breast in flour. Dip into the egg mixture; press into the bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place breaded chicken on a large plate.
Combine mangoes, cream cheese, heavy cream, and mango jam in a blender; puree into a smooth sauce. Transfer sauce to the refrigerator to thicken up.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded chicken until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side.
Spoon mango sauce over cooked chicken. Garnish with chopped shallots and sea salt.
