Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
½ cup Worcestershire sauce
¾ cup honey
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In an electric skillet, combine the chicken cubes, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 cup of honey, salt and pepper. Let sit for a minute to mingle the flavors, then turn the heat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). If using a regular skillet, turn the heat to medium-high.
Cook chicken for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain off juices, and then add the remaining honey. Continue cooking until the sauce becomes thick and sticks to the chicken.

Description: 
The easiest 'gourmet' chicken bits around! It's spicy and sweet at the same time. The longer you cook it, the thicker the sauce will be. We like ours thick!
