Ingredients:
4 jalapenos
4 tbs cream cheese -(light will also work)
8 slices of bacon - cooked (not crispy though)
8 oz Colby jack cheese-sliced in 1-2" slices - size should be the same width/length and each pepper half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Half the jalapenos longwise.  Scoop out the seeds.  Bake peppers for 15 min to soften. Cut bacon slices into 3 pieces (about the length of a pepper). When peppers are cool enough to handle, put 1/2 tbs of cream cheese into each pepper half.  Next, lay each piece of bacon on top of each pepper. Place a slice of cheese on top of each pepper. Bake for approximately 10 minutes or until  cheese is melted.
