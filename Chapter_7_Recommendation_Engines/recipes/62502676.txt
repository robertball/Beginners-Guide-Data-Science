Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
1 tsp baking soda
2 eggs
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 cup cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups Nestle Toll House milk chocolate chips (or your favorite brand)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl
Add eggs and softened butter, making sure not to overwork the dough
Stir in cream cheese and vanilla
Add chocolate chips last, folding them into the mixture gently
If dough is too warm or soft, refrigerate for 20 minutes or until slightly firm
Line balls of dough onto tinfoil-lined cookie sheet and bake in oven for 13 minutes, or until cookies are golden brown
Eat them quick before your friends or family (or dog, in my case) does!

Description: 
These cookies are nice and chewy. You'll want to eat 5 of them, but they are wayyyyyy too sweet and decadent! (I've eaten that many, regardless.)
