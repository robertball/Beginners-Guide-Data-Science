Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound Italian sausage links
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 (1 pound) package fresh gnocchi
chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish
grated Romano or Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausages and cook until browned and firm, about 10 minutes. Cut sausages into 1/2 inch slices, return to the skillet, and continue cooking until no longer pink. Drain sausage slices on a paper towel lined plate.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning; cook until the garlic softens, about 2 minutes. Pour in crushed tomatoes, water, salt, sugar, and remaining 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi and cook for 2 to 3  minutes until pasta floats; drain.
Meanwhile, stir Italian sausage slices into sauce to rewarm. Toss pasta with sauce, and sprinkle with chopped parsley and grated Romano cheese to serve.
