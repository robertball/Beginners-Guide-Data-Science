Description: 
Smooth, buttery, butterscotch concoction mean to resemble a drink you'd find in Harry Potter's magical world. It's perfect for a cool, snowy or rainy day and a great alternative to hot chocolate. You could top this with some whipped cream. Substitute butterscotch schnapps for a more adult version. You can also use soy milk in place of the milk if you prefer.
