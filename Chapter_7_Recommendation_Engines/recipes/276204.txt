Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 links chicken sausage, or more to taste
1 pound ground chicken
1 bunch green onions, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced
1/2 white onion, diced
1 cup crumbled blue cheese, divided
3/4 cup bread crumbs
1 cup Buffalo wing sauce, divided
2 eggs
1/8 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Remove chicken sausage from its casing and place in a large bowl with ground chicken.
Set aside 1/4 cup each of green onions, celery, jalapeno peppers, and white onion. Add remaining green onions, celery, jalapeno peppers, and white onion to the ground chicken-sausage mixture; mix to combine. Mix in 3/4 cup blue cheese, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce, eggs, onion powder, salt, and pepper until all ingredients are incorporated and chopped vegetables are evenly distributed. Scrape mixture out of the bowl with a spatula into the prepared loaf pan.
Pour remaining 1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce on top of meatloaf. Sprinkle with reserved green onions, celery, jalapeno peppers, white onion, and remaining 1/4 cup blue cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until sides begin to bubble and shrink away from the edges of the pan, about 1 hour 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
