Meanwhile, make the crab cakes.  Mix the mayo, parsley mustard, lemon juice and Old Bay in a large bowl until combined.  Add the panko and mix again.  Add the crab and mix, taking care not to crush the meat.  Shape the crab mixture into 8 patties, each about 3 inches in diameter.  Cover and refrigerat 15 to 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 200.  Line a large baking dish with a brown paper bag or a double layer of paper towels.  Pour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet to come 1/2 inch up the side and heat over medium-high heat until the oil is hot but not smoking.  Add the crab cakes in batches and cook until the underside are golden brown, about 2 minutes.  Transfer to the lined baking dish and keep them warm in the oven while cooking the remaining cakes.
