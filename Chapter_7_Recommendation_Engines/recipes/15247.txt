Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/2 cup butter flavored shortening
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
2 (10 ounce) jars maraschino cherries, drained

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the shortening and cream cheese until well blended. Stir in the flour, you may need to use your hands to help it form a dough. If the mixture seems too dry, add a couple of teaspoons of water. Cover and chill several hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets.
Before rolling out the dough, dust the rolling surface heavily with confectioners' sugar. Roll the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 1x4 inch strips. Place a cherry on the end of each strip. Roll up each strip starting with the cherry. Place on prepared cookie sheets and dust with a little of the confectioners' sugar.
Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should brown slightly. Dust again with the confectioners' sugar. Allow cookies to cool before serving, the cherries are very hot!
