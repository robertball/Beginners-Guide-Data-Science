Ingredients:
2 eggs whites
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup sugar
1 1/3 cup Dinomite

Directions:
Lightly grease a cookie sheet; set it aside.
Dismember and debone the Dinomite. Chop it into 1/2 inch cubes. Avoid using the head. You can mount that on the wall at a later date. Slightly brown Dinomte cubes.
In a medium mixing bowl beat egg whites and vanilla with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff.
Fold in Dinomite.
Drop small rounded teaspoons of Dinomite Fluffy Bites dough on greased cookie sheet 2 inches apart. Bake 20 minutes or until edges are brown.
Remove from sheet and place on cooling rack. Yields 30 bites.
