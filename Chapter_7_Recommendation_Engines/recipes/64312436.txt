Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup(s) broth, chicken, less sodium
1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons vinegar, balsamic
2 clove(s) garlic peeled and halved
1 sprig(s) rosemary, fresh
1 leaf bay leaves
2 fillet(s) chicken, breast, boneless, skinless trimmed (1/2 pound total)
1 tablespoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 tablespoon shallot(s) chopped
1/2 teaspoon pepper, black ground
salt to taste
3 cup(s) lettuce, mixed greens torn
1 medium pepper(s), red, bell roasted and cut into thin strips
1/2 tablespoon nuts, pine nuts toasted
1 tablespoon parsley, fresh chopped, preferably flat-leaved

Directions:
Combine broth, vinegar, garlic, fresh rosemary sprigs (or 1 teaspoon dried) and bay leaf in a wide saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Add chicken breasts, cover and poach gently just until the flesh is no longer pink inside, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and keep warm.
Boil the poaching liquid until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain, discard garlic, rosemary and bay leaf and pour 1/2 cup poaching liquid into a small bowl. Whisk in oil, shallots and pepper. Season with salt if desired.
Toss greens in a large bowl with 1/4 cup of the dressing. Arrange on individual plates. Carve chicken into thin slices and arrange over greens. Garnish with red pepper and drizzle the remaining dressing over chicken and peppers. Sprinkle pine nuts, parsley and remaining 1 teaspoon fresh (or 1/2 teaspoon dried) rosemary over the chicken.
