Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef top round or sirloin steak, 3/4 to 1 inch thick
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
1 medium onion, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped gingerroot
2 medium green bell peppers, cut into 3/4 inch-wide strips
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons sugar, if desired
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 medium tomatoes
6 cups hot cooked rice

Directions:
Trim excess fat from beef.  Cut beef into 2x1/4-inch strips.  (Beef is easier to cut if partially frozen, about 1 hour.)
Heat oil in wok or 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook beef in oil about 5 minutes, turning frequently, until brown.
Stir in water, onion, garlic and gingerroot.  Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low.  Cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes for round steak, 5 to 8 minutes for sirloin steak, adding bell peppers during last 5 minutes of simmering, until beef is tender and peppers are crisp-tender.
Mix cornstarch, sugar and soy sauce; stir into beef mixture.  Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.  Boil and stir 1 minute.
Cut each tomato into 8 wedges and place on beef mixture.  Cover and cook over low heat about 3 minutes or just until tomatoes are heated through.  Serve with rice.
