Ingredients:
5 ounces honey
4 ounces white sugar
3 ounces chopped pine nuts
3 ounces chopped walnuts
3 ounces chopped almonds
3 ounces chopped candied pineapple
3 ounces chopped crystallized ginger
3 ounces chopped dried dates
2 ounces unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/3 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or as needed for dusting

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line an 8- or 9-inch baking pan with a removable bottom with rice paper or parchment paper, including the sides.
Combine honey and sugar in a small pan over low heat and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Bring to a gentle boil, and do not stir once syrup begins to boil. Heat to 240 degrees F (115 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat and stir in pine nuts, walnuts, almonds, pineapple, ginger, dates, cocoa powder, coriander, allspice, and nutmeg. Mixture will be very stiff.
Press mixture into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven and place pan on a cooling rack to cool completely.
Remove panforte from the baking pan and dust with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
When visiting Florence, Italy I came across this dessert and just fell in love with it. Panforte (strong bread) is a wonderful dessert and addition to a cup of coffee. After trying out a few recipes, I made my own. which is enjoyed by many.
