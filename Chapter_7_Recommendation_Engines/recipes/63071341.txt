Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
4 cloves garlic, crushed
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Rub the fish fillets with the crushed garlic, then place them in a shallow, non-reactive dish.
Spoon the olive oil over the fish until they are coated.  Place the onion on top of the fish. Cover the fish and refrigerate overnight to allow the fish to soak in the marinade.
If baking the fish, transfer it to a 9x13 inch baking dish along with the olive oil, garlic, and onion.
Sprinkle the fish with the cayenne or white pepper.
Bake at 350ยบ for 30 minutes.
If you are grilling the fish, wrap the fish and oil, garlic, onion, and pepper in aluminum foil.
Grill until fish is flaky.
