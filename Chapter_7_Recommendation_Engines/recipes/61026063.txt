Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste
1/2 cup margarine, divided
1 stalk celery, leaves removed

Directions:
Preheat grill to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken in a roasting pan (making sure the pan will fit on your grill with the grill's lid closed), and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.
Cover the chicken with foil and cook on the grill with the lid closed for 1 hour- 1 hour 15 minutes, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), removing the foil for the last 15 minutes to brown. Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.
