Ingredients:
2 C. Heavy whipping cream
1 C. Milk
1 can Sweetened Condensed Milk
1/2 tsp. Vanilla
1 tsp. Mint Extract (not peppermint)
1 bag semi-sweet chocolate chunks

Directions:
Freeze Cuisinart bowl for at least 12 hours, it's best to just store it in the freezer when not in use.  Mix all ingredients in a bowl, pour into ice cream maker and let churn for 20-30 minutes.  For firmer ice cream, churn for 20-30 minutes then cover and freeze until it reaches desired consistency.
Ice cream will not be green unless you add food coloring. I did about 7 drops of neon green and 4 drops of neon blue and it was perfect!  Enjoy!  I'll be trying this recipe with crushed Oreos or Andes Mints next time.
