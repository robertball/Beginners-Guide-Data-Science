Ingredients:
2 cups chopped, cooked chicken
1/2 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
1 (7 ounce) can prepared green chile salsa
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups whipping cream
oil for frying
12 corn tortillas
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix together chicken, chilies, and salsa.
In a wide, shallow dish stir together salt and whipping cream.
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Fry each tortilla for a few seconds, until it blisters, and immediately dip into cream and salt.
Fill fried tortillas with chicken mixture. Roll and place flap side down in a baking dish. Pour remaining cream over tortillas, and sprinkle with cheese.
Bake, uncovered, in a preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
My husband lived in Mexico for several years and loved Enchiladas Suizas (Swiss Enchiladas). I found this recipe, and he said that it tastes just like the ones his 'mamita' made him.
