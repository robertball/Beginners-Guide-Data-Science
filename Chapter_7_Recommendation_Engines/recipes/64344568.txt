BBQ Cabbage Sandwich Recipe

Ingredients:
2 bags ready cut coleslaw mix or 1 full head of green cabbage, shredded
2 carrots, shredded
1/2 large onion, shredded
1/2 -3/4 c BBQ sauce of your liking
1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke (if you are unsure, start with less and taste, you can always add more)
8-12 toasted rolls, or sandwich rounds

Directions:
In a large sauce pan over medium heat saute the carrot and onion in a tablespoon or two of water until it begins to wilt.
Add cabbage to the carrot and continue to "stir fry" until the cabbage is limp and tender but not mushy. Do not over cook, you still want a little texture to your veggies. Add in another tablespoon of water if needed to prevent sticking. Let the water cook out during this step, or your BBQ will end up watery. I didn't need to in the times I have made this, but drain off the excess water, should you need to.
Turn heat to low. Add in BBQ sauce slowly, mixing as you go until the cabbage mixture is saucy but not sloppy. I used maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup total. Remove from heat once heated through.
Add liquid smoke in small amounts until you reach the desired amount of smokiness.
Pile onto toasted buns and chow down like a champ!
