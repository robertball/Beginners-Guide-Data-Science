Ingredients:
1 ear fresh corn in the husk

Directions:
Rinse entire ear of corn under water briefly. Wrap corn in a paper towel and place on a microwave-safe plate.
Cook corn in the microwave oven until hot and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and let rest for 2 minutes. Remove corn husk.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite ways to fix corn on the cob, even when I have several to fix. Without the water from boiling, the corn stays nice and sweet. Hope this helps just one young cook.
