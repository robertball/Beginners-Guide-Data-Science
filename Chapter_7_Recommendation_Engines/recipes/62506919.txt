Ingredients:
2 ancho chile peppers
2 Guajilo Chile Pepper
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, smashed
1 28-ounce can tomatoes
2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Mexican Oregano
1 teaspoon Thyme
2 bay leaves
8 cups low-sodium chicken broth
Kosher salt to taste
1 to 2 grilled chicken breasts or leftover shredded chicken, sliced
3/4 to 1 cup crumbled queso fresco
1 avocado, diced
Fresh cilantro
4 corn tortillas, cut into strips and fried
1 to 2 tablespoons sour cream

Directions:
Place dried chiles in a bowl, cover with hot water and soak until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain the chiles, (reserve 1/3 cups water from chiles) pull out the stems and most of the seeds and transfer to a blender (or food processor) add about 1/3 water from chiles and process to make a smooth-ish puree.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent. Add the tomatoes with their juice, chile puree, the coriander seeds, mexican oregano and cumin and cook about 5 minutes. Add the broth, bay leaves and thyme and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook about 30 minutes.
Using immersion blender, blend soup until all chunks are gone and its smooth.  This may also be done in batches in the blender if needed.
Place a small amount of chicken, queso fresco, avocado, cilantro, fried tortilla strips and sour cream in each bowl, then pour about 1 cup hot broth around the garnishes.
