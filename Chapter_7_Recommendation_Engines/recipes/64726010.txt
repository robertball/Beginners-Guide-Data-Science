Ingredients:
1.5 pounds fresh comice pears
1 tsp lemon juice
2 tbsp corn starch
1/4 cup white rice flour
1/4 cup brown rice flour
1/4 cup buckwheat flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp flaxseed meal
1/8 cup packed brown sugar
4 tbsp cold butter, divided
1/4 cup cold milk, divided

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Put one tablespoon of butter in cubes in an 8-inch round baking dish.
Wash, peel, core, and cube the pears. Leave some of the peel if desired. Put the pears into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with lemon juice. Toss to coat. Sprinkle the corn starch over the pears. Toss to coat and set aside.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, flaxseed meal, baking powder, and brown sugar. Cut in the remaining butter until it resembles course pebbles. Add milk a tablespoon at a time until the dough begins to pull together and form a ball.
Pour the pears into the baking dish covering the butter cubes. Drop walnut-sized balls of dough on top of the pears pushing down to flatten the dough. Do this until all the dough is finished and a crust has formed on top, allowing for some areas that are not covered.
Bake in the oven until the top has browned and the pears are bubbling, about 30 minutes.
Serve warm.

Description: 
Rustic, gluten free drop biscuits top fresh pears for an old fashioned fall or winter treat suitable for celiacs. I use comice pears that are naturally very sweet and juicy even when firm to ensure natural sweetness that will maintain their shape after cooking.
