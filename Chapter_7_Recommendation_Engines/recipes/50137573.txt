Ingredients:
CRUMB TOPPING
1/3 C butter
3/4 C regular all-purpose flour
1/3 C firmly packed brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 C chopped walnuts
BATTER
1-1/2 C sifted all-purpose flour
1-1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 C butter
2/3 C sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1 C dairy sour cream
BUTTER-CREAM FILLING
1/4 C all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 C milk
2/3 C butter
1 C sugar
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat Oven 325 degrees
PREPARE PAN: 9x9 baking pan. (I like to use an 8x12 glass Pyrex pan)
Grease pan. Cut piece of wax paper so the length hangs over the ends of the pan lengthwise. *This aids in lifting out the coffeecake so topping doesn't fall off.
CRUMB TOPPING: blend first four ingredients thoroughly and add nuts.
BATTER: combine dry ingredients & sift together. Cream butter & sugar; add eggs & vanilla. Add sour cream & dry ingredients alternately (begin & end with dry ingredients).  Do Not Over beat.  Spread in pan & sprinkle with Crumb Topping.
BAKE: 45-55 minutes.  Cool 10 minutes & remove from pan.
BUTTER-CREAM FILLING: combine flour, salt & milk. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until very thick (leaves sides of pan & clings in a mass). COOL
Cream butter & sugar; add vanilla. Combine with cooled flour mixture - Beat until very light & fluffy.
Cool Coffeecake thoroughly - CUT in half horizontally.
Lift top half of coffeecake & set aside.
Spread Butter cream filling on bottom layer.
Place top half of coffeecake back on top.
