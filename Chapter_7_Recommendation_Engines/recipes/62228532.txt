Ingredients:
1 Box Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme Cake Mix
4 eggs
1/2 cup Crisco Oil
1 small pkg instant lemon pudding
1 Tbsp lemon extract
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
1 8 oz pkg candied cherries, halved
1 8 oz pkg candied pineapple, cut into thirds
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 cup craisins (or can use raisins instead)
Baker's Joy

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Mix cake mix, eggs, oil, pudding, lemon extract and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.  Stir until well mixed.  Add cherries, pineapple, pecans and craisins.  Stir until well mixed.  Spray a tube pan with Baker's Joy.
Pour in cake mixture.  Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes (or until a toothpick, inserted in the center, comes out clean).  Allow to cool for 20 minutes on cooling racks and then invert it onto a plate to finish cooling.  Doesn't need to be refrigerated.  Store in an airtight container to help it retain moisture.

Description: 
This is a fruit cake for people who do not normally like fruit cake.  If you happen to already like fruit cake, you will love this.  Honestly, it is the best fruit cake I have ever tasted.  It was handed down to me by a dear old lady who has now gone home to be with the Lord.
