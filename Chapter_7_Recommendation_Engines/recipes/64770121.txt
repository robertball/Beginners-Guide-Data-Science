Ingredients:
2 packages Trader Joe's Aloha rolls
2 packages Trader Joe's gluten-free chicken nuggets
1 stick of butter
1/2 cup of honey
Sliced dill pickles
Dijon or spicy brown mustard
Hot sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Melt butter and honey together and stir well to blend.  Cook chicken nuggets in oven according to package directions for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, turn over, drizzle about half the honey butter over nuggets and return to oven for 10 more minutes. While chicken is baking, slice rolls in half and place the bottom halves in a 9" x 13" baking dish, spread with mustard and place a pickle slice on each half. Remove chicken from oven and turn oven down to 350°. Place chicken on roll bottoms then add roll tops and drizzle with remaining honey butter. Bake an additional 10 minutes in oven. Serve with hot sauce on the side if desired.
