Ingredients:
18 Murray® Sugar Free Shortbread Cookies, finely crushed
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3 tablespoons light margarine, melted
1 tablespoon sugar-free orange marmalade
1 1/2 cups canned cooked pumpkin
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated skim milk
1 3/4 cups egg substitute
1/3 cup fresh orange juice
1/2 cup granular sucrolose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Chop the cookies in the blender until finely crushed. Add in the cinnamon, margarine, and marmalade; pulse until well blended. Press the crumbs into the bottom of a 2-quart souffle dish.
Bake the crust at 350 degrees F for 6 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.
When crust has cooled, combine the filling ingredients in food processor or blender. Pour the mixture into the souffle dish on top of the crust. Place the souffle dish inside a larger baking pan filled with 1 inch of hot water.
Set both pans in the oven and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Chill overnight.
