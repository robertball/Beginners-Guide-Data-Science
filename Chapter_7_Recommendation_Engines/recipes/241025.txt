Ingredients:
2 cups lightly packed brown sugar
1 cup butter-flavored shortening, melted
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup molasses
2 eggs
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup coarse sugar crystals, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk brown sugar, shortening, butter, molasses, eggs, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt, cloves, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl until glossy; fold in flour until dough is just-combined.
Pour coarse sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into 48 balls. Roll balls in sugar and place 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cookies crack, about 9 minutes.

Description: 
These are our traditional Christmas cookies. The shortening keeps the cookies soft; all butter will result in a harder cookie.
