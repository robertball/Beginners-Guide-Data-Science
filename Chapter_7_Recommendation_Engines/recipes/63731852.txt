Ingredients:
1/4 cup reduced fat peanut butter
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 dash ground cayenne pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat grill for high heat.
In a saucepan, mix the peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, garlic, curry powder, and cayenne pepper.  Separate 1/4 cup of sauce from the rest for basting the chicken.  Add water or chicken broth to thin out the sauce and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 5 minutes.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on grate, and brush with the 1/4 cup of the sauce. Grill 6 to 8 minutes. Turn chicken, and brush with sauce. Continue grilling 6 to 8 minutes, until chicken juices run clear.
