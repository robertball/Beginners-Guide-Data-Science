Ingredients:
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh mint
1 teaspoon minced fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
4 (1 inch thick) bone in lamb loin chops

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the wine, soy sauce, mint, basil, pepper and garlic; add the lamb chops. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill lamb, uncovered, over medium heat or broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 5-7 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium, a meat thermometer should read 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
