Ingredients:
4  bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin

3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons white wine
2 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs

Place bread crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl and dredge chicken in crumbs, leaving skins on. Place coated chicken pieces in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
