Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups water
1 cup red lentils
3/4 cup fine bulgur (cracked wheat)
3 tablespoons olive oil
7 spring onions, finely chopped, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 bunch parsley, minced
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine water and red lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until water is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir in bulgur and remove saucepan from heat. Cover and let stand until bulgur absorbs the residual moisture, about 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir spring onions until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste; cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Combine red lentil mixture and onion mixture in a large bowl. Add parsley, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, cumin, and salt; knead by hand until evenly distributed.
Shape mixture into small logs or round balls and arrange on a plate. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent the tops from drying out before serving.
