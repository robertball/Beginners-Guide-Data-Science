Description: 
'Our town is dubbed the bratwurst capital of America,' writes Jodi Gobrecht of Bucyrus, Ohio. 'As a volunteer at our annual Bratwurst Festival, I could not have someone in my family who disliked bratwurst, so I developed this cheesy casserole for our son. It's the only way he will eat them.'
