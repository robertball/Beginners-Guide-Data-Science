Ingredients:
1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 cup fresh spinach, rinsed and dried
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pizza crust on baking sheet.
In a small bowl, mix together olive oil and sesame oil. Brush onto pre-baked pizza crust, covering entire surface. Stack the spinach leaves, then cut lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips; scatter evenly over crust. Cover pizza with shredded mozzarella, and top with sliced mushrooms.
Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and edges are crisp.
