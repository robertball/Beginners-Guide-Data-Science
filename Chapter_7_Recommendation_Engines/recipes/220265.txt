Description: 
This recipe is inspired by both Jaime Oliver's Creamy Shells and Peas recipe and a local restaurant's version. However, I've never been tempted to make Jaime's; I'm sure it tastes awesome but I decided to tweak it to my heart's content. Mine is very fast to make and very fresh tasting.
