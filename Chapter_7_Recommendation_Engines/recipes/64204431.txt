Description: 
Not wanting to use commercial seasonings that have hidden MSG and other additives, I have researched some alternatives.  Many recipes include other spices and herbs that may or may not be right for all dishes.  This is a base recipe that can be adjusted to your likes and preferences but suit most savoury soups and stews.  Make sure your products are gluten free when purchasing because some yeasts are not certified as such.
