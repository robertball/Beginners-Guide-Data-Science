Ingredients:
2 egg white, lightly beaten
1/3 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon herbes de Provence
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
ground black pepper to taste
8 tomatillos, husked and sliced 1/4 inch thick
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Place egg whites in a shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, mix together cornmeal, herbs, salt and pepper.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tomatillo slices in egg whites, then dredge in cornmeal mixture turning to coat both sides.
Fry tomatillo slices 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Be careful not to over cook; tomatillos should be tender, but not totally softened. Serve immediately.
