Ingredients:
2 Tbsp butter
2 Tbsp flour
1 Cup stock (beef, chicken, fish, or vegetable)
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat pan on stove top.  Add butter and flour, mix together to form a paste, and cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the roux is the desired color (lighter for chicken stock, darker for beef stock).  When the roux is the desired color, add in the stock while stirring.  Add salt & pepper.  Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until it is the desired consistency.  (The sauce should be velvety smooth.)  Stir frequently.  Serve hot over food.
