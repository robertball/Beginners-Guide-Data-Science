Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) onion
2 cloves garlic
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
3 (14.5 ounce) cans black beans
6 cups fat-skimmed beef broth or vegetable broth
3 cups chopped carrots
1/2 cup long-grain rice
1/4 cup dry sherry (optional)
Salt and pepper
1 (1/2 pound) firm-ripe avocado
Nonfat sour cream
Cilantro sprigs, rinsed

Directions:
Peel and chop onion and garlic. In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over medium-high heat, stir oil, onion, and garlic until onion is limp, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, coriander, and cayenne; stir until spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Drain and rinse beans. Add 2 cans to pan along with broth, carrots, and rice. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until carrots and rice are tender to bite, 15 to 20 minutes.
In a blender, puree soup, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return soup to pan, add sherry and remaining beans, and stir over medium heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Peel, pit, and slice avocado. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with avocado slices, sour cream, and cilantro.
