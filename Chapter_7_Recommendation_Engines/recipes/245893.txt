Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) fillet salmon fillet
1/4 cup avocado oil
1 teaspoon curry powder
salt to taste
1 mango - peeled, seeded, and diced
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 small serrano pepper, diced
1 small bunch cilantro leaves
1 lime

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place salmon on the baking sheet and fold edges of aluminum foil up over the salmon and crimp to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
Mix avocado oil, curry powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Pour over salmon. Scatter diced mango, red onion, and serrano pepper over salmon. Serve garnished with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
