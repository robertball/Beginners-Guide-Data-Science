Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup mashed bananas
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup quick cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the banana and vanilla.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking soda and salt. Beat into creamed mixture. Stir in oats. Pour into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.

Description: 
This is the best banana nut bread I have ever made! Healthier with whole wheat flour and less sugar. I prefer butter over shortening. So full of flavor.  I double the recipe and we still eat it all in two days!Modified from: Oatmeal Banana Nut Bread
