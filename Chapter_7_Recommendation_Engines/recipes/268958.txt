Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound extra-lean ground beef
2 egg whites
1/2 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup ketchup, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan lightly with cooking spray.
Combine beef, egg whites, bread crumbs, onion, Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons ketchup, brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Press into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. Spread remaining ketchup over the top and continue baking until ketchup bubbles and thickens, about 15 minutes more.
