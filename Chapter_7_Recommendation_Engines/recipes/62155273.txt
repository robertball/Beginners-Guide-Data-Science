Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef, formed into patties about an inch thick
1/2 Cup worcestershire sauce
1 package onion soup mix
1 cup water
1 large tomato sliced
1/2 large red onion chopped
1/2 head of lettuce shredded
4 pieces fresh provolone cheese
1/2 cup mayo
1/2 cup prepared mustard
dill pickle slices (optional)
1 package of 4 large onion rolls

Directions:
In a bowl, mix worcestershire sauce, water, and onion soup mix and stir well or until the soup mix is disolved. Place mixture in a large resealable bag and add the beef patties.  Turn the bag to coat the patties well.  Refrigerate over night.
Remove the patties from the bag; discard the marinade.  Patties will appear very deep brown to almost black.  Put patties on a gas or charcoal grill over medium-high heat.  Cook burgers through to your liking about 15-20 minutes turning once.
put mustard, mayo, chopped onion, lettuce, tomato, and pickles on bottom half of onion roll.  Place a piece of provolone cheese on the top half. Place the cooked pattie directly on top of the provolone so the cheese melts. Put it all together and enjoy!!

Description: 
This is the most tasty burger I've ever had.  Let's just say that I could eat one per day if I were able to keep a slim figure in the process.  It's very decadent and tender and it's a backyard cook out favorite.
