Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 egg
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 dash hot sauce, or more to taste
1/3 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Mix black beans, egg, red bell pepper, cilantro, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and hot sauce in a large bowl with your hands until evenly mixed.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Divide mixture into 1/3 cup portions; shape into 3-inch burgers.
Spread cornmeal into the bottom of a shallow dish.
Press the burgers into the cornmeal to coat both sides.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Cook burgers in hot oil until the center is hot, about 8 minutes per side.
