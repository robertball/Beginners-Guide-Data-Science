Description: 
A friend catches Spanish mackerel in South Florida and fillets it for us. He delivers it, and we spend the day smoking 10 pounds of fish. We vacuum pack what we don't need and freeze it for later. It keeps very well for months in a freezer. How long? We don't know, because we make this so often! Can't find smoked mackerel? There are YouTube videos to smoke your own! Serve with an assortment of crackers, toasts, celery, and carrots immediately.
