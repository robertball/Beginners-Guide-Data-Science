Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) packages ground sausage
1 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese
15 jalapeno chile peppers
1/2 pound sliced bacon, cut in half
Diced onions to taste (optional)
Honey (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place ground sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.
Drain sausage and place in a medium bowl. Mix with the cream cheese, then lightly mix in cheddar cheese.
Cut jalapenos in half lengthwise under water (WEAR GLOVES). Remove the seeds. Stuff each jalapeno half with equal portions of the sausage and cream cheese mixture.
Partially cook bacon in microwave on paper towels to remove some fat, then dip in honey and wrap stuffed peppers. Secure bacon with toothpicks.
Arrange wrapped jalapenos in a large, shallow baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until the bacon is evenly brown.
