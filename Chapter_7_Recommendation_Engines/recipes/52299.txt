Ingredients:
1 pound dried rice noodles
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
1/3 cup water
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 cup milk
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon paprika
cayenne pepper to taste
1 pound mung bean sprouts
1 cup shredded carrots
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup chopped, unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Submerge the rice noodles in a large bowl of hot water for about an hour.
Pour 1/2 tablespoon of oil into a large skillet, and add eggs. Scramble into medium-sized pieces, and transfer to plate. Set aside.
In a saucepan, mix together peanut oil, peanut butter, water, soy sauce, milk, brown sugar, and lemon juice. Season with garlic powder and paprika. Heat until sauce is smooth. Season liberally with cayenne pepper.
Drain noodles; noodles should be very flexible, but still relatively firm. Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil in  a large saucepan or wok. Cook noodles in oil, stirring constantly, until they are tender, about 2 minutes.   Stir in peanut sauce, sprouts, carrots, scallions, ground peanuts, and the scrambled eggs. Continue to cook over low heat until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately, garnished with lime wedges.

Description: 
This recipe is the closest I've come to imitating the heavenly Phad Thai I had in London. It's a little sweeter than the Phad Thai dishes I've tried in the U.S. Raw cabbage and/or carrots may also be served on the side.
