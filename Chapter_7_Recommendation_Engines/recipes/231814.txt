Ingredients:
Fish:
8 (3 ounce) fillets tilapia
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce
Cilantro Cream Sauce:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 (5.3 ounce) container plain Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon lime juice
Beer Batter:
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
cayenne pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup dark beer
3 cups peanut oil for frying
For the Tacos:
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1/4 medium head cabbage, finely shredded
1 (8 ounce) jar prepared salsa
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 small limes, quartered

Directions:
Place tilapia fillets on plate and sprinkle with salt and hot sauce; cover and refrigerate while making cilantro cream sauce.
Combine cream cheese, 2 tablespoons cilantro, mayonnaise, and yogurt in a small bowl or large measuring cup; mix well. Stir lime juice into cream sauce. Cover and refrigerate.
Whisk flour, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, and pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined; whisk in beer to make a smooth batter.
Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Remove fish from refrigerator; dip in beer batter and fry fillets 3 at a time in the hot oil, turning when golden (approximately 2 minutes on each side, depending on the thickness). Transfer to paper towels to drain; set fish on a covered plate to keep warm. Repeat with remaining fillets.
Wrap tortillas in a clean kitchen towel and heat in the microwave until warm, about 20 seconds. Assemble tacos by placing a fish fillet on a warm tortilla. Top with shredded cabbage, a dollop of cilantro cream sauce, a spoonful of salsa, and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro. Serve each taco with a lime quarter for squeezing.
