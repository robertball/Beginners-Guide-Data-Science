Ingredients:
3 cans or 1 lb. Soaked, cooked garbanzo beans
½ cup olive oil
1/3 cup cup raw sesame seeds
1/3 cup fresh lime juice
4 cloves of garlic, crushed (and set aside)
1 tsp-1 ½ tsp salt
pepper to taste
Add-Ins:
1 ½ cup jarred artichoke hearts
1 ½ cup chopped spinach

Directions:
In a blender, mix oil, salt, lime juice and sesame seeds until pasty. A few unblended seeds is okay.
Add garbanzo beans with enough liquid to allow for a smooth, milkshake-like consistency. (I usually like to add the liquid from 2 cans of beans and drain the other).
IMPORTANT: Do not blend the crushed garlic in the blender with the hummus. It will break the garlic down too much and it will most likely be too hot to eat.
Dump the hummus into a bowl and mix in artichoke hearts, a pinch of pepper and chopped spinach.
It is ready to eat but even better chilled over night.
Serve with pita bread, tortilla chips, or veggies.
