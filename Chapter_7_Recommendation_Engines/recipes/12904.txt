Ingredients:
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 pound broccoli rabe, thick stems peeled
1/2 cup olive oil
4 anchovy filets, rinsed and chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 pounds mussels, cleaned and debearded
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup water
salt to taste

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, cover the potatoes with cold water.  Add salt, and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Drain.
Bring a saucepan of salted water to a boil.  Add the broccoli rabe, and cook until just tender; it should be bright green.  Drain well, and cut into 2 inch lengths.
Combine the oil, anchovies, and garlic in a large, deep skillet.  Cook over high heat, mashing the anchovies, for about 1 minute.  Spread the mussels in the skillet, top with the potatoes, broccoli rabe, and chopped parsley.  Add 1/2 cup water, and season with salt.  Cover, and cook until mussels are open.  Serve.
