Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust
1 (8 ounce) can zucchini in Italian-style tomato sauce
3 tablespoons canned tomato paste
6 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (7 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (8.25 ounce) can mixed vegetables, no-salt added, drained
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Oil a dark, metal-rimmed 10x15-inch cookie sheet with 1 teaspoon olive oil.
Unroll the crust onto the cookie sheet and press to cover the bottom of the cookie sheet, creating a slightly thicker rim around the edge. Brush another teaspoon of olive oil over the crust and set aside.
Puree the zucchini and the tomato paste in a blender or food processor. Spread over the pizza crust. Top with the shredded mozzarella, mushrooms, mixed vegetables, Parmesan cheese and remaining olive oil.
Bake until crust is browned and topping is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Let the pizza rest for 5 minutes before serving. Cut in 8 pieces.

Description: 
Pizza doesn't have to be delivery once you have this easy, homemade vegetable pie in your recipe file.  It's loaded with vegetables that kids enjoy and the one unusual culprit with the Italian-sounding name, Signor Zucchini, is hidden in the sauce. S-h-h-h, don't tell. The whole recipe takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish. Just try to get pizza delivery faster than that.
