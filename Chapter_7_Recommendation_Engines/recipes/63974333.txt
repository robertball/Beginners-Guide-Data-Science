Ingredients:
1/2 banana
1 cup flour of choice
2 tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 1/4 cup of buttermilk (or milk and lemon juice or vinegar)
1 egg
2 tbsp of chocolate chips, or more (optional)

Directions:
Mix all the dry ingredients
Measure the buttermilk. If you are using milk and lemon juice or vinegar, mix about 1 tbsp of the catalyst into the milk and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.
Beat the egg until the the yolk is broken.
Create a well in the dry ingredients by making a hole in the middle so that you can see the bottom of the mixing bowl.
Pour the buttermilk and egg into the well and mix in the dry ingredients until just combined. Make sure none of the yolk is visible.
Very thinly slice the banana and incorporate it into the batter by folding it in. Lastly, add the chocolate chips and any other ingredients.
Heat a frying pan or gridle on medium heat. Butter or spray with non-stick spray. Cook the cakes for about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
