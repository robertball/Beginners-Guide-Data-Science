Description: 
This is a cake that I grew up with and is probably the first cake I ever made.  The recipe came from my great grandmother's family.  It was made during the depression when eggs, milk and butter were hard to come by.  I love that it's made with the most common ingredients.  It's easy to prepare and no mixer is required.
