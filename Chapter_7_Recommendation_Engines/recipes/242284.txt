Ingredients:
1 ½ cups white sugar
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
2 tablespoons ground ginger
3 cloves garlic, diced
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 ½ pounds chicken drumettes

Directions:
Combine sugar, soy sauce, and water in an 8-quart pot; stir until sugar is dissolved. Turn heat to medium-high; add ginger, garlic, cinnamon, and black pepper and stir.
Bring mixture to a boil and add chicken drumettes. Once mixture begins to boil again, reduce heat to medium-low, and partially cover pot with a lid tilted to allow steam to escape. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and teriyaki sauce is thickened, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
Because it's boiled, this teriyaki turns into a great caramelized sauce that can be drizzled across the chicken and steamed white rice for a nice side dish. This can be made with any kind of meat - drumettes make a great party item. Recipe doubles nicely.
