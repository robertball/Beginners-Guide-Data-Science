Ingredients:
1 cup tomato juice
1 cup water
1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped green onions
2 cloves garlic
1 carrot, shredded
1 teaspoon salt
6 cups bread flour

Directions:
In a sauce pan, heat the tomato juice and water over a low heat until warm to the touch.  Pour into a large warmed bowl, and add yeast and honey; stir to dissolve yeast.  Allow to rest until yeast is creamy.
Mix in oil, parsley, onion, garlic, carrot, and salt.  Add 1 cup of the flour, and stir until smooth. Add more flour, until a firm dough is formed.  Knead five minutes on a lightly floured surface.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface completely.  Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
Punch down, and divide into halves.  Form two loaves, and put into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Allow to rise for another 45 minutes, or until loaves have doubled in size.
Bake at 400 degrees F (220 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove from pans to wire rack to cool.
