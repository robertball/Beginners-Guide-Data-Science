1 lb chicken breast, boiled and shredded
8 oz cream cheese, softened
4 oz can chopped green chiles
1 Tbsp ground cumin
1 red bell pepper, diced small
1 small onion, diced small
15 oz can condensed cream of chicken soup

8-10 soft corn or flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
To make filling for enchiladas:
Mix shredded chicken, cream cheese, cumin, bell pepper, onion, and 1/2 of green chiles.
Place about 2 Tbsp of chicken/cream cheese filling down the center of tortilla.
Roll and place in greased 9x13 pan. Repeat until all of the chicken filling and tortillas are used.
To make sour cream sauce:
Mix together cream of chicken soup, sour cream and remaining green chiles.
Pour over the enchiladas using a spatula to spread out evenly.
Top with shredded cheese.
Cover pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for 10 more minutes until cheese is bubbly.

Description: 
This is a good crowd pleaser. It is easy to prepare and can be made ahead of time for large gatherings, just double or triple the recipe. It also freezes very well. Bake as directed, allow to cool, then freeze.
