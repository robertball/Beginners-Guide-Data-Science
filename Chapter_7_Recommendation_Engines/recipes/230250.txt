Ingredients:
1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 (16 ounce) package frozen stir-fry vegetables
1 cup sugar snap peas
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup sliced carrot

Directions:
Stir orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, ground ginger, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken and orange juice mixture in the hot oil until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.
Whisk chicken broth and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into the chicken and sauce mixture in small amounts until sauce has thickened to your liking.
Mix stir-fry vegetables, sugar snap peas, broccoli, and carrot into the chicken and sauce mixture; cook and stir until the vegetables are slightly softened, another 7 to 10 minutes.
