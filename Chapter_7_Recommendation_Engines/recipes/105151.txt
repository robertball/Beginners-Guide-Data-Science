Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
3 teaspoons lemon or lime juice
3 tablespoons water
2 garlic cloves
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 dash bottled hot pepper sauce
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon paprika
Dash kosher salt
Dash pepper
4 small skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 whole wheat pita breads, split and toasted
3/4 cup coarsely chopped Roma tomatoes
1/2 cup sliced cucumber

Directions:
For hummus, in a blender container or food-processor bowl, combine garbanzo beans, cilantro, lemon or lime juice, water, garlic, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and hot pepper sauce. Cover; blend or process until smooth. Refrigerate. (Serve any leftovers with crackers.)
Combine oil, lemon juice, paprika, dash salt, and pepper. Place chicken on an unheated rack of a broiler pan. Brush both sides of chicken with the oil mixture. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 7 minutes. Turn; broil 5 to 8 minutes more or until chicken is tender and no longer pink. Cool; cut into strips.
To serve, spread hummus over toasted pita; top with the chicken, tomatoes, cucumber, and yogurt.
