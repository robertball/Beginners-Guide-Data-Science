Ingredients:
1/2 cup lukewarm water, divided, or as needed
2 1/4 cups Italian-style tip 00 flour
3/4 ounce fresh yeast
2 eggs
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup dried blueberries
1/4 cup chopped dried apricots
3 tablespoons stevia powder
2 tablespoons sugar-free candied fruit
10 drops sugar substitute (such as TruviaÂ®)

Directions:
Combine 1/4 cup lukewarm water, 1/3 of the flour, and yeast in a bowl and dissolve yeast. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm place, 8 hours to overnight.
Stir in 1/3 more of the flour and enough warm water to make the dough soft and elastic. Knead together, cover, and let rise in a warm place, about 2 hours. Add remaining flour and a few tablespoons of warm water, knead into a soft and elastic dough, cover, and let rise in a warm place, about 3 hours.
Work in eggs, olive oil, raisins, blueberries, apricots, stevia, candied fruit, and sweetener and knead everything into a soft dough. Place dough in a panettone mold, cover, and let rise in a warm place until dough has almost doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until panettone is baked through and lightly browned, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is my variation on yeasted Christmas panettone with ingredients I like, but fewer calories from sugar. You do need to let the panettone rise a number of times and for long periods, but all the rising results in a soft yet firm panettone that is wonderfully sweet thanks to the dried fruit.
