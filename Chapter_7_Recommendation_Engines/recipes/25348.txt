Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 cups boiling water
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 eggs
2 cups whole wheat flour
4 cups bread flour

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine olive oil, white sugar and salt. Add boiling water and stir to dissolve sugar; let cool to lukewarm.
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
When sugar and water mixture has cooled, add yeast mixture, eggs, whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Divide the dough into twenty four equal size pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds on lightly greased baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These are great-tasting wheat rolls made with olive oil, regular bread flour, and whole wheat flour.  This recipe happened one night when I was making white Italian rolls, and I ran out of flour.  All I had left was wheat flour, and luckily for me, it worked out well.
