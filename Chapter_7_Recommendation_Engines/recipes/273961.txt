Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil
10 jalapeno peppers, sliced
10 habanero peppers, sliced
1/2 cup minced onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups watermelon juice
1/2 cup diced mango
1 cup white vinegar

Directions:
Heat coconut oil in a medium glass- or enamel-lined saucepan over high heat. Add jalapenos, habanero peppers, onion, garlic, lime juice, and salt. Saute mixture for 5 minutes; reduce heat to a simmer. Stir in watermelon juice and mango and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let mixture cool to room temperature, 15 to 30 minutes.
Transfer mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth. With processor running, slowly add vinegar until combined. Pour sauce into a clean jar with a tight lid.

Description: 
This is a great recipe I came up with that packs a lot of heat and still has a sweet taste. Goes great with any kind of chicken, Mexican food, fish, and pork. It is very tasty. This sauce will keep for 4-6 months when stored in the refrigerator.
