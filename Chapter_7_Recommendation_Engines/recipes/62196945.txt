1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. Ground Cinnamon
1 tsp. ground ginger
1/2 tsp. ground cloves
4 Large eggs
1 can (29 oz) Pure 100% Pumpkin

Directions:
1. Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in a small bowl.
2. Beat eggs in a large bowl, and stir in Pumpkin & sugar-spice mixture.
3. Gradually stir in Evaporated milk
4. Pour into Pie shells, there may be left over filling, you can throw this away.
5. Bake in pre-heated oven at 425 F for 15 minutes, then take the pies out carefully, and cover just the pie crust edges with foil, this will keep them from getting to brown and burning. Put the pies back in the oven and reduce heat to 350 F bake for 40-50 minutes or until knife comes out clean. Cool on wire rack for 2 hours.
