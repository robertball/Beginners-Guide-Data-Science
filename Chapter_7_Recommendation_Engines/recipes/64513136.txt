Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup margarine, softened (or use all butter ie. 1 lb or 2 cups total)
3 cups flour
1 cup icing sugar
1 cup corn starch
1 tsp. almond extract
Candied fruit or cherries or nuts (optional)

Directions:
Sift dry ingredients into a bowl.
Beat butter and margarine until fluffy.
Add 1/3 - 1/2 dry ingredients at a time to butter/margarine, whipping after each addition. The last portion will likely have to mixed with a spoon and some muscle.
Roll into 1" balls and place on cookie sheets - they won't spread, so can be fairly close together.
Press each ball with a fork dipped in flour.
Decorate with candied fruit or cherries or nuts, if using.
Bake @ 375 x 18 - 20 minutes or until the tiniest bit brown on edges.

Description: 
It just wouldn't seem like Christmas without a batch of these! They taste just as good fresh or straight from the freezer. The butter/margarine ratio & almond extract are a winning combo.
