Description: 
When my boys hear Im planning to make Monkey Bread, theyre eager to help, says Carol Allen of McLeansboro, Illinois. Brady is the official shaker. He coats the biscuits after Mom has cut them into pieces. Jerod arranges the coated biscuits in the pan, then its ready to go into the oven. Both boys really enjoy helping me make Monkey Bread, and it seems to taste twice as good when theyve helped fix it, Carol assures. Its one of our favorites for breakfast or as a snack.
