Ingredients:
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons corn oil
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
2 (16 ounce) packages fresh mushrooms, stems removed
1/2 red bell pepper, diced

Directions:
Combine the vinegar, water, oil, sugar, onion, parsley, basil, garlic, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Stir in the mushrooms and red bell pepper; return mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until the mushrooms are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer to a covered container and store in refrigerator at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
This is perfect for a buffet or as a football appetizer menu addition. I make these a couple of days ahead and store them in a glass jar. Even non-mushroom-eaters like this one. On occasion, I kick this up by adding 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes instead of the black pepper.
