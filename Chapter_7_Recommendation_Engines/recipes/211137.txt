Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 red onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chipotle chile powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 eggs
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/2 avocado, sliced

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the heated oil until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and garlic; continue cooking until the onions sweat and begin to caramelize. Season with chipotle chile powder, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper; stir. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a plate to retain the heat.
Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil into the skillet and return to medium heat. Crack the eggs into the heated oil and cook until they begin to turn opaque; flip and continue cooking until no clear white remains. (Don't overcook the eggs -- the best part of this meal is the smoothness that the yolk adds to the mix). Place the cooked eggs atop the potato mixture. Top with cilantro, feta cheese, and avocado to serve.

Description: 
This recipe features one of my all-time favorite vegetables: the sweet potato. The tanginess of the feta (the Greek part) is a strange but tasty complement to the smoky, spicy chipotle chili powder (the cowboy part). This meal is great for brunch and simple to scale down for a quick dinner when you're cooking for yourself.
