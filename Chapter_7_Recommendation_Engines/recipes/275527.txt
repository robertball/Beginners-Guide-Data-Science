Ingredients:
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 large cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) container grape tomatoes, halved
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 pinch crushed red pepper
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 1/4 cups finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
6 ounces water-packed fresh mozzarella cheese, drained and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Whisk together olive oil, garlic, and salt in a large bowl. Place tomatoes in a medium bowl; mix in 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil mixture. Mix in oregano and crushed red pepper.
Place chicken in the bowl with remaining garlic oil; turn to coat.
Place 1 cup Parmesan cheese in a pie plate. Dip one side of each chicken breast into Parmesan to coat, then place chicken breasts, cheese-side up, on one half of a large rimmed baking sheet. Scatter tomatoes on the other half of the baking sheet.
Place in the preheated oven and roast until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and top chicken with mozzarella slices. Return to the oven and roast until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer chicken and tomatoes to 4 plates and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
