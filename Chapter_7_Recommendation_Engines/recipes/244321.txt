Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) angel food cake
2 (3 ounce) packages raspberry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-OÂ®)
1 1/4 cups boiling water
1 (15 ounce) package frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed and undrained
1 pint heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Butter a 9-inch tube pan. Break angel food cake into chunks; set aside.
Stir raspberry gelatin and boiling water together in a bowl until gelatin is dissolved; place gelatin in the refrigerator  to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir raspberries with syrup into gelatin.
Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form; fold whipped cream into raspberry mixture.
Pour about 1/4 cup of raspberry mixture into prepared pan. Place 1/3 of cake chunks into pan; pour 1/3 of remaining raspberry mixture over cake. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with the raspberry mixture. Chill in refrigerator until firm, about 2 hours.
To remove from pan, center a serving plate over tube pan; invert.

Light-tasting and delicious! My mother's famous dessert recipe has completed many holiday meals and makes a stunning summery cake. This works beautifully with strawberries as well.
