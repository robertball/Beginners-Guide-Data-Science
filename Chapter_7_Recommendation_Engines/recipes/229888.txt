Description: 
A simple and sweet treat that packs a lot of flavor. It makes a great alternate breakfast side in place of the standard hash browned potatoes. Try it as a breakfast side with scrambled eggs! Sweet potatoes let off a lot of water as they cook, so it may be necessary to drain the hash before serving.
