Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, or more to taste
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup brown sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon vegetable seasoning salt (such as McCormick® Vegetable Supreme® Seasoning)
2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
salt to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon bacon drippings. Crumble bacon.
Bring water to a boil in a skillet. Add brown sugar, vegetable seasoning, and bacon drippings to water; cook and stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add green beans and bacon to brown sugar mixture; season with salt. Reduce heat and simmer until green beans reach desired tenderness, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
My husband wants desperately for me to patent and sell this recipe to a canner, but I want to share it with you! It is a huge hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas in place of the standard green bean casserole.
