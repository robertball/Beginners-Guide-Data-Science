Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 clove garlic, minced
1 quart cold beef broth

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add flour; cook and stir until mixture is golden-brown and smells like cooked pie crust, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook for 30 seconds. Whisk in 1 cup of broth.
Stir remaining broth, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard into the mixture in the saucepan. Bring to a simmer, whisking, and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
