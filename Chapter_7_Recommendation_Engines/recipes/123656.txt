Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup Italian salad dressing
1 cup chopped broccoli
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped cucumbers
1 cup chopped tomato

Directions:
Unroll crescent dough and place on an ungreased baking sheet; press seams together to form a 15-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Bake at 375 degrees F for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown; cool completely. Combine cream cheese and salad dressing; spread over crust to within 1 in. of edge. With a knife, mark off 20 squares. Fill each square with one vegetable to make a patchwork design or the quilt pattern of your choice. Refrigerate or serve immediately.

Description: 
Decorating one of my favorite appetizers to serve to an avid group of quilters turned out to be such fun! I arranged the colorful vegetable toppings into a savory sampler for my luncheon guests to snack on.                                   --Grace Yaskovic, Branchville, New Jersey
