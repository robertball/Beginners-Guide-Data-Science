Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 thin-cut, boneless pork loin chops
2 tablespoons sweet sherry
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce, divided
3 tablespoons molasses
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 (3 inch) fresh ginger root, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon cornstarch, mixed with equal parts water
4 green onions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat while preparing ingredients. Place pork chops in a shallow bowl or baking dish; mix together sherry and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and pour over meat.  Mix remaining soy sauce with molasses, sesame oil, and vinegar, and set aside.
When ready to cook, increase heat under skillet to high. Cook ginger in hot oil until golden, about 1 minute.  Place chops in skillet; pan-fry until pork is a deep brown on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chops and ginger to a platter, cover, and keep warm.
Pour molasses-soy sauce mixture into the pan; simmer to reduce slightly. Whisk in cornstarch mixed in water; continue to simmer until sauce is thick, stirring frequently. Pour sauce over pork chops, and garnish with green onions, sesame seeds, and browned ginger. Serve immediately.
