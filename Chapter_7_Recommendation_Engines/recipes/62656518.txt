Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cup peanut butter
2 eggs
1 tsp. Vanilla
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tsp. Cinnamon
1 1/4 cup quick-cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together shortening, margarine, brown sugar, white sugar, and peanut butter until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time until well blended and add the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in the oats until just combined. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until just light brown. Don't over-bake. Cool and store in an airtight container.

Description: 
We have fallen in love with these!! The added cinnamon and vanilla add a lot more flavor. 
The less they're baked the softer they'll be; the longer they're baked the crunchier they'll be.
Adding chocolate chips to this recipe would be amazing!!Modified from: Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies
