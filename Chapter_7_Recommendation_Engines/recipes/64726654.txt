Ingredients:
1/2 pound (2 sticks) of unsalted butter
2 Cups of sugar
2 eggs - beaten
Vanilla (I never measure it cause I like a lot)
16 ounces (2 bags) of chopped dates
4 Cups of Rice Krispie cereal
1 bag of coconut

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan.
Add sugar and stir until dissolved.
Lower heat.
Add about 2 spoonfuls of butter/sugar mix to beaten eggs to temper them.
Add eggs to pans and stir well so eggs don’t scramble.
Add vanilla.
Add dates.
Increase heat.
Constantly stirring, bring to a boil.
Stir until almost all the dates dissolve and it’s a light brown color.
Turn off heat.
Let cool for about 3 minutes.
Add the Rice Krispies and stir until all combined.
Use two spoons or a cookie scoop to make small balls. I wear kitchen gloves while doing this because the mixture is very hot and it sticks less to the gloves than your bare hands.
Toss cookies in coconut.
Let cool on wax paper.

Description: 
Uncle Jay’s favorite which ceremoniously become his birthday present every year. Grammy taught me how to make these and they are mandatory at Christmas! This recipe is for one batch. But you will need to double the recipe if you want there to be any for Christmas. The picture has Grammy’s recipe in the background.
