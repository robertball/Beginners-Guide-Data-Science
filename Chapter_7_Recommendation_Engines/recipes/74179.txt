Ingredients:
1 cup bottled Bloody Mary mix
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
1 lemon, juiced
2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 pounds halibut fillets, cubed

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the Bloody Mary mix, hot pepper sauce, and lemon juice. Stir in the shrimp and halibut chunks. Let marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.
Preheat a grill for high heat. Place a grill pan over the grilling surface, or you may use a heavy sheet of foil that has holes poked in it with a fork.
Drain the shrimp and halibut in a colander, discarding the marinade. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the seafood is browned and opaque.

Description: 
I like serving this dish as brunch when an all-day barbeque is planned. I usually serve it over rice with lemon wedges as a garnish.
