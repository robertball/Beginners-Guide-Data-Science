Description: 
Adding typical BLT ingredients to avacado, alfalfa sprouts, and provolone cheese makes a winning combination for even the pickiest eaters.  The avacado sauce is versatile enough to experiment with different wrap toppings.  Vegetarians can leave off the bacon for a hearty protein wrap given the addition of sprouts. Everyone who tries this,both with and without bacon, loves it!
