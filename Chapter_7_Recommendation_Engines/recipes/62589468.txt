Ingredients:
2 medium red potatoes (more or less depending on your hunger level)
¼ yellow onion
1 clove garlic
¼ red bell pepper
A few chives (optional)
½ cup of shredded vegan cheddar cheese
2 TBS olive oil
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Poke holes in the potatoes and microwave on high for 3 minutes.
Chop the potatoes, skin and all, into ½ inch chunks.
Chop onion, garlic, and bell pepper and set aside.
Preheat stainless steel pan (or non-stick if you prefer) on medium-high, then add olive oil.
When oil is hot and sizzling, add potatoes and stir to coat.
Add salt & pepper to taste.
Sauté until the potatoes begin to brown, then add onions, garlic, and bell pepper and slightly lower the heat.
Add more oil if pan is drying out.
Stir often, cooking until potatoes have browned even more and veggies have begun to soften.
Place your potato spectacular in a bowl, sprinkle with shredded cheese.
Snip the chives with your scissors on top of everything and enjoy!
