Ingredients:
Pasta:
1 lb. (12 oz.) egg noodles, homestyle
1 cube, salted butter
3/4 cup (1/2 oz) fresh sage leaves (1/2 c. chopped)
1 extra large garlic clove, crushed
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 cups frozen peas, defrosted
1-1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lime, juiced
Fish:
1 lb. 8 oz. salmon, skinned and brown part removed, cut into approx. 4 x 4" pieces
1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 extra large garlic cloves, crushed
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 lime, juiced
kosher salt

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Marinate salmon in olive oil and garlic for at least 30 min.
To cook Salmon, put foil on baking sheet and place salmon inside. Sprinkle generously with salt and sprinkle with thyme. Cover to make a sealed pouch. Cook Salmon for 15 - 20 min. Or until done.
Boil pasta in well salted water (approx 2 tablespoons of kosher salt), and cook until ready. Drain
In a small sauce pan melt butter, swirling the pan until butter turns brown. Be careful not to let it burn. Turn off heat and add sage and garlic. Stir, cover until you are ready to add to cooked pasta. (Let sit approx. 5 min.) Then add in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Pour over pasta. Stir. Add the juice of 1 lime and 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt. Stir well.
When salmon is done, squeeze lime juice all over and cut salmon in large chunks and place on top of pasta.  Sprinkle with sea salt and serve.
