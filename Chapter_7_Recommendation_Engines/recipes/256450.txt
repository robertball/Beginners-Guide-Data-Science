Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups whole pecans
1/3 cup brown sugar
6 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 egg, beaten
Filling:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
2 eggs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 vanilla bean

Directions:
Pour pecans into a blender; grind into a meal.
Whisk pecan meal, 1/3 cup brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Rub in butter with your fingers until mixture resembles a coarse meal and a few pea-sized pieces remain. Drizzle beaten egg over butter mixture; mix gently with a fork until dough comes together.
Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Form dough into a disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface into a 10-inch crust. Transfer to an 8-inch baking dish. Cover crust with a piece of parchment paper; fill with pie weights.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let crust cool.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add sweet potatoes, cover, and steam until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Strain into a bowl; mash until smooth.
Combine 8 ounces plus 6 ounces cream cheese and 1 cup brown sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Beat in mashed sweet potatoes and sour cream. Add cinnamon and ginger.
Split vanilla bean lengthwise with the tip of a sharp knife. Holding the pod open, scrape seeds from each half using the flat side of your knife. Beat seeds into the cream cheese mixture.
Pour cream cheese mixture into the cooled crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
