Ingredients:
6 eggs
4 (15 ounce) cans baked beans with pork, drained
1 cup sweet pickle relish
1 small onion, diced (optional)
5 radishes, diced
1 (16 ounce) jar creamy salad dressing (e.g. Miracle Whip)

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice.
In a large bowl, stir together the baked beans, relish, onion, and radishes. Stir in the salad dressing, and gently mix in the sliced hard-cooked eggs until everything is evenly blended. The amount of dressing may be adjusted to suit your taste. Cover, and chill for 1 hour before serving.
