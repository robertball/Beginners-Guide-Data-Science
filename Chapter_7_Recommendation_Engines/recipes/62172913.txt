Ingredients:
2 medium sweet potatoes, scrubbed clean
6 sun-dried tomato tortillas

1 (15 ounce)can black beans, rinsed, drained, divided
1 cup salsa (optional)

Directions:
Bake sweet potatoes at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes...doing this ahead will halve the cooking time!
Place a skillet over medium heat, warm the tortilla for 2 minutes.  Flip the tortilla over.
Sprinkle shredded cheese to within half an inch of the edge.  Allow  cheese to melt.
In a bowl, mash the hot sweet potato.
Spread mashed potato with a spatula over melted cheddar cheese on half of the tortilla.
Spoon on some black beans.
Fold the cheesy half of the tortilla over.
Place on an oven-proof plate to keep warm in oven. Cut into wedges & serve plain, or with salsa.
