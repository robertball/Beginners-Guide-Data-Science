Ingredients:
1 pack of fresh bagels (or your own homemade are even better)
1-2 slices of your favorite cheese for each bagel
1 egg for each bagel
1 med slice of turkey pastrami or regular Pastrami per bagel

Directions:
Slice the bagels in half and lightly toast.
While they're toasting, pan fry the egg to your liking in a pan with a little oil to reduce sticking. i like mine cooked "over-hard."
When the egg is cooked, place the slice of pastrami in the pan and flip the egg onto it.
Lay the sliced cheese on top and fry it about a minute to 90 seconds.
Once the cheese melts a bit, scoop the pastrami-egg-cheese  onto the bottom half of the toasted, split bagel. Put the top half of the bagel on top and you're ready to serve.
