Ingredients:
Sea salt
1 pound De Cecco® farfalle pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
3-4 cups kale, chopped
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup chicken broth or pasta water
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, 8 minutes. Drain and reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water.
In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add kale, red pepper flakes, and garlic. Cook until wilted, about 5 minutes. Add in beans and toss using a wooden spoon.
Using a slotted spoon add pasta into the sauté pan. Stir in 1/2 cup of chicken broth or reserved pasta water. Sprinkle in parmesan cheese.
You may want to drizzle a little olive oil over pasta before serving!
