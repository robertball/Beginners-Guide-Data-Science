Ingredients:
1 box rice noodles (or black bean noodles), prepared.  Toss with a little sesame if you'd like to keep them from sticking to one another.
2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 bunch of green onions, finely chopped (white and whitish green parts only - save the green parts for garnish)
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 tsp fresh ginger paste (or peeled and minced fresh ginger)
1/3 cup peanut butter (I used chunky)
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup water
1-2 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
1-2 tsp Sambal Olek chile paste
1 tsp brown sugar (white sugar also works)
Crushed peanuts for garnish

Directions:
Heat sesame oil to low-medium in a large skillet or wok.  Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.  Add ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
Add peanut butter, soy sauce, water, vinegar, sugar, and chile paste to the onion mixture.  Mix well.  Taste sauce and add additional ingredients, if needed.
Add noodles and mix well.  Garnish with crushed peanuts and some chopped green parts from the green onions.
