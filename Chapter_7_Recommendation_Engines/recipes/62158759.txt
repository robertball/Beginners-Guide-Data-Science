Ingredients:
1 one lb box elbow macaroni, cooked according to directions on box
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
2 cups diced processed cheese (I use Velveeta)
6 tablespoons butter (plus a bit more for greasing baking pan)
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups milk
1 scant tsp garlic powder
1 1/2 tsp salt
fresh grated pepper to taste
2 cups diced ham

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 (F).
Use an over size pot for cooking elbows so that you can use the same pan for mixing later on.
Cook the elbows, drain in a colander and return them to the cooking pot. If your elbows cook before you're ready, add a bit of butter to them & stir to keep them from sticking too much.
While elbows are cooking, grate & dice cheeses and dice the ham.
Melt the butter in a medium sauce pan over low heat.
Add the flour to the butter, along with salt and pepper(if desired) and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbly.
Stir in milk slowly and use a whisk if needed to eliminate lumps.
Stir constantly until the milk & flour mixture has thickened, add garlic powder & then the cheeses, a handful at a time, waiting until previous addition is melted.
Stir cheese mixture and diced ham into pot of elbows. When everything is well mixed, pour into a greased baking pan.
Bake at 350 (F) for 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how deep your baking pan is.

Description: 
A great idea for leftover ham and you'll still have the bone left for soup. Add a salad for a complete dinner.
