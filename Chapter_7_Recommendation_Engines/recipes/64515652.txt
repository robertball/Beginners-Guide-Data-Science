Ingredients:
1/2 cup honey
3 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cups almonds, toasted
3/4 cups cashews, toasted
1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, lightly toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F.  Put nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Put coconut, spread out, on a parchment lined baking sheet.  Toast each until lightly toasted and aromatic.  (Approximately 10 minutes for nuts, 7 minutes for coconut).
Heat honey, water, vanilla and salt in a small pot over medium heat until bubbling.  Lower to medium-low heat and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture registers 270F (hard ball stage) on a candy thermometer.
Remove from heat and stir in nuts and coconut.  Mix thoroughly until nuts and coconut are completely coated.
Line an 8x8 pan with parchment paper and press mixture into pan.  Make sure that it is evenly distributed.  Use a piece of parchment on top and press down firmly with hands (or a small rolling pin) making sure to get it into the corners and as flat as possible.
Leave on the counter for 1 1/2 hours.
Cut in to 12 bars.
Bars can be individually wrapped and stored in a zip lock bag.
