Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup quinoa
3 small carrots, finely diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 small zucchini, diced
salt to taste
3 scallions, sliced
Dressing:
4 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cucumber, diced
7 sprigs fresh dill, finely chopped

Directions:
Bring vegetable broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. After 10 minutes of cook time, add carrots and cook for the last 5 to 10 minutes with the quinoa. Remove from heat, drain, and place in a bowl.
While quinoa is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet. Add zucchini and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Lightly salt. Remove and add to quinoa. Mix in scallions.
Mix lemon juice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper in a small bowl for the dressing; pour over the salad. Add cucumber and dill and toss to combine.

Description: 
This is a very versatile salad that I often make for potlucks or as a side for barbecues. You can switch out the vegetables to your liking. I've made also it with tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms. You can eat it right away while still warm or chill for a few hours for flavors to combine.
