Ingredients:
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon dried minced onion or onion powder
1 teaspoon fresh or jar minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (or oregano)
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
1. Whisk together the balsamic vinegar, water, and spices in a bowl, and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken breasts, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 30 minutes to overnight (overnight is really good, but can get strong. I would recommend putting this together in the morning to cook later that day).
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, or lightly grease a broiler pan. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade, and place the chicken breasts onto the baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken breasts are golden brown, and no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes.
