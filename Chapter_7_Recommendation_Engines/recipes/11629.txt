Ingredients:
1/3 cup boiling water
2 cups dates, pitted and chopped
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, pour boiling water over dates, and set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10x10 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and white sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the dates, including any water; mix well. Sift together the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda; stir into the date mixture. Then stir in the nuts.
Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared 10x10 inch pan, and bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. When cool, cut into bars, and roll each bar in confectioners' sugar.
