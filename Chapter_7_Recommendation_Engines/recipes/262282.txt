Description: 
My mother-in-law taught me to wrap Christmas fruitcake in cheesecloth soaked in grapefruit juice. 
She would make one for her 7 children and 13 grandchildren every year.
 After trying different things back in the day, even trying a coffee wrap, which didn't work very well, she settled on grapefruit juice. This is great for a non-alcoholic family fruit cake! Some mild fermentation will already exist in the cake from the fruit.
