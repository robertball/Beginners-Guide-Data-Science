Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (1 to 1 1/4 pounds total)
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced (1 1/2 teaspoons minced)
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Directions:
1. Place each chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound lightly to 1/2-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap.
2. Place chicken in a self-sealing plastic bag. In a small bowl combine vinegar, oil, garlic, kosher salt, and crushed red pepper. Pour over chicken. Seal bag; turn to coat chicken. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours, turning bag occasionally.
3. Drain, discarding marinade. For a charcoal grill, place chicken on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals for 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink (170°F), turning once halfway through grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place chicken on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.)
Oven method: Place chicken on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. Roast chicken in a 400°F oven for about 15 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink (170°F)
