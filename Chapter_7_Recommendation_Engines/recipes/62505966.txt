Ingredients:
2-3 stalks celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 onions, roughly chopped
1 sweet pepper, roughly chopped
1 796ml. can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 680ml. can smooth pasta sauce
1 lb. ground beef
3/4 cup mushrooms, diced
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 540ml. can kidney beans, drained and rinsed (optional)

Directions:
Saute celery in a little butter a few minutes, add onions and garlic and cook a few more minutes. Add peppers, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes, or until celery is beginning to soften.
Stir in tomatoes (and beans if using) and cook 2 minutes. Add pasta sauce, stir well, cover and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, 15-20 minutes, to allow flavors to blend and vegetables to soften.
Mix beef, mushrooms, bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and cayenne pepper. Either form 1" meatballs and fry until cooked through. Or cook mixture as for browning ground beef. Add to sauce, stir to combine and serve.
