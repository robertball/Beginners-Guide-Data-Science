Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 small onion, thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 pound chopped deli ham
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1 (16 ounce) package potato gnocchi
1 cup whipping cream
1 cup marinara sauce
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in ham and garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add wine, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until liquid has reduced by 3/4 of the original amount, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain gnocchi and set aside.
Add cream to the skillet and bring to a rolling boil. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in marinara sauce and cooked gnocchi; toss lightly to combine. Add parsley and basil. Sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and serve.
