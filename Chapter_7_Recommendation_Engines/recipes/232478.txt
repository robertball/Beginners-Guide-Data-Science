2/3 cup red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Salad:
1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, garlic, Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes. Drain.
