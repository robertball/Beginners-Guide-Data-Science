Ingredients:
INGREDIENTS
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (boiled and shredded, I use the crock pot so they're ready when I get home from work)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
3 cups shredded Pepper Jack cheese (DIVIDED)
1 (10.5 ounce) can red enchilada sauce (DIVIDED)
1 (7 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers
1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of celery soup
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Start with the meat mixture: Saute onions in oil until translucent. In a medium bowl combine shredded chicken, onions, salt, and pepper.
Cheese mixture: In a medium bowl mix soup, 2 1/2 cups cheese, green chilies, and 1/8 cup enchilada sauce; stir until blended.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Assemble enchiladas: In each tortilla place a spoonful of meat mixture and a spoonful of cheese mixture. Roll tortillas and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
Top with enchilada sauce and remaining shredded cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes or until cheese is melted and edges start to brown.

Description: 
I've made cottage cheese enchiladas for years from a recipe given to me by my old college roommate, similar to the one on this site but my fiance hates cottage cheese more then anything, so this is what I came up with.  It's certainly not as healthy but they taste great.
