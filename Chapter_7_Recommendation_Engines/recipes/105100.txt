Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 pound lean ground beef
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 small onion, diced
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Place 4 bacon slices on a plate lined with a doubled paper towel. Top with another doubled paper towel, followed by 4 more bacon slices. Microwave on high power until bacon has rendered much of its fat but is still pliable, about 3 to 4 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix ground beef, cheese, onion, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper. Form into patties and wrap 2 slices of bacon around each burger's perimeter. Secure in place with toothpicks.
Place burgers on hot grill. Cover and cook until grill marks appear, about 4 minutes per side for medium or until internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove toothpicks and serve immediately with desired burger condiments and buns.
