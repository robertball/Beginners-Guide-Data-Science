Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef, elk, turkey, or chicken
1 can kidney beans
1 can plain diced tomatoes
1 can tomato paste
1/2 onion
1 packet chili seasoning
3 tablespoons hot sauce

Directions:
Brown ground beef in a large skillet until it's about halfway done, then add the onion. Continue cooking until beef is browned and onion is translucent. Drain any fat. Keep the beef and onion in the skillet.
Scoop tomato paste into the skillet with the beef and fill the empty can with water. Add the water. Mix until the water and tomato paste are combined.
Add the canned tomatoes to the skillet without draining the liquid. Stir until combined.
Drain kidney beans and add to the skillet. Stir until combined.
Stir in chili seasoning and hot sauce. Once it's all warm, test it. If you want it spicier, add more hot sauce.
