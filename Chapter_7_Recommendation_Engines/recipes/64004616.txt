Brownie Waffle Recipe

Ingredients:
6 oz bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, or 1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup butter
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
2 Tbsp. cocoa powder
1 tsp espresso powder (optional)
1/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan, melt the chocolate and butter over medium-low heat; pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Stir in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla.
Add the flour, cocoa, espresso and salt and stir just until combined; the batter will be thick.
Preheat your waffle iron and spray it with nonstick spray. Cook about 1/3 cup of batter at a time, or whatever fits with your waffle iron. Close the lid and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until cooked through. Open the lid and let cool slightly before flipping out by inverting the waffle iron (carefully!) onto a flat surface. (The brownies are fragile while they’re still hot – however you get them out, be careful!)
Makes 6-8 Belgian-style waffles, each breaking into 4 wedges (about 2 dozen total).
