Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons orange zest
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
STREUSEL TOPPING:
1/4 cup sugar
2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
4 teaspoons cold margarine
2 Tablespoons finely chopped pecans

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Fold in sour cream and orange zest.
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg and salt; stir into creamed mixture just until moistened. Fold in cranberries and pecans. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
To make streusel topping: in a small bowl, combine sugar, flour, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in pecans. Sprinkle over batter.
Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
