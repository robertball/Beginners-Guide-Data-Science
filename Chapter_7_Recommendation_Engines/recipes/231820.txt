Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
water, as needed
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup oats
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 pecan halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners and prepare the liners with cooking spray.
Put squash into a roasting pan with cut sides down. Pour enough water into pan to fill 1/2-inch deep.
Roast squash in preheated oven until flesh is easily pierced through with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove roasting pan and reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Scoop hot squash into a large bowl and mash until no large chunks remain. Stir sugar and butter into the squash.
Whisk flour, oats, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat eggs, milk, sour cream, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stirring constantly, add a spoonful of squash mixture into the egg mixture to temper it before adding egg mixture to the squash mixture; stir.
Fold flour mixture into the squash mixture until just incorporated; spoon into muffin tins. Top each with a pecan half.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
A little sweeter, a little fluffier, a little tastier than the original, but with more fat and calories. Makes a beautifully bright-colored muffin perfect for the fall table. An excellent way to use the squash.
