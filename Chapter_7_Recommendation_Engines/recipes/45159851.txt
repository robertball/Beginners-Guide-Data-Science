Ingredients:
1(18.9 oz Pkg.) Pillsbury French Vanilla cake mix *
1/3 C vegetable oil (Crisco) *
2 eggs Buttercream Frosting *
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened *
6-8 cups confectioners sugar *
1/2 cup milk *
2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Directions Preheat oven to 375F Blend, cake mix, eggs, and oil until moistened. Roll into 1" balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten with a glass or cookie stamp. Bake at 375F for 6-8 minutes. Allow to cool 1 minute before removing to cooling rack. While the cookies are still a little warm, spread on some buttercream frosting. Allow the frosting to set up before storing. Place butter in a large bowl. Add 4 cups sugar and then milk and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, approx 3-5 minutes. Gradually add remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time beating well after each time, about 2 minutes, until the icing is thick enough to spread. Add food coloring if you'd like. I like to let this go in the kitchenaid mixer for 10-15 minutes to make it really light and fluffy.
