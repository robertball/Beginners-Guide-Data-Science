Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2/3 cup halved grape tomatoes
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup roasted unsalted sunflower seeds
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1 tablespoon minced shallot
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring water, quinoa, and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread quinoa on a baking sheet and cool, about 30 minutes.
Mix quinoa, tomatoes, feta cheese, sunflower seeds, parsley, olives, and shallot together in a large bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon sea salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour over quinoa mixture and toss to coat.
