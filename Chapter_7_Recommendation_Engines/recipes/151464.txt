Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups chopped onion
2 cups chopped celery
16 cups dry bread crumbs
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
2 cups chicken broth, or as needed

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until tender, about 10 minutes. Blend in the bread crumbs, salt, poultry seasoning, pepper, thyme and sage. Stir in enough chicken broth to moisten. Spoon into large resealable bags and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
To bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the stuffing into greased casserole dishes.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven. If stuffing a bird, cook according to the recipe for your bird and place any extra stuffing into a casserole dish to bake.
