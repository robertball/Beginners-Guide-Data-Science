Ingredients:
Dough:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup canola oil
1 large egg
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup warm water
2 cups canola oil for frying
Simple Syrup Coating:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

Directions:
Mix flour, 1/3 cup canola oil, egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer with an paddle attachment. Add 1/4 cup water slowly and mix until a soft dough is formed, 4 to 5 minutes. Let dough rest for 30 minutes.
Cut dough into about thirty 1-inch pieces. Press each piece onto the back of a fork and curl it out away from you to make the shushumow.
Heat 2 cups oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan over medium heat. Fry shushumow a few at a time, stirring slowly, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and cardamom in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Stir in the shushumow gently until coated in the syrup. Transfer shushumow to a plate and let cool.

Description: 
Shushumow, which also has many other names (kalkals, zinanaande), is one of the delicacies made during holidays and weddings in Somali culture! It's a fried pastry made with flour, eggs, and water (some recipes call for milk) tossed in simple sugar syrup. The dough is shaped into small balls, flattened, and curled over. It is crispy on the outside and little bit soft in the inside. Shushumow is one of my favorites.
