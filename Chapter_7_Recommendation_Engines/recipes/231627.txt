Ingredients:
1 pound lentils
Chimichurri Sauce:
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
salt to taste
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add lentils, cover, and steam, adding more water as needed, until tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer cooked lentils to a serving bowl.
Blend oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and salt in a blender until well incorporated. Add parsley and cilantro; pulse only long enough to incorporate the herbs.
Drizzle 3 tablespoons chimichurri sauce over lentils; add feta cheese to salad. Toss to evenly coat. Store remaining sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for another use.

Description: 
Steamed lentils mixed with a chimichurri sauce. 
This recipe, I discovered, is quite good in many ways. It is a favorite in our home on baked Yukon gold potatoes or stuffed in a whole wheat pita with sliced cucumbers. You will most likely find a favorite way to enjoy this healthy, high-fiber salad.
