Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1 egg
Filling:
9 ounces dark chocolate chips
2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese (such as Tre Stelle®)
3 eggs
2/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)

Directions:
Combine flour, butter, cocoa, and confectioners' sugar in a food processor. Blend until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add egg and blend briefly to combine into the dough.
Roll out crust dough on a lightly floured work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin. Place in a 8-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Prick pastry dough liberally with a fork. Chill for 1 hour.
While crust dough chills, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake crust in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and set on a wire rack to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Melt dark chocolate chips in a double boiler, about 5 minutes; remove from heat.
Beat mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Pour in melted chocolate and orange liqueur; stir to combine. Pour filling into the prepared crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before serving.
