Ingredients:
12 large eggs
Dash hot sauce, or to taste
2 tsp seasoning salt
1/2 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 large onion, diced
1 lb ground venison or turkey
1 1/2 lb fresh or 20 oz frozen spinach

Directions:
Add eggs, hot sauce, and seasonings to a small bowl.  Whisk just enough to combine.  Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  Add onions and cook saute until soft, but not brown (approx 4 minutes).
Add the ground meat and continue cooking until completely browned, breaking the meat into small pieces as it cooks.
Sprinkle the spinach over the meat and cover.  Cook until the fresh spinach wilts or the frozen spinach is warmed through, approximately 3 minutes.
Stir the spinach into the meat mixture, cooking briefly to eliminate any excess moisture.
Add egg mixture and remove from heat.  The eggs should cook from the residual heat.  Stir occasionally.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
It's that classic American diner recipe, made lighter for the more health conscious American.  That delicious combination of meat, eggs, and veggies is just what the doctor ordered on a cold Sunday morning.  Somewhere between an omelet and a casserole, this hearty, flavorful dish is perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
