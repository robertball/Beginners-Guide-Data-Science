Ingredients:
1 large cucumber sliced thinly
1 medium red onion sliced thinly
4 tablespoon white vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup hot water

Directions:
Mix vinegar, sugar, salt and hot water until sugar is dissolved.
Combine cucumber and onions with vinegar sauce, coating thoroughly.
Let sit in fridge for at least an hour, stirring occasionally to keep cucumbers and onions coated. Over time, they'll become softer, and the onions less pungent.

Description: 
This salad is a refreshing side to spicy Thai food. I prefer it without hot peppers or peanuts since its major purpose for me is refreshment. It's especially quick to make if you can slice the cucumbers and onions in a food processor.
