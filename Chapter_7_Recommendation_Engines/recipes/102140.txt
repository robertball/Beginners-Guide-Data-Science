1 (16 ounce) package Regular Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage, cooked, crumbled and drained
1 (16 ounce) package large fresh mushrooms
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 tablespoon Italian-style bread crumbs
1 tablespoon melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Remove stems from mushrooms; reserve for another use. Place mushrooms rounded side down in two greased 9 inches X 13 inches baking dishes. Drain and press spinach to remove excess liquid.
In a large bowl, combine cooked sausage, spinach, Parmesan cheese and olive oil; mix well. Stuff sausage mixture into mushroom caps. Sprinkle with bread crumbs; drizzle with melted butter.
Bake 30 minutes or until topping is brown and bubbly.
