Description: 
This is my Aunts  recipe and she is old school, and does not write things down.
She does not use ground meat.




I have made them this way many times but also with  a mix of
ground chicken, pork and beef burger, or all beef burger.
Charring the peppers make them softer and easier to eat and more flavorful.
If making with ground meat add tomatoe sauce to the mixture, 1-2 cups.
I use Goat Cheese Mozzarella  and it works great.
