Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup mirin
1/2 cup sake
1/2 cup canned chicken stock
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon crushed finely chopped garlic

Directions:
Combine in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a slow rolling boil.  Lower heat to medium-low heat and simmer uncovered until it heavily coats the back of a spoon (2-3 hours).  Make sure not to use a higher heat as it will scorch the sauce rather than speed the process.
Note: After simmering for the first 15 minutes, this is the stage of the sauce that you can use it as a marinade for teriyaki.

Description: 
This sauce is a favorite among sushi bar patrons - the thick sweet sauce that comes atop Unagi (Freshwater Eel) and atop some sushi rolls, e.g. Caterpillar Roll.  This sauce was originally created in Japan using the stock from boiling eels, but since it is difficult to come across live eel in the US, this non-eel version works just as well.
