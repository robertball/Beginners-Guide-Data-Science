Ingredients:
SAUCE:
1 cup honey
1 tbs chili flakes
MARINADE:
2 cups buttermilk
2 tbs hot sauce
1 tsp each salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder
20 wings, disjointed, tips removed
non stick spray
3 cups Corn Flake Crumbs
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup yellow corn meal
salt
pepper

Directions:
Cut up wings, and discard tips. Soak in buttermilk mixture with hot sauce and spices for 12-24 hours (the buttermilk tenderizes, flavors and gives the "fat" the wings will need to hold the coating and "fry" in the oven.
Mix the crumbs, flour and corn meal and seasonings in a large bowl.  Take wings from buttermilk and shake off ecxess.  Dredge in breading, pressing the coating into the wings.  Place on oiled or pre-treated sheet pans.  Spray tops of wings with pam or non stick spray.  Bake at 400 degrees  30-40 minutes until brown and very crispy.
While chicken is cooking, heat honey and chili flakes in a small saucepan over low heat.  Honey will get thin and hot.  When chicken comes out of the oven, plate and pour chili honey sauce all over the wings.  Now you will have a big pile of hot, crunchy, spicy, sticky wings.  GET LOTS OF NAPKINS (AND MAYBE A BIB) AND ENJOY!
