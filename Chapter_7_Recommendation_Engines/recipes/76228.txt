Ingredients:
1/2 cup canola oil
3/4 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 large egg white
1/8 teaspoon anise extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
1 tablespoon anise seed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Spray a cookie sheet or jellyroll pan with baking spray and set aside.
Mix the oil, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and sugar together in a large mixing bowl. Add eggs and egg white, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Add anise extract.  Stir until blended.  Set aside.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, nonfat dry milk and anise seed in a medium size mixing bowl.
Pour the flour mixture into the oil and egg mixture and stir until blended.
Divide dough in half.  Shape each half into a log approximately 3 1/2 inches wide by 12 inches long.   Place the logs on the prepared pan 2 inches apart.
Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes.
Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes.   Slice the loaves with a sharp knife into 48 slices, approximately 1/2 inch wide.
Cool and store in airtight containers.  Cookies will stay fresh up to 5 days.
