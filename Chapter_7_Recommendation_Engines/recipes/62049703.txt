Ingredients:
1/2 lb Italian sausage links (I used 3 Perri sweet sausage links)
2 medium red potatoes, cooked and cut into 1/2" dice
1 Tbsp	margarine
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 small	canned corn, drained
1 cup Egg Beaters® 99% egg substitute, OR 4 eggs, beaten
1 tsp dried thyme, crushed in palm
1/4 cup sharp Cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Remove sausage from casings.  Heat nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook sausage until done, about 5 minutes, crumbling with wooden spoon in skillet while sausage cooks.  Remove to bowl.  Melt margarine in same pan; add diced potatoes, salt and pepper to taste, and cook until crispy and lightly browned, stirring frequently, about 5-8 minutes.  Remove to bowl.  Add drained corn kernels and mix well.
Spray a 1-quart round casserole dish with Pam cooking spray; add sausage/potatoes/corn mixture, dried thyme and pour Egg Beaters or beaten eggs over all.  Mix well.  Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes.
Sprinkle grated cheese on top and bake for an additional 5 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned and eggs are set (it's done when knife inserted into center of casserole comes out clean).
Let sit for 5 minutes before cutting into quarters and serving.
