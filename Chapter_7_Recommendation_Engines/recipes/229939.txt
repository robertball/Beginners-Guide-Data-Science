Ingredients:
2 cups raw whole pumpkin seeds
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
3/4 teaspoon teriyaki sauce, or to taste
1 pinch salt (optional)

Directions:
Spread pumpkin seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with waxed paper; set aside in a cool, dry place and allow to dry overnight, turning seeds a time or two during several hours of drying.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Mix melted butter, Cajun seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, seasoned salt, and teriyaki sauce in a bowl; toss the pumpkin seeds in the seasoned butter to coat. Set seasoned pumpkin seeds aside for 5 minutes to absorb flavors. Spread seeds onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until seeds are browned and fragrant, 45 minutes to 1 hour; stir after 30 minutes. Remove and let cool until seeds stop making a popping noise; sprinkle with salt if desired.

Description: 
My family and I have always loved these during the pumpkin season. Over the years I've come to tweak it to our tastes. More flavor and a little more spice, but NOT overdoing it. I hope you love this as much as we do. Trust me on the seasonings. Seems to be a lot, but SO very worth it. I usually get quite a bit out of these with everyone just passing them around. You can make a bigger batch of these (which I have done many times). Just adjust the ingredients to the amount of pumpkin seeds you have. This a great snack for parties or family night.
