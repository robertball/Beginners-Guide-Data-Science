Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
3 large eggs
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup fresh Cara Cara orange juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 standard muffin cups with papers.
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Beat white sugar, butter, and orange zest together in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes; beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir cream, orange juice, and vanilla extract together in a cup.
Beat flour mixture into butter mixture on low speed in 3 batches, alternating with cream mixture and ending with flour mixture, just until fully combined. Fill prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Intense, deep pink Cara Cara oranges bring bright citrus flavor to vanilla butter cupcakes. If you feel they need dressing up, dust with confectioner's sugar, add a generous tablespoon of orange zest to a vanilla buttercream, or contrast with a milk chocolate or cream cheese icing.
