Ingredients:
2 pounds pork baby back ribs
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbecue sauce
Dry rub mix

Directions:
Tear off 4 pieces of aluminum foil big enough to enclose each portion of ribs. Spray each piece of foil with vegetable cooking spray. Rob ribs with dry rub mix.  Brush the ribs liberally with barbeque sauce and place each portion in its own piece of foil. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Bake ribs wrapped tightly in the foil at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from foil and add more sauce, if desired.

Description: 
An overnight marinade makes these baked ribs so succulent. And look how easy it is to clean up! Just toss the foil and you're out of the kitchen. It doesn't get any easier than this.Modified from: Baby Back Ribs
