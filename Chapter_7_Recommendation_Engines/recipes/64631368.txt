Ingredients:
6 eggs
8 oz cream cheese
8 oz white baking chocolate

Directions:
Separate egg whites from yolks and place in separate bowls. Refrigerate the egg whites.
Preheat oven to 338 degrees.
Break white chocolate into pieces and place in large bowl. Melt chocolate in double boiler over hot water. Mix chocolate until smooth.
Whip egg whites with electric mixer until firm peaks form. You can turn the bowl over without the egg whites falling out when firm enough.
Mix in softened cream cheese to the chocolate. Then mix in the egg yolks.
Add 1/3 of the merengue to the cream cheese mixture and blend well. Add the rest of the merengue 1/2 at a time. Blend well.
Rub oil/butter on parchment paper (to help prevent cracking when cake begins to shrink) and line a 6" cake pan.
Pour batter into pan and drop on counter a couple of times to release air bubbles.
Place cake in oven on cookie tray and fill with some hot water.
Back cake at 338 degrees for 15 minutes, then reduce heat down to 320 degrees for another 15 minutes. Then turn off oven and bake for a remaining 15 minutes with remaining heat.
Remove from oven and place on wire rack to cool completely.
Dust with powdered sugar if desired.
