Description: 
You can use Bisquick for the bottom muffin if all being eaten that day.  I find they don't reheat well but are yummy the first time.  I used the Grands in an extra large muffin tin I have.  They reheat wonderfully.  I've also used ham and Kielbasa (leftover) as well as the sausage and the bacon.  The kids love them! Great to make ahead for Christmas morning!
