Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
2 cups packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar

1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups quick-cooking oats
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups miniature chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl until creamy. Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla extract; beat until smooth.
Mix flour, oats, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter until combined. Fold chocolate chips into batter. Drop 1 to 2 tablespoons batter for each cookie onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of each cookie are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
