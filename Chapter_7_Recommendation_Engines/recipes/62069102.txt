Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Spray large cooking sheet with nonstick spray and unroll the dough onto it.
In a medium frypan, melt margarine and then cook chicken until it is no longer pink. Set aside.
In a small saucepan, melt peanut butter. Add soy sauce, honey, garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Stir until well blended.
Spread the sauce mixture onto the rolled out crust. Top crust with chicken, oranges, pineapple and almonds. Sprinkle cheese over everything.
