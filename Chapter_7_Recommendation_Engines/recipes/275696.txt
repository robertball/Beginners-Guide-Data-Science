Description: 
Delicious, creamy, and decadent French silk pie! This recipe is unique since it requires the eggs to be cooked rather than a traditional French silk pie recipe that uses raw eggs. To make things easier, use a frozen store-bought deep-dish pie crust! Garnish with fresh whipped cream and chocolate curls. Cover remaining pie with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
