Ingredients:
2-2/3  cups dried bow ties, penne, or ziti (8 ounces)
2  medium onions, cut into thin wedges, or 5 medium leeks, sliced
2  cloves garlic, minced
1  tablespoon butter or margarine
1/4  cup all-purpose flour
1/2  teaspoon anise seeds, crushed
1-3/4  cups milk
1-1/2  cups chicken broth
1/4  cup grated Parmesan cheese
1  10-ounce package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
2  ounces prosciutto, cut into thin bite-size strips
1  medium tomato, seeded and chopped

Directions:
1. Cook pasta according to the package directions. Drain; rinse pasta with cold water. Drain again.
2. In a large saucepan cook onion and garlic, covered, in hot butter about 5 minutes or until onion is tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in flour and anise seeds. Add the milk and chicken broth all at once. Cook and stir until slightly thickened and bubbly. Stir in Parmesan cheese. Stir in the cooked pasta, spinach, and prosciutto. Spoon the mixture into a 2-quart casserole.
3. Bake, covered, in a 350Â°F oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until heated through. Let stand about 5 minutes. To serve, stir gently and top with chopped tomato.

Description: 
Prosciutto -- a salt-cured and air-dried ham -- adds flavor and dimension to this hearty Italian-inspired casserole recipe. Prosciutto is available in most supermarkets, but if you can't find it, try thinly sliced cooked ham instead.
