Ingredients:
1/3 cup finely chopped pecans, toasted, divided
8 ounces semisweet chocolate
1/4 cup butter (no substitutes)

1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Place 24 small foil candy cups in miniature muffin cups or on a baking sheet. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon pecans into each; set cups and remaining pecans aside. In a 2-qt. microwave-safe bowl, combine chocolate and butter. Microwave at 50% power for 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until melted. Stir in cream and extract. Beat with an electric mixer until slightly thickened, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Immediately pour into prepared cups. Top with remaining pecans.  Refrigerate until set.
