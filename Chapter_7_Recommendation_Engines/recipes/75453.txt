Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
8 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 medium white onion, chopped
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced

1 cup dry white wine
4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained and rinsed with juices reserved

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Melt butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add onions, mushrooms, and garlic, and saute until tender. Pour in wine and simmer for 10 minutes, reducing heat if necessary.
Stir in clams, reserved clam juice, sour cream, pepper, and parsley, and simmer another 20 minutes. Toss with linguine, and serve. Enjoy!
