Ingredients:
1 cup Fiber One® cereal, ground into a flour (about half of one pouch.)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Splenda
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup fat free buttermilk
2 large eggs
1/4 cup Agave nectar OR honey
1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract
2 Tbsp melted butter
_______________________________
For Glaze:
chocolate chips or white chocolate chips
1 tsp vegetable shortening
Sprinkles, optional

Directions:
I prefer to use my Babycake Donut maker for this recipe, if you don't have one just preheat your oven to 425 and lightly coat a donut pan with non-stick spray.
Combine flours, Splenda, baking powder, and nutmeg. Blend with a whisk.
In a separate bowl, combine remaining ingredients and whisk well.
Add the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture and whisk well. Batter should be thick and smooth.
Put batter into a pastry bag without a tip on the end and pipe into donut pan or Babycakes maker.
If using Babycakes, cook for about 4 minutes.
If using oven bake for about 15 minutes, and check.
Microwave chocolate and shortening about 1-2 minutes and stir until smooth.
Dip the donuts into the chocolate, letting the excess drip off. Add sprinkles if desired. Let cool on wax paper

Description: 
I was inspired to create these by my five year old, who loves donuts. I was looking to up the nutritional value in these treats so I could feel better about indulging him. They turned out wonderfully. Enjoy them with a big glass of milk!
