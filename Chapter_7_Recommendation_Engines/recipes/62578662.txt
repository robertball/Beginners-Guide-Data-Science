Ingredients:
2 recipes Pizza Dough (see Footnotes) or 2 cans refrigerated pizza dough
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cut into 48 cubes
4 ounces thin pepperoni, roughly chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
2 cups pizza sauce or marinara sauce, heated

Directions:
Prepare pizza dough.
If you are going to bake some (or all!) right away preheat oven to 400°F. Grease 3 pie pans.
If using refrigerated pizza dough: roll one dough out into a large rectangle and cut into 24 pieces. Repeat with 2nd pizza dough. If using homemade dough just pinch off walnut sized pieces as you go.
In each dough piece place a couple pieces of chopped pepperoni and a cube of cheese. Seal dough around meat and cheese and place seam side down in pie pan.
Repeat, placing approximately 16 dough balls in each pie plate.
Once assembled, combine oil and spices and brush over the dough. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Now you can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze or you can bake right away.
When ready to bake: bake at 400°F for 16-20 min. Serve with warm pizza or marinara sauce.

I found this recipe at chaosinthekitchen.com. 
These Pizza bites make great party food, or you can add a salad for a fun family dinner.  This recipe makes three trays which means you can pop them in the freezer and always have a quick appetizer on hand. When you are planning to make these grab a package of three disposable pie tins from the bakery aisle at the store, they are cheap and they will keep you from having to waste all of your good pie plates in the freezer.
