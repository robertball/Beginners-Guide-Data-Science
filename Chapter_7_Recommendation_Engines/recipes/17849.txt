Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch round pan. Sift together the flour and cocoa. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
