Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve with wavy potato chips or mini toasts.

Description: 
Legend has it that the Sloppy Joe was first created in Sioux City, Iowa in 1930 by a cook named Joe. We think Joe would love this creamy, cheesy, game day dip! Season ground beef with McCormick® Sloppy Joes Seasoning Mix for authentic flavor. Add cream cheese, tomato sauce, onions, and Cheddar Jack cheese to beef. Bake until ooey-gooey and garnish with dill pickle slices. Tangy, sweet and savory, it's best enjoyed loaded on top of potato chips.
