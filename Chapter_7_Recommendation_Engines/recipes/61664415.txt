Apple Pie by Grandma Ople Recipe

Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1 egg white
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water less 1/2 Tbsp
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 Tbsp vanilla*
4 large Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced thinly
* I normally use a vanilla from Mexico that is actually now illegal to bring back across the border.  *blush*  It's extremely strong.  Therefore, my 1/2 Tbsp is not going to be the same as a normal grocery store, everyday, cheap vanilla extract. *makes nasty face*  You may want to alter spices to your individual preferences, just remember to remove the same amount of water you used in vanilla. ;)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). While the oven preheats, prepare pie crust. Place the bottom crust in your pan. Brush with egg white. (This helps keep the bottom crust from becoming soggy.)  Prepare lattice top or top crust with decorative cut-outs.  It's very important to move quickly with the sauce and work with it while it's hot, therefore having this step complete will ensure things go smoothly!
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir flour water, white sugar, brown sugar, spices and vanilla together in a separate bowl.  Add sugar mixture to the melted butter, stirring constantly, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer until a golden caramel color.  Remove from heat.
Quickly toss 2/3 of caramel sauce with apples in a large bowl.  Reserve remaining 1/3 of sauce in warm pan. Fill  crust with apples, mounding slightly. Cover with a lattice work of crust.  Gently pour the remainder of the sauce over the crust, pouring slowly so that it does not run off.
Bake for 15 minutes at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes or until apples are soft.

This is an apple pie recipe I ganked from the Internet and made my own.  I've never had one quite like it and will never bother to make a different one.
