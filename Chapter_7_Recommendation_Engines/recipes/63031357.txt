Ingredients:
1 cup baby spinach leaves
2 cups mixed baby salad greens
1/3 cup semi-crumbled Feta Cheese
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup chopped salted pecans or roasted sliced almonds
2 apples, cored and diced
1/4 to 1/2 red onion, diced
1 carrot, finely grated
1 avocado, peeled and diced
3 T cup balsamic vinegar
1 T Olive Oil
1/2 t Orange Juice, Frozen Concentrate
Black Pepper or Red Pepper Flakes to taste

Directions:
Place spinach, feta, cranberries, nuts, apple, onion, carrot, and avocado into a bowl and toss lightly. Whisk together Balsamic Vinegar, Olive Oil, Frozen Orange Juice and pepper. Drizzle balsamic vinaigrette over salad, and toss to coat.
To roast almond slices: Spread out almond slices evenly on a cookie sheet. Place carefully in a pre-heated (300 degree F)oven. Watching almost constantly, leave them in the oven for 5-10 minutes. Check for any brown edges. If none, then check them every 3 minutes until a few browned edges appear. Remove immediately to a cool plate. PS-It is easier if you use aluminium foil or parchment paper under the nut slices so you can slide the nuts off the paper and onto the plate easily after roasting.
