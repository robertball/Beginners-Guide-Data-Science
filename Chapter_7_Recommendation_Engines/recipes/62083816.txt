Image:

Ingredients:
1 whole chicken with giblets, quartered
2 tbsp clarified butter or vegetable oil
1 large whole onion
1-2 bay leaves
4-5 cardamom pods
4-5 whole cloves
salt and pepper to taste
1-1 1/2 quarts water

Directions:
Wash the chicken parts.  Shake dry, and rub with salt and pepper.  Add the chicken, giblets, and butter to a 5-7 quart pot.  Cover and turn on medium heat.  Peel the onion and cut off the ends.  Add the onion to the pot.  Add the bay leaves, cardamom, and cloves.  When all the moisture has boiled off, brown the chicken for about a minute or two, just enough for the chicken to brown, but not so long that it burns.  Add the water, just enough to almost cover the chicken.  Simmer about 20 minutes.  Serve with rice and stewed vegetables.

Description: 
My husband taught me this traditional Egyptian recipe.  He says I make it better than his mom did!  The trick is knowing exactly when to add the water, just enough time to let the chicken fry a little, but before it burns.
