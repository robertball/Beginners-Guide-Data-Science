Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 yellow cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
Large tray or cardboard, covered with foil
2 (16 ounce) containers Betty Crocker速 Rich & Creamy vanilla frosting
Blue food color
Red food color
Green food color
Yellow food color
Red or black string licorice
8 yellow round starlight candies
10 creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookies
1 red or orange gumdrop
2 birthday cake candles

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease bottoms only of three 8x4-inch loaf pans, or spray bottoms with cooking spray.
Make cake batter as directed on cake mix box. Divide batter evenly among pans.
Bake 28 to 33 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Run knife around sides of pans to loosen cakes; remove from pans to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour. Freeze cakes uncovered about 1 hour for easier frosting if desired.
Remove 1/4 cup frosting from each container; set aside. To make purple frosting, stir 8 drops blue food color and 8 drops red food color into 1 container frosting. To make green frosting, stir 3 drops green food color and 3 drops yellow food color into other container frosting.
Place 2 loaves, rounded sides down, on tray; frost one with about two-thirds of the purple frosting; frost the other with two-thirds of the green frosting. Cut remaining loaf crosswise in half; taper the cut edges slightly to form windshields. Place one half on each cake for cab, placing about 3 inches from front edge and with tapered windshield side toward front of car. Frost windows of cabs with reserved vanilla frosting; frost top and edges with colored frosting. Use licorice to outline windows and make bumpers. Add starlight candies for headlights and taillights; add cookies for wheels and the spares. Place gumdrop on top of 1 car for beacon and add candles for radio antennas. Store loosely covered at room temperature.
