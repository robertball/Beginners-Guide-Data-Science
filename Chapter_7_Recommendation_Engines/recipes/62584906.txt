Ingredients:
1 lb. steak or stew beef (any cut will do)
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced (or 1 tsp garlic powder)
1 tsp white sugar
pepper to taste
1 tbsp butter or olive oil
1 green pepper, sliced thinly
1 onion, sliced thinly
6 button mushrooms, sliced thinly
4 fat-free processed swiss cheese slices
Optional: garnish of sliced green onions
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Slice the beef very thinly across the grain with a sharp knife.
In a bowl or freezer bag, combine the soy sauce, worcestershire, red wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, sugar, and pepper.  Add the beef and marinate for at least 1/2 hour or up to 4 hours.
In a large skillet, heat butter or oil over medium high heat, and saute the green pepper, onion, and mushrooms until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
In the same skillet, fry the marinated steak strips until desired doneness is reached, then return the onion/pepper/mushroom mix to the pan.  Add the swiss cheese slices, and stir until melted.  Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.  Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a versatile dish:  You can eat it as a main, make steak sandwiches with it, or top rice or noodles! (Edit: I added a cup or so of sour cream to this last night and made a fancy beef stroganoff, served over noodles...really great!)
