Ingredients:
1 whole chicken--approx 5 1b
5 or 6 cloves of garlic
1/2 lemon
1 small onion, quartered
sprig of thyme
salt and pepper
2 T butter
melted butter

Directions:
Rinse chicken inside and out and pat dry.  Season inside and out with salt and pepper.  Place inside the cavity of the chicken the lemon, onion,garlic and thyme.  Place the chicken on a roasting rack on a pan.  Place alumium foil over the ends of the drum sticks.  Make a space between the skin and the breast meat and insert a tablespoon of butter.  On the outside, brush melted butter over all the chicken.  Cover the chicken loosely with a large sheet of aluminum foil.  Bake the chicken at 350 for 1 1/2 hrs.  Half-way through cooking, remove the foil to finish browning.  When you remove the chicken, loosely cover with foil and let sit for about 20 minutes before carving.

This is an easy recipe.  I even suprised myself with the outcome.  I put in things I like, but you could substitute things and still get good results.
