Ingredients:
2 oz. can anchovies packed in oil
1/2 medium onion (diced finely)
1 tsp garlic (minced)
3/4 c. chicken stock
1/4 c. white wine
1/2 tsp dried parsley
4-5 dashes Old Bay seasoning
salt and pepper to taste
12 oz. frozed bay scallops (thawed)
1 box linguine

Directions:
Place large pot of water over high heat.
Once boiling add pasta and cook according to package directions.
For scallops, heat large skillet over medium heat.
Add anchovies and oil from can.
Saute until anchovies melt into the oil, about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add onion and saute.
Once onion is translucent, add garlic.
Cook until just heated through. Be careful to not let garlic burn.
Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Allow to cook until scallops are opaque in color (about 7 minutes).
**Optional**
If you like your sauce a bit thicker, at this point you can make a slurry out of a tsp. or so of hot water mixed with a tsp. of corn starch.   Add this mixture to the boiling liquid to tighten it up.
Serve this sauce over the boiled and drained pasta along with crusty bread for an easy weeknight meal.
