Ingredients:
5 medium red potatoes, diced with peel
1 medium vidallia onion, chopped
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons taco seasoning
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup shredded pepper jack Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Put the potatoes and all the ingredients, except cheese into a zip loc bag and shake it until evenly distributed.  Pour potato mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish so that they are evenly distributed.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until potatoes are fork tender and slightly crispy. Stir every 10 minutes. When done, sprinkle with cheese. Wait about 5 minutes for the cheese to melt before serving.

Description: 
Slight twist to an old favorite. Chili powder gives the potatoes and onions in this recipe some zing!  I make these for breakfast every Sunday, and my family loves them!Modified from: Easy Spicy Roasted Potatoes
