Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
steak seasoning to taste
8 ounces rotini pasta
8 ounces mozzarella cheese, cubed
1  red onion, chopped
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
6  cherry tomatoes, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the grill for high heat. Season both sides of chicken breast halves with steak seasoning.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill chicken 6 to 8 minutes per side, or until juices run clear. Remove from heat, cool, and cut into strips.
Meanwhile, place the rotini pasta in a large pot of lightly salted boiling water. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and rinse with cold water to cool.
In a large bowl, mix together the cheese, onion, lettuce, and tomatoes. Toss with the cooled chicken and pasta to serve.
