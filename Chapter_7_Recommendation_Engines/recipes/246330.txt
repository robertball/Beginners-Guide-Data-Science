Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup ground almonds
2 tablespoons slivered almonds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper.
Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add sugar gradually, continuing to beat on high until firm peaks form. Fold in ground almonds gently until incorporated into the dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Sprinkle slivered almonds onto tops.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
My take on this French classic. An exceptionally light and crispy cross between a biscuit and a meringue, with a slightly gooey center. A huge family favorite!
