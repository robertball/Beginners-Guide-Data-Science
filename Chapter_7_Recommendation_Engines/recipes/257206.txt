Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground nutmeg
3 very ripe bananas
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a small bowl.
Mash bananas in a large bowl. Mix in white sugar, melted butter, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Fold in flour mixture until just combined. Fold walnuts into the batter.
Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
My staple go-to recipe for overripe bananas! The key to super moist muffins is to mix the batter until only just combined, and not to over bake.
