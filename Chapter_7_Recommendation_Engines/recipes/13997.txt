Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry chickpeas
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon dried thyme
salt and pepper to taste
2 1/2 cups dry bread cubes
2 eggs, beaten
4 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large pot cover the garbanzo beans  with at least 12 cups water. Cook over medium heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until tender. Check occasionally, as you might need to add more water.
Working in small batches, in a blender, on either the chop or blend setting, process garbanzo beans. Blend until the mixture is a paste.  Add onions, thyme, salt and pepper to the mixture; mix well.  Add bread cubes and egg; mix well.
Form the garbanzo bean mixture into patties.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Fry patties until each side is golden brown.
