Ingredients:
1 T. coconut oil
4 chicken thighs, bone in, skin on
2 medium sweet onions, chopped
2 C. chopped celery + tops
1/2 C. shredded carrot bits
garlic sea salt
onion powder
black pepper
Montreal chicken seasoning
3/4 C. wild and brown rice mix
water to fill the pot 2/3 full
2 C. unsweetened coconut milk

Directions:
Season the chicken with garlic sea salt, onion powder and black pepper.
In a 6 Qt. Dutch oven (soup pot), in the melted coconut oil, brown the chicken well on both sides.
Add 1/2 C. water, cover pan and simmer 15 minutes.
Remove chicken to a plate and remove skin and bones. Save bones for future stock.
Chop or shred meat and set aside.
Reduce the water left in the pan, then add onions, carrots and celery and saute until almost tender.
Fill the pot 2/3 full with hot water, add the wild rice mix, the Montreal seasoning and put the skin of the chicken back in the pot (that's where all the seasoning is).
Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer for 45 minutes.
Remove chicken skin.
Add the chicken and continue simmering for 30 more minutes.
Add the coconut milk and heat through.
Taste for seasoning and add sea salt and pepper if necessary.
