5 chicken breasts, halved
1 Lg bunch broccoli
1/2 C butter
1/2 C flour
4 C chicken stock
3 egg yolks
1 C whipping cream, whipped
6 Tbl sherry
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 C grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook chicken breasts until tender. Remove and Debone if required. Cook the broccoli and season lightly, drain and set aside. Melt butter, stir in flour and then add stock. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Simmer gently for about 5 minutes. Cool slightly, then beat in the egg yolks. Whip the cream (not too stiff) and fold it in with the sherry. Place the broccoli in the bottom of an oven proof dish. Cover broccoli with half the sace and cover with grated cheese. Arrange the chicken over cheese covered broccoli and top with remaining sauce and additional cheese if desired. Freeze at this point if keeping for another occasion. Otherwise, bake at 350 for 20 minutes, just until very hot. Can be put under the broiler at the end of cooking for about 5 minutes to brown a bit.
