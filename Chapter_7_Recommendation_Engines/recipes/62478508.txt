Ingredients:
2 cups all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold water
1/2 cup oil
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
7 large eggs, separated
2 teaspoons grated key lime rind
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line 2 cupcake pans with paper liners.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, milk, and vanilla.  Beat 7 egg yolks in a separate bowl, and add to dry ingredients along with the water, oil, vanilla and key lime rind.  Mix with mixer at medium speed while scraping bowl until well blended. (approximately 2 1/2 minutes)
In another large mixing bowl, combine egg whites and cream of tartar.  Mix at high speed 2 to 2 1/2 minutes or until egg whites are stiff.
Carefully fold flour mixture into egg whites until just blended.
Pour cupcake batter into paper liners until 1/2 to 2/3 full.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly.
Cool cupcakes completely in pans then drizzle with key lime glaze.
To make key lime glaze combine 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon melted butter in a small mixing bowl.  Stir in 2 - 3 tablespoons of key lime juice until slightly thin glaze consistency is reached.  Drizzle over key lime cupcakes.
