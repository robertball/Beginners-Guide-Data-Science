Description: 
This marinade has developed over some time. Now it's perfect. If I change something it's not as good. It's perfect on all meats, and gives that wonderful taste you get sometimes when served professionally prepared grilled and BBQ'ed food. With this one it's 'always' though! This marinade stores well.
