Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice, uncooked
2 cups water
1 cup clam juice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
1 1/2 cups milk
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1/2 lemon, juiced
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup Gruyere cheese, shredded

Directions:
In a pot, bring the rice, water, and clam juice to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 25 minutes.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and saute until tender.
Remove from heat, and set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, and slowly whisk in the flour to form a golden brown paste.
Gradually whisk in the milk, and stir continuously until the mixture has thickened.
Mix the tomato paste, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into the saucepan.
Slowly stir in the Gruyere cheese until melted.
Mix in the mushrooms, shrimp, crab, and lobster.
Season with Old Bay seasoning.
Continue cooking until heated through.
