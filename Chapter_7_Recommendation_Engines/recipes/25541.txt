Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons barbeque seasoning
1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 dash ground black pepper
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced green olives, drained

Directions:
Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool and peel.
Slice eggs lengthwise. Remove yolks and place in a sieve. Using a spoon or fork, force egg yolks through a sieve into a small bowl.
Into the bowl with the egg yolks, mix mayonnaise, barbeque seasoning, prepared Dijon-style mustard, lemon juice and ground black pepper. Place the mixture in a plastic ziplock bag. Cut one corner from the bag, and pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Top with sliced green olives. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.
