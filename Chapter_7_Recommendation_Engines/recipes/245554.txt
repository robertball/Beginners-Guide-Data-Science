Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
1/2 ounce dark chocolate, chopped
1/2 teaspoon honey
1/4 cup shredded coconut, or as needed

Directions:
Spray a small skillet with cooking spray; add sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Warm over low heat until they just start to brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a small bowl. Add peanut butter, almond flour, flaxseed meal, dark chocolate, and honey to the bowl. Mix well.
Scoop out level tablespoon-sized portions of the mixture with a measuring spoon. Roll into balls with your fingers.
Place shredded coconut in a shallow bowl. Roll each ball in coconut to coat. Transfer to refrigerator; chill until set, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is my take on a healthy, protein-packed, energy-filled peanut butter ball. We all know nuts and seeds are nutritious, but getting them into your diet can be hard when eating them raw doesn't appeal. Here they add a lovely crunchy texture and complement the strong peanut butter taste. This is a great low-carb snack between meals or to satisfy an after-dinner sweet tooth. Make sure you use an all-natural peanut butter with no additives.
