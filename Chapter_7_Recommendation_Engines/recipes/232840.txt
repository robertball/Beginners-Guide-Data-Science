Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir milk and oil into flour mixture until just moistened. Gently knead until dough comes together, 8 to 10 times.
Turn dough out onto a flat surface and roll to a 3/4-inch thick rectangle. Cut dough in half lengthwise and cut each half into thirds crosswise. Transfer each biscuit to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until gold brown, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
These biscuits bake up golden brown on the outside and light fluffy inside. They're perfect slathered with butter, honey, and/or jelly. Sometimes we top them with a rich, thick chicken gravy for a top notch chicken and biscuits dinner.
