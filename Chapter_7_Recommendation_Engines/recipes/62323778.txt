Ingredients:
- Dry white wine; 1 glass
- Garlic; 1 large (or 2 small) cloves, flattened under the blade of a knife and slammed with the heel of your hand - no need to peel.
- Fresh tarragon; 4 or 5 healthy sprigs
- Eggs; 3, large
- Gruy√®re (or Emmenthal); 55 gms (2 ounces), coarsely grated
- Butter; a lump about the size of a walnut
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat a small, preferably heavy-based, saucepan over a medium heat and pour the wine into it.
Drop in the garlic and tarragon, and simmer briskly for 5 minutes or more, until reduced by half. Remove from heat, let cool somewhat and remove the garlic and tarragon.
In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs before adding the cheese and mixing well. Season with salt and pepper. Then gently beat in the wine with a fork.
Put the butter in the original wine saucepan, melt it, and pour in the egg mixture.
Cook gently, stirring with the fork, until set and creamy but still, just, a little liquid.
Serve on buttered toast.

Description: 
This is something I sometimes knock up as a delicious supper, or a midnight feast. It is similar to making a Cheese fondue, in that garlic, wine and cheese are present!
