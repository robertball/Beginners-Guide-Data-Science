Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 boneless pork chops
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed chicken and rice soup

Directions:
Mix flour, dry mustard, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Dredge pork chops in the mixture.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Place chops into a slow cooker; add soup and 1/4 cup water. Cook on Low until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
