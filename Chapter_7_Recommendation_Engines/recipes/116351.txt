Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloin

Directions:
In a resealable plastic bag, combine the oil, lemon juice, peel, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper; add pork. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill, covered, over medium coals for about 13-14 minutes on each side or until juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I enjoy grilling, so I worked hard to develop marinades and sauces to accompany the meats. This blend of tangy lemon and savory garlic mixes perfectly with pork.
