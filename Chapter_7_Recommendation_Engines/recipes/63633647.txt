Ingredients:
1 1/2 ils salmon filet, cut into chunks
1 cup fresh whole-grain bread crumbs
1/2 cup feta cheese, light crumbled
1/4 green onion, minced
1 tbsp honey mustard
1 tbsp lemon juice, fresh squeezed
1 egg
1 tbsp dill, fresh minced
1 tsp lemon zest
1/4 tsp black pepper, fresh ground

Directions:
place salmon chunks in a food processor.
Pulse on and off until salmon is chopped into very small pieces.
Transfer salmon to a large bowl.
Add remaining ingredients.
Mix well using your hands.
Form mixture into 6 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.
Place patties on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour (chilling makes them hold together).
Spray a large, non-stick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.
Add patties and cook for about 4 minutes per side, until the salmon is cooked through.  Be careful not to over cook the patties and be careful when flipping so they do not break apart.
Serve patties on a small whole-grain hamburger bun with sliced tomatoes, lettuce and hiney mustard, or top them with a spoonful of low-fat tarter sauce.
