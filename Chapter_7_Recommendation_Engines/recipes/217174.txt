Ingredients:
1 (28 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained
1 cup milk
1 cup white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Place the peaches into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a bowl, whisk together the milk, sugar, flour, melted butter, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg just until moistened (mixture can be slightly lumpy). Pour the flour mixture over the peaches. Do not stir.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Serve warm.
