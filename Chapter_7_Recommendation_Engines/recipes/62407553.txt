Ingredients:
1/2 lg. onion, minced
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tablespoons garlic powder
1/4 cup bourbon whiskey
2 tablespoons butter
In Blender
6 small and medium tomatoes, roasted in the oven on broil at 500 for 10 mins or until blister & black spots appear, careful, teh are squishy and hot!
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt
3 cups ketchup
1 6oz can tomato sauce
2/3 cup cider vinegar
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 & 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste
7 tablespoons mustard or mustard powder
2 to 3 beef bouillon cubes

Directions:
First put whole fresh tomatoe's core down in a pan and place on the top rack of pre-heated oven. In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the first 5 ingredients. Simmer for 10 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Mix all other (including the roasted tomatoes) in blender until pureed (may have to do in 2 or 3 batches, depending on how much your blender holds) then add to onion and bourbon mix. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, and simmer for 30 mins to 1 hour until it reaches a consistancy you like. You can cook sauce longer than an hour if you like, just make sure you give it a stir every 30 mins. Run sauce through a strainer if you prefer a smooth sauce. Eat, put in jars and seal or freeze in freezer containers and enjoy!
