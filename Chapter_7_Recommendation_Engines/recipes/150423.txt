Ingredients:
Rolls:
1 package yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 cup mashed potatoes
1 cup hot potato water
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup sugar
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 cup cold water
6 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons Spice Islands速 Saigon Cinnamon
Powdered Sugar Frosting:
6 1/2 cups powdered sugar
6 tablespoons butter, softened
6 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon Spice Islands速 Pure Vanilla Extract
1 teaspoon Almond Extract

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. In a large bowl, combine mashed potatoes, potato water, butter, salt and sugar. Add egg, cold water and yeast mixture. Mix well. Add flour to make very soft dough. Knead 5 minutes. Cover and let rise until doubled. Punch dough down. Roll out dough to a 24 x 12-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Spread dough with melted butter. Combine 1 cup sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the melted butter.
Roll up from long sides, as a jelly roll. Cut into 24 equal slices. Place cut side up in a greased 11 x 15-inch pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 30 minutes, or until done. Remove from oven and cool on rack.
For frosting, combine all ingredients; beat until smooth and creamy. Frost cooled rolls.
