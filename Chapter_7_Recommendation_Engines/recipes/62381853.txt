Ingredients:
1 pound of cooked, or practically cooked chicken, cubed or shredded (I browned my chicken for a while on the stove, then lost interest. It was almost cooked, but not yet edible.)
1 small sweet potato, peeled and cut in 1-inch chunks (optional.)
1 red onion, diced (optional. I didn't use this, although I intended to, and am kind of kicking myself for the accidental omission.)
1 cup frozen or fresh corn
1 bottle of your favorite barbecue sauce (18 oz)
1/4 cup hot water
Cornbread Topping: Use a mix and follow the directions on the box (minus the oil or butter), or mix together the following: 3/4 cup corn meal, 1-1/4 cups of flour (I used a Bob Red's Mill GF mix--we were out of Pamela's), 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking powder (only if using regular all-purpose flour)

Directions:
Use a 4-qt round crockpot and spray the inside of your stoneware with cooking spray.
Cut up the chicken and sweet potato, and add to the crock.
Add the corn.
Empty the contents of the barbecue sauce bottle, and then add 1/4 cup of hot water to the bottle, shake, and pour that out, too.
Mix well with a spoon.
In a separate bowl, mix together the cornbread topping. You don't need to mix well, I just used a fork.
Spread the topping on to the chicken mixture.
Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
