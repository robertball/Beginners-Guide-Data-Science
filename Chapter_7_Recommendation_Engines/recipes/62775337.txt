Ingredients:
2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
1/4 teaspoon sugar
3/4 cup hot water
1 3/4 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) jar pizza sauce

Directions:
1 Dissolve yeast and sugar in hot water.
2 Let sit for 8 minutes.
3 Meanwhile mix flour and salt.
4 Pour yeast mixture over flour mixture and mix well with a heavy spoon.
5 Turn onto floured surface and knead for 2 minutes.
6 Spread into a 12-14" circle.
7 (I do this directly onto a pizza stone with a marble rolling pin).
8 If you roll it out on a counter top, transfer to a greased pizza pan, stretching to edges.
9 Cover with sauce and desired topping.
10 Bake at 500 degrees for 8-12 minutes or until edges are golden.
