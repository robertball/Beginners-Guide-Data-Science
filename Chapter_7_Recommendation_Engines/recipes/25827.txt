Ingredients:
1 egg
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup dark molasses
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup candied mixed fruit peel, finely chopped
1 egg white, beaten
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat the egg, brown sugar and honey until smooth. Stir in the molasses. Combine the flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and allspice; stir into the molasses mixture. Stir in the almonds and candied fruit peel. Cover or wrap dough, and chill overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into 2x3 inch rectangles. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. While still warm, brush the cookies with the lemon glaze.
To make the glaze: In a small bowl, stir together the egg white, lemon juice and lemon zest. Mix in the confectioners' sugar until smooth. Brush over cookies.
