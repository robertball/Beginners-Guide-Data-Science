Ingredients:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
1 medium white onion
2 cloves garlic
1 pound ground sausage (I used Jimmy Dean regular)
1 carrot, sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 tsp. cumin
1/2 tsp. thyme
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper
32 ounce container low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup water
salt to taste
fresh ground black pepper to taste
1 vine-ripe tomato, diced
1 14.5 ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes, undrained
1 15 ounce can black beans, undrained
2 cups cooked short grain brown rice
4 cups chopped fresh kale, curly or lacinato

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot.  Saute onion, garlic, and sausage until onion is translucent and sausage is browned. Add carrots, red pepper, cumin, thyme & crushed red pepper, saute for 5 minutes.  Add chicken broth, water and tomatoes. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes or until carrots are tender.  Add black beans and kale, simmer 5 to 10 minutes until kale is wilted. Stir in rice and serve.

Description: 
Had a bunch of stuff in the kitchen that needed to be used up including the start of a kale salad that I wasn't in the mood for.  Threw this together and it ended up being one of my favorite soups! (Most measurements are approximate as I just kind of tossed stuff in until it looked and tasted right.)
