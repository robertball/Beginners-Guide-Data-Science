Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages rapid rise yeast
1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 large red onions, diced
7 cups bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
2 cups pitted kalamata olives, chopped
1 3/4 cups warm water

Directions:
Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup of warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and the onions.  Cook and stir for 3 minutes, or until onions are soft.  Remove the onions from heat and reserve.
Combine the bread flour, salt, sugar, dill, garlic powder, olives, and cooked onions in a large bowl and mix well.  Add the yeast mixture and the remaining 1 3/4 cup water.  Mix well until the ingredients have pulled together and have formed a sticky dough.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
Lightly grease two baking sheets.   Deflate the risen dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide the dough into two equal pieces-don't tear it. Shape into dough into round loaves, and place the loaves into the prepared pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Bake loaves in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms sound hollow when tapped, about 40 minutes.  Cool slightly before slicing.

Description: 
This is a lovely bread to add to a Mediterranean meze table.  Use black or green olives and try it toasted, drizzled with a little olive oil and rubbed with roasted garlic.
