Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon maple extract
2 eggs
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
4 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon melted butter
3/4 cup icing sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Cream together sugar and butter. Stir in the maple syrup. Add maple extract and eggs.
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir into the wet mixture, then add the walnuts.
Divide dough into 2 balls. Shape each ball into a log the length of a baking sheet, place on a baking sheet, then flatten each into a rectangle 3 inches wide and 1 inch tall.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated over. The top should crack slightly, and the bottom should look light brown.
Without turning off the heat, remove biscotti logs from oven and let cool for 15 minutes.
Slice 1/2-inch biscottis from the log using a diagonal angle (to get that long biscotti length). Turn resulting biscottis on their side and bake for 8 minutes on each side. Biscotti should turn slightly brown and be crispy on the outside.
To make Maple Topping, melt butter in microwave, then add maple syrup. Stir in 3/4 cup of icing sugar a little at a time, until the topping has a candy-like consistency. Using a fork or spoon, drizzle the maple topping across the biscottis after they've come out of the oven.
