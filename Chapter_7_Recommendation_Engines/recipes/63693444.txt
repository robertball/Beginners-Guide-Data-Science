Ingredients:
1 lbs. cream cheese
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 Tbsp. vanilla
1 cup white sugar
2 tsp. cinnamon
1/3 cup A/P flour
1 egg, beaten
4 (10") thin flour tortillas
2 small ripe bananas, split
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
With a mixer, beat the cream cheese until softened; add the powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
In a shallow dish, combine the sugar and cinnamon, set aside. In a small bowl, mix together the beaten egg and flour (tortilla glue). Set aside.
Heat the tortillas in the microwave to soften. Spoon 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture onto the center of each tortilla in the form of a log, top each with the half of banana. Fold in sides, then roll the tortillas to roll into a tight package. Seal the flour tortillas with the egg glue.
Fill a pot or skillet with enough oil to deep fry the rolls. Heat to 350 degrees F. Fry the bunuelos until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. While still hot, roll in the sugar and cinnamon.
To serve, cut the bunuelo on the bias and criss-cross ends. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Garnish with fresh fruit, ice cream or whipped topping if desired.
