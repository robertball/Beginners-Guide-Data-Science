Ingredients:
1 orange, zested and juiced
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1/4 cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons chia seeds
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold coconut oil, divided into 8 equal-size pieces
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1/4 cup finely chopped almonds
1/4 cup hemp seed hearts

Directions:
Preheat convection oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Stir orange juice and lemon juice together in a small bowl; add enough water, if necessary, to equal 7 tablespoons liquid.
Stir juice mixture, coconut milk, orange zest, lemon zest, chia seeds, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside until chia seeds gel, about 10 minutes.
Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, ginger, cardamom, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until just-combined. Add cold coconut oil pieces and process until mixture resembles wet sand. Pour chia mixture into flour mixture; pulse until dough begins to come together.
Transfer dough to a bowl and add pecans, almonds, and hemp; knead with your hands until nuts and seeds are evenly distributed. Divide dough into 2 pieces, and flatten each piece into a 1-inch thick disc. Cut each disc into 8 wedges, and places wedges on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when pressed, 30 to 35 minutes.
