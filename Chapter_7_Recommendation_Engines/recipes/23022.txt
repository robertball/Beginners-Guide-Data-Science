Ingredients:
1/4 bunch fresh parsley
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 large green bell pepper, diced
4 cloves crushed garlic
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
5 cups water
red pepper sauce to taste
2/3 cup sherry
1 (4 ounce) jar pimentos, julienned
1 cup frozen petite peas
4 raw lobster tail, quartered
2/3 pound fresh shrimp, shelled and deveined without tails

Directions:
Remove the stems from the parsley and discard. In a food processor combine the parsley leaves, yellow onion, green pepper, garlic and stewed tomatoes. Process just enough to chop the ingredients up. Should retain a chunky consistency
In a large pot over medium/low heat, combine olive oil and parsley mixture. Cook for about 6 to 7 minutes.
Stir in tomato paste until completely dissolved. Pour in 5 cups of water, red pepper sauce, sherry and red pimentos. Raise the heat to medium and simmer for about 15 minutes.
Add the petit poi, lobster tails and shrimp. Simmer for 10 minutes or until shrimp are pink all the way through.

Description: 
This is a Spanish style Creole dish where the lobster tails may be substituted by shrimp or you can convert it into a seafood Creole by combining both lobster tail meat, shrimp & scallop.  I recommend accompanying this dish with white steamed rice, fried green plantains and a salad.
