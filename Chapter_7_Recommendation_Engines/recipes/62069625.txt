Ingredients:
meat & onions from one Gyro sandwich, with sauce on side (discard pita)
2 pounds frozen hashbrown potatoes
2 cups egg substitute
1-2 cups shredded cheese (use the family's favorite blend)

Directions:
Coarsely chop meat and onions.
In large skillet cook potatoes according to "no-fat" or "water method" directions on package.  When cooked stir in meat and onions.  Distribute evenly in skillet and pour eggs substitute over.  Cover and cook on medium heat until eggs are almost set.  Sprinkle with cheese, and allow to cook until melted.  Cut into wedges and serve.  Serve with sauce if you like.

Description: 
My family loves this simple frittata with a twist.  You can control the fat by controlling the type and volume of cheese you use.  When we get take out I always order a extra Gyro (with the sauce on the side) and make this the next nite.  You can control the onions to your family's liking.  It isn't exactly Quiche, but without the crust you get rid of lots of the fat.
