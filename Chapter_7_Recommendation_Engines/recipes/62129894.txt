The Best Chinese Chicken Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
Salad:
6-8 boneless/skinless chicken breasts
1 bottle teriyaki sauce or marinade
2-3 packages angel hair shredded cabbage (DO NOT use the cole slaw mix with red cabbage & carrot)
2 bunches green onion, sliced
1 large package slivered(not sliced)almonds
3 packages Chicken Flavored Ramen Soup
Dressing:
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup safflower oil (like Saffola)
1/3 sugar
1/3 cup white vinegar
2 1/2 - 3 seasoning packets from the Ramen soup mentioned above

Directions:
Prepare the dressing. In a large bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients. You can adjust the amount of sugar, vinegar, and seasoning to your taste. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.
In a large skillet, cover the chicken breasts with the teriyaki sauce and sautee until the chicken is cooked through and the teriyaki sauce has reduced to a glaze. Allow to cool and cut into bite-sized cubes.
Place the Ramen noodles in a plastic bag and crush to very small pieces.  You will probably not use all of the noodles in the salad - About 2/3 of the crushed noodles will do.
To serve, combine the cabbage, green onion, slivered almonds, and chicken. Toss well.  Add the crushed Ramen noodles and toss with the dressing just before serving.
