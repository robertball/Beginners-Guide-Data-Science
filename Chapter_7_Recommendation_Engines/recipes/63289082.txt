Ingredients:
Chicken Cigars
1/8 lb ground chicken
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon grill seasoning (recommended Montreal Seasoning by McCormick)
1/8 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves (a handful)
1/2 sheet phyllo dough
1/16 cup butter, melted
Sweet and Sour Dipping Sauce
1/8 tablespoon sweet plum sauce or 1/8 tablespoon Chinese duck sauce
1/8 tablespoon rice vinegar
1/16 cup light oil (such as peanut, canola, or vegetable oil)
1/16 to taste kosher salt
1/16 to taste fresh ground black pepper, to taste
1/16 cup finely diced mango (optional)
1/16 scallion, green tops only, thinly sliced on the bias

Directions:
1
For the chicken cigars: Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
2
Place chicken in a bowl and mix with spices and parsley. (I actually used my food processor to shred/chop chicken and mix in the spices and it worked nicely--use it to chop the parsley first and then add other ingredients).
3
Place a piece of phyllo on a nonstick cookie sheet and brush with some of the melted butter. Repeat 3 more times, placing each of phyllo over the last buttered sheet to make 4 layers. Cut layered phyllo into 16 rectangles (4 x 4).
4
On one end of each of the rectangles, place a heaping tablespoon of chicken filling. Roll up tightly to make mini "cigars". Cut each of these in half and place on a cookie sheet. (They should overlap slightly on the bottom--they will stay together nicely if you press them gently after you place them on the cookie sheet). Butter the tops of each.
5
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown.
6
Repeat with second half of phyllo sheets and chicken mixture.
7
Make the sweet and sour dipping sauce by whisking together plum or duck sauce and vinegar in a bowl. Stream in oil and continue whisking to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Fold in mango and sliced scallions.
8
Serve either hot or at room temperature with dipping sauce.
