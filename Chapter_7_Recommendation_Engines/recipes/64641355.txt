Ingredients:
1 dozen supermarket cookies:
Peanut butter cookies
Chocolate chip cookies
Molasses cookies
Sugar cookies
Snickerdoodles
3/4 cup of your favorite spread:
Chocolate hazelnut spread, such as Nutella
Seedless raspberry jam
Lemon curd
Honey
Cookie butter
Giant campfire marshmallows

Directions:
Pick two of your your favorite type of cookie: peanut butter, chocolate chip, molasses, sugar or snickerdoodle.
Spread 1 tablespoon of your favorite filling on the bottom sides of each cookie. I recommend  chocolate hazelnut spread on peanut butter cookies, seedless raspberry jam on chocolate chip cookies, lemon curd on molasses cookies, honey on sugar cookies and cookie butter on snickerdoodles.
Skewer a giant marshmallow and turn slowly over a campfire or grill until roasted on the outside and soft and melted in the center.
Place the roasted marshmallow on top of one cookie, filling side up, then cover with the other cookie, filling side down. Press together to grasp the marshmallow and pull out the skewer.
Enjoy immediately and repeat as needed for total campsite fun!
