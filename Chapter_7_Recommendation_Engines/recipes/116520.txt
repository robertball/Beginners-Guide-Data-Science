Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
FILLING:
1/2 cup sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
3 cups heavy whipping cream
4 cups sliced fresh strawberries
2 cups fresh blueberries
2 cups fresh raspberries

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture.
Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or greased aluminum foil; draw a 9-3/4-in. circle on each. Spoon a fourth of the batter onto each circle; spread evenly with a spoon to within 1/4 in. of edge. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
Combine the sugar, confectioner's sugar and cornstarch. In a large mixing bowl, beat cream and sugar mixture until stiff peaks form. To assemble, place one cookie layer on a large serving plate. Top with 1-1/2 cups whipped cream mixture and 2 cups of mixed berries. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining cookie layer and whipped cream mixture. Arrange remaining berries on top. Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours.

It's so easy to see why this fruity dessert always impresses dinner guests. I sometimes substitute the berries with sliced bananas.
