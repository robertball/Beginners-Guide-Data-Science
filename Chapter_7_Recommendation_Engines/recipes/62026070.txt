Ingredients:
1 can peanuts
1 can potato sticks
1-1/2 bags of butterscotch chips
1/2 C peanut butter

Directions:
Mix the potato sticks and peanuts together in very large bowl.  Microwave the butterscotch chips and peanut butter until blended and smooth, stirring every few minutes.  After melted, pour over the potato sticks and peanuts and coat well.  Drop by tablespoons onto waxpaper-coated cookie sheets and then put in regrigerator to set.  You have to work quickly as the coating wants to harden up!!  I store them in the refrigerator, they are great cold!
