Beef Wellington Bites Recipe

Ingredients:
2 pounds beef tenderloin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, stems removed and finely chopped
2 medium shallots, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towel. Cut into 24 cubes. Place in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and quickly sear on 2 sides only until deep golden brown, about 4 minutes; do not overcook. Transfer to a plate.
Add mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they start to brown and release liquid, about 5 minutes. Add shallots and garlic; continue cooking until liquid has evaporated from the pan and shallots have softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Roll 1 sheet of pastry into a 10x14-inch rectangle. Put 12 teaspoon-sized mounds of mushroom mixture onto the pastry, evenly spaced in 4 rows of 3. Top each mound with 1 piece of beef, seared-side up. Cut pastry into 12 even squares around the meat and mushrooms. Working on 1 square at a time, pull 2 opposite sides of pastry up and over the filling, then fold the ends over the top to make a packet. Place seams-side down on the prepared baking sheet and press lightly to seal pastry. Repeat with remaining pastry sheet, beef, and mushroom mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to a serving tray and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
