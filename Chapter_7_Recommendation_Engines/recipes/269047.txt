Ingredients:
12 ounces udon noodles
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 pound beef, thinly sliced
6 tablespoons white sugar
6 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons sake
4 tablespoons dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 small head napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 1/2 cups chopped celery, 2-inch long pieces
16 shiitake mushrooms, sliced
6 scallions, cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Rinse with cool water to stop the cooking process and set aside.
Heat a wok over medium-high heat and add oil. Sear beef slices in the pan until browned, about 3 minutes. Add sugar, soy sauce, sake, white wine, and white pepper. Add cabbage, celery, mushrooms, and scallions and cook 10 to 15 minutes more.
Adjust seasoning if necessary with additional soy sauce, wine, sake, or sugar.

Description: 
The Japanese traditionally set each ingredient individually in one common pot or serving bowl. Each diner creates their own bowl of meat, vegetables, and noodles. This is my take on a flavorful, favorite, beautiful Japanese dish that we love. I do not add the traditional tofu, but feel free to add 8 ounces of fried tofu cubes.
