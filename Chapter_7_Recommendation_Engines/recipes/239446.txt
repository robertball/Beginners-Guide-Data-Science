Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup cocoa powder
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch oven-proof skillet.
Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 30 seconds. Add sugar and cocoa powder to butter and stir. Heat butter-cocoa mixture in microwave until sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds.
Mix vanilla extract into butter-cocoa mixture. Stir eggs into butter-cocoa mixture; add flour and stir until batter is well mixed. Pour batter into the prepared skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the brownies comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
A recipe my Uncle Drew brought with him when he visited for our family reunion. I think we made about five batches of these rich, chocolaty goodies over the course of his stay! Top the brownie batter with shredded coconut or nuts if desired.
