Ingredients:
4 cups Rice or Corn ChexÂ® cereal
1 1/2 cups miniature pretzels
1 cup pecan halves
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup honey

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine cereal, pretzels and pecans; set aside. Melt butter in a small saucepan; stir in honey and blend well. Pour over cereal mixture and stir to coat evenly. Spread in a jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12 to 15 minutes or until mixture is slightly glazed, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven and cool slightly. Spread on waxed paper to cool completely.

For a nice change of pace from packaged snack, try this golden, slightly sweet mix from Cindy Kolberg of Suracuse, Indiana. 'I've even put this mix in decorative canisters and given it as gifts,' she notes.
