Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped sweet onion
10 fresh Habanero peppers
8 fresh Fresno chile peppers
4 reconstituted dried Chipotle peppers
2 teaspoons Garlic powder
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 cup white vinegar
1 cup water
salt to taste

Directions:
**Be sure to use eye protection and nitrile or powderless latex gloves while resisting the urge to scratch/wipe your face when preparing Habaneros** Throw Habanero gloves in the trash when finished.
Reconstitute the dried chipotle peppers by submerging in boiling water in a pyrex or other heat-resistant bowl for 15 minutes, then slice and seed. Discard water.
Wash, slice, and remove seeds/stems from the rest of the peppers. Toss in blender or food processor with "liquify" option. Remove gloves and WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY
Add onions, brown sugar, vinegar, garlic powder, and water to blender.
Blend until it's as liquid as your machine will make it.
Add salt to taste, re-blend.
Carefully pour liquid into sterilized glass container with tight seal.
Place in refrigerator overnight.

Description: 
Hot sauce recipe inspired by many others, but unique.  Very simple ingredients and easy to make.  Has great heat with legs (the heat lasts), good pepper flavor, and the sweet balances the heat.  I used salt substitute (66% KCl, 33% NaCl) for low-sodium diet. Servings below are in tablespoons. Add chipotles for smoky flavor!Modified from: Hot Sweet Habanero Chile Sauce 2
