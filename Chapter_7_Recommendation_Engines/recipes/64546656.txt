Ingredients:
4 lbs fresh tomatoes (roma preferred) or 4lb canned tomatoes, drained
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil + extra for drizzling
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups water
1 loaf of artisan bread (such as pugliese, chiabatta, boule) french bread will do if no other options
1 bunch fresh basil leaves, torn

Directions:
Pour 1/4 cup olive oil into a large saucepan or dutch oven over medium heat
Add the garlic and stir gently until the garlic turns golden but not brown
Add the tomatoes and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes until thickened
Season with salt and pepper to taste
Add 2 cups of water and bring soup to a boil.
While waiting for soup to boil, remove the crust from the bread and cut into large chunks
Once soup has been brought to boil, turn off heat and add bread chunks stirring until the bread absorbs the liquid. If soup becomes too thick, add more boiling water in small increments.
Allow the soup to cool for 10 minutes then add the torn basil leaves, stir and drizzle lightly with olive oil
Let soup sit until the bread has absorbed the juice, and olive oil
Serve with a sprinkle of basil and another dash of olive oil in each bowl.
