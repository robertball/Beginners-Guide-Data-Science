Ingredients:
ROLL
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 eggs
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
FILLING
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cut a piece of parchment or wax paper to fit in bottom of cookie sheet. Lay paper on the bottom and grease sides.
In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir in pumpkin puree, eggs, and lemon juice. Pour mixture into prepared pan. Spread the mixture evenly.
Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Cool in pan for 20 minutes.
While it's chilling, make the icing. In a medium bowl, blend cream cheese, butter, vanilla, and sugar with a wooden spoon or electric mixer.
When the cake has cooled, lay down another piece of parchment paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Lift the cake out of the pan and carefully flip it onto the other paper.
Peel the parchment off the bottom and spread the filling evenly onto it. Roll up the cake and wrap in foil. Put in freezer for 45 minutes, then move to refrigerator.
Keep the cake refrigerated or freeze it for up to 2 weeks in aluminum foil.  Cut the cake  in slices just before serving.

Description: 
A sweetly spicy, pumpkin-flavored cake is spread with a silky rich cream cheese filling and rolled up like a pinwheel. For easy lifting, line your baking pan with parchment paper. Chill the cake to set before slicing.Modified from: Granny Kat's Pumpkin Roll
