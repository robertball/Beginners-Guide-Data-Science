Ingredients:
1 pound white raisins
1 pound red and green candied cherries, chopped
1 pound dates, pitted and chopped
6 slices candied pineapple, chopped
1 cup bourbon whiskey, divided, or as needed
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
28 ounces pecans, chopped
3 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Place raisins, candied cherries, dates, and candied pineapple in a bowl; stir in 1/2 cup bourbon whiskey; set aside to soak.
Beat butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter mixture; beat in vanilla extract and cinnamon with last egg.
Stir pecans and fruit mixture into butter mixture; stir in self-rising flour alternately with remaining bourbon whiskey as needed to form a soft dough. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven just until cookies begin to look dry, about 30 minutes. Cool cookies on a wire rack; store in a sealed container lined with waxed paper.

Description: 
Uncle Lucky and Aunt Bert's fruitcake cookies are a Virginian Christmas tradition. The cookies will soften and the flavour will mature when stored. The longer the cookies sit, the more the flavour will develop. They also freeze well.
