Ingredients:
2 lbs of fresh tilapia
1 can drained crushed pineapples
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup crushed roasted almonds
1 1/2 cups chopped coconut
1 tbsp sesame seeds
1 tbsp brown sugar
1 pinch nutmeg
3 large eggs

Directions:
First add the roasted almonds, 1 cup of the chopped coconut, the sesame seeds, brown sugar and the nutmeg into a dry medium sized mixing bowl. Mix it up really well. This will make the breading for the tilapia fillets.
Then mix the can of pineapples and the onion in a small mixing bowl. This will make the topping.
Next take a large baking pan (9 x 13) or bigger and butter the bottom of the pan. At this point preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
Take your three eggs and mix them up in a shallow bowl. Dip the tilapia fillets in the egg and then into the breading, and lay across the baking pan and repeat for each fillet. Then spread the pineapple topping over each fillet and bake for 40 minutes. Enjoy!
