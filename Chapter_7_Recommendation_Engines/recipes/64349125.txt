Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 ounces fresh snow pea pods
12 ounces bean sprouts
4 green onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 large carrots, peeled jullienned
rice vermicelli opt
1 teaspoon fish sauce
12 spring roll wrappers
1/2 cup peanut sauce and/or dipping sauce

Directions:
In a wok or skillet over medium heat, cook the snow peas, bean sprouts and green onion with the ginger and garlic until heated but still crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Mix in the cilantro. Use a vegetable peeler to add long slices of carrot into the mixture. Add vermicelli if using. Drizzle 1 teaspoon fish or soy sauce into the mixture; toss to coat.
Fill a large bowl with hot water. Dip wrappers one at a time into the water for about 2 seconds each. As wrappers are removed from the water, fill each with a small handful of the mixture. Fold in two opposite ends of the wrapper to meet the filling. Then fold the bottom of the wrapper over the top of the filling and roll. Serve with 1/2 cup peanut sauce and or dipping sauce for dipping.
