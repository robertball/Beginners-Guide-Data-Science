2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano

Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
Remove the lid and check a bean; if not yet tender, close and lock the lid and cook another 5 minutes at high pressure.
Drain beans, reserving 2 cups of liquid. Return beans to pot and add salt and 1 cup reserved liquid. Puree using a stick blender, adding additional cooking liquid as needed. Keep warm using the slow cooker function.
