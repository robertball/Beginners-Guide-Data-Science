Description: 
When I was a teenager taking a beginners pottery class, I couldn't think what I wanted to make.  Then I remembered my mom's 3-bean salad.  I sure hated those garbonza beans, but I loved the kindey and green beans, and my mom's yummy dressing.  So I decided to make a 3 compartment bowl with holes in the walls.  This way she could separate the beans, and the dressing would still go everywhere!  As I've grown, so has my appreciation for other foods.  I've also learned that changing mom's recipe is okay.  So here is my version of mom's 3-bean salad (sans garbonza beans!)
