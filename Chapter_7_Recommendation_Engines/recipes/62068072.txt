Description: 
As a depression baby growing up during rationing during WW2, we were taught to never to waste food. So when I looked at the two bags of frozen, sliced cucumbers intended four our New Year's Even party, I contemplated tossing or somehow using. Well, I was absolutely amazed at the wonderful soup I created with the frozen cucmbers and carrots. Fresh, unfrozen ingredients can be used for like results.
