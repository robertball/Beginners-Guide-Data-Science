Ingredients:
2 lbs fresh long green snap beans
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
1 tbsp olive oil or butter
1/4 teaspoon Vietnamese chili sauce
dash of sesame oil to taste
dash of pepper to taste

Directions:
Thoroughly wash and rinse the green beans.  Remove the stem by snapping it off at the end and leave the rest of the bean whole for a long bean.
In a medium/large skillet melt your butter or olive oil over medium low heat for about 1 minute.  Add your chopped garlic and cook for another minute.  Keep the garlic moving and you do not want the garlic to brown so reduce heat if this happens.
Add in the green beans and saute for another minute, stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to low, add soy sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil and pepper.  Stir and cover.  Cook for another 10 minutes on low heat or until beans have reached desired tenderness.  Serve as a side by itself or over steamed rice.

This is an easy to make side dish and tastes absolutely wonderful with anything.  It is even good over some steamed white rice with a little sauce drizzled over it.  So yummy and quick to make!
