Ingredients:
1 pound dry garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
10 tablespoons tahini
10 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
3/4 cup water, divided, or as needed

Directions:
Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with at least 2 inches of cool water; let stand at least 12 hours.
Drain garbanzo beans and transfer to a large pot; add enough water to cover beans by at least 2 inches. Bring water to a rolling boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until beans are very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove pot from heat and cool water and beans to room temperature; drain and transfer beans to a glass container and cover. Refrigerate beans, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine beans, tahini, olive oil, salt, citric acid powder, garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper in a food processor; add 1/2 cup water. Process mixture for 1 minute. Check consistency of hummus and add 1/4 cup water if hummus is too thick; process again until smooth.
Continue processing hummus in the food processor until hummus is warm, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a solid hummus with a mild but complex taste and is a good base for making flavored hummus as well.
