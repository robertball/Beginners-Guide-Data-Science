Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 1/2 cups water
1/3 cup chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon white sugar
3 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, drained

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir just until you start to smell the garlic, 2-3 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook, stirring frequently, until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the tomato sauce, tomatoes, and water. Season with the chili powder, cumin, salt, black pepper, oregano, cayenne, and sugar. Place the mixture over medium heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for about 1 hour.
Remove the cover and stir in the beans. Replace the cover and continue cooking until fully heated through, about 15 minutes.
