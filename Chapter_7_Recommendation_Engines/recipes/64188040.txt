Ingredients:
1/2 cup rice flour
3/4 cup sorghum flour
2 tablespoons potato starch (or corn starch)
1 tablespoon ground flax seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1 large pinch cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon agave nectar
3/4 cup solid-pack canned pumpkin
1 1/2 cups soymilk, water, or other non-dairy milk
2 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
Mix all ingredients except orange juice and set aside to rest while you heat your waffle iron. Once the waffle iron is hot, add the orange juice to the batter and stir. Spray the iron lightly with canola oil and follow manufacturerâ€™s directions to make waffles. (Batter will be very thick; add more orange juice or water if you want a thinner batter.) You may need to spray the iron between waffles to avoid sticking.
