Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup sugar, divided
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
Dash salt
6 eggs, separated
4 cups milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
45 NILLA Wafers, divided
6 ripe bananas, sliced and divided
Additional NILLA Wafers and banana slices, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix 1 cup sugar, flour and salt in top of double boiler. Blend in 6 egg yolks and milk. Cook, uncovered, over boiling water, stirring constantly for 10 to 12 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.
Reserve 10 wafers for garnish. Spread small amount of custard on bottom of 1 1/2-quart casserole; cover with a layer of wafers and a layer of sliced bananas. Pour about 1/3 of custard over bananas. Continue to layer wafers, bananas and custard to make a total of 3 layers of each, ending with custard.
Beat egg whites until soft peaks form; gradually add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Spoon on top of pudding, spreading evenly to cover entire surface and sealing well to edges.
Bake at 350Â°F in top half of oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until browned. Cool slightly or refrigerate. Garnish with additional wafers and banana slices just before serving.
