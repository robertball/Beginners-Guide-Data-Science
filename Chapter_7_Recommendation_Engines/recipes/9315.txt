Ingredients:
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 cups molasses
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons ground ginger
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground cloves

Directions:
Beat the sugar, molasses, butter or margarine, and oil together. Add 2 cups of the flour and the baking soda, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon. Mix in the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough is stiff. Flatten into disks and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
On a lightly floured surface roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thick and use cookie cutters to cut into desired shapes. Place cookies on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes.

Description: 
My children love spice cookies at any time. I think most children love them.  I am enclosing a recipe that moms and dads can have their children help with during the baking at Christmas.  Every child keeps their special memories of every day with the family and I sure remember mine from when I was a little girl.
