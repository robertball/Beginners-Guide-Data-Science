1 small onion, sliced
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut in half, backbone removed
salt as needed

Directions:




Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
The next time rain ruins your dream of a grilled chicken dinner, I hope you fire up your broiler and give this easy, alternative method a try. Not only are you getting the same intense, direct heat, but you also have more control, since you can adjust how far the chicken is from the flame. I prefer the meat about 7 to 8 inches under the heating element, but feel free to adjust as needed. Garnish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and fresh oregano.
