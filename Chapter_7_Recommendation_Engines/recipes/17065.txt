Description: 
This is a delicious simple sauce which goes with anything. You can have it plain over pasta or make lasagna with it.  You can make ziti or spaghetti and meatballs (just cook the meatballs in the sauce - it will take longer) or anything you can think of.  It makes good, slightly too bland, pizza sauce.  You can triple the batch and freeze it in jars.
