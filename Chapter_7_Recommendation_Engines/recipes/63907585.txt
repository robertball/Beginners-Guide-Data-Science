Ingredients:
2 heads escarole, washed and dried
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 / 4 teaspoon large-grain sea salt

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 2. Trim woody stems off the bottom of escarole and discard, and give the leaves a rough chop. Toss with olive oil and season with sea salt.
3. Spread escarole evenly across two baking sheets and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Turn after 5 minutes, to help the escarole become crispy. Escarole should be dark green, wilted, and have crispy, slightly browned edges. 4. Serve immediately.
