Ingredients:
2 packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (105-115F, 40-45C)
1/2 cup lukewarm milk (Scalded then cooled)
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour (Do not use self-rising.)
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup cut-up citron
1 tbsp anise seed
2 tbsp pine nuts (optional)
1 egg
1 tbsp water

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in milk, sugar, salt, 2 eggs, the butter, and 2 1/2 cups of the flour. Beat until smooth.
Mix in fruit, anise seed, nuts(if used), and enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic - about five minutes - and place in a greased bowl, turning the greased side up.
Cover and let rise in warm place until double - 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
Punch down dough and divide in half. Shape each half into round, slightly flat loaves.
Place loaves in opposite corners of a greased baking sheet and cut a criss 1/2 inch deep on top of each loaf.
Let rise until double, about an hour, and preheat oven to 350F(180C)
Blend 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of water, brush on loaves and bake 35 to 45 minutes.
