Ingredients:
1/2 lb. ground pork sausage
1/2 Head of Cabbage (3 to 4 cups)
2 Carrots
3 Green Onion (chopped)
2 tbsp. of Lawrys Terrakyi Sauce
1/2 tbsp of ground ginger
1 Cup of bean sprouts
1 tbsp. oil
1 package of Egg Roll Wrappers

Directions:
Cook ground pork in skillet so not pink, don't over cook or brown, drain off fat, rinse if you like, put in chopper and pulse just a few times, not to fine.  Set aside
Chop the cabbage (you can use slaw mix if in a hurry)
I cut the carrots into 1/3 and then put in chopper.  You can shred if you like.
Heat oil in wok and add cabbage, carrots, ginger and Terrakyi sauce.  Cook till tender, 10 to 12 min.
Add bean sprouts,chopped green onion and sausage.  Cook about 5 min.
Remove from wok and let stand for a few minutes.
I put 2 TBSP of mixture in Egg Rolls and Wrap.
You can deep fry or bake at 400 if you bake you will need to brush with oil.  You can freeze the extras if you have any.
