Ingredients:
Smoked Tofu Filling:
1 (8 ounce) container smoked tofu, diced
2/3 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup pine nuts
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
Guacamole:
3 tomatoes, diced
2 avocados, flesh removed and lightly mashed
2 jalapeno peppers, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 head Bibb lettuce leaves

Directions:
Mix tofu, onion, pine nuts, red pepper flakes, black pepper, turmeric, and 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt together in a large bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir tofu mixture until heated through, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low to keep mixture warm while preparing guacamole.
Mix tomatoes, avocados, jalapeno peppers, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt together in a separate bowl.
Arrange lettuce leaves onto a platter. Spoon guacamole into each lettuce leaf; top with tofu mixture.
