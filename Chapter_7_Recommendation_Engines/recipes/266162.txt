Ingredients:
4 boneless center-cut pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons dried thyme, lightly crushed, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Sprinkle chops on all sides with thyme, salt, and pepper. Place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a pork chop reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 20 minutes. Tent aluminum foil over the chops and let rest 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
