Ingredients:
3 cups bread cubes (any thick pieces of leftover bread will work)
1 1/2 tsp. garlic, minced
1/4 tsp. salt and pepper (to taste)
1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
2 tsp. Parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp. onion powder (or less to taste)
1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning (optional)
.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl mix garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil. Put bread cubes into a bowl and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, onion powder and Italian seasoning, if desired.
Pour oil mixture over bread crumbs and toss. Spread out on a baking sheet. Bake, tossing once, until golden brown about (15-20 minutes). Store the homemade croutons in an airtight container.
These homemade croutons taste best if they are allowed to sit for one day before using.
