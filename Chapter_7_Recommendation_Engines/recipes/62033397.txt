Ingredients:
3/4 c vinegar
1 1/2 c water
1 1/2 c low-sodium soy sauce
3 tbsp honey (optional)
1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic
3 bay leaves
1/2 tsp black pepper
3 lbs bone-in or boneless chicken thighs (do not use white meat)

Directions:
Preheat grill or oven broiler.
Combine first 7 ingredients in large covered pot.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Add chicken and reduce heat to medium-low and cook covered for 35-40 minutes.
Remove chicken and drain on paper towel.  Discard bay leaves.  Boil sauce over high heat until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups.
Grill or broil chicken until brown and crisp, about 5 minutes on each side.
Serve chicken with white rice and just a little of the sauce (not too much).

Description: 
This is a very tasty and easy-to-make Filipino chicken dish made with soy sauce, garlic, and vinegar, which actually preserves the chicken. I can just as easy double or triple the chicken in this recipe to serve guests at a party.  Serve with rice with just a little of the sauce (not too much).
