Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup cold butter, cut into pieces
2-3 teaspoons candied ginger pieces
2-3 tablespoons raisins
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 large egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Combine flour, sugar, and baking soda in a large bowl.
With a pastry blend, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Add the raisins and ginger pieces, stir lightly.
In a separate bowl, whisk the egg into the buttermilk.
Add the liquid into the flour mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients.
Use your hands to fully incorporate the flour into the mixture.
Knead mixture about 10 times.
Shape into a ball and place onto lightly floured board.  With your hands, flatten and spread out the dough until it is about Â¾ inch thick.
Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter in half.  You will have 8 pie shaped pieces.
Place pieces apart from each other on a cookie sheet, and bake for 10-12 minutes.
Cool on wire racks.
