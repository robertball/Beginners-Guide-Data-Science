Description: 
This is a tasty, healthy, quick dish that has a taste similar to Bruschetta.  
Since the dough does not contain yeast, it is quick to prepare.  You can 
multiply the recipe to make several individual sized pizzas.  Pesto is only one 
of many topping options.  This makes it a wonderful option for families and it 
can be fun for kids to create their own.  I have also tried traditional toppings 
and BBQ chicken pizza as well.
