Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups flour
1/2 Tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/4 tsp instant yeast
1 Tbsp shortening or butter (at room temperature)
3/4  1 cup milk (at room temperature)
cornmeal for sprinkling

Directions:
In a standing mixer with the dough hook, mix together the flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Mix in the shortening and 3/4 cup of the milk. Add the remaining milk if the dough is too dry.
Allow the machine to knead the dough for about 10 mins on the lowest setting. Lightly oil the bowl/dough and cover dough to rise for 1 hour.
Divide dough into 6 balls and allow to rise for yet another hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 and have a baking sheet lined with parchment ready. Heat a griddle or cast iron pan to medium high and begin browning your english muffins.  About 5-6 mins per side, or until very brown. They will flatten as you flip them.
Once you’ve browned them place them on the baking sheet and bake for about 5-8 minutes.
Allow them to cool for at least 20 mins.
