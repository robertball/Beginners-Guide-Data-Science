Ingredients:
2 Cups shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese
1 1/4 Cups flour
1/2 Cup butter
36 medium large pimento stuffed green olives, jalape√±o stuffed olives, or garlic stuffed olives

Directions:
Place the first three ingredients in the food processor and blend until fine.  Wrap cheesy mixture around olives individually until each are completely coated.  Place on a cookie sheet and flash freeze olives for an hour.  Store in a freezer bag until needed if you wish to make them days in advance.  Put the olives on a baking sheet and cook at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes until lightly browned.  Let cool for 5 minutes before serving and eat with caution, olives can retain the heat.
