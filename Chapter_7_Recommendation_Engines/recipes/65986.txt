Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cook and serve vanilla pudding
2 cups milk
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups cooked instant rice
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese

Directions:
Prepare the vanilla pudding according to package directions using the milk. Set aside to cool slightly.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Stir in the cooked rice, vanilla pudding and ricotta cheese until smooth. Pour into a 9 inch deep dish pie plate or 10 inch pie plate.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the center appears set when the pie is gently jiggled. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled before slicing and serving.
