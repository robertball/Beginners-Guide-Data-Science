Ingredients:
1 - 4 lb chicken cut up
salt
15 oz. green chile enchilada sauce
12 oz. chopped green chile (frozen or canned)
20 oz. condensed cream of chicken soup
1-1/2 lb. grated cheese (muenster, monterrey jack, asadero, or a combination)
1 c. parmesan or enchilado cheese
18 corn tortillas
oil for frying

Directions:
Rinse chicken well and put in a large stock pot; cover with water add salt and boil chicken 45 minutes or until cooked through. Cool until able to be handled. Remove chicken from bones discarding skin and bones. Pull into bite-sized pieces.
In a large bowl, combine chicken, condensed soup, enchilada sauce and green chile. Lightly cover bottom of 9X13 baking pan with mixture to prevent sticking.
Heat 1/4" oil in fry pan. Carefully slide tortillas one at a time into hot oil then turn over immediately (just to soften); pat off excess oil with paper towels.
Cover bottom of baking pan with 6 tortillas. Spread 1/3 of remaining chicken mixture over tortillas. Sprinkle 1/3 of grated cheese over chicken mixture and sprinkle with 1/3 cup parmesan or enchilado. Make another layer of 6 tortillas and continue layering in the same way ending with cheese.
At this point, casserole may be stored (covered) in the refrigerator for later baking.
Bake at 350 for 20 minutes. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into 12 squares. Garnish with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato, if desired.
Serve with spanish rice and refried beans.
