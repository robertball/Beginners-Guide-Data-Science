Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups brown rice flour
1 cup sorghum flour
3/4 cup millet flour
1/4 cup ground chia seeds
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
3 3/4 cups banana puree
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
3 eggs
1/2 cup rice milk
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 3/4 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Whisk brown rice flour, sorghum flour, millet flour, ground chia seeds, and baking powder together in a bowl. Whisk banana puree, walnuts, eggs, rice milk, applesauce, vegetable oil, salt, and cinnamon together in a separate large bowl. Whisk flour mixture into banana mixture until smooth, thick batter forms.
Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, spreading as necessary to form pancake shape. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
A couple years ago my family went on a low-sugar, dairy-free, and gluten-free diet. This recipe is sweetened by fruit and has no gluten, dairy, or added sweetener except the applesauce and banana.
