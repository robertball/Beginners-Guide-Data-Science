Ingredients:
2 cups good chicken or other stock
1 cup orzo (rice-shaped pasta)
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 1/4 pound)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bring stock to a boil in a 6- to 8-cup saucepan; stir in the orzo, cover, and turn heat to medium-low. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
Use a 1/4-cup measure to make four rounds of Parmesan on a non-stick baking sheet. Smooth the rounds into thin pancakes, 5 or 6 inches across; the thickness need not be perfectly uniform. Place baking sheet in oven.
The Parmesan rounds are done when the centers darken slightly and the edges begin to brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove sheet from oven, and let it stand for about a minute; then, carefully lift each of the rounds and drape it over the bottom of narrow cup or glass to form a cup shape. Let dry for about 5 minutes.The orzo is done when it is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed. Season it with pepper and very little salt, then stir in the parsley. Spoon a portion of the orzo into each of the Parmesan cups, and serve.
