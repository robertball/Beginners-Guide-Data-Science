Ingredients:
3 Tbsp butter
2/3 cup dark brown sugar
2 cups milk, divided (whole, 2% or 1%)
1 egg
1 egg yolk
2 Tbsp corn starch
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Whisk together 1 cup milk, egg, egg yolk, corn starch, pumpkin and spices until smooth; whisk in remaining 1 cup milk; set aside.
Melt butter in large heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Add sugar and cook, stirring or whisking frequently, until sugar begins to melt.  (About 4 minutes)
Slowly add in about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, whisking constantly.  Whisk in another 1/2 cup, then slowly add remaining milk mixture, always whisking constantly.  Turn heat up to medium-high, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Boil for 1 minute, or until thickened.  Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla extract.  (Strain if desired)
Pour into dessert dishes. Cover with plastic wrap so the plastic is touching the pudding.  Chill for three hours or overnight.
Serve with whipped cream.
