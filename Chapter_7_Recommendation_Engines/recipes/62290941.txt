Description: 
I found this recipe on Allrecipes.com, but made so many modifications that I typed up my version.  My family loved it, especially the kids. I made a double batch, and it was even better the next day! The corn tortillas act as a thickener (the original recipe called for masa corn flour, but I really didn’t want to buy a big bag of this, and other reviewers said corn tortillas work just as well.)
