Ingredients:
1 potato, peeled
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
4 eggs, beaten
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
salt and pepper to taste
ground cayenne pepper to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potato and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and chop.
Saute the onion and garlic in a lightly oiled skillet over medium high heat. When onion is soft, stir in the spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and pour in the eggs.  Cook until the bottom has set, about 2 minutes. Stir in the potatoes and tomatoes; sprinkle on the salt, pepper, cayenne and hot sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs have set. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve warm.
