Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
1/2 cup white sugar
4 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped fresh strawberries

Directions:
Beat milk, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla with a wire whisk in a saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until beginning to thicken, about 5 minutes.
Fold the strawberries into the thickening mixture. Whisk until the strawberries soften enough to nearly dissolve into the liquid. Continue cooking until nearing a boil and thick enough for a thin layer to cling to a spoon dipped into it, about 5 minutes.
Chill in refrigerator until completely cool.
Freeze in canister of ice cream maker according to manufacturer instructions.

Description: 
This recipe is perfect for 1.5-quart ice cream makers. It's easy to make and tastes great. Making gelato takes some trial and error to figure out the custard bases, flavors, and the quirks of your ice cream maker. Once you conquer the technique you won't believe what you can do.
