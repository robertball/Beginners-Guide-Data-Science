Ingredients:
1 ripe avocado, sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Chipotle seasoning to taste
4 hamburger buns
1 Large tomato

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine sliced avocado and lemon juice. Add water to cover; set aside. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Season the chicken with chipotle. Place on grill, and cook until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side. Place buns on grill just long enough to toast them.
Spread buns and add chicken, slice tomato, and avocado.
