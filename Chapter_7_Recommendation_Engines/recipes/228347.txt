Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups water, or enough to cover
1 pound red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into quarters
1/2 yellow onion, diced
2 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch squares
2 stalks celery, diced
1/4 cup mild yellow pepper rings, drained
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
2 tablespoons juice from yellow pepper rings
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere'sÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Stir salt into water in a large pot and add potatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Slice potatoes and place in a large bowl.
Cook and stir yellow onion, bacon, celery, and pepper rings in a skillet until bacon is browned and celery begins to soften, about 10 minutes.
Mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, horseradish, pepper juice, lemon juice, and Creole seasoning together in a bowl until well blended.
Add bacon mixture and dressing to potatoes; stir to combine. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
