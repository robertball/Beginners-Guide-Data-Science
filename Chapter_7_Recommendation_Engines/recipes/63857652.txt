1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, chilled

In separate bowl beat together wet ingredients, and slowly pour into dry ingredients, stirring with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead just until it comes together, 3 or 4 times. Don't overhandle.
On lightly floured board, shape into a 9 x 12 rectangle about 3/4" thick. Cut into wedges.
Bake on a greased sheet about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Serve warm!!
