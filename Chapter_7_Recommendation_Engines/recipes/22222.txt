Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 cup fat-free (skim) milk
1/2 cup fat-free chicken broth
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package washed fresh spinach, chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Remove fat from chicken. Spray 12-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium heat. Cook chicken in skillet 2 minutes on each side; reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in milk, broth and onion. Cook about 5 minutes, turning chicken occasionally, until onion is tender.
Stir in spinach. Cook 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until spinach is completely wilted and juice of chicken is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut. Remove chicken from skillet; keep warm.
Increase heat to medium. Cook spinach mixture about 3 minutes or until liquid has almost evaporated. Stir in salt, pepper and nutmeg. Serve chicken on spinach.
