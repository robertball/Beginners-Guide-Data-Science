Ingredients:
1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/2 cup whole milk
1/4 cup butter, cut into pieces
1 pinch ground nutmeg
kosher salt to taste
ground white pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the potatoes into a large pot, and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two, and place the potatoes in a large bowl.
Bring the milk to a boil in a small saucepan over low-medium heat.
Whip the potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth; pour the boiling milk over the potatoes, and add butter, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Whip on Medium speed until light and fluffy.

Description: 
These are, hands down, the best mashed potatoes I have ever had  -- and so very easy to make. You can also use soy milk and non-dairy butter for vegans.  I make a side batch vegan-style for my brother and his friends, and they say it tastes great.
