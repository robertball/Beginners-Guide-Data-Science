Ingredients:
4 ripe bananas, cut into chunks
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup buttery spread (such as Smart Balance®)
1 (4 ounce) container applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups rice flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Blend bananas, sugar, buttery spread, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a food processor for at least 3 minutes. Add rice flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon and process until smooth. Scrape down sides and bottom as needed. Pour batter into mini muffin tins.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffin tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 9 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool.
