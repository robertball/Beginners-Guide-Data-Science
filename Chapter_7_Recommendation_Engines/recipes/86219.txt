Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
¼ medium onion, sliced
4 large fresh mushrooms, sliced
¼  green bell pepper, sliced into long strips
1 (1/2 pound) well-marbled beef steak of any type, sliced as thinly as possible
3 tablespoons chopped pickled hot peppers

2 slices sharp Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
⅓  French baguette, cut in half lengthwise

Description: 
I tried for years to make a cheese steak as good as the takeout sub shops of southeastern Massachusetts. I think this is about as close as you can come at home. Freezing the steak the day before makes it easy to cut into very thin slices.
