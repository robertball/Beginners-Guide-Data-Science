Description: 
Super simple, potatoes to serve with hamburgers, steaks or kabobs. They can be made right on the grill with your favorite main dish.  These are crispy on the flat side and tender on the inside.  I make these on the grill but it’s easy to make them in the oven. Just bake at 400 degrees for  30 minutes.
