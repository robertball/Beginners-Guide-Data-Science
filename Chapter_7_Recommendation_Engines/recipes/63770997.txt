Ingredients:
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup salt (coarse salt works best)
1/3 cup paprika
1/3 cup chili powder (choose a hot or mild powder depending on your tastes)
1/3 cup ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix ingredients and pack firmly around brisket 12-24 hours before smoking. Wrap in plastic wrap or place in a large plastic bag. This rub can be stored for several days, but after a week or two the brown sugar will crystallize.

Description: 
Smoked barbecue brisket works great with sweet. This rub starts with brown sugar (choose a dark brown sugar for added molasses flavor) and then picks up the salt and seasoning that finish off a good rub. You can adjust the heat of this rub by choosing a hot or mild chili powder.
