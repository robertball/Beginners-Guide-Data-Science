2 cups minus 2 Tbsp cake flour
1 2/3 cups bread flour
1 1/4 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 1/2 sticks butter at room temperature

1 cup plus 2 Tbsp white sugar
2 large eggs at room temperature
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/4 lbs (2 pkgs) Ghiradelli bittersweet chips

Directions:
Cream butter and sugars together with mixer until light and fluffy, 3-5 mins. Add eggs one at a time, mix after each. Mix in vanilla. Combine flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a bowl, whisk well. Add dry ingredients to wet a little at a time and mix well. Add chocolate chips, mix. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24-36 hours. Remove from fridge to soften slightly and preheat oven to 350. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Use ice cream scoop to make 6 scoops on baking sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 15-20 mins. Transfer baking sheet to wire cooling rack for 10 mins, then transfer cookies directly onto wire rack.
