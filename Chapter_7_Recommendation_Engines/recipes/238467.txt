Ingredients:
4 cups mussels
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
2 cups beef broth, divided
2 tablespoons anise-flavored liqueur
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 red chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 cup white wine
10 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1/4 cup light cream
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Soak mussels in a bowl of cold water for at least 10 minutes; remove from water and scrub with a stiff brush to remove dirt if needed. Remove beard using a sharp knife if needed.
Melt butter with the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir garlic and shallots until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup beef broth, anise-flavored liqueur, jalapeno pepper, and red chile pepper to garlic-shallot mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until peppers are softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir wine, remaining 1 cup beef broth, and basil into broth mixture; simmer.
Whisk light cream and cornstarch together in a bowl until cornstarch is dissolved; add to broth mixture and bring to a boil. Add mussels and lemon juice to boiling broth mixture and cover stockpot with a lid; cook until shells open, about 5 minutes. Discard any shells that didn't open.
