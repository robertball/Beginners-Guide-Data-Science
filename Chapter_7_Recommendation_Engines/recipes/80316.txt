Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup molasses
2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh or frozen cranberries, thawed

Directions:
Place the orange juice, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, butter, and salt in a pan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low, and stir in the cranberries. Cook until cranberries pop, about 10 minutes. Bring the mixture to a boil. Cook and stir until mixture reduces to approximately 1 3/4 cups, about 10 minutes. Cool, cover, and refrigerate until needed.
