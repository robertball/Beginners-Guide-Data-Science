Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
1 10 3/4 ounce can cream of mushroom soup
1 10 3/4 ounce can cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup milk
1 16 oz. package frozen mixed vegetables
1 1/2 cups cooked rice (optional)
1 16 oz. package frozen tater tots
1 1/2 cups shredded Velveeta

Directions:
Brown the ground beef with the onion; drain off any fat. Stir in the soups, milk, and the vegetables, and cooked rice. Transfer the mixture to a 9 x 13" baking dish. Arrange the tater tots on top.
Bake in a preheated 350Â° oven for about 30 minutes, or until the mixture is bubbly and the tater tots are brown and crisp. Sprinkle the cheese over the tater tots, return the dish to the oven, and bake an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
