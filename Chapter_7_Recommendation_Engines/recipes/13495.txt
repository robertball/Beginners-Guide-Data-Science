Description: 
This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I've ever used. It's been in the family for at least sixty years! Since, in our family, one pie is never enough, I like to triple the filling recipe and divide it into two pie shells, since, as my Mom always says, No body likes a skimpy pie!  (Of course, this will add a few minutes to the baking time, too.)
