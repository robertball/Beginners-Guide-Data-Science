Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 cups water
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon honey
15 ounces part skim ricotta
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg
9 whole wheat lasagna noodles
1 pound shredded reduced fat mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook turkey and onion until turkey is no longer pink and onion is translucent.  Drain and combine turkey and onion in a large saucepan with tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, water, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper and honey.  Cook over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer 1 hour.
While sauce is simmering, blend ricotta, Parmesan and egg until smooth. Set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook as directed on package; drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  Cover sauce with 3 noodles.  Cover noodles with one-third of remaining sauce.  Top with half the mozzarella.  Place another layer of noodles and one of sauce over the mozzarella; top that with the ricotta mixture.  Top with remaining 3 noodles and remaining sauce.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes.  Sprinkle remaining mozzarella on top and bake 15 minutes more, until golden and bubbly.
