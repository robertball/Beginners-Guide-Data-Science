Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
Mix the cocoa powder, vegetable oil, and water together in a bowl. Stir the stevia and sugar into the mixture. Pour the soy milk and vanilla into the mixture and stir. Add the flour and baking powder; continue stirring until the batter is smooth.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 35 minutes.
