Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter (or substitute cooking spray)
1 Cup yellow cornmeal
1 Cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 Cup honey
1 egg, beaten
1 3/4 Cups buttermilk
2 4-oz cans chopped green chiles, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease an 8"x8" pan with butter or lightly spray with vegetable cooking spray.
Combine cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda in a large bowl.
Stir in honey, egg, and buttermilk. Don't overmix - it should be somewhat lumpy.
Stir in drained green chiles.
Pour into prepared pan and bake for 55 minutes or until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Description: 
This is my favorite corn bread recipe. It's very dense and flavorful, and goes great with chili or just about anything coming off the grill or smoker.
