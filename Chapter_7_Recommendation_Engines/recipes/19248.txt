Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons creme de menthe liqueur
3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups mint chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, then stir in the creme de menthe liqueur. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the mint mixture. Mix in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
