Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (3 pound) sirloin tip roast
4 (8 ounce) cans mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 cup beef broth
1 envelope onion soup mix
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup beef broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat; fry roast in hot oil until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Pour mushrooms and 1 cup beef broth over roast. Sprinkle with onion soup mix.
Bake in preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 90 minutes. Remove roast from Dutch oven to a platter, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
Whisk cornstarch and remaining 1/4 cup beef broth in a bowl and stir into Dutch oven with mushrooms and pan drippings. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve over sliced beef.
