2 T lemon juice
3/4 t Dijon mustard
2 T olive oil
1/2 c vegetable oil
3 T parmesan cheese, grated
salt and pepper

Directions:
Chop together anchovy, garlic, and a pinch of kosher salt (this tends to be a very salty dressing if salt is used here). Mash with knife to make a paste. Scrape into medium bowl.
Whisk in yolks, lemon juice, and mustard.
Drop by drop then in a slow stream while whisking, add the olive oil and vegetable oil. Whisk until thick and glossy.
Stir in parmesan. Adjust seasonings.
