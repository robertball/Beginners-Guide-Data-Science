Ingredients:
8 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 pound fresh kale, torn into bite-size pieces
1 small green bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 (4 ounce) links linguica sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed, or more to taste
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Turn a slow cooker to Low and add chicken broth.
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker. Add kale, bell pepper, linguica slices, and potatoes to the slow cooker. Pour in beans and tomatoes. Add garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir and cover.
Let cook on Low heat, stirring every 4 hours or so, until potatoes and kale are soft and sausage is cooked through, about 12 hours.
