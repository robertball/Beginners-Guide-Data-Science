Description: 
I had already chosen a pretty serving bowl for this creamy fruit salad and then I came across these cute mini coke glasses, so I used them instead. If you add a cherry on top and a straw, they look like mini milkshakes...but for these you'll need a spoon! 

I entered these cuties in the 2011 Texas Rice Festival cooking contest and they were awarded a 1st place medal in the adult division salad category, best presentation trophy and the reserve champion silver platter!
