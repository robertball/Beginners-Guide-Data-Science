Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Morton® Hot Salt™
2 fluid ounces bourbon whiskey
3 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, rosemary)
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 lime, juiced
4 (8 ounce) NY Strip Steaks, about 1-1/2 inches thick
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 cups mushrooms, sliced
1 large onion, sliced
1 teaspoon Morton® Hot Salt™
1/4 cup beer
1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, rosemary)
3/4 cup steak sauce
1/2 cup 35% whipping cream
1 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
In a bowl mix together the Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM), bourbon, 3 tablespoons fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil and lime juice. Lay steaks evenly into glass dish. Pour marinade over, turning to coat. Marinate the steaks, covered and refrigerated, in the bourbon and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) mixture for 2 to 4 hours.
In a saute pan heat oil over medium heat, add mushrooms, onions and Morton(R) Hot Salt(TM) and saute for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally until tender. Add beer and remaining tablespoon of fresh herbs and simmer for 2 minutes. Add steak sauce and cream and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cheese, stir and set aside, keeping warm.
Preheat grill to high.
Remove steaks from the marinade, setting aside the marinade for basting. Grill the steaks for 3 to 4 minutes per side, basting with the reserved marinade, for medium-rare doneness. Remove steaks from grill and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes. Slice on the bias and serve with mushroom, onion and blue cheese sauce.
