1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw速
1/4 cup Stevia In The Raw速
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw(R), Stevia In The Raw(R), butter, eggs, molasses, 2 tablespoons water, and vanilla. Stir into flour mixture until a stiff dough comes together.
Divide dough in half and shape each half into a 8 x 2-inch log. Place on baking sheet and press to flatten slightly. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons Sugar In The Raw(R). Bake 25 minutes. Let cool enough to handle, then transfer to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch slices. Lay slices on baking sheet and bake 10 minutes. Flip slices and bake until lightly browned, 5 minutes more.
