Ingredients:
3 8-ounce packages cream cheese
3 cans chopped or minced clams (I use 2 cans chopped and 1 can minced)
9 cloves fresh garlic, minced or chopped

Directions:
Put the three packages of cream cheese in a large bowl and allow to soften to room temperature.
Add the juice from one can of clams to the cream cheese.  Using a mixer on whip, add juice of another can of clams and keep whipping.  As it thickens, squeeze the juice from the third can of clams and continue to whip.
After it has thickened, mix in the garlic and clams.
Chill for at least one hour before serving.

This fabulous clam garlic dip was always brought to family gatherings by our friend Pat.  Everyone loved it and couldn't get enough.  Pat has since passed away, but her dip lives on.
