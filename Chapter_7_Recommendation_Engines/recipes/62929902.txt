Description: 
Do you remember the Lincoln Del in Minneapolis? Apparently it first started as a bakery. At one time there were three of them, the last one closing in 2000. I remember the one on 494. They were famous for the omelets as well as their Matzo soup and desserts. Here is a recipe for their famous chocolate pie. You certainly need a stand mixer if you are going to make this one!
