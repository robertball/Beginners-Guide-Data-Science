Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package dried soba noodles
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1/4 cup onion
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 cup assorted mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped eggplant
6 leaves bok choy, chopped
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon teriyaki sauce
ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 green onion, finely chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in mushrooms and eggplant; cook for 2 minutes more. Add cooked soba noodles, bok choy, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and pepper. Cook until bok choy is tender, about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle sesame oil and green onion over vegetables and serve.
