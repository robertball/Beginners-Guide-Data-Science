Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons chile powder, divided
Salt and ground black pepper
1 medium green bell pepper, cut into medium dice
1 small onion, cut into medium dice
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper sauce

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with 1 tablespoon chile powder, salt and pepper. Add chicken to pan and cook until no longer pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate, cover and set aside.
To the hot skillet add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, bell pepper and onion; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, remaining 1 tablespoon chile powder and hot pepper sauce. Simmer to blend flavors, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and simmer until heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes longer.
