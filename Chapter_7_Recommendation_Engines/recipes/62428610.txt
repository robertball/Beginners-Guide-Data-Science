Ingredients:
6 quarts of Popped corn (place popped corn in a large roasting pan)
1 cup butter
1/2 cup corn syrup
2 cups brown sugar (use only C&H; brown sugar)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla (I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp maple extract)
1/2 tsp baking soda

Directions:
Heat your oven to 250F.
In a saucepan melt the butter, stir in the corn syrup, sugar and salt.
Bring the mixture to a boil (medium high heat) stirring constantly. Boil (medium high heat) without stirring for 5 minutes (making sure to use a timer because you don't want to go longer as it will burn).
Remove from the heat, stir in the soda and vanilla (Careful! it foams!).
Pour over the popped corn and mix well in roasting pan.
Bake for 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to evenly coat (making sure to mix all the caramel that forms on the bottom of the pan.
Let it cool and eat!
