Ingredients:
2 cups eggnog
2 cups heavy cream
1 (10 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste

Directions:
Mix eggnog, heavy cream, condensed milk, and vanilla in a large bowl. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
