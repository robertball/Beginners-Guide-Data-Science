Ingredients:
2 lbs. (four 8 oz. packages) cream cheese, room temp.
1 3/4 cups brown sugar plus 2 TBS. set aside
3/4 cup sour cream
one 15 oz. can pumpkin puree(1/4 cup set aside)
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp ginger
1/4 tsp salt
4 eggs
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup crushed graham crackers

Preheat oven to 350. Butter an 8"x3" round cake pan.
Beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth.
Add, in order, beating slightly afeter each addition: brown sugar(not extra 2 tbs) sour cream, pumpkin puree(not extra 1/4 cup), spices,eggs and yolks
Remove about 1/4 cup of the batter and place in small bowl. Pour remaining batter into pan. Add set-aside pumpkin puree and brown sugar to small bowl, with the 2/4 cup batter.
Spoon this mix into a small airtight bag and seal. Cut off one tiny bottom to make a piping bag. Start at the center of the cake pan and swirl a mixture on the surface of the batter. Carefully drag a knife through the batter to create a pattern(starting on the edge, drag knife to center to make a * shape).
Place cake pan in a larger pan(9"x3")with about an inch of water in it. Place in oven and cook for about 1 and a half hours. Outher edge should look set while middle is still jiggly. Remove from largerpan and let cool on a wire rack for one houer. DO NOT put in fridge to cool.
When cool place plastic wrap over the top of the cheesecake. Then place a plate ontop. Carefully flip the cake over. Lift the cake pan off and sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs over the bottom of the cake. Place another plate over the crumbs and flip the cake over again. Peel off the plastic wrap, slowly. Chill cake in fridge for 4 hours.
