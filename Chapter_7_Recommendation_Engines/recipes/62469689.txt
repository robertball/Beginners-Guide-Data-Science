Ingredients:
6 lb Pork Shoulder
5 garlic cloves, peeled & whole

Directions:
Turn crock-pot onto low heat. Add whole garlic cloves to bottom of crock-pot and place the pork shoulder on top. THATS IT.
Cook for about 5-6 hrs on low heat covered. There is no need to add water or anything to the bottom, once heated, after about an hour, the pork shoulder will begin to shred the fat and it will cook in its own juices. Once 5-6 hours is up - check the pork, its should be pulling away from the bone and when pieced with a fork should be very easy to tear. Remove the pork shoulder carefully and place on a plate. Carefully shred the pork - depending on your preference you can do completely shredded or leave bigger chunks here and there.
Heat large skillet on stove top on high heat, remove whatever garlic pieces are left from bottom of crock-pot and throw into skillet. Slowly begin adding shredded pieces of pork into skillet and brown just a bit. Do not attempt to brown all pork meat at once, I usually do about a 1/4 at a time. Once all meat is browned to your liking, you are done. Serve with white rice and black beans.
