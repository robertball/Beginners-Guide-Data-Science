Ingredients:
2 cups baking soda
3 T hydrogen peroxide
20 drops essential oil

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine two cups of baking soda, three tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide, and about 20 drops of essential oil. Mix these ingredients together until the consistency resembles moist sand, and then use an ice cream scoop to form your sanitation explosives. Let these sit overnight.
Before you run any dishwasher cycles, make sure the filter is cleaned and any leftover food is removed.
Now that your baking soda bombs are hardened, place them on the bottom rack. Combine a mixture of two cups vinegar and one tablespoon detergent in a mixing bowl, and place it on the top rack. Run your dishwasher and get ready to witness true cleaning power.
