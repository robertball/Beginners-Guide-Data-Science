Ingredients:
1 pound extra large shrimp (16-20 per lb.), shell on, deveined
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
Lemon wedges

Directions:
Season with salt, pepper, brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, ketchup. Pour in olive oil and stir thoroughly. Let shrimp sit for about 15 minutes, no longer.
Heat a dry saute pan over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, or when a few drops of water sizzle and start to bead up before evaporating. Place shrimp in pan. Let cook on one side until the shrimp turns from opaque to white about halfway up the side, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn shrimp over. Cook until shrimp are almost cooked through. Transfer to a serving plate.

Description: 
If the weather puts a damper on your barbeque plans, these indoor barbeque shrimp are so easy and fast. Use the raw, ready-to-peel shrimp that are deveined but still have their shells on (raw, ready-to-peel) to achieve the char-grilled look without worrying about dry shrimp.
