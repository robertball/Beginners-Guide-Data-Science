Ingredients:
1 medium butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2/3 cup chopped carrot
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/4 cup half-and-half
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place butternut squash halves on the prepared baking sheet, flesh side up.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash is fork tender and easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; add carrot, onion, and garlic and saute until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Remove squash from the oven and cool until easily handled. Scoop cooked squash into a bowl; discard skins.
Combine chicken broth, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, half-and-half, sauteed veggie mixture, cooked squash, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper in a high performance blender (such as Vitamix(R)) in the order listed. Start blending on variable speed 1 and gradually increase to variable speed 10. Blend for 5 minutes 45 seconds, then turn down to variable speed 1.
Remove the cap while still blending and pour in remaining 3 tablespoons evaporated milk. Blend on variable speed 1 for 10 seconds more.

Description: 
I was looking for a great butternut squash soup recipe that was creamy with great flavor. I found that I liked elements of many of the ones out there, but none hit the mark. So I created my own in the Vitamix®! My husband is an extremely picky eater when it comes to food consistency and he loved it. I hope you do as well. This recipe is now in our regular rotation. Top with paprika and parsley or your desired spice.
