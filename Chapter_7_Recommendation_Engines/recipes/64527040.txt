Ingredients:
1 granny smith apple
1 lime, cut into 4 wedges
2-4 green onions
1 Poblano pepper
Handful of fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees farenheit.
Cut the root end off of green onions.  Cut white end off and place on metal tray for baking.  Thinly slice the green ends and set aside.
Cut pobalano pepper in half legthwise.  Try to not touch the inside! Scoop out the seeds, cut off the stem, and pull out the white parts.  Place on metal tray with green onions.
Drizzle olive oil on pepper and onions.  Add salt and pepper.  Bake for 12-18 minutes, or until soft and slightly charred.  (The onions may need less time than the pepper)
While vegetables are baking, peel and core granny smith apple.  Cut into small chunks.
Toss the apple in the juice of 2 lime wedges.  Add green parts of onions.
Chop the cilantro leaves and add to apple mixture.
Once vegetables have baked and are cooled, dice onion and pepper into small chunks.  Add to apple mixture.
Mix well.  Add more lime juice, salt, and pepper, if needed.  Chill before serving.
