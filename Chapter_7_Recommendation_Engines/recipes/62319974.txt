Ingredients:
8 slices bacon, cut into 1/2" pieces
5 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into ½ “cubes
3-4 ribs celery, finely diced
1 large onion, finely chopped
2 large carrots, peeled and finely diced.
1 red or orange pepper - diced.
1 box chicken broth
1-2 teaspoons salt (to taste)
2 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons paprika
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
Dried parsley (optional)

Directions:
Cook bacon over medium-high heat in stock pot, about 4-5 minutes, until crisp.
Reduce heat to medium and add potatoes, celery, onion, carrots, and red pepper. Stir in salt, black pepper and paprika. Sauté for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add broth to stockpot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
While vegetables are cooking, in a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and cook stirring constantly until thick, about 1-2 minutes. Slowly whisk in milk. Turn heat to medium-high and continue whisking over heat until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk/flour mixture into the stockpot, and continue to cook for 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately sprinkled with a bit of dried parsley for color.

Description: 
This recipe is fast and hearty! My version is a bit different. I use bacon, with the addition of carrots and red or orange pepper. I choose Yukon Gold potatoes. I saute the vegetables lightly before adding boxed chicken broth (instead of water and boullion granules).Modified from: Delicious Ham and Potato Soup
