Directions:
Combine gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a large bowl.
Whisk eggs in a separate bowl. Whisk in almond milk, coconut oil, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Fold in flour mixture until batter is just blended.

Stir batter. Scoop 1/2 cup batter onto the preheated iron and spread to the edges. Close iron and cook until iron stops steaming, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
