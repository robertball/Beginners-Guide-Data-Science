Ingredients:
1½ cups raw unprocessed cashews plus water for soaking
¾ cup water
3 tbls lemon juice
¼ cup nutritional yeast
1 clove garlic
½ tsp brown mustard
½ tsp paprika
½ tsp chile powder
? tsp tumeric
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Soak the cashews for at least an hour or overnight. The longer you soak the softer and easier they are to blend.
Drain them and then toss them into a blender.
Pulse them a few times to get them chopped up.
Add the water and the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth and creamy. Stop every now and then to scrape down the sides – you won’t want to waste a single bit of this stuff!
