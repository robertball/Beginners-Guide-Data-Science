Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup white sugar
6 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled, divided
3 egg yolks
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl, about 5 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups flour, milk, sugar, 4 tablespoons melted and cooled butter, egg yolks, and salt. Mix well.
Lightly flour a clean work surface. Turn dough out onto the surface and knead for 5 minutes, adding enough flour so that dough is not sticky.
Grease a bowl with 1 teaspoon butter. Place dough in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Let dough rise in a warm place for 50 minutes.
Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and set aside. Lightly punch dough down and knead on a lightly floured surface into an 18x9-inch rectangle. Brush with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.
Roll dough up snugly from 1 short end and cut into 9 slices, trimming ends to make neat. Place slices in the prepared baking pan, cut side-up. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and put in a warm place for 40 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a platter and dust with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
I had this at a StarbucksÂ® when I went to Puerto Rico and made it myself a few times. It is my favorite type of bread, with a fluffy consistency and an egg taste. Hope you like it too.
