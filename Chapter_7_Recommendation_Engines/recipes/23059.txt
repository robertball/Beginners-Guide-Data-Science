Ingredients:
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup white sugar
2 cups light cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup brown sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together eggs and sugar until smooth; set aside.  In the top of a double boiler over simmering water, heat cream until bubbles start to form at edges.  Remove from heat and whisk into egg mixture, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.  Return mixture to double boiler and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Cook 2 minutes more, then remove from heat.   Cool completely.  Stir in vanilla.
Preheat oven broiler.
Pour cooled mixture into a 1 quart, shallow baking dish and place dish in an ice bath, in a larger, ovenproof dish.  Sprinkle brown sugar over surface of mixture and place under preheated broiler 1 to 2 minutes, until top is lightly browned and bubbly.
