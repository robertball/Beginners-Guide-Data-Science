Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
2 cups medium-grain white or wild rice
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional spices to taste: garlic, rosemary, savory, thyme, or others

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Rinse rice thoroughly and place in a deep round or oval baking dish. Pour chicken broth over the rice.
Season both sides of the chicken thighs as desired and place on top of rice in the baking dish.  Cover and bake for about 50 minutes, or until rice is fluffy and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees.
