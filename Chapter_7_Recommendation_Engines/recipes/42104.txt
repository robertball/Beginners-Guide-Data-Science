Ingredients:
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup Sauterne wine
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon dry mustard
6 (1/2-inch thick) pork chops
1 (15.25 ounce) can crushed pineapple
3 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
In a medium container, mix onion, Sauterne wine, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and dry mustard. Place pork chops in the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight. Turn pork chops once while marinating.
Prepare an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Arrange pork chops on the grill, and cook 5 to 7 minutes on each side, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Top with crushed pineapple and brown sugar before removing from heat. Discard remaining marinade.
