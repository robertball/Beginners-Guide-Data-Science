Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) cans boneless, skinless salmon, drained
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons chopped onion, or more to taste
3/4 cup quick-cooking oats, or as needed
2 tablespoons canola oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix salmon, egg, and chopped onion in a bowl with your hand; add oats incrementally, mixing until the mixture holds together and it not overly moist. Shape the mixture into 4 patties.
Heat oil and butter together in a skillet over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot. Fry patties in oil mixture until browned and heated through, about 7 minutes per side.
