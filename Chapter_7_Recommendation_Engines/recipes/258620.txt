Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups 2% milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons water
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add garlic, cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add milk, salt, and pepper; stir constantly until simmering, about 2 minutes.
Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Add water-cornstarch mixture to sauce; stir continuously until sauce is thickened to desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
A simple pasta sauce using a few common ingredients, this is kind of like an Alfredo, but not nearly as rich. It's very light and flavorful and pretty low in fat, depending on what kind of milk you use. I made this up because I didn't have any butter for my kids' noodles, and dry noodles just won't do!
