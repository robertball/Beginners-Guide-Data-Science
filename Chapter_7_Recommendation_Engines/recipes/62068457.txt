Ingredients:
Batter- 4 eggs
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon water
1/4 teaspoon salt
Filling- 3 ounces ground pork
3 water chestnuts, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons scallions, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
Sauce- 3/4 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon dry sherry
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Seasoning- 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Beat batter ingredients together, and let stand 25 minutes. Mix filling ingredients with seasoning ingredients, knead until smooth, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Wipe out skillet with oiled cloth or spray with cooking spray, and heat to medium. Pour in 1 tablespoon batter and tilt, trying to form a circle. Cook until set on bottom but still sticky on top. Remove and let cool. Repeat until batter is gone. Place a small amount of filling in center of each dumpling wrapper and fold in halves. Gently press together the edges to stick firmly. Bring sauce ingredients to a simmer in small saucepan. Add dumplings and gently simmer for 10-15 minutes. Serve dumplings with sauce.
