Nicoise-Style Tuna Salad With White Beans & Olives Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4 pound green beans, trimmed and snapped in half
1 (12 ounce) can solid white albacore tuna, drained
1 (16 ounce) can Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
4 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled and quartered

Directions:
Place green beans, 1/3 cup water and a large pinch of salt in a medium skillet. Cover, turn heat on high, and bring water to boil. Once beans start to steam, set timer and cook until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. (Because the beans cook in such a small amount of water, make sure not to let the skillet run dry.) Immediately dump them onto a lipped cookie sheet lined with paper towels to cool.
Mix tuna, white beans, olives and onion in a medium bowl. Whisk together oregano, oil, lemon juice and zest in a medium bowl, then pour over the salad and gently stir to combine.
Adjust seasonings to taste. Arrange a portion of green beans, tuna-bean salad and eggs on each of 4 plates.

Description: 
For my nicoise-style tuna salad, just open three cans: one each of tuna, white beans and sliced olives. Toss these ingredients with slivered red onion, olive oil and lemon juice. Take time, if you like, to boil eggs, or pick them up at the grocery salad bar. Serve the salad with steamed green beans. For an even simpler version, add a little chopped parsley to the salad for color and serve it with salted tomato slices.
