Ingredients:
3 large eggs
3/4 cup turbinado sugar
1/4 cup virgin coconut oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 ripe bananas
1/3 cup whole walnuts, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup golden raisins
5 Golden Delicious apples, peeled and cut into chunks
2 tablespoons turbinado sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, coconut oil, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until creamy.
Mix whole wheat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl.
Mash bananas in a small bowl until creamy. Add to the egg mixture and beat well. Add flour mixture and beat well. Add walnuts, cranberries, and raisins; mix again. Add apple chunks and mix with a spatula until coated with batter.
Scoop batter into the prepared pan and pat down with the spatula, filling in any gaps. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons turbinado sugar on top for a rich finish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a delicious cake enriched with fresh fruit and lusciously spiced. It tastes better the next day when the flavors really come together and the tartness of the apples settles. It is worth warming slightly before serving. Adding allspice takes away the slightly bitter taste of the whole wheat flour. Happy baking!
