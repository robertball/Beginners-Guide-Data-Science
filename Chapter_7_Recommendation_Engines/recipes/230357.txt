Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter in a large bowl until creamy and fluffy. Mix flour, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract into the creamed butter to form a dough. Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Press the dough balls with the bottom of a glass until dough is flattened to 1/2-inch thick.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are light brown, 10 to 13 minutes.

Description: 
Perfect little shortbread cookies. Dip them in chocolate and top with nuts, coconut, and crushed candy canes. Not too sweet and a great Christmas cookie! Freezes well and dough can be made a day or two ahead. These are good plain, or you can melt some chocolate chips (milk, semi-sweet, or white) and dip one end of the cookie. You can then dip the chocolate end in chopped nuts, crushed candy canes, coconut, jimmies, or decorating sugar. Or, add a little grated orange peel or chopped candied ginger to the chocolate when you melt it for another great flavor. Place on waxed paper to harden.
