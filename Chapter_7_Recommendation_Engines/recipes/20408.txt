Ingredients:
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 eggs
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.
In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, turmeric and onion.  Add the still-warm potatoes and stir until evenly coated.  Gently mix in the hard-cooked eggs.  Serve immediately, or refrigerate and serve cold.

Description: 
Warm tater salad is easy; just mix everything together when the taters are still warm. The mustard and turmeric are to taste, so just start with a little and keep adding until  you get the flavor you're looking for.  Also, the onions are optional in this recipe.
