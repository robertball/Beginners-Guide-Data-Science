Ingredients:
1 1/2 Dz Flour Tortillas or more
Chicken--we like the dark meat of the legs and thighs,
or you can use breasts, or the whole chicken.
Sufficient amount of water
Salt and Pepper to taste
1 can (10 oz. can) Rotel tomatoes
1 heaping tablespoon of plain flour
2 ice cubes.

Directions:
In a large pot, put in water, salt and pepper, chicken and Rotels.
Cook chicken until tender, but not falling off the bone (over-
cooked chicken will be stringy), debone, and dice.  Place
back in the pot, and while it is coming back to a boil, slice
the tortillas in strips.  In a jar, mix about two oz. water and
the flour with two ice cubes, put a lid on it and shake until
throughly mixed and set aside. When mixture is boiling, drop in the
tortilla strips quickly, but seperately (so they won't stick together).
Boil until tender (8-10 minutes).  Then, using the flour + water
mixture, stir and pour until the soup is as thick as you want it.
