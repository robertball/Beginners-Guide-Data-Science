Ingredients:
4 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 cups frozen chopped onions
1 1/2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (24 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes (such as Ore-Ida® Steam n' Mash®) Garlic Seasoned Potatoes)
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
3/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/2 dashes hot sauce (such as Louisiana®)
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour chicken broth over onions; add potatoes, flour, basil, salt, pepper, garlic salt, and hot sauce.
Bring chicken broth to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring and mashing potatoes often using a potato masher, until soup is cooked through and smooth, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir evaporated milk into soup.
