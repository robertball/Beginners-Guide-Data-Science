Ingredients:
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 quart heavy cream, divided
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
6 boneless pork chops
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, cut into 1 inch chunks
1 clove garlic, diced
3/4 cup maple syrup
6 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Mix the egg, 3 cups heavy cream, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, and dip in the cream mixture. Then dredge in the oats to coat. Repeat to coat chops completely.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Use tongs to place the coated chops in the hot oil, and fry until browned on both sides. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat (you may use the same skillet if the oil has been drained), and cook the pork chops, onion, and garlic until onion is tender. Pour in the maple syrup, and mix in mushrooms and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook 10 minutes, or until pork chops are done. Remove chops from skillet, reserving sauce.
Mix the remaining cream into the skillet with reserved sauce. Bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened. Serve over the pork chops.
