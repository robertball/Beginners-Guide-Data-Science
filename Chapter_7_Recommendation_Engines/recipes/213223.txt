Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups water
1 1/2 cups milk
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, or more if desired
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring to a boil the chicken broth, water, milk, garlic, rosemary, and salt. Gradually whisk in cornmeal, set heat to medium-low, and simmer the cornmeal mixture until thick and creamy, stirring often to prevent lumps, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and stir in the Parmesan cheese until well combined.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole. Spoon the polenta into the prepared casserole, adding more Parmesan cheese if desired. Sprinkle the top with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until the polenta is bubbling and golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Creamy polenta is seasoned with Parmesan and rosemary -- delicious served with osso buco (braised lamb or veal shanks). This is excellent without the rosemary if you don't care for the flavor.
