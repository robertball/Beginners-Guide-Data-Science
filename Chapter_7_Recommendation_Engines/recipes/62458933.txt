Ingredients:
2 8 ounce packages Seamless Dough Sheets (Crescent)
2 8 ounce packages cream cheese--softened
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 egg
Topping:
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Butter a 9 X 13" pan.
Unroll 1 package of the seamless dough and fit into bottom of the pan.  You might want to stretch the ends up around the corners.
Mix cream cheese, vanilla, sugar, and egg until creamy.
Spread over crescent roll dough.
Unroll the other package of dough and fit over the top of the filling.
Spread the melted butter on the dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture over that.
Bake 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.  I checked it part way through and tried to tilt the pan so the butter would be spread evenly.
