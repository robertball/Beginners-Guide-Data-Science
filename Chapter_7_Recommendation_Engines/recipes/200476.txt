Ingredients:
4 eggs
3 tablespoons molasses
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste
12 thick slices challah bread
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Beat together the eggs, molasses, cream, vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon in a bowl until smooth. Dip the challah slices in the batter until coated on all sides.
Melt half of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place half of the challah slices into the pan, and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining butter and challah slices.

Description: 
The molasses in the batter gives this version of the classic breakfast food a caramel coating that is quite delicious. This one also proves to be a great way to use up the left over Challah from Shabbat on a Saturday morning.
