Ingredients:
2 cups Greek yogurt
2 cups cream
1 2-3 oz. package of instant vanilla pudding
2 cups roughly crushed ginger snap cookies
2 banana’s sliced
2 tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Whisk the pudding, cream & yogurt together until it thickens.  Slice the bananas & toss them in lemon juice to prevent browning.  To assemble the parfaits, line up four, 8-10 oz. clear drinking glasses.  Sprinkle 2 tbsp. of cookies in the bottom of each glass and then cover the cookies with 2-3 tbsp. of Crème mixtures and 3-4 banana slices.  Repeat this process 2 times in each glass or until all the ingredients are gone.
