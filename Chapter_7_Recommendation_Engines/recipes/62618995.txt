Ingredients:
* 1  pound  boneless beef chuck pot roast
* 1  tablespoon  ground ancho chile pepper
* 1  tablespoon  vegetable oil

2. In a 3-1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker, combine frozen stew vegetables and frozen corn. Top with meat. Pour salsa and the water over.
3. Cover and cook on low-heat setting for 8 to 9 hours or on high-heat setting for 4 to 4-1/2 hours. If desired, serve with corn bread. Makes 4 servings.
