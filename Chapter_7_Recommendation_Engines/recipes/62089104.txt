Ingredients:
1 packaged chocolate cake mix, (devil's food, fudge, or your favorite kind)
3 eggs
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling
1 can chocolate frosting
1 can vanilla frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.
Grease and flour or coat with cooking spray two 8 inch round layer pans, and set aside.
Combine cake mix, eggs and cherry pie filling in a large mixing bowl.
Mix with spoon -- not an electric mixer -- until well blended.
Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes, or until the cake is springy when lightly touched.
Cool completely (at least 20 minutes).
Place first layer on cake plate.  Frost top generously with vanilla frosting, reserving at least half the can for later.
Place second layer on top of first.
Cover entire cake with chocolate frosting.
Dollop a generous amount of vanilla frosting onto the top of the cake and swirl with the chocolate frosting.

Description: 
This rich, delicious cake goes together in no time, and the swirled vanilla and chocolate frosting on top of the cake looks impressive for almost any occasion!  I've seen variations of this dessert in several places, including this site, but never such an easy version.  Enjoy!
