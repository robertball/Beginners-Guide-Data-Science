Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups cassava flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
4 tablespoons duck fat
3/4 cup water

Directions:
Stir together cassava flour and salt. Add duck fat and water and mix with your hands. Continue kneading mixture into a soft and pliable consistency similar to child's play dough.
Divide dough into 10 balls and keep covered with plastic wrap in a bowl while you work.
Roll out individual balls of dough into rounds, either by hand or with a tortilla press lined with parchment paper.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 1 flattened tortilla round in the skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Repeat with remaining dough.
