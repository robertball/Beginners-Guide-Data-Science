Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 pound ground pork
3/4 cup chili powder
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup white vinegar

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, ground pork, chili powder, oregano, garlic, salt, red wine and vinegar. I find that using my hands works the best. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days. Take out daily, and mix thoroughly.
If you are not going to cook with it immediately, divide it into 1 to 2 pound portions, and store in freezer bags in the freezer.

Description: 
This chorizo is delicious, easy to make and way better than store bought. I keep some in the freezer at all times for a quick and easy breakfast burrito with scrambled eggs, and cotija or Monterey Jack cheese. Enjoy!
