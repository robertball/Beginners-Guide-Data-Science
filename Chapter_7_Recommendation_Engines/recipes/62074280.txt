Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Margarine
1 Cup Brown Sugar
1 20 oz. Can Pineapple Slices
1 Box Chocolate Cake Mix (I used Pillsbury)

Directions:
In a large deep skillet (I use cast iron) melt margarine over medium to medium high heat.  Add in the brown sugar and simmer till bubbly.  Remove from heat.  Take pineapple slices and distribute evenly over bottom of skillet over the margarine sugar mixture.  Set aside.
Mix cake mix (I use an immersion blender so the cake does not get too fluffy and it fits into the skillet nicely) according to directions till smooth then pour immediately over pineapple in skillet.  Bake 30 to 45 minutes in oven till toothpick when inserted into center comes out clean.  Remove from oven and immediately invert onto a round pizza pan or large round platter.  Use caution the remaining juices will run out and are very hot.  I serve ours while it is still warm.

Description: 
This recipe I came up with just wanting something sweet and the regular chocolate cake mix did not sound appealing.  This is moist and just the right amount of sweetness that will satisfy a sweet tooth.  I did not have any icing around and I wanted something that will be ready all at once with a minimal amount of ingredients.  I hope your family enjoys this as much as mine has.
