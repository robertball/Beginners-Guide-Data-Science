Ingredients:
*Tomatillo serrano salsa:
1 lb tomatillos, husked and washed (they're sticky devils)
1/2 large white onion, roughly chopped
3 serranos
4 cloves of garlic, minced and pan roasted
2 T cilantro
2 t salt
1 t cumin
1/2 t black pepper
1 lime, juiced
*Pineapple Habanero
2 C diced pineapple
1 C diced red onion
1 C diced red bell pepper
2 T cilantro (up to you)
2 habanero peppers minced (seed them if you want it less spicy or just use one)
2 t salt
1 t cumin
1/4 t ginger
1/4 t black pepper
pinch paprika
1 lime, juiced
*Tex-Mex dumplings
1lb ground white meat turkey breast
2 eggs
1 avocado - smashed
3 or 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - minced
1/2 C red onion - diced
2 C roasted or sweet corn kernels
4 cloves garlic - minced
1 lime - juiced
1 package won ton wrappers
1/2 c orange bell pepper - diced
3 T minced cilantro
2 t salt
2 t honey
1 t cumin
1/2 t black pepper
1/4 t paprika
1/4 t chili powder
1/4 t cayenne pepper

Directions:
*Roasted tomatillo serrano salsa:
Roast tomatillos under broiler, 2" from the heat, 3-4 minutes. Flip, go another 3-4 minutes. Remove stems, toss everything in blender. Blend til smooth. Refrigerate. Stir & adjust lime juice & salt to taste before serving.
*Pineapple haba√±ero salsa
Stir everything together, cover refrigerate. Garnish with extra cilantro or green onion. They'll think you're fancy.
*Tex-Mex dumplings
Set aside one egg & wonton wrappers. In a medium bowl, mix everything else together. Cover and let it sit at least a couple hours, or overnight (max).
After marinating, remove from fridge. Take the extra egg and add it to a small bowl with 1 tsp water. Beat the egg and set aside as your egg wash. On a piece of wax paper lay out the won ton wrappers (I usually do five at a time). Brush each wrapper's edges with the egg wash. Add 1/2-3/4 small kitchen spoon full of the mixture to each wrapper. Fold in the left and right side and then roll like a burrito and make sure it's sealed. Repeat this until you're out of either won tons or filling. Brush the completed dumplings with the remaining egg wash.
In a large skillet heat 1 T of olive oil or spray with PAM or another non-stick cooking spray. Reduce the heat to medium and add won tons (size of skillet will dictate how many you can add. . .DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH WHILE COOKING. . .they will stick and it will suck).
Cook on each side for 1-2 minutes until golden brown. Remove to large plate to cool. Repeat until all have been cooked.
Take everything to the party and prepare for high fives. . .Happy Cinco de Mayo!
