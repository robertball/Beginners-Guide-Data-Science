Directions
In a pan, heat olive oil and brown meat. (Don't cook all the way through or it will come out too dry.)
In a large pot, mix soup mix, V8, water, chopped onion, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, potatoes, and carrots. Cook on medium heat. When meat is ready, add to mixture. Cover and simmer (stir occasionally) on medium/low heat until meat is cooked through and potatoes and carrots are soft. Add in broccoli, cauliflower and corn. Simmer long enough for the vegetables to be cooked. If you don't like brocolli or cauliflower, it's ok to leave them out. Add more or less spice as you please.
