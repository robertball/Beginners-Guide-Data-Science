Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, sliced
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
6 apple - peeled, cored and sliced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup skim milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Cut bread into 1 1/2 inch thick slices and place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat eggs with 1 1/2 cup skim milk, 1/3 cup white sugar, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Pour egg mixture over bread slices.
Arrange apple slices on top of bread. Sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, and  2 tablespoons white sugar over apples. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
In the morning: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake toast in preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour. Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, flour, and margarine. Stir in brown sugar, 1/2 cup skim milk, and 2 teaspoons vanilla in a small saucepan. Cook until thick. Serve French toast hot with warm sauce.

Description: 
Baked French toast with apples and caramel sauce. The consistency of the finished recipe will be similar to bread pudding! A glass baking pan will help prevent the toast from sticking.
