Ingredients:
3 cups 100% whole wheat flour
2-3 Tbls vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
1 1/3 cup hot water
1 Tbls active dry yeast
1 Tbls Sugar
1 1/2 tbls olive oil
1 tbls melted butter

Directions:
Add flour, gluten, salt and pepper in large bowl.
In small bowl mix water, yeast and sugar, wait 5 minutes until foamy.  Once foamy, add olive oil and softened butter to yeast mix.
I typically Combine flour mixture and yeast mixture by hand in the mixer bowl, then start the mixer (using a dough hook) on med-high until a ball forms then continue to knead on #2 speed (kitchenaid)  for approx 10 minutes.
Place dough in medium  bowl (sprayed with cooking spray) cover and let rise till double, approximately 45 minutes.  Remove from bowl, press down. Shape into loaf and and place into oiled loaf pan, let rise till double, approximately 45 minutes to 1 hr.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.

Description: 
Basic 100% whole wheat bread.  I use this same recipe for whole wheat pita bread and whole wheat pizza crust. 
Wheat gluten is the secret to get a great raise on this bread.  Although I make in my food processor, it can be made in a kitchenaide mixer or the good old fashion method of choice.Modified from: 100% Whole Wheat Bread
