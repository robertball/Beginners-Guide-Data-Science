Description: 
I threw this together with what was on hand one afternoon. My finicky Hubbie LOVED it! I let it simmer about four hours before serving and the flavors really popped. I also saved time by using pre-cooked and frozen ground beef as well as tomato juice frozen from the summer pasta sauce freeze. All natural ingredients make this a sure to please soup!
