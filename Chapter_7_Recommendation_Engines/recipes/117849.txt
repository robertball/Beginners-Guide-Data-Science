Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 (8 ounce) tuna steaks

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first seven ingredients. Pour 1/2 cup marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add tuna steaks. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2-4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade.
Drain and discard marinade from tuna. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting grill. Grill tuna, uncovered, for 5-7 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Serve with the reserved marinade.
