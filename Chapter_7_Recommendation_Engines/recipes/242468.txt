Almond Tea Cakes from King Arthur FlourÂ® Recipe

Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 1/3 cups King Arthur Almond Flour
1/2 cup King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar or glazing sugar, plus extra for dusting
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 large egg whites
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon almond extract
Fresh berries or jam

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the cups of a mini-muffin pan.
Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan set over medium heat. Swirl the butter in the pan and continue to cook until it turns golden and smells nutty.
Pour the browned butter into a heat-safe bowl, and let it cool to room temperature.
In a separate bowl, stir together the almond flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt.
Mix in the egg whites, honey, almond extract, and browned butter.
Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups (a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here). Top each cake with a fresh berry or two (or a dollop of jam).
Bake the cakes for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown around the edge and firm to the touch in the middle.
Remove the cakes from the oven, and cool them in the pan for 5 minutes before turning them out onto a rack to cool completely.
Repeat with the remaining batter.

Description: 
Also known as financiers or friands, these almond-scented, bite-sized cakes are a perfect treat for a mid-morning or afternoon snack. They're prettiest when filled with fresh berries; but if looks aren't important, a teaspoonful of jam works quite well, also.
