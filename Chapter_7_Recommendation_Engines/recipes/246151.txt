Ingredients:
1 teaspoon salt
4 broccolini stalks, bottoms trimmed
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups baby greens mix (such as spinach, chard, kale, and arugula)
2 teaspoons lemon vinaigrette, or to taste
coarse sea salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat and add broccolini stalks; simmer until broccolini turns bright green, about 1 minute. Transfer broccolini to a bowl of ice water; drain when cool. Chop broccolini into 1-inch pieces.
Return pot to stove; heat olive oil and red pepper flakes over medium heat. Add broccolini; cook until warmed through. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant but not brown, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove pot from heat.
Stir baby greens, vinaigrette, and sea salt into broccolini mixture; toss just until greens are warmed through but not wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
