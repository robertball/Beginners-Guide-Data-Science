Ingredients:
6 egg yolks
1 cup white sugar, divided
1 pound mascarpone cheese
6 egg whites, stiffly beaten
1/4 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons kirschwasser
1 1/4 cups strong brewed coffee, cold
25 ladyfingers
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar.  Using a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and kirschwasser; stir until smooth.  Set aside.
Dissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee.  Quickly, to avoid complete saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture.  Place ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish.  Spread a layer of cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese mixture.
Cover and refrigerate for several hours.  Sprinkle with cocoa just before serving.
