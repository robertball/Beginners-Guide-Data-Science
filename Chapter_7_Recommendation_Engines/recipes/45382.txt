Preheat the oven broiler. Place the roast in a roasting pan, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with thyme leaves, and season with salt and pepper. Place under the broiler for 10 minutes, until lightly browned in several places.

Description: 
This is the traditional New Year's Day meal I learned from my husband, whose family originated in central Pennsylvania. It's wonderful, especially served with mashed potatoes and applesauce.
