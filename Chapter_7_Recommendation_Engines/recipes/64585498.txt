Fresh Corn Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6 ears of corn OR 1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn, thawed and drained
1 green or red bell pepper, chopped
1 bunch green onions, sliced
2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped
2 tablespoons garlic vinegar
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Husk the corn and remove the silk. In a large pot of boiling SUGARED water, cook corn for 1-2 minutes. Really, this short amount of time is perfect - you just want to heat the kernels. Place the corn in a bowl of ice water and let stand 3-4 minutes.
Cut the corn off the cob using a sharp knife. I like to stand the cobs on end in the center of a bundt pan. The kernels will fall into the pan and make less of a mess.
Combine the corn kernels in a large bowl with the green pepper, onions, and tomatoes.
In a small bowl combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, basil, garlic vinegar, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and stir to combine.
Pour this dressing over the corn mixture and toss gently to coat. Chill for 1-2 hours or overnight before serving.

Description: 
A wonderful summer salad--we enjoyed it at a family gathering, brought the recipe home and have made this a family favorite. It's best made with fresh corn, but can also be made with frozen. Just thaw and add to salad without cooking first.
