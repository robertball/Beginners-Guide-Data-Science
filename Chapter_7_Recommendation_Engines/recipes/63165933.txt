Description: 
Ground beef tacos and taco salads are nicely enhanced by the mixture that Sue Gronholz uses in place of store-bought taco seasoning. 'It's so easy to mix up a batch and keep it in the pantry,' writes the Beaver Dam, Wisconsin cook. 'It's convenient and saves money, too.'Modified from: Seasoning For Tacos
