Directions:
Warm beer over a low flame in a large saucepan. Add browning,molassas, sugar,jam or perserves,honey, and margarine. Stir until dissolved.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together all the dry ingredients, than add the dried fruit.  Add the stout mix to the dry ingredients & stir.  Pour into greased bread loaf pans. Bake at 350 for about 1 hour. Excellent with a slice of processed cheese on top.
