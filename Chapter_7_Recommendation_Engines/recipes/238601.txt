Description: 
When you want to wake-up an appetizer, main dish, or side dish that is a Mexican dish, this takes food to another level that your tired old sour cream just can't do. Great as a dipping sauce or to top any Mexican dish such as fish tacos, burritos, nachos, enchilada pie, etc. Anytime you'd ordinarily use sour cream or whenever you want a more gourmet topping or dip, this is fast and easy and a crowd pleaser.
