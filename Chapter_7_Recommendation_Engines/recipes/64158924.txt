Description: 
I came up with this festive and flavorful side dish one day when I needed a side dish to take to a barbeque and realized that I needed to use some fresh vegetables I had on hand. I added the bell pepper just to use the one I had, I think the salad would be just as tasty without it. Maybe add some pecans for an extra crunch.
