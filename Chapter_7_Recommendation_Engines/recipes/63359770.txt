Ingredients:
6 links hot Italian sausage
5 links andouille sausage
1 each red, yellow and orange peppers, diced
3 stalks celery, sliced
1 onion, minced
1 yellow squash, diced
1 zucchini, diced
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 can Great Northern White beans
1 bottle Spicy V8 juice (1 qt, 14 oz)
1 box Kitchen Secrets (32 oz) chicken stock
2 cans tomato paste (6 oz)
2 Tb minced garlic
1 Tb Oregano
1 Tb Basil
1 Tb Garlic Pepper
2 Tb Olive Oil

Directions:
Remove Italian sausage from casings and brown with the onion and garlic in a frying pan, adding andouille sausage towards the end to brown.  While the sausage browns, saute the remaining vegetables in a stock pot with the olive oil until crisp tender.  Add the sausage to the vegetables, and add the white beans (undrained) and the black beans (drained).  Then add the V8 juice and the broth.  Bring to a boil and then lower to a simmer.  Add the tomato paste and stir (one or two cans depending on how thick you want it).  Finally add oregano, basil and garlic pepper to taste.  Allow to simmer for an additional 15 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
