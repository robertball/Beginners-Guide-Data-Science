Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups self-rising flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
1 cup water
2 eggs
1/4 cup vanilla Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift flour, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl. Mix sugar, water, eggs, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract together in another bowl using an electric mixer.
Gradually add the flour-cocoa mixture into the bowl with the yogurt mixture. Mix until well blended. Pour batter into two 9-inch cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
