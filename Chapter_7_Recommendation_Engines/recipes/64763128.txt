Ingredients:
For the filling:
Frylight Cooking Spray
1 onion, chopped
200g Chestnut mushrooms, sliced
1 garlic clove, crushed
200g baby spinach, wilted
50g butter
50g plain flour
500ml milk
200g cheddar cheese, grated
50g parmesan
Â½ teaspoon nutmeg

Directions:
1. Gently heat the butter in a pan until melted and stir in the flour.  Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly until you have a smooth thickened sauce.  Add half of the grated cheese and stir through.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
2. Spray a large frying pan with Frylight and place over a medium heat.  Wait until Frylight is clear and then add onion and mushrooms.  Cook for 5-10 minutes until starting to brown, add garlic and cook for a further few minutes.
3. Ensure the spinach has been squeezed of excess water and add to the pan.  Mix to combine.
4. Pour sauce into the spinach mixture, add nutmeg and stir together.
Fill each pancake with a spoonful of filling and roll up.  Place into a baking dish and pour over any remaining sauce.  Sprinkle over the remaining cheese and the grated parmesan.  Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes until bubbling and lightly brown on top.
