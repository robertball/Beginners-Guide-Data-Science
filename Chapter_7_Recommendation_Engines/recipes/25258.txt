Ingredients:
1 medium head cabbage, cut into small wedges
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2/3 cup shredded American cheese
1/2 cup crushed buttery round crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook cabbage in boiling water until barely tender, about 10 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Blend in flour, milk, and salt. Cook and stir until slightly thickened, and then fold in cheese.
Transfer cabbage to prepared casserole dish, and stir in cheese sauce. Sprinkle cracker crumbs on top.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until top is browned.
