Ingredients:
¼ rennet tablet or ¼ teaspoon liquid rennet
¼ cup unchlorinated water
½ gallon whole pasteurized milk
2 tablespoons kosher salt

Directions:
Dissolve the rennet in the water. Set aside.
In a heavy pot, slowly heat the milk to 90 degrees F (32 degrees C), stirring occasionally.
Turn off the heat and gently stir in the rennet solution. Cover the pot and let it rest in a warm place, about 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) for 40 minutes, until the curd forms a thick mass. Check for a “clean break” by placing your finger or spatula in the curd and gently lifting. It should split along a clean line (not be too soft or milky). If it isn’t quite firm, cover the pot and let it sit for another 10 minutes.
Using your finger, a knife, or the spatula, cut the curds into ¼-inch cubes. Heat the curds and whey to 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 46 degrees C), over 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Ladle the curds into a colander; discard the whey or keep for another use. Using your fingers, gently mix in the salt to combine.
Transfer the curds to a form or mold with holes, lined with cheesecloth (a colander or plastic container works well). Place a heavy weight on top, such as a small bowl filled with pie weights or a jar of water. Press for 4 to 6 hours.
The cheese is ready to eat or can refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.
