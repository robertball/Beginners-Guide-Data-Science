1 apple, sliced
1 pear, sliced
1 cinnamon stick
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg

1/2 cup raw, unsalted cashews
3 tablespoons maple syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla
Water

Place apricots, prunes, apple, pear, cinnamon, nutmeg, and juice in a medium-size pan; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 20-30 minutes, until all the fruit is soft.
Remove cinnamon stick.
Grind nuts to a fine meal in a small grinder.
Put ground cashews, maple syrup, and vanilla in the blender. With blender running, add water a little at a time until the consistency is thick and creamy.
Put compote in individual serving bowls and top with nut cream.
