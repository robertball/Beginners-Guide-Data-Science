Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 cup chopped mushrooms
5 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 eggs, beaten
2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
5 slices multigrain bread, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
8 leaves fresh basil, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine beef, pork, onion, mushrooms, and garlic in a large bowl. Sprinkle parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper over the mixture; mix well. Pour in eggs and add tomatoes and bread; gently combine to evenly distribute all ingredients.
Lay a sheet of parchment paper on the counter. Gently press meat mixture into a 14x16-inch rectangle about 1-inch thick. Place mozzarella slices and basil leaves on top in 2 rows. Leave a 3-inch border along 1 horizontal side.
Roll meat mixture into a loaf by lifting one side of the parchment and gently folding it over itself. Press ends and seam to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatloaf is no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. Remove from oven, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
