Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
2 (16 ounce) packages vanilla frosting
1 drop red food coloring
Suggestion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart ovenproof Pyrex glass mixing bowl with shortening and dust with flour. Suggestion: This is such a fun cake. Pampered Chef's large batter bowl is the perfect size and is shaped more like a skirt than a regular bowl is. I think you might want to get the Barbie bodice cake topper (at Walmart or a bake shop); that will totally alleviate the leg issues. Also, if you cook it @ 200-250 degrees for 2hours, the cake will bake more evenly.
Prepare cake as directed on box. Pour batter into prepared bowl.
Bake 50-60 minutes or until cake tester inserted into center comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes.
Invert on cake plate with widest part of cake on the bottom. Cool 3 hours before decorating.
Insert a clean doll into center of cake. Decorate the skirt with icing tinted any color or use more than one color. Use a decorator tip to make the skirt as fancy as you like and decorate the top of the doll for the top of the dress also.
