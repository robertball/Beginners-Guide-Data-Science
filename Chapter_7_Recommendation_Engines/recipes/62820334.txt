Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
2 1/34 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 chopped walnuts
8 dried dates, chopped
6 dried apricot halves, chopped
1 large egg
1 very ripe banana, mashed
1/4 cup fat-free milk

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees; spray 8 x 4-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon; stir in the walnuts, dates, and apricots. In a small bowl, beat the egg; add the banana and milk.  Pour over the flour mixture; stir until just blended (do not overmix).
3. Transfer to the pan.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.  Cool completely on a rack.
