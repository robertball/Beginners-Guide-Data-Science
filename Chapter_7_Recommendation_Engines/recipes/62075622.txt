Ingredients:
3 cans black beans, rinsed
1 package frozen kernel corn (~4 cups)
1 Jalapeno, seeded and minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium sized red onion, diced
1 Red bell pepper, diced
2-3 Fresh Mangoes, peeled, seeded, and diced
About half a bunch of cilantro (leaves only, no stems), cleaned, drained and chopped
1 tsp ground cumin
Â¼ tsp Cayenne pepper
1 Tbsp olive oil
Juice of 1 fresh lime
Kosher salt to taste
Fresh ground pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine beans, corn, jalapeno, onion, bell pepper, mango, and cilantro in a large bowl.  In a small bowl, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, lime juice, and olive oil.  Mix well and pour over bean mixture, stir well and season with salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.  This may be eaten immediately but is best when left to sit in the refridgerator at least several hours to overnight, and keeps for about a week.

Description: 
Amazing black bean salsa recipe that was given to me by a woman at church.  Recipe has been slightly modified to suit my tastes.  More or less of any ingredient may be added to taste.  Kick up the spice by adding more jalapeno and/or cayenne pepper.  This salsa is great as an appetizer with tortilla chips or served over chicken or fish.  This makes a party size recipe, so make sure you use a LARGE bowl!  Lots of prep with the veggies but worth it!
