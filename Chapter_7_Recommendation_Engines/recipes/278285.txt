1 (14.75 ounce) can pink salmon, drained
1/4 cup chopped onion
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 large egg
3 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon lite salt, or more to taste
1 (10 ounce) package pretzels
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mix salmon, onion, flour, egg, pepper, and salt together in a bowl.
Crush pretzels in a plastic bag and place into another bowl. Form patties from salmon mixture and coat with crushed pretzels.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot oil until browned on both sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Place on paper towels to absorb extra oil, if any. Serve.
