Ingredients:
10 pounds red potatoes
2 cups chopped celery
2 cups chopped red onion
6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 cup sliced black olives
1 cup sliced green olives with pimentos
1 cup dill pickle relish
1/2 cup sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/4 cup prepared mustard, or as needed
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, or as needed
1/2 cup mayonnaise, or as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool.
Remove skins from potatoes and cut into chunks. Place in a large bowl.
Lightly stir celery, red onion, eggs, black olives, green olives, dill pickle relish, sweet pickle relish, and paprika with potatoes until thoroughly combined.
Mix in mustard, vinegar, and mayonnaise; stir lightly until all ingredients are coated and moist. If salad isn't moist enough, stir up to 1/2 cup more mayonnaise into salad.
Season with salt and ground black pepper to taste. For best flavor, make the day before and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This is my mother's recipe and is a combination of my two grandmothers' potato salad recipes.  It leans a little to the Irish side.  My mother's maiden name is McClain and her mother's maiden name is McBee. I like to make this the night before so the flavors will blend.
