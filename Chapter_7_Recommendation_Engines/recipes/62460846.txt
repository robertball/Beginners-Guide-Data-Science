Ingredients:
Pancakes:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tbsp sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg
1 cup milk
1 tbsp melted butter
1 tsp vanilla
2 ripe bananas, mashed
2/3 cup mini chocolate chips
Pineapple Syrup:
1 20 ounce can pineapple chunks, drained and juice reserved
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp butter
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla
Whipped cream for garnish, if desired

Directions:
1.  Make the pancakes.  Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in small bowl.  In a large bowl, combine egg, milk, butter, vanilla, and bananas.
2.  Stir flour mixture into milk mixture until just combined.  Batter will be somewhat lumpy.  Stir in chocolate chips.
3.  Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.  Pour batter onto griddle, using about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.  Cook until edges look set and bubbles appear on top of pancakes.  Flip and cook until golden.  Keep pancakes warm in low oven while making syrup.
4.  For the pineapple syrup:  In a small bowl, stir together 3 tbsp pineapple juice with cornstarch until smooth.  Set aside.
5.  In a small saucepan, melt butter.  Add pineapple chunks, remaining pineapple juice, and brown sugar.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes.
6.  Add cornstarch mixture to the saucepan.  Stir and simmer for one minute.  Remove from heat and add vanilla and maple syrup.
7.  Serve hot pancakes, topped with pineapple syrup, immediately.  Garnish with whipped cream if desired.
