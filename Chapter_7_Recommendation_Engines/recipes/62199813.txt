1 egg, well beaten
1 1/2 c confectioner's sugar

1 tsp almond extract

Roll chilled dough into large marble-sized balls. Put on ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake at 375 for 6-8 minutes. Do not brown. Cool before glazing.
Glaze:
Moisten some confectioners' sugar with just enough cherry juice to form thick glaze. Add 2 drop of almond extract for flavoring. Glaze cookies. Makes about 5 dozen small cookies.
