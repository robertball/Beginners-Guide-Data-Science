Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound bulk turkey sausage
2 cups baking mix
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Combine turkey sausage, baking mix, and shredded Cheddar cheese in a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. Roll mixture into approximately 30 quarter-sized balls and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until golden brown and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
