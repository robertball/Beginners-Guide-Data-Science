Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pheasants, rinsed, patted dry, and cut into pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, sliced into rings
1 cup sliced crimini mushrooms
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 cup white wine
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup sliced black olives

Directions:
Place the flour, salt, and pepper into a resealable plastic bag; shake to mix. Place the pheasant pieces into the flour mixture, and shake until evenly coated.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Shake any excess flour off of the pheasant pieces, and place them in the hot oil. Cook until the pheasant is brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Place the pheasant into a slow cooker, reserving the oil in the skillet. Cook the onion in the remaining oil until they soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and garlic, and continue cooking and stirring until the mushrooms have softened and the garlic has mellowed, about 5 minutes more.
Pour the wine into the skillet and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then pour in the chicken broth and return to a boil. Pour the mushroom mixture into the slow cooker, and sprinkle with sliced black olives.
Cover, and cook on High for 4 hours, or Low for 7 hours.
