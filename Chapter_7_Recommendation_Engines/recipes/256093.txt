Ingredients:
2 cups frozen precooked rice (such as InnovAsianÂ®)
24 pitted green olives, roughly chopped
3/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 orange, juiced
1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound cod, cut into 4 pieces
4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 thin slices orange
2 tablespoons chopped toasted almonds
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut four 12x15-inch sheets of parchment paper. Fold each in half widthwise and reopen.
Mix rice, green olives, chicken broth, orange juice, orange zest, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Spoon 3/4 cup of the rice mixture onto 1 side of each parchment rectangle, near the crease. Lay 1 piece of cod on top. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over fish; lay 1 orange slice on top.
Fold empty half of parchment over cod and rice mixture; crimp edges together with overlapping folds to seal. Arrange packets close together on a sheet pan.
Roast on the center rack of the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 17 minutes. Unfold 1 edge of the parchment, being careful to avoid steam, and look inside to check doneness.
Open packets carefully, being careful to avoid steam. Slide cod and rice mixture into bowls. Garnish with almonds and parsley.
