Ingredients:
6 cups shredded green cabbage
1 1/2 cups shredded carrot
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1/2 cup shredded onion
1/4 cup kosher salt
1 cup cider vinegar
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon celery seed
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1/4 cup vegetable oil
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Toss green cabbage, carrot, red cabbage, and onion in a colander and sprinkle with kosher salt. Set aside to drip for 30 minutes.
Heat cider vinegar, sugar, celery seed, and dry mustard together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool.
Squeeze as much juice as possible from cabbage mixture and transfer vegetables to a serving bowl. Pour vinegar mixture to taste over vegetables and drizzle vegetable oil over the top. Sprinkle with black pepper and stir coleslaw to coat with dressing. Refrigerate 2 hours before serving for flavors to blend.

Description: 
This cole slaw has a vinaigrette-style dressing instead of a traditional creamy dressing. It would be good for picnics or where a salad needs to sit out. If you like vinegar-based dressings, this one can be addictive.
