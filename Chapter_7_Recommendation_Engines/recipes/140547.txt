4 large baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 (15 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained
1 teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste
1/2 cup hot milk
1/4 cup softened butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, puree the artichokes and garlic with the milk until smooth.
Place drained potatoes in a mixing bowl and mash with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in softened butter and artichoke puree until the butter has melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
