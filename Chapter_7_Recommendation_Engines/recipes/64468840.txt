Ingredients:
1 cup daisies, hand picked
1 robin's egg, fresh from the nest
1/2 teaspoon of acid (the strong kind)
A handful of cow chips
3 or 4 paper margins (margins only!)
1 cup Dinomite powder

Directions:
1. Mix daisies and robin egg until well blended. Make sure you do this over a cliff so that the air fluffens the fluffy bites
2. Throw in the cow chips as if they insulted you and your family. This is also a good time to yodel and alert the Dinomites to your presence so they will meet you at the bottom
3. Scale down the cliff as you vigorously sprinkle the acid upon your mixture. If you're doing this correctly, the acid should be melting your skin as the sprinkles land on it
4. Now that you've reached the bottom of the cliff, with your acid ridden hands, line a 3x4 pan with the paper margins and then pour your mixture on top
5. At this point, the Dinomites should have arrived and will give you their powder (you know the kind). Sprinkle this on top
6. Give the Dinomites the pan. After 10-11 minutes they should return and you will have wonderful, sweet, fluffy Dinobites
