Description: 
This was probably one of the most delicious roast chickens I have ever tried.  Golden brown on the outside and moist and delicious within.  The vegetables (after having soaked up the juice from the chicken) were insanely devine.  Serve with a nice tossed green salad and some soft dinner rolls.
