Description: 
I stumbled on this when I had an excess of pineapple and peaches. The resulting jam tasted a lot like duck sauce when warm, and it makes an excellent condiment to savory meals and accompanies chicken nicely. Cold, it's also a delicious jam. Creates about 8 to 10 half-pint jars, depending on the size of your peaches and pineapple.
