Ingredients:
1 gallon cold water
2 quarts apple juice
2 quarts orange juice
3 cups kosher or coarse salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
10 whole cloves
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Pour apple and orange juice into a large pot over a medium heat. Add salt, brown sugar, cloves and nutmeg. Simmer for 15 minutes until salt and sugar are completely dissolved. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Add cold water.
Place poultry in a large plastic container. Pour brine over top. Brine poultry for 1 hour per pound in ice chests full of ice and plastic bag for brining turkey.
Thoroughly rinse all the brine from the turkey before cooking. Otherwise there will be a salty flavor to the turkey.
