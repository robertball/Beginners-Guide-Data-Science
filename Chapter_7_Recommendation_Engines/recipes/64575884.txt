Ingredients:
8 oz of Sharp Cheddar Cheese (shredded)
4 tablespoons of butter , cut into cubes
1 cup of flour (I used All purpose, but you can use and kind you like)
3/4 teaspoons Salt
2 tablespoons of cold water

Directions:
1-pluse the cheese, butter, flour, and the salt together until the dough is like course sand.
2- Combine in water 1 tablespoon at a time.
3- remove the dough from the processer, wrap in plastic wrap and set in fridge for 20 minutes.
4- Roll out the dough and cut into desired shapes. If you choose to use a fish cut out you may use a tooth pick to make faces. Then place the cut out dough onto a non-stick cookie sheet or a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
5- Bake at 350 degrees F for about 15-16 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
6-Makes approximately 5-6 dozen crackers. (depending on the cut outs you choose)
