Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups water
4 teaspoons chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
6 small potatoes, diced
4  carrots, sliced
6  large bok choy ribs with leaves, finely chopped
2 stalks celery, sliced
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2-inch cubes

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add water, chicken base, potatoes, carrots, bok choy, and celery; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken; continue simmering until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
I bought bok choy with no idea how to use it. Threw it in a simple chicken and veggie soup, and the family loved it! 4 cans low-sodium chicken broth can be substituted for the 6 cups water and chicken base.
