Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (15 ounce) can canned pumpkin
1/3 cup water
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans.
Stir the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl. Whisk together the pumpkin, water, eggs, vanilla, and vegetable oil together in a separate bowl. Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry while whisking until everything is well mixed. Fold the walnuts into the batter. Divide the batter between the two prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden and springs back when lightly pressed, 50 to 60 minutes. Allow to cool 20 minutes before removing from the pans.
