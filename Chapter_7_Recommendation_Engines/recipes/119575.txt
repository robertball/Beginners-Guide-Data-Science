Ingredients:
3 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed
1 3/4 cups reduced-fat biscuit/baking mix
1/2 cup fat-free milk
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary

Directions:
In a large bowl, cut cream cheese into biscuit mix until crumbly. Stir in milk and rosemary just until moistened. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; knead 10 times. Roll out into a 6-in. square. Cut into for 3-in. squares; cut each square diagonally in half. Place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
