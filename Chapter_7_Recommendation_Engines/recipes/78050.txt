Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into cubes
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Place bacon slices in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until crisp. Remove bacon, crumble and set aside. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings.
Add mushrooms, onion and garlic to the bacon drippings, and cook over medium heat, stirring, until tender and most of the liquid has evaporated.
Sprinkle the flour, salt, and pepper over the top, and stir to blend. Mix in cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. Reduce heat to low, and stir until cream cheese is melted. Remove from heat. Stir in the sour cream and bacon. Serve warm.

Description: 
This delicious dip is always best when it's served really warm -- works well with breadsticks and assorted crackers.  I make it during the holidays when JOY is in the air and romance is always in style.
