Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 bunch asparagus, ends trimmed and stalks cut into small pieces
4 medium leeks, sliced, white parts only and thoroughly washed
2 medium red potatoes, peeled and diced
1 large shallot, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, freshly minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups warm water
1 (14.5 ounce) can low-sodium chicken stock
1 cube chicken bouillon
4 tablespoons sour cream, or as desired
1 pinch paprika, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add asparagus, leeks, potatoes, shallot, and garlic. Cook and stir until potatoes are soft but not mushy, about 5 minutes.
Add flour to the pot with the vegetables and stir until thoroughly coated, making sure not to burn them. Add warm water, chicken stock, and bouillon cube. Bring soup to a simmer and cook for 20 to 25 minutes.
Carefully transfer hot soup to a food processor and blend to desired consistency. Ladle soups into bowls and garnish with sour cream, paprika, and pepper.

Description: 
This was just a creation I came up with when my asparagus was looking a little old. At first, I thought I was going to add some sort of cream base, but the soup ended up not needing it. The vegetables just taste lovely as they are. Even my husband who hates soup and asparagus LOVED this!  It is also a great way to use almost-expired vegetables in your veggie drawer!
