Ingredients:
½ cup soy sauce
¼ cup packed light brown sugar
2 tablespoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon white pepper
5 cups Chinese cabbage (Napa), shredded using food processor
1 cup green cabbage, shredded using food processor
1 cup red cabbage, shredded using food processor
2 large carrot, peeled and shredded using food processor
6 scallions, chopped
4 cups cooked chicken shredded using food processor
24 egg roll wrappers
1 egg, lightly beaten
Oil for frying

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic powder, and white pepper; mix well.
In a large bowl, combine cabbages, carrot, scallions, and chicken; mix well. Pour soy sauce mixture over cabbage mixture; toss to coat well and let stand 10 minutes. Place cabbage mixture in a colander and squeeze to drain well.
Spoon about 1/2 cup cabbage mixture evenly onto center of each egg roll wrapper. Lightly brush edges of egg roll with beaten egg. Fold one corner of each egg roll wrapper up over cabbage mixture then fold both sides over, envelope fashion; roll up tightly.
Fry egg rolls in batches for 6 to 8 minutes (turn occasionally) or until golden. Drain on a paper towel-lined platter.
