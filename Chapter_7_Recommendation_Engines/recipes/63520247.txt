Ingredients:
2 sticks butter, softened
1 whole lemon, zested and halved
1 clove garlic, finely minced
salt and pepper, to taste
4 T-Bone, rib-eye, sirloin, or new york strip steaks

Directions:
Well in advance of dinner, make the butter. Place the softened butter in a bowl and whip until it is fluffy. Add the lemon zest and the juice of half the lemon. Mix it until it is combined. Add the garlic and salt and pepper.
Lay a long piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Place about ½ of the butter mixture in the shape of a log, similar to a stick of butter. Carefully wrap the butter very tightly in the plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining butter.
Put the butter into the fridge so it will harden. Or, freeze it if you won’t be using it right away.
Steak- Season with salt & pepper. Grill to desired temperature.
