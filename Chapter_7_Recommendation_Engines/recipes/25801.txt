3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

In a large bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla.

Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.  Unwrap the roll of dough and using a sharp knife, slice the roll into 1/4 inch coins. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
