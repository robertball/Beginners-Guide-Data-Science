Ingredients:
1/4 cup fish sauce
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds extra large shrimp, peeled and de-veined
3 scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Combine fish sauce, dark brown sugar, crushed red pepper flakes and water in a bowl and whisk until brown sugar is dissolved.
Heat vegetable oil in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook a few minutes more. Do not brown.
Turn heat up to medium-high and add shrimp. Cook, stirring frequently, until shrimp are just barely pink and still translucent in spots, a few minutes. Add fish sauce mixture, turn heat down to medium, and simmer until shrimp are cooked through, a few minutes more. (Note: the sauce will be thin.) Off the heat, stir in scallions and cilantro. Serve immediately.
