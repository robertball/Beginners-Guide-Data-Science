1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup lowfat buttermilk
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and soda. Combine eggs, buttermilk, honey, and oil; add slowly to the dry ingredients. Mix until blended. Pour into non-stick muffin cups, making them about two-thirds full.
Bake until golden, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the muffins from the pan and cool completely.
