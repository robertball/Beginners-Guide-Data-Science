Ingredients:
(Cusa Authir
Vegetarian Style Stuffed Squash)
Traditionally, this is made with light skinned green squash but since this only available at farm stands in the summer, you can use regular zucchini or yellow squash.
6 medium cusa (Be sure they are at room temperature so they won’t crack when coring them. This is done with a munarah (a long corer). If you don't have one, you can use an apple corer which is about half the length.  In that case, you may have to cut the zucchini in half so you can reach to the bottom. Save the corings to put in the bottom of the pan.)
1 ½ cups chopped parsley
½ - 3/4 cup chopped scallions (onions may be substituted)
½ -3/4  cups fresh chopped mint or 1 heaping Tb. dried mint
1 can garbanzo beans - drain liquid from can and rinse
1 c. washed uncooked rice
½  tsp. pepper
½ -1 tsp. allspice
1/8 tsp. cinnamon
¼ cup olive  oil
juice of 1 lemon
1 small can tomato sauce (15 Oz.) or 1 can crushed tomatoes
potato "plugs"

Directions:
In a bowl, mix parsley, scallions, mint,  garbanzo beans, rice, seasonings, and half of the tomato. Adjust seasonings. Core cusa and stuff firmly. Block the end with a piece of potato so the stuffing won’t come out. Put corings, 1 tsp. dried mint or some fresh mint in the bottom of a pan. Place the stuffed cusas upright on top of the corings and pour on the rest of the tomato sauce. Put in enough water to barely cover the top of the cusas. Cook on medium-high heat for about 45 minutes. Extra potato may be cooked along with it.
