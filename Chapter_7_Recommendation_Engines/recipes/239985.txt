Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
3 tablespoons ketchup
3 tablespoons garlic powder
3 tablespoons dried dill
2 tablespoons finely chopped dill pickles
2 teaspoons mustard

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine ground beef, ketchup, garlic powder, dill, pickles, and mustard in a bowl using your hands; form into patties.
Grill patties on the preheated grill until desired doneness is reached, 7 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
