Ingredients:
Pork:
4 cups water
4 cups fresh orange juice
1/2 cup coarsely chopped jalape単o pepper (about 2 peppers)
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 1/2 tablespoons fine sea salt
4 (8-ounce) bone-in center-cut heritage pork chops (such as Berkshire)
2 slices bacon
1/2 cup finely diced onion
1/4 cup finely diced apple
1/4 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup finely chopped peeled butternut squash
1/4 cup finely chopped Swiss chard
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
Sauce:
1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1 teaspoon minced jalape単o pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fat-free, less-sodium beef broth
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup no-salt-added canned whole tomatoes, coarsely chopped
Grits:
2 1/2 cups water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup stone-ground grits
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons fat-free, less-sodium beef broth

Directions:
To prepare pork, combine first 5 ingredients in an airtight container, stirring until sugar dissolves. Add pork; seal and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. Remove pork from brine; pat dry. Discard brine.
Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan; crumble. Add 1/2 cup onion and next 5 ingredients (through 1 minced garlic clove) to drippings in pan; cook 8 minutes or until squash is tender and liquid evaporates, stirring frequently. Stir in bacon.
Cut 1 (1-inch) horizontal slit through thickest portion of each pork chop to form a pocket. Stuff about 3 tablespoons vegetable mixture into each chop. Sprinkle both sides of chops evenly with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Add pork to pan; cook 3 minutes on each side or until browned. Remove pork from pan; reduce heat to medium-low.
To prepare sauce, add 1 1/2 cups onion to pan; cook 4 minutes or until browned, stirring frequently. Add celery, jalape単o, and 1 garlic clove to pan; cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in flour; cook 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup broth and 1/2 cup water, stirring until flour dissolves. Add tomatoes; increase heat to medium-high. Return pork to pan; simmer 10 minutes or until desired degree of doneness.
To prepare grits, bring 2 1/2 cups water and 1/8 teaspoon salt to boil in a saucepan. Slowly add grits, stirring constantly. Reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently. Remove from heat; stir in butter and 2 tablespoons broth. Serve with pork and sauce
