Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups crispy rice cereal
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the rice cereal, oats, and raisins. Set aside. Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine the brown sugar and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat just until boiling, then remove from heat and stir in peanut butter and vanilla until smooth. Pour over the cereal and oat mixture, and mix well.
Press into the prepared pan using the back of a large spoon. Allow to cool, then cut into squares.

Description: 
This is a quick granola snack recipe that my sister-in-law gave to me one snow day when the kids were home.  She told me the kids would eat the batch in a day and she was sure right!  I tend to double the recipe so I am not making it every day!
