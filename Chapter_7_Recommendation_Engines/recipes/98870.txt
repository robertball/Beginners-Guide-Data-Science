Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, cut into medium dice
1 celery stalk, cut into small dice
1 large carrot, cut into small dice
1/2 cup uncooked long grain rice
1 tablespoon dried basil leaves
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
4 cups chicken broth
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pound shucked small bay scallops
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven or small soup kettle over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, and carrot; saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice and basil and cook, stirring until rice is evenly coated in oil, 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in undrained tomatoes. Add chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Simmer until rice is almost tender, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, rinse the scallops. Stir scallops and lemon juice into the soup and simmer until scallops are opaque, about 8 to 10 minutes longer.
