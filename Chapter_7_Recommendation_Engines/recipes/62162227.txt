Ingredients:
3 cups of cooked pumpkin pulp, mashed (can be roasted or steamed; of steamed, save water)
1 can coconut cream
water
1 Tbs salt
2 tsp ground ginger
1 tsp chilli powder (or 1 whole chilli)
1 sprig fresh thyme
water
sour cream
nutmeg

Directions:
Cook pumpkin by preferred method.  Roasting adds more flavor/depth, while steaming gives you 'stock' and is quicker.  Mash pulp.
In soup pot, combine pumpkin, coconut cream and enough water to make a thick soup consistency. (Remember, you can always add more liquid later).
Add ginger, chilli and thyme.  Let simmer for 30 - 45 minutes.
Remove thyme and whole chilli if used.
Blend with a hand mixer to achieve a creamy consistency.  More liquid can be added at this point, as desired.
To serve, ladle soup into bowls and top with a dollup of sour cream and a dusting of (preferable freshly) grated nutmeg.

Description: 
Until we moved to New Zealand a few years ago, where the style of Pumpkin Soup is comeplety different, I didn't realize how special my West Indian version of this was.  It's a rich and creamy pumpkin soup with a hint of spice and a bit of heat
