Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow or white cake mix
1 cup boiling water
1 pkg. (4 serving size) JELL-O Brand Lime Flavor Gelatin
1/2 cup cold water
2 (1 ounce) squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, melted
2 cups thawed COOL WHIP Whipped Topping
1 red chewy fruit snack roll
1 green chewy fruit snack roll
4 pretzel sticks
1 JET-PUFFED Miniature Marshmallow, cut into quarters

Directions:
Prepare and bake cake mix in 13x9-inch baking pan as directed on package. Cool completely. Invert cake onto large platter; remove pan. Using small sharp knife, cut and scoop out a shallow free form "golf course" from center of cake. Reserve removed cake for another use.
Stir boiling water into dry gelatin in medium bowl until completely dissolved. Stir in cold water. Refrigerate about 1 hour until slightly thickened (the consistency of unbeaten egg whites). Pour thickened gelatin into center of cake. Refrigerate 3 hours or until set.
Stir slightly cooled melted chocolate into whipped topping until well blended. Frost borders and side of cake with whipped topping mixture. Cut out small triangle from the red fruit roll. Attach to pretzel stick. Place in center to resemble flag. Using sharp small knife, cut green fruit roll into strips and attach to remaining pretzel sticks to form trees. Use some of the darker reserved crumbs to make sand traps. Roll marshmallow quarter into ball and place near flag for the golf ball. Store any leftover cake in refrigerator.
