Ingredients:
A few tbsp olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 dried bay leaf
2 tsp cumin
1 tsp curry powder
1 tsp turmeric
¼ tsp ground coriander
4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
3 cups water
1 cup canned tomatoes, chopped with juice
6 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
2 tsp Spike seasoning
1 pkg frozen, cut spinach or 1/2 lb. fresh spinach or chard

Directions:
1. Saute onions with the bay leaf in the olive oil until tender. Then add the cumin, curry powder, turmeric, coriander and sauté for another minute or two. Stir constantly to keep spices from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan.
2. Add the rest of ingredients, except frozen spinach, and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, until potatoes are mostly cooked through.
3. Add the frozen or fresh spinach and stir into the soup until fully blended, mashing some of the potatoes on the side of the soup pot to make the soup thicker. Cook another 10 minutes or until potatoes are well done.
(Variation: Add a can of chick peas or some cooked chicken during the final phase of cooking)
