Ingredients:
DRY:
1/2 cup wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose white flour
2/3 cup light brown sugar
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded carrots
1/2 cup chopped nuts
WET:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup yogurt (or any liquid dairy or dairy substitute)
2 eggs
TOPPING:
1 tablespoon wheat germ
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven 400 degree Fahrenheit.
Combine flour, sugar, wheat germ, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl.
Grate carrot.
Add grated carrot and 1/2 cup nuts to dry mixture and combine well.
In a separate small bowl mix oil, yogurt and eggs until smooth and uniform consistency.  (Lumps will go away).
In a separate smaller bowl or cup mix wheat germ, brown sugar and cinnamon.
Pour wet mixture into dry mixture.
Gently fold until just moistened (don't stir too much!  You will have nice light fluffy muffins if your muffin batter is just moist or foamy).
Line muffin pan with paper cups or grease muffin pan.
Fill 9 cups in the muffin pan with batter to the top.
Sprinkle each muffin with 1/2 teaspoon topping.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until tooth pick inserted near middle comes out clean.
