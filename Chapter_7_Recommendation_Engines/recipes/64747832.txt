Ingredients:
Filling:
4 Gala apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/16" slices
2 cups frozen wild blueberries
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 tbsp corn starch
Juice from 1 lemon
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp kosher salt
Topping:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 cup apple beer

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9 or 10" cast iron skillet.
2. Mix together apple slices, blueberries, maple syrup, corn starch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Toss to thoroughly combine. Pour into prepared cast iron skillet.
3. In a large bowl, stir together melted butter, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Add in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and stir until crumbly. Pour in apple beer and stir until just combined. Place dollops of batter over the apple-berry mixture. Bake in preheated oven until biscuits are cooked through, and fruit is bubbly, about 45 minutes.
Note: It may be helpful to place a cookie sheet beneath the cast iron skillet in the oven to prevent any spills caused by the berries bubbling over.

Description: 
This recipe was inspired by camping trips I used to take with my family when I was younger. Originally, this cobbler was made using huckleberries, and baked over a campfire; but since I no longer live in an area where I can get huckleberries, and don't have a constant campfire going, I substituted frozen wild blueberries and baked it in the oven instead. I also use a homemade apple beer in the batter, but use whatever fruity beer you like--or even a hard apple cider would work too.
