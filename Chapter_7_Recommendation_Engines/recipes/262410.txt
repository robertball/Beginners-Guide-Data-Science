Ingredients:
1/2 cup Shamrock FarmsÂ® Premium Sour Cream
2 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 1/2 cups cake flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Whisk eggs with sugar and vanilla until fluffy. Add in Shamrock Farms Premium Sour Cream and whisk briefly. Add in flour, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk briefly. Pour in milk slowly, whisking until incorporated. Batter may be lumpy. Add up to 1/4 cup milk if it is too thick. It should be a thick batter, not watery or soupy, but should definitely be sticky and pourable.
Pour 1/8 of the batter into a waffle iron and cook to desired darkness. Repeat with remaining batter. Once the steam dissipates, the waffles are cooked.

Description: 
These sour cream waffles are extra fluffy thanks to cake flour, which makes for fluffier waffles than AP flour. Serve topped with a dollop of sour cream, maple syrup, and fresh berries. Recipe created by Joanie Simon.
