Ingredients:
3 C. Whole Milk
3 T. Flour
4 T. Butter
4 T. Salt
1 T. Black Pepper
3 T. White Pepper

Directions:
melt the butter in a pot over low heat. Once melted add the flour, mix in the pot with a whisk. Slowly add the milk and both the white pepper and the black pepper and the salt. Continue to whisk to keep from sticking and to avoid clumps. Stir often with whisk until it thickens to desired consistency. Pour over buttermilk biscuits and enjoy. May add sausage to gravy but make sure it is sage sausage, works the best.
