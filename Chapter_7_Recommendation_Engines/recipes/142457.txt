Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup butter-flavored spread
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur
1 1/2 teaspoons bourbon
1/2 cup chopped almonds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Grease a cookie sheet.  Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl.  Set aside.
Cream together brown sugar, white sugar, and vegetable oil spread in a medium bowl.  Stir in sour cream, olive oil, almond extract, amaretto and bourbon, blending well after each addition.
Gradually stir flour mixture into sugar mixture until well blended.  Stir in almonds if desired.  Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheet.
Bake until just crisp around the edges, 12 to 14 minutes.

Description: 
I was pleasantly surprised when my late night sugar munchies concoction tasted fabulous. They're cake-like; barely crisp around the edges and so soft inside that the center will literally melt in your mouth. Mom called them the best cookies she'd ever tried. You should try them.
