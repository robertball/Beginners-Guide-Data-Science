Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry kidney beans
2 teaspoons salt, divided
3 1/2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon hot paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Place kidney beans in a large saucepan. Cover with water and soak for 8 hours, or overnight.
Drain water from kidney beans. Pour in fresh water to cover by 1-inch; add 1 teaspoon salt.
Cook beans over low heat for 2 hours. Remove from heat; drain excess water from pan until it just covers beans.
Stir in tomato paste, brown sugar, vinegar, cornmeal, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, hot paprika, and ginger to beans. Mix well.
Cook bean mixture over low heat for 2 hours. Stir to loosen any beans on the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook over low heat until bean mixture has reduced and thickened, about 2 hours more.
