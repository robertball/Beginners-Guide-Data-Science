Ingredients:
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 boneless pork loin chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.
Mix Dijon mustard, honey, black pepper, and garlic powder in a bowl. Arrange pork chops in prepared baking dish and pour mustard mixture over pork.
Bake in preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
