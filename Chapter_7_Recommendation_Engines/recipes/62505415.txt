Ingredients:
3 Large Eggs
1 Cup thinly sliced Baby Red Potatoes (skin on)
1/3 Cup Diced Red Onion
2 Cups Fresh Baby Spinach, steamed and squeezed dry (after steaming, you will have about 1/2 cup steamed spinach)
1/4 Cup Milk
1/2 Tbsp Butter
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large frying pan over low heat, add potatoes and saute on low for 5-7 minutes until potatoes are almost soft.
Season with salt & pepper and add onions, cook for another 2-3 minutes until onions are soft.
Drain potatoes and onions on a paper-towel lined plate, set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with milk until frothy.
Spray a 6 tin muffin pan with Non-Stick Spray, evenly divide potato and onion mixture into 4 of the 6 muffin tins.
Arrange steamed spinach on top of potatoes/onions (dividing equally).
Pour Egg/Milk mixture over top, until the tins are full.
Bake in a 350F oven for 30-35 minutes or until eggs are set.
