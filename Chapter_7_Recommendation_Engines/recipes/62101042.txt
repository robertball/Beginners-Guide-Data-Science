Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
Stir the flour, sour cream and butter together with a fork until just blended and all the butter is absorbed into the flour.  Do NOT overmix.  Batter will be slightly lumpy.
Spoon batter into lightly greased miniature muffin pan, filling to the top of each tin.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 min. or until lightly browned.
