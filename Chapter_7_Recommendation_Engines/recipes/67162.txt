Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup mandarin orange segments, drained
2 cups cranberries
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon orange extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and white sugar. Mix in the melted butter until the mixture looks crumbly. Stir in the cranberries and oranges. In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the eggs, milk, sour cream, vanilla and orange extract. Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the crown comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for a while, then remove from the pans and place on wire racks to cool completely.
