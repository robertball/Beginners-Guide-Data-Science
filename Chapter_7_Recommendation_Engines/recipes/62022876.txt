Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup confectioners' sugar (sifted)
Pinch salt
2 tablespoons boiling water or strong brewed coffee

Directions:
Melt butter in microwave or on stove top. Stir in cocoa powder. Stir in sifted confectioners' sugar, salt and boiling water or coffee until smooth. Let glaze stand a few minutes until it is slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.
Pour glaze over cake top and sides and spread quickly to coat. To frost cupcakes, dip tops of cupcakes directly into bowl of glaze. If desired, immediately sprinkle with nuts or candy decorations.
Leave frosted cake/cupcakes uncovered to air dry for at least an hour, or until glaze is set.
