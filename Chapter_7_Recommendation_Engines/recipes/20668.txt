Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans
1 sweet onion, peeled
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot sauce
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Thinly slice the onion and place into a colander over the sink.  Add the cleaned green beans to a large pot of boiling water and boil until crisp tender (about 4 minutes).  When the beans are done, drain the water into the colander to slightly cook the onions.  Immediately rinse all in cold water to stop the cooking process.
For the dressing:  In a large bowl, whisk together the garlic, rice wine vinegar, cider vinegar, oil, sugar, salt, pepper, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  Add beans, onions and cheese and stir until combined.  Place in a nonreactive container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Enjoy!
