Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup white distilled vinegar
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon ketchup
2 teaspoons sambal chili sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
6 cloves finely crushed garlic
2 tablespoons finely minced Thai chili peppers (bird's eye peppers)
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Directions:
Place 1/2 cup cold fresh water and vinegar in a saucepan. Whisk in Asian fish sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, sambal chili sauce, and cornstarch. Whisk until cornstarch disappears. Place over medium-high heat and bring up to a simmer stirring occasionally. As it bubbles, it will start to thicken up. Remove pan from heat.
Whisk garlic and chili into hot mixture. Add fresh lime juice; whisk again. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature before checking for seasonings.
If not using immediately, transfer to a glass jar with a lid. Refrigerate.

Description: 
Here's my take on Thai-style sweet chili sauce, or Nam Jim. It's sort of a hybrid between the cooked and fresh versions. If you can't find Thai bird's eye chilies, use any other combination of fresh, preserved, and/or dried chilies. Things like jalapeno, red Fresno, or Serrano chilies work great, as does habanero. This sauce is great on grilled chicken and pork.
