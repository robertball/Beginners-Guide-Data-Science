Ingredients:
1 cup boiling water
2 dried chipotle peppers
2 cups fresh cranberries, washed
4 Tbsp adobe sauce, or more to taste
2 Tbsp vinegar
1/4 cup raw cane sugar
1 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Remove the stem (but not the seeds) and wash the chipotle peppers. Put them in a saucepan and cover them with the boiling water. Place a plate over the them and allow them to sit for 20 minutes. In a medium saucepan, add the chipotle peppers with the water, vinegar, pepper, and sugar. Once heated through, add the cranberries and turn down the heat until the cranberries are soft and tender (about 8 minutes), stirring often but keeping the saucepan covered. Add the adobo sauce. Be careful, cranberries tend to pop when cooking and can burn you.
Once all the cranberries are cooked, turn off the heat and blend with an immersion blender, just enough to leave some pulp of the cranberries and large pieces of chipotle pepper. Adjust the flavour with extra adobo sauce if needed. Serve warm or store in a hermetic glass or ceramic jar in the refrigerator for up to a week. This can also be frozen.
