Ingredients:
1 pound bulk spicy Italian sausage
1 cup chopped onion
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry red wine
5 cups beef broth
1 cup water
2 cups chopped tomato
1 cup grated carrots
1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 bay leaf
1 1/2 cups sliced zucchini
1 green bell pepper, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 cup water
1 (9 ounce) package tortellini

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly and lightly browned. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the red wine, beef broth, and 1 cup of water. Add tomato, carrots, tomato sauce, basil, oregano, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Stir in the zucchini, bell pepper, and parsley. Continue simmering for 45 minutes more. Pour in the remaining 1 cup of water. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Stir in the tortellini. Cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Discard bay leaf before serving.
