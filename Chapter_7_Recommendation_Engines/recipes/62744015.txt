Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces (reserve 3 whole for topping)
2 cups cooked rotisserie chicken, diced
1 unbaked pie shell
5 eggs
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt
White pepper to taste
1/4-1/2 teaspoon green chili Tabasco sauce
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
2 teaspoons flour
1 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place asparagus in a steamer, cover and cook until tender but still firm, about 4 to 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
In a small bowl, beat together eggs, cream, Tabasco, salt and pepper and dried parsley. In a separate bowl combine cheeses, diced chicken, green onions and mushrooms; lightly toss with flour. Prepare pie shell in large pie plate. Sprinkle half of the chopped asparagus into bottom of pie shell, top with layer 1/2 cheese/chicken mixture. Top with remaining asparagus followed by remaining cheese mixture, carefully cover with egg  mixture. Top with three whole asparagus artistically arranged.
Bake uncovered in preheated oven until firm, about 40-50 minutes. Top with cherry tomatoes chopped into quarters if desired. Let cool before serving.
