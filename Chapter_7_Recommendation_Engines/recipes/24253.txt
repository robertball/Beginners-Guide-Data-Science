Ingredients:
⅔ cup uncooked wild rice
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast half
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ cup sliced water chestnuts, drained
4 tablespoons walnut oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
salt and pepper to taste
1 head romaine lettuce, rinsed and dried

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, cover wild rice with three inches (7.5 cm) of salted water.  Bring to a boil and boil, uncovered, for 30 minutes, or until tender.  Drain the excess water, turn heat to lowest setting, cover rice and let steam for 15-20 minutes, or until the grains split open.  Remove from heat and let cool.
In a medium skillet over medium heat, saute the chicken lightly in the butter and oil, cooking gently and thoroughly.  Do not overcook the chicken.  Cool and shred the chicken into bite-size pieces.
In a medium bowl, mix together the rice, chicken and water chestnuts.  Set aside.
For the dressing, whisk together the walnut oil, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Pour over the wild rice mixture and combine.  To serve, place 2-3 romaine leaves on each plate and spoon the wild rice mixture onto the leaves.
