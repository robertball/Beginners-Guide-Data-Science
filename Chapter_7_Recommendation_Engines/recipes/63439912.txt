Peppakakor Cookies (Swedish gingerbread) Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2. lb. butter
1 1/2 c. sugar
1 T. dark molasses
2 tsp. baking soda
2 eggs
3 1/2 c. flour
3 tsp. ground cinnamon
3 tsp. ground cloves
3 tsp. ground ginger
1/2 c. blanched almond halves (skin removed), if desired

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar. Add molasses and eggs and mix well.
In a separate bowl, combine dry ingredients, except almonds. Add dry mixture gradually to butter mixture.
Refrigerate a minimum of an hour. It is better to leave in the fridge overnight to allow the spices combine well with the other ingredients for a stronger flavor.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 425 F.
Remove cold dough from the refrigerator, break off a fist sized portion and roll out very thin, about 1/8", directly on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Cut out shapes with cookie cutters, leaving about 1/2" between cookies so they won't stick together during baking. Peel away the dough between the cookies with a table knife and set aside to re-use later.
Press an almond half in the center of each cookie for decoration, if desired.
Bake 4-6 minutes, watching carefully to make sure they do not burn.
Cool on cookie sheet until firm enough to remove with a spatula to cooling rack. Leave on rack until no longer warm to the touch, then package in air-tight containers.

Description: 
This recipe has been passed down for many generations on my mother's side of the family. The Spegels immigrated to the Chicago area of the United States from Sweeden in the early 1900's. All the years I was growing up, I remember it just wasn't Christmas until we made the first batch!
