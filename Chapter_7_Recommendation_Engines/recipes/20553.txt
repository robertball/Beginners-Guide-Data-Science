Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons prepared mustard
2/3 cup lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
1 dash onion powder

Directions:
Use a flat container large enough to hold meat in a single layer. Combine oil, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and lemon juice. Season with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. Place meat in the marinade and turn to coat both sides.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, shaking or turning meat occasionally.

Description: 
This meat marinade has got to be the easiest, best tasting thing I've ever done to inexpensive cuts of beef, pork, or venison. As a newlywed, we cut all corners, but thanks to this recipe, not on taste!
