Ingredients:
Scallops Casino
½ lb. sea scallops
1 tablespoon onion, minced
1 large clove garlic, minced
2 slices of lean bacon
¼ green pepper slivered
1 tablespoon of roasted red peppers chopped
¼ cup of dry white wine
1 tablespoon of butter
2 teaspoons fresh parsley
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons of chicken broth
1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese
½ cup plain breadcrumbs
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Fresh Lemon slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (I use my toaster / convection oven)
In a medium mixing bowl combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, parsley until well mixed.
In a medium skillet cook bacon until golden (not crisp). Remove bacon from pan and chop.  Drain bacon fat until there is only about 1 tablespoon left in the pan. While the pan is still hot, add the scallops and sear about 1 ½ – 2 ½ minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove scallops from pan and set aside.
Wipe fat from pan, and add a tablespoon of butter.  Sauté onion, garlic, green and red pepper over medium heat for approximately 2-3 minutes. Add white wine cook and simmer about 1 minute.  Add chicken broth and simmer 1 minute. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
Toss scallops and bacon in pan mixture.  Divide scallop mixture between individual serving dishes (two to three) and top with breadcrumb mixture. Bake for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Turn oven to broil and broil until lightly browned.
