Ingredients:
Pulled Turkey:
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/3 cup chopped green onion
1 (2 pound) skinless, boneless turkey breast, cut into 8 ounce chunks
1/2 cup juice from canned pineapple
1/4 cup sweet chile sauce
3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon beef bouillon granules
2 teaspoons garlic powder
6 canned pineapple rings
Coleslaw Topping:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 cups chopped cabbage
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and black pepper to taste
6 Kaiser rolls, split

Directions:
Sprinkle the celery and green onions into the bottom of a slow cooker; place the turkey chunks on top. Combine the pineapple juice, sweet chile sauce, vinegar, water, beef bouillon, and garlic powder; pour over the turkey. Place the pineapple rings on the turkey chunks.
Cook on Low until the turkey pulls apart easily, 6 to 7 hours.
Meanwhile, make the coleslaw by stirring the mayonnaise, lemon juice, parsley, and onion together in a mixing  bowl. Add the cabbage and Cheddar cheese; season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover, and refrigerate while the turkey cooks.
Once the turkey is tender, shred using two forks. Pile some of the shredded turkey and a pineapple ring onto a Kaiser roll; top with coleslaw to serve.
