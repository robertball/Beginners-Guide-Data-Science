Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
3 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon or more cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon dried Italian herbs or poultry seasoning
2-3 cups buttermilk
Vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
Slice each chicken breasts into thick strips.
Whisk the dry ingredients together and pour into a gallon-sized storage bag. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish.
Coat the chicken strips in the flour mixture by placing several at a time in the bag, seal it, and give it a good couple of shakes. Repeat until all of them.
Dip each strip into the buttermilk to coat, then back into the flour mixture.
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Fill a heavy-bottomed pan at least 4" deep with the oil, heat it to 350 degrees (use a thermometer to monitor the temperature) and fry the strips, 4 or 5 at a time, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in the oven as you repeat the procedure until all the strips are fried. Serve with barbecue sauce, ranch dressing or you favorite dipping sauce.

A quick, easy, more delicious version of a fast food favorite. You can cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces for nuggets as well, or use eggplant instead of chicken if you prefer.
