Ingredients:
3 lbs small bosc pears
2 cups sugar
2 cups Chardonnay wine (white)
1 1/2 cups water
1 vanilla pod
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 cinnamon sticks
4 cardamom seeds
4 whole sweet cloves
1 star anise

Directions:
Combine sugar, lemon juice, wine, water and spices in a four-quart slow cooker. Stir to dissolve sugar.
Peel pears, cut them into halves and remove seeds with a spoon, or if you’d rather leave them whole, cut a little piece off the bottom to allow them to stand.
Place pears in slow cooker, cover and cook over low heat for 3 hours or until pears are tender. Carefully remove pears with a skimmer or slotted spoon and place in a heat-resistant glass bowl.
Set slow cooker’s temperature to high and cook uncovered until the liquid is reduced by half.
Pour the reduced liquid over pears and let them cool. Serve over vanilla ice cream.

Description: 
These pears in wine look very appealing when you serve them with the spices in which you cook them. The best part is that, once you’ve prepared them, you can use them to make different recipes like: tarts, mousses or simply enjoy them with vanilla ice cream.
