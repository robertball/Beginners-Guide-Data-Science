Steak and Guinness Pie Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 lbs round steak, cubed ½"
1 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tsp brown sugar
4 oz fresh mushrooms, sliced
5 medium onions, minced
1/2 tsp salt
1 bottle Guinness
8 slices bacon, chopped small
4-oz (1 stick) butter
1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
Double crust pie pastry (store-bought frozen and thawed or make your own)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Dredge the round steak cubes in the flour.  In a skillet put the round steak, butter and bacon then brown.  Remove the meat to a casserole dish. Add the onions, mushrooms and salt to the skillet then cook until the onions are yellow and the mushrooms are tender. Remove to the casserole dish as well.
Add the parsley, brown sugar and Guinness to the casserole then mix and cover tightly.  Bake at 325°F for 2½ hours stirring occasionally.  If the gravy becomes too thick for a pie filling then add a little water and stir to thin it out again.  When the filling is finished baking take it out and increase the oven temperature to 400°F.
Line a deep pie dish with one of the pie crusts and bake it blind (which means baking an unfilled pie shell to produce a partially or fully baked crust) at 400°F for about 10 minutes.  Scoop the cooked filling into the pie crust then cover with the second layer of pie pastry.  Put the completed pie back into the oven and bake for 10-15 more minutes or until the top crust is golden brown.
