Ingredients:
8 ounces shaped pasta such as gemilli, fusilli, or rotelle
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 large yellow squash, quartered lengthwise, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
4 ounces sugar snap peas, strings removed, halved
6 asparagus spears, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook bell pepper, squash, and garlic, stirring occasionally, until pepper is crisp-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add snap peas and asparagus and cook, stirring, until asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 minutes more.
Put flour and salt in a bowl and whisk in milk until smooth. Add flour mixture to skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sauce is lightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Pour mixture over pasta and stir in tomatoes, 3/4 cup parmesan, and basil. Transfer to prepared baking dish and sprinkle with panko and remaining 1/4 cup parmesan. Bake until top is lightly golden and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes.
