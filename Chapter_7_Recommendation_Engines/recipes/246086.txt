Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 small head cabbage, shredded
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons mango chutney
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook ground beef until browned and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked ground beef to a plate to drain; reserve remaining oil in skillet.
Return skillet to medium heat with residual oil. Add onion, garlic, and curry powder; cook and stir until onion is almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir cooked ground beef and cabbage into onion mixture; stir in ketchup, chutney, and salt. Sprinkle on a little water to prevent burning, but not enough to make the curry wet.
Cook and stir until cabbage is just tender and flavors have combined, 7 to 10 minutes more.
