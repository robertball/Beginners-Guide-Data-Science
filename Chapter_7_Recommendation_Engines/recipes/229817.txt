1 pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place yam, red potato, white potato, yellow potato, beet, rutabaga, parsnip, and turnip into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and return to pot.
Mash vegetable mixture and butter together with a potato masher or fork until orange-ish with streaks of red from the beets; season with nutmeg, salt, and black pepper.

Description: 
Beautiful fall colors and amazing flavors make this a favorite at any holiday gathering. Stir in milk and sour cream for a creamier texture if desired. The beets should not mash all the way. It should be orange-ish with streaks and dots of red from the beets. The name alone will convince your picky eaters to try this, and the taste will make them want more!
