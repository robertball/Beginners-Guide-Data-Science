1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pulse beans, garlic, egg white, water, salt-free seasoning, salt, and pepper in a food processor until smooth. Mix together bean mixture, ground beef, and bread crumbs in a large bowl. Do not overmix. Shape into 1-inch balls and put on a lightly greased rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a thermometer inserted in centers registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 12 to 14 minutes.
