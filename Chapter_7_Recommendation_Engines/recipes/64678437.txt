Ingredients:
Broccoli (1/2 c - 1 cup per person) fresh and raw, cooked/steamed or frozen florets)
Cherry tomatoes cut in half or whole grape tomatoes
Black olives pitted and cut or pre sliced (to taste)
Bottled Italian oil and vinegar dressing (up to 2 large bottles depending on rest of ingredients)
Dry Zesty style Italian Dressing Mix (1 envelope)

Directions:
If using totally raw broccoli clean, cut and marinate overnight in one bottle of dressing before assembly.
If using cooked or frozen & thawed: Add dressing, cut or whole tomatoes and cut/sliced olives and let marinate for a minimum of 4 hours. Drain lightly: add more dressing and dry packet.
Stir well to mix dry in and refrige until serving time...at least an hour but the more time the merrier. Simple, tangy, saucy and a favorite among my in-laws, this recipes is for them.
