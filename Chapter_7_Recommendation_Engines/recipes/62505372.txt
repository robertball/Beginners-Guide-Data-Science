Lower the heat to medium and cook until it thickens, then add ham mixture and continue to stir for a few more minutes.
Let the dough cool down. Take about 1 tbsp of dough and form into ball or small log.
Cover with egg mixture and roll in breadcrumbs (twice if you want extra crispy).
Fry in hot oil until golden.
