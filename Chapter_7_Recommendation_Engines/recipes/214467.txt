Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package macaroni
2 potatoes
1 hard-boiled egg, chopped fine
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons Italian-style salad dressing
1/2 Maui onion, minced
1 carrot, cut into very fine matchsticks
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the macaroni in boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Chill in refrigerator.
Bring a separate pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the potatoes in boiling water until just cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, peel, and chop the potatoes into small cubes. Combine the potatoes, chopped egg, and mayonnaise in a bowl; mix. Add the macaroni, Italian-style salad dressing, onion, carrot, salt, and pepper to the potato mixture; stir. Chill in refrigerator until cold, about 20 minutes. Serve cold.

Description: 
If you've ever been to Hawaii, you know mac salad is a staple there and is different than mac salad anywhere else! I finally think I've made some almost as good as the island!  Serve with kalua pork or any of your other island favorites! Enjoy!
