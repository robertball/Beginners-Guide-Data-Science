Ingredients:
1 (10 inch) soft flour tortilla
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon milk
1/2 teaspoon butter (optional)
1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, or more to taste
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/4 cup salsa, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch paprika, or to taste (optional)
1 pinch sea salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press tortilla into a tortilla shell mold or oven-proof bowl.
Whisk eggs, milk, and butter together in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in Mexican cheese blend.
Bake tortilla in the preheated oven until crispy and brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool slightly before transferring from mold to serving dish, about 2 minutes.
Cook egg mixture in the microwave until set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove egg mixture from the microwave and stir gently with a fork. Cook in the microwave until fully set, about 30 seconds more.
Place cooked eggs in tortilla bowl; top with avocado, salsa, paprika, and salt.
