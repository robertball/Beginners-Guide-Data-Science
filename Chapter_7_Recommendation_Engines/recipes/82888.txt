Spread the cream cheese in a layer in a 9 inch square baking dish. Spread a layer of pizza sauce over the cream cheese, followed by layers of shredded cheese, green chilies, black olives, jalapenos, and pepperoni.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated throughout.

Description: 
This is an easy hot dip that I love to serve at NASCAR parties.  Can use for any occasion and can use many different types of meats, or omit the meat entirely. Sometimes I add 3/4 pound of cooked ground turkey or lean ground beef if I want to make it more of a meal.  Add extra peppers or spices if you like your food hotter.  I usually make 2 pans, one with lots of hot stuff and one omitting the chiles, olives and peppers.
