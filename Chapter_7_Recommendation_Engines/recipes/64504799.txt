Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 tsp salt
3 eggs
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tbsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 cup buttermilk or soured milk (1tsp lemon juice with enough milk to make 3/4 cup)
1 bag of cranberries (3 cups) coarsely chopped
1 small orange, zested and juiced
coarse sugar for topping (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Spray 24 muffin cups with non stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs and beat for one minute.
Add salt, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla, buttermilk, orange zest and orange juice, stir until combined.
Add cranberries and flour, stir until just combined and no flour remains.
Using a scoop ( I use a #50) divide batter evenly among the 24 cups.
Sprinkle tops with coarse sugar if desired for a crunchy top.
Bake in a preheated oven for 23 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, remove from pans and let finish cooling.
I freeze for fast snacks and breakfasts.
