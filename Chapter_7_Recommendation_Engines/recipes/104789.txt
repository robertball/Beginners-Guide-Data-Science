Ingredients:
1 cup flaked coconut, finely chopped
2 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 (4 ounce) carton egg substitute
1/2 cup canola oil
Apricot Dipping Sauce
1/2 cup apricot jam
2 teaspoons brown mustard
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish

Directions:
Toss together the coconut, flour and Creole seasoning in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, toss the tilapia with the cornstarch, and shake off the excess.  Pour the egg substitute into a separate bowl, and dip the fillets in the egg.  Press fillets in the coconut mixture coating all sides.
Heat canola oil in a frying pan to a temperature of about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry fillets one or two at a time on both sides until golden brown.  Remove to drain on a paper towel.  Prepare the apricot dipping sauce by stirring together the jam, mustard, and horseradish in a small bowl.  Serve the tilapia accompanied by the dipping sauce.

Description: 
After having coconut shrimp at a famous restaurant here in Phoenix, I decided to recreate it at home using a mild white fish filet and tilapia was my first choice.  Sit back and enjoy the compliments.
