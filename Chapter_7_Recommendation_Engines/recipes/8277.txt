Ingredients:
1 cup water
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 cups self-rising flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon hot water
1/2 cup butter, melted
4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a saucepan, combine 1 cup water, 3 tablespoons cocoa, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Heat until mixture comes to a boil, then remove from heat. Pour into a large mixing bowl.
Add sugar, flour, soda, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla. Mix well and pour into prepared 9x13 inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Have icing ready when cake comes out of oven.
To make the icing: In a medium bowl, combine 3 tablespoons cocoa, 1 teaspoon hot water and 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine. Add confectioners sugar, pecans and milk and mix well. You can add more milk to achieve desired consistency, but too much will make cake soggy.
Frost while cake is hot and icing is still soft.
