Ingredients:
12 whole fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon EVOO, plus extra to coat whole mushrooms
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/3 C. crushed Stove Top Stuffing
1 TBS melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel.
Carefully break off stems, chopping to fine dice.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and chopped mushroom stems to the skillet.
Fry until any moisture has disappeared, taking care not to burn garlic, then set aside to cool.
Coat whole caps with EVOO.
When garlic and mushroom mixture is no longer hot, stir in cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder and cayenne pepper.  (Mixture should be very thick).
Using a small spoon, fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing.
Mix melted butter and crushed stuffing.
Roll stuffing ends of filled mushrooms into coating.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the mushrooms are piping hot and liquid starts to form under caps.
