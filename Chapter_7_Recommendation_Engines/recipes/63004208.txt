Vegan Black Bean Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
- 1 can Black Beans
- 1/3 cup chopped sweet onion
- 1 tablespoon garlic (pressed, minced or out of a jar-never powder)
- 3-4 baby carrots grated (optional)
- 1/4 cup minced green bell pepper (optional)
- 1 tablespoon corn starch mixed in 1 tablespoon warm water
(use 1 egg if corn starch is unavailable. *this makes the recipe NOT vegan)
- 3 tablespoons of Sriracha chili sauce (add more/less as desired)
- 1 teaspoon Chili powder
- 1 teaspoon Cumin powder
- 1 teaspoon Bay seasoning
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
*ALL SEASONINGS - approximate measurements. use less/more as desired.
- 2 pieces of bread (preferably wheat)
- 3/4 cup flour (preferably unbleached or wheat flour)

Directions:
preheat oven to 350 F. (these can also be grilled or fried in a pan. pan bean burgers seem to fall apart. use your own judgement.)
drain & rinse black beans, mash in medium sized bowl. chop, then add onion & garlic. (add carrot & green bell pepper now if you choose to use them.) mix together.
in a separate small bowl, combine cornstarch + water (or egg), sriracha sauce and spices. add mixture to black bean mix, stir.
rip 2 slices of bread to to as small of pieces as you can get them, add to bean mixture, stir. add 1/4 cup of flour at a time to mixture, stir until desired consistency is reached. 3/4 cup is just about right. you want the mixture to be sticky, not too loose, but not too dry. adding more/less flour will give this effect.
grease a baking sheet, spoon 'burger-sized' mounds of the mixture onto the baking sheet, about 3/4 inch thick. shape into burgers. bake for 10 minutes, flip and bake on the other side for 10 minutes, or until done. the thicker the burgers, the longer it takes them to cook. 5 minutes here or there.
serve with your favourite burger fixings!
