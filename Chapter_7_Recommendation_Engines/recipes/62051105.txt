Ingredients:
2 cans aparagus tips- drained,and fork  smashed til most lumps are out, remove any woody pieces
8 eggs- beaten
1 C unseasoned dry bread crumbs
1 C finely grated romano cheese
2 t garlic powder
1/2 t salt
1/2 t ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl.  Let mixture sit for 5 minutes so bread crumbs may absorb some liquid.  Pre heat non stick fry pan to Medium  (I use 2 to get the job done quicker) with about 1/16" canola or vegi oil.  Drop teaspoons of batter mix into pre heated oil and slightly pat out.  Fry each side for about 2- minutes over med. heat or until they just turn lightly brown.  Decrease your heat if they brown too fast and middles do not cook.  Drain on paper toweling.  I think they are best served at room tempurature, but can be eaten hot, warm or cold.
