Description: 
I was in Santa Monica a few years ago, where I ordered a chicken Parmesan that featured a garlic, rosemary, and Marsala-spiked sauce. I loved the subtle sweetness the wine added to the tomato. For whatever reason, I thought of those flavors while brainstorming a quick skirt steak marinade, and this is what happened. Skirt steak is always great on the grill and doesn't need much help, but I love how this came out.
