Ingredients:
6 eggs
3 slices bacon
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 cherry tomatoes, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon dried parsley
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble bacon when cool enough to handle.
Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork; stir in crumbled bacon, mayonnaise,  tomatoes, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Arrange egg white halves on a serving platter; spoon yolk mixture into egg whites. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve.
