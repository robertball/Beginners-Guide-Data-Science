Ingredients:
¾ cup butter, divided
1 pound chicken livers
1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, chopped
3  green onions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
⅔ cup Riesling wine
½ teaspoon dry mustard
⅛ teaspoon dried rosemary
1 pinch dried dill weed

Directions:
Melt 1/4 cup butter in a skillet. Add chicken livers, mushrooms, green onions, garlic, and salt; cook for 5 minutes. Add Riesling, mustard, rosemary, and dill. Simmer until chicken livers are tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Transfer mixture to a food processor; blend until almost smooth. Blend in remaining 1/2 cup butter. Add additional salt if needed.
Pack pate into a ceramic crock and refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving.
