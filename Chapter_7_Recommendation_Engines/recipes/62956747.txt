Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
10-12 medium sized fresh jalapeno peppers
1 tsp canola oil
1 tsp minced sweet onion
1 1/2 tsp minced garlic
3 T dry bread crumbs
16 oz room temperature Neufchatel Cream Cheese
2 cups shredded 2% Sharp Cheddar Cheese
1/2 tsp cumin
1 tsp dried oregano

Directions:
Bake bacon on a rack for 25-35 minutes at 350 degrees until done and crispy.  Let cool.
Using plastic gloves to protect your hands, trim stems off peppers, split and remove seeds.  Coarsely chop peppers and set aside.
Lightly saute onion in canola oil for 2 minutes then add garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes more.  Do not brown the garlic.  Let cool.
Coarsely chop 4 slices of bacon and mix with bread crumbs.  Set aside.  Coarsely chop remaining bacon for cheese mixture.
Shred cheddar cheese.  If shredded earlier keep refrigerated, it will mix better if chilled.
In mixing bowl(I like to use my Kitchen Aid with the paddle) combine cheeses, herbs, chopped peppers, sauteed garlic and onion, and the bacon.  Mix together well.  Scrap out with a spatula and spread into an 8" pie pan, evenly sprinkle bacon breadcrumbs on top.  Bake at 375 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until lightly brown and bubbly.  Serve warm with your favorite chips.

Description: 
Before my son left for boot camp, I wanted to give him a going away party complete with all of his favorite foods. There wasn't enough time to stuff and wrap jalapenos for poppers so I took his favorite recipe and turned it into a warm spicy dip that disappeared faster than any poppers I've ever made!
