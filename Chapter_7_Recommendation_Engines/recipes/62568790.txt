Ingredients:
1 pack of cranberries
1 orange, juice and zest
1/2 inch piece ginger minced
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
1 firm pear 1/4 inch dice
1/8 - 1/4 cup amaretto or any almond flavored liquor

Directions:
Over medium heat pour water and sugar in medium pot. After sugar dissolves, add pear, ginger, orange juice, and orange zest. Cook for 3 minutes then add cranberries. Cook for at least 5 minutes. While cranberries are popping, smash up some with the back of a spoon. The cranberries should have whole and crushed berries after 5-7 minutes. Cool covered in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. Can be made 24 hours ahead. Before serving, add the amaretto and stir well. If you don't want liquor in your sauce add 1 tsp of almond extract.
