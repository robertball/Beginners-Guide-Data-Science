Ingredients:
2 pounds hamburger
1 (46 ounce) bottle V-8 juice
3 (15 ounce) cans light kidney beans, drained
3 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed Italian tomatoes, diced
1 large onion, chopped
2 envelopes chili mix

Directions:
Brown hamburger and add onions last 10 minutes of browning.
Add all remaining ingredients and simmer on low all day in crock pot.
Good for supper that night, but much better if left to set in refrigerator a day or two.
