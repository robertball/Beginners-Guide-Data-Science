Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAF® Regular or Premium Cherry Fruit Filling & Topping
1/2 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Position rack to center of the oven.
In a large mixing bowl on medium speed, cream together butter and sugars for two minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl as necessary. Add eggs, one at a time. Mix in the vanilla.
In a separate mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.
Mix in the oats and then the white chocolate chips.
Press about 2/3 of the batter into a thin layer in a greased jelly roll pan; set aside.
In another mixing bowl, stir together the cherry fruit filling and apple butter. Spread evenly over the layer of batter in the pan. Scoop the remaining batter evenly over the fruit filling.
Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden. Let cool completely before cutting into bars, or serve warm and gooey with ice cream.
