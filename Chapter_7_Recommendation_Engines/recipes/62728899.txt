Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups sugar
3/4 cups margarine/butter, softened
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup flour
2 Tbsp. vanilla extract OR 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract
6 Tbsp. cocoa
3/4 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Dump all ingredients into a bowl and mix well.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes in greased square pan.  Don't bother inserting a toothpick to test if they're done or not - they're SUPPOSED to be gooey in the middle.  If in doubt, take them out sooner!
