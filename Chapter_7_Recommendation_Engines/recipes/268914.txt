Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/2 cup vegan Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup tamari soy sauce
1/2 cup water
1 shiitake mushroom
1 tablespoon fermented black bean paste
1 tablespoon minced shallot
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 strip nori seaweed
4 1/2 ounces tempeh
1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
1 (6 inch) French baguette, sliced into bite-sized cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced
1/2 ounce pickled daikon, or to taste
1/2 ounce pickled carrot, or to taste
2 cucumber slices, or to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Warm Worcestershire sauce, tamari, water, mushroom, black bean paste, shallot, garlic clove, and seaweed in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and let cool. Drain sauce and discard the solids.
Place tempeh in a bowl and pour 1/3 cup of the sauce on top. Marinate for 20 minutes, turning tempeh over halfway.
Remove 1 teaspoon of the tempeh marinade and whisk together with vegan mayo and sriracha in a separate bowl. Refrigerate until needed.
Arrange baguette pieces on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle olive oil on top. Toss and arrange bread into a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn bread and cook until browned, about 8 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl.
Place the tempeh on the baking sheet; reserve the liquid. Bake for 10 minutes, basting with some of the reserved marinade halfway through. Flip tempeh; bake, basting again, for 10 minutes more.
Cut tempeh into cubes. Arrange the bread, tempeh, jalapeno slices, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, and cilantro into serving bowls. Top with sriracha mayo.
