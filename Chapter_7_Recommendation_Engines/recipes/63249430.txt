Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breast (2 breasts)
1/2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash white pepper
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/3 cup toasted almond, finely chopped
1 green onion, chopped
For sauce
4 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
3 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons chicken bouillon
For batter
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons flour (Wondra works well)
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Boned chicken breasts are thicker on one side than on the other. To make them more uniform, slice horizontally through the thick part and lay the meat "open". Do not cut the thinned section from the rest of the breast meat. Pound both sides with back of cleaver. One side will be smoother than the other. Mix light soy, sherry, salt and white pepper together and mix in chicken meat. Set aside 20 minutes. Wash and drain lettuce. Shred. Finely chop toasted almonds. Make sauce: Mix 4 T. cornstarch and 3 T. water in saucepan until smooth. Gradually mix in broth, butter, soy sauce, and bouillon. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Let boil for about 1 minute; reduce heat and keep warm. Make batter: Beat together 3 T. cornstarch, flour, baking powder, egg, and water until smooth. Coat chicken with batter and cook 5-7 minutes in 375* oil until golden brown. Drain chicken on paper towels. Cut cooked chicken into strips, put on bed of shredded lettuce and sprinkle with finely chopped almonds and green onions. Spoon on sauce and serve with steamed or fried rice.
