Ingredients:
4 pounds boneless pork loin, trimmed
Salt and pepper, to taste
Filling
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced onions
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes with Italian herbs, drained and chopped
1 tablespoon jalapeno chilies, diced
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped
2 cups California raisins
1 cup California raisins
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup white wine
Rub
1/3 cup Dijon mustard
2 large cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Blend 2 cups raisins in food processor or blender until smooth.
Using long slicing knife, with pork loin facing away lengthwise at 12 o'clock, make 3/4-inch deep cut along right edge for the entire length of roast. Roll the roast to the left. Then, starting inside that cut, holding knife at an angle, cut another 3/4-inch-deep cut along previous cut. Keep turning roast, repeating these 3/4-inch-deep cuts until you have one large square 'sheet of pork.
In heavy-bottomed saute pan, saute onions in olive oil until caramelized and tender. Add remaining ingredients and simmer on low 15 to 20 minutes until flavors blend.
Mix Dijon mustard, minced garlic cloves and 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil. Set aside.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Season pork on both sides with salt and pepper. Spread filling evenly over flattened loin to 3/4 inch around all edges. Roll loin jelly roll style and tie with string. Spread rub on outside of rolled loin. Bake, basting occasionally, 45 to 60 minutes, to internal temperature of at least 140 degrees F for medium, 150 degrees F for juicy medium-well. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Slice and serve.
