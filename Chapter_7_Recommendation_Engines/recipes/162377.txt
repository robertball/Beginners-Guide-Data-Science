Description: 
This very hot and flavorful pepper paste can be used to spice up any dish or used as a hot sauce.  Use gloves when cutting peppers or your hands will burn for days.  Also make sure to cook in a well ventilated kitchen. If your vent hood does not work well, open some windows and use a fan.
