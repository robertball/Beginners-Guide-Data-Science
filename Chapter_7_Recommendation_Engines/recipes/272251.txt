Easy Pork Chops with Cream of Mushroom Soup Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
all-purpose flour
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 pork loin chops, 1/2 inch thick
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup water
1/2 (6 ounce) can french-fried onions, divided
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together flour, salt, and pepper in a rimmed plate. Dredge pork chops in flour mixture; shake off excess.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook, turning halfway, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Place chops in an 11x17-inch baking dish.
Stir canned soup and water together in a small bowl until well blended. Pour over pork chops and sprinkle with 1/2 of the fried onions.
Cover and bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 50 minutes. Stir in sour cream and top with remaining onions.
Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, until sauce is hot, about 10 minutes more.
