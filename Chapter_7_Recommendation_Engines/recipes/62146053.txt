Description: 
This dip is a crowd pleaser!  I always have people requesting the recipe. It's super easy, but super fattening - I don't skim on the ingredients (no low-fat) and I use the best quality products (no generic). I serve this in a fondu or mini crock pot with unsalted mini toast or crackers. It's delicious!
