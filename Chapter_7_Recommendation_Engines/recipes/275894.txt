Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 large eggs
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
2 1/2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons ricotta cheese
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons finely grated orange zest
2 1/2 tablespoons sour cream
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Whisk eggs, 1/2 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons orange juice, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons ricotta, vegetable oil, milk, sugar, orange zest, sour cream, and vinegar in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in egg mixture and chocolate chips. Stir until flour is just moistened. Be sure not to overmix to avoid overly tough muffins.
Spoon about 1/4 cup batter into each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
