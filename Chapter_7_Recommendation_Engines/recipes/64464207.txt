Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups of almondmilk
1 1/2 tablespoons of vinegar or lemon juice
4 cups of whole wheat or all purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons of salt
1 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
Caraway seeds and/or raisins to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Oil baking sheet generously and set aside.
Combine milk and vinegar/lemon juice and set aside until for at least five minutes to create the "buttermilk" flavor.
Sift together the dry ingredients and then slowly pour in the milk, kneading at intervals, until all is incorporated. Then work the dough until it is a cohesive ball. Fold in caraway seeds and/or raisins if desired.
Shape the dough into a rounded cylindrical shape and form an "X" on the surface, ad least one half an inch deep, using a sharp knife.
Bake for 45 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
A fat-free version of vegan Irish Soda Bread, adapted from Vegan Planet (cookbook). Given the method used to check if it is done (tapping on the bottom to see if it sounds hollow inside) I believe it's safe to assume that this loaf is very dry, which is normal for Irish Soda Bread, but just keep in mind that the other less traditional version that uses coconut oil is much sweeter and moister.
