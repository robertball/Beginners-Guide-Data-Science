Description: 
unable to find a recipe for kale using what ingredients I had on hand, I decided to be creative...amazingly, it was delicious!!  I didn't use any salt or pepper and yet the taste was not at all bland...the kale was very tender but not soupy...this will definitely be a go-to recipe for kale.
