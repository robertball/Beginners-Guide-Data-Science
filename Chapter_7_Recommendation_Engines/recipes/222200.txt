Ingredients:
2 tomatoes, finely chopped
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 butternut squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, or to taste
2 (4 ounce) fillets rainbow trout
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Place squash halves on a baking sheet. Fill butternut squash cavities with tomato salsa mixture, reserving about 2 tablespoons of salsa for garnish. Brush cut surfaces of squash with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle squash with 2 tablespoons of dill.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until almost tender, about 45 minutes.
Remove baking sheet from oven; place trout fillets onto baking sheet, brush with 1 teaspoon olive oil, and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons dill. Return to oven and bake until trout fillets are opaque and fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 more minutes. Serve fillets on top of squash halves, served with reserved salsa.

Description: 
This is something a friend of mine showed me. It's super easy, not to mention delicious. I try to eat according to the paleolithic diet and this fits wonderfully. The portions are quite large, so it can easily feed more than 2 or you can have some for lunch the next day. Feel free to change amounts according to taste, especially in regards to the onion, cilantro, lemon juice and olive oil.
