Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat pasta
2 8oz cartons of fresh mushrooms
8oz package Seitan (optional)
½ medium onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons thyme
1 teaspoon rosemary
½ cup white wine
1 cup tofu sour cream
Tofu Sour Cream
1 package Extra Firm Tofu (use only 8 oz)
2 Tbls Lemon Juice
1 Tbls Red Wine Vinegar
1 clove garlic
1/4 tsp salt
1-2 Tbls of water for consistency

Directions:
Boil the noodles according to package instructions
Make the Tofu Sour Cream: My box of Tofu was a 12oz package, you only need about 8oz for this recipe so cut off 1/4 of the block and save it for later use.  Drain the tofu well and add everything to a blender.  Be sure to stop and scrape down the sides occasionally.  If it seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of water until it reaches a sour cream-like consistency.This should make about 1 cup of Tofu Sour Cream.
Saute onion and garlic in a few tablespoons of water or veggie broth until soft
Stir in seasonings and seitan
Add fresh mushrooms and allow to cook down
Stir in white wine until bubbly
Stir in sour cream
Top drained noodles with sauce
