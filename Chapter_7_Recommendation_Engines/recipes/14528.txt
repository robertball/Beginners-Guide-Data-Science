Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

In a bowl, mix the oil, white wine, and Cajun seasoning. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the mixture. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Preheat the grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Discard marinade, and place chicken on the grill. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, until juices run clear.

Description: 
Finally, I can contribute my own original recipe! I created this when I bought some marinated chicken at the deli and they would not divulge their recipe; I experimented and came up with an even better one! It IS original and it IS good!
