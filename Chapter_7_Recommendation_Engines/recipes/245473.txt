Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/4 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste
2 cups finely shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup tapioca flour, plus more for dusting
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk eggs and salt together in a large bowl with a fork. Stir in mozzarella cheese. Sift tapioca flour and baking powder together over cheese mixture; mix well until cheese softens into the eggs and flour. Add enough milk to make a moist, slightly crumbly dough.
Dust your work surface with tapioca flour. Scrape dough out of the bowl and knead gently until it begins to feel smooth, about 3 minutes. Shape dough into a log; divide into 4 equal pieces. Carefully roll the pieces of dough under your cupped fingers until round. Transfer to the lined baking sheet.
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
A great gluten-free dinner roll that can be put together in no time. If you're going to get in to gluten-free baking, tapioca flour is going to be one of your best friends. It has great texture and weight, making a fantastic wheat substitute. In this recipe notice we don't even need a binding agent like xanthan gum? That's the beauty of using cheese!
