Description: 
In our family, we make a meal out of gyoza about once a week. Just take them from the freezer and pop them into a frying pan, steam some rice, and your meal is ready. I make up a big batch and freeze them, and you may adjust the recipe size according to what you have on hand. Be prepared for those accounting fights about who gets the last gyoza. Mmmm! Enjoy with rice on the side sprinkled with some ground sesame seeds.
