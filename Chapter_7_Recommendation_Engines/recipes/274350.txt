Ingredients:
2 1/2 bunches broccoli rabe
1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
3 Italian pork sausages, casings removed
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
3 ounces bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ounce shaved Pecorino cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.
Cut 1 to 1 1/2 inches off of the bottom of the broccoli rabe stalks; cut into 1 1/2-inch sections.
Place trimmed broccoli rabe and orecchiette into the boiling water and boil until pasta is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add sausage and cook for 6 minutes; stir in garlic and cook until sausage is browned and crumbly, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Heat a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Stir in bread crumbs. Cook until browned and crunchy, about 5 minutes.
Drain the pasta pot. Add drained broccoli rabe and orecchiette to the sausage. Add red pepper flakes and 1/2 of the bread crumbs and stir well.
Transfer 1/2 the pasta mixture to a large bowl. Stir in 1/2 the Pecorino cheese. Add remaining pasta mixture to the bowl and top with remaining cheese; mix well. Top with remaining bread crumbs.
