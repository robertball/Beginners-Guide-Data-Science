Ingredients:
1/2 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 rib celery, diced
1 tbs butter
2 lbs ground beef
3/4 cup buttery round cracker crumbs
1 egg
1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1/2 can milk

Directions:
Saute the veggies in the butter until barely soft.
In a bowl, combine the veggies and butter, meat, crumbs, egg, Worcestershire and salt and pepper until thoroughly mixed.
Shape into a loaf and place in a lightly greased 9 x 13 pan
Bake at 350 until mostly cooked, about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, on the stove combine the soup with 1/2 can of milk, and heat through.
After 45 minutes in the oven, remove the meatloaf and drain off some but not all of the grease. Pour the soup/milk combo over the meatloaf and return to the oven to finish cooking, 10-15 minutes.
When the meatloaf is done, remove the pan from the oven and using a spatula (or two) remove the loaf from the pan and place on a pretty plate. With a whisk, combine the juices in the pan with the leftover soup/milk sauce to make a gravy. Pour into a gravy boat and serve with mashed potatoes!

Description: 
This is how my dad made meatloaf and it's the only way I'll eat it. There's not a tomato or a bottle of ketchup in sight.
