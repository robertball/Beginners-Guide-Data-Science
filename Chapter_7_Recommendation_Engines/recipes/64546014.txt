Ingredients:
1/2 cup sour cream (I use light)
1 teaspoon dry ranch seasoning mix
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1-8 ounce package cream cheese, softened
1-4 ounce can diced green chili's, drained lightly
2 tablespoons jarred pickled jalapeno pepper slices, chopped small

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the sour cream, ranch seasoning mix and garlic powder ; mix well.
Add the cream cheese to the sour cream mixture and mix until combined and smooth (you can use an electric hand mixer for this if you are having trouble using a spoon).
Add chili's and jalapenos; mix well.
Cover and refrigerate at least 2-3 hours for the flavors to blend.
About an hour before serving, remove from the refrigerator and allow it to come to room temperature .
Serve with your favorite Doritos(R).

Description: 
An AWESOME dip for Doritos®! You can add up to 1/2 teaspoon more ranch seasoning, but it does tend to be a bit saltier that way, so maybe start with the teaspoon and then go from there. Feel free to add more chopped jalapenos for a spicier dip. I like to serve this with nacho cheese flavored and cool ranch flavored Doritos®. Enjoy!
