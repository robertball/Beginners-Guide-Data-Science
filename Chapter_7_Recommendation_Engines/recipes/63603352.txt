Ingredients:
Fresh Whole Chicken
4 Tbs Vegetable Oil
Mixed Herbs (Thyme, Sage, Parsley, Oregano)
1 Tsp Cajun Seasoning
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Pepper
1 Chicken Stock Cube
3 Tbs Water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius (375 F)
Prepare a roasting tray by lining the bottom with tin foil and adding two tablespoons of oil and three tablespoons of water.
Place the chicken into the tray and pour the remaining two tablespoons of oil over the skin.
Sprinkle on the chopped herbs, cajun seasoning, salt and pepper.
Crush the stock cube and sprinkle on top of the chicken.
Place a large sheet of tin foil on top of the chicken and wrap loosely.
Calculate the cooking time for the chicken by it's weight:
20 minutes per 450g (1 lb)
(E.g. A 1500g chicken will take 60 minutes)
Place the chicken in the oven and cook to the time calculated above
Remove from oven and remove the tin foil from the top of the chicken.
Using a large spoon, carefully spoon the oil from the tray on top of the chicken and place back into the oven for 30 minutes.
Take the chicken out of the oven and check it is cooked by placing a knife into the thickest part of the chicken and ensuring there is no blood in the juices.
Leave to rest for at least 10 minutes then carve and serve.
