Ingredients:
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1  lemon, zested and juiced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
¼ teaspoon salt
2 cups finely chopped cooked chicken
1 ½ cups water
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
½ cup half-and-half
½ cup shredded carrots
1 tablespoon pesto sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Combine chicken stock and quinoa in a large pot over high heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
Whisk lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, and salt in a small bowl to make lemon dressing.
Stir lemon dressing, chicken, water, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, half-and-half, carrots, pesto sauce, and oregano into the cooked quinoa. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thick and creamy, about 15 minutes. Spoon into individual bowls.

Description: 
This is a copycat recipe of First Watch®'s Quinoa Power Bowl. I think you are really going to enjoy this protein-packed quinoa mixed with grilled chicken, lemon, feta, roasted tomatoes, and shredded carrots. The recipe is quite simple, and the dish is a complete meal all-in-one, so it takes the guesswork out of what side dishes to prepare to ensure a balanced meal of protein, whole grains, and fresh veggies.
