Turkey Meatballs Florentine Recipe

Ingredients:
1 lb ground turkey
1 handful chopped spinach, fresh, raw
1 egg
1/3 cup breadcrumbs
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp dried minced garlic
3 tbsp olive oil, seperate
1 14oz container low sodium chicken broth
1 pkg baby bella mushrooms, sliced
1/4 tsp dried sage
1/4 tsp dried thyme
1/4 tsp rosemary
2 tbsp cornstarch
1/2 cup cool water
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl add the turkey, spinach, egg, onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, and salt and pepper to taste. With your hands lightly mix until the egg is combined, but do not over mix. Gently shape into golf ball sized balls, making sure not to over-press the mix or it will be hard.
In a frying pan with sides, heat 2 tbsps olive oil. Cook the meatballs in the pan until they are nicely browned on all sides. It's ok if they're not fully cooked, but they should be mostly cooked at this point. Remove the meatballs and let rest.
In the same fry pan add the last tbsp of olive oil. Add the mushrooms and saute until they start to soften.
Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes. Then, add the spices, and salt and pepper to taste, to the broth.
In a cup place the cornstarch and water. Mix well, then pour it into the boiling broth. Stir well, and when thickened, turn to low.
Return the meatballs to the pan and continue cooking if needed, or let sit until ready to enjoy. Serve over pasta, rice or mashed potatoes.
