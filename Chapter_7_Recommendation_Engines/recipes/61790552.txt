Ingredients:
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
10 ounces chopped fresh spinach
3 ounces reduced fat cream cheese, softened
3 ounces fat free ricotta cheese
1 cup fat-free milk
1 cup egg substitute
1/4 teaspoon pepper
6 ounces shredded reduced or low fat cheese
5 fresh mushrooms, sliced OR 1 can mushrooms

Directions:
Coat a skillet with nonstick cooking spray and place over medium heat. Add onions and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 min. Add spinach to pan in batches, adding more when the spinach cooks down a little. Cook, stirring constantly, until all the spinach has been added and is cooked, about 5 minutes after the last batch is added. Set aside to cool.
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and ricotta. Add milk, egg substitute and pepper; beat until smooth. Stir in the canned mushrooms, the cheese, and the spinach mixture.
Transfer to a 10-in. quiche pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
