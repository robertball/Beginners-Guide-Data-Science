Ingredients:
Nonstick spray
1 (15 ounce) package ready-made pie crust containing 2 pie crusts (PillsburyÂ®)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
10 ounces fresh baby spinach
1/3 cup diced dried apricots
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons slivered California Almonds, roasted*
Special equipment
Dry beans or pie weights
6-inch tart pans with removable bottoms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 4 tart pans with nonstick spray. Cut pie crusts into fourths, and insert each piece into a tart pan, pressing so it fits and trimming loose ends. Fill with dry beans or pie weights, and bake on a baking sheet 15-20 minutes, or until edges are golden brown. Let cool on rack, and then remove beans or pie weights.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet or wok. Add garlic and simmer on low heat until it turns just a shade darker; turn heat to medium, add spinach and saute, working in 2 batches if pan isn't big enough. Gently stir in apricots and butter while spinach is still hot, then sprinkle in almonds.
Fill each tart shell with spinach mixture and serve immediately.
