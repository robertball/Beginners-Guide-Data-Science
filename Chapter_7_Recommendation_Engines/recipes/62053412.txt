Ingredients:
2 pkg. boneless chicken cutlets
3 tbsp. olive oil
1 tbsp. butter
1 sm. onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, chopped.
1 bag spinach, washed and torn
Salt, pepper & garlic powder to taste
1 c. + 1 tbsp. Wondra
4 oz. shredded swiss
1/3 c. parmesan
1/3 c. white wine
1 can chicken broth
1/3 c. parmesan
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place chicken between sheets of wax paper and pound to thin out.  Preheat large skillet then add 1 tbsp. olive oil and 1 tbsp. butter.  Saute onion until tender and then add garlic.  Saute another minute and then add spinach and saute until wilted.  Stir in salt, pepper & a little garlic powder.  Let cool then pour into food processor and process slightly. Add swiss and parmesan and mix together.
Mound about 2 tbsp. spinach mixture in center of each chicken breast.  Roll up and secure with toothpicks.  Lightly coat outside of each roll in Wondra.  Preheat 2 tbsp. olive oil in large skillet.  Saute chicken rolls until golden, turning to cook all sides.  When browned, remove from skillet.  Deglaze pan with white wine and scrape up browned bits including any spinach mixture that falls out of rolls when cooking.  Add chicken broth, parmesan and salt & pepper and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  When boiling, reduce heat and gradually stir in 1 tbsp. Wondra until thickened.   Return chicken to pan and bake at 350 approx. 15 min. until chicken is cooked through.
