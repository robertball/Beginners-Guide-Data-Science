Description: 
EVERY TIME I serve this simple but elegant dessert to guests, I have to give them the recipe, too.    I found this dessert recipe in the early '50s and since then, it has earned a place in my tried-and-true file.    I had to make adjustments to prepare it for two people, but it can be easily increased to serve any number. -Merval Harvey, Glennie, Michigan
