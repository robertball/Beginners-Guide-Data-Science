Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup hot pepper sauce
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the buttermilk and hot pepper sauce. Place chicken in the mixture to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a separate medium bowl, mix dry bread crumbs, flour, onion powder, cornstarch, white sugar, garlic salt, salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Thoroughly coat the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.
Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and cook chicken 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until lightly browned.
Transfer chicken to a medium baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
