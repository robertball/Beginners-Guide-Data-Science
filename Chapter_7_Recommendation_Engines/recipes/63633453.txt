Ingredients:
3 cups All-Purpose Flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
2 TBS ground cinnamon
2 cups sugar
1 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp ground nutmeg
3 eggs, well-beaten
1 1/4 cups canola oil
2 pints blueberries (mash about 1 cup of these)
2 tsp lemon extract
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease 2 large loaf pans.
Mix 1/4 cup of the sugar and half of the cinnamon. Sprinkle pan and top of bread with this mixture. Place flour, salt, baking soda, sugar, cloves, nutmeg and the remaining cinnamon in a large bowl.
Make a well in the center of dry ingredients. Add eggs, oil and lemon extract. Stir until dry ingredients are moistened.
Stir in the blueberries and nuts. Mashing some of the blueberries give the bread a nice blueberry color. If you use frozen blueberries, make sure they are frozen plain and not sugared.
Divide batter between two loaf pans. Bake 1 hour. To remove the loaves from their pans without losing the sugary topping, try this trick: double a sheet of alumminum foil, cut it half the width of the pan and place it in the greased bread pan, up and over the edges, then pour in the batter. This will give you a handy way to lift the bread right out of the pan.
Let cool before eating. It's really even better the next day.
Keep refrigerated.
