Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
3 1/2 cups cooked wild rice
1 cup sliced green grapes
1 cup sliced green onions (optional)
1/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted (optional)
1 tablespoon grated pecans, toasted (optional)
1 tablespoon grated orange rind
1 cup Smucker's速 Sugar Free Orange Marmalade
1/3 cup raspberry vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Spray a large skillet with Crisco cooking spray: heat over medium-high heat until hot.  Add chicken; cook 2 minutes on each side or until lightly browned.
Place chicken in an 11x17-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Bake at 450 for 20 minutes or until cooked through. Remove chicken: cook and cut into 1/4-inch strips.
In a large bowl, combine chicken, rice, green onions, and grapes and pecans, if desired.  Toss well and set aside.  In a small bowl, combine orange rind and next 4 ingredients; stir well.  Pour over chicken mixture; toss well.
Serve salad at room temperature, on lettuce-lined plates, if desired.
