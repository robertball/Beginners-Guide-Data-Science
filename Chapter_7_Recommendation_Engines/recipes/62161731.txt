Description: 
I wanted to make something substantial involving lentils... and this was truly delicious and colorful. My steak n' potatoes lovin' husband thought it was great, and he didn't even complain that it didn't have actual meat in it. I used chicken broth/boullion, but for a vegetarian meal, use vegetable broth.
