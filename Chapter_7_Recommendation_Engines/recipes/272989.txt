10 skewers, or as needed
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
1 pint strawberries, hulled

3 peaches, cut into chunks
3 plums, cut into chunks
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/8 cup chopped fresh mint

Directions:
Soak wooden skewers in water for at least 15 minutes before use to prevent scorching.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Thread 1 piece each of pineapple, strawberries, banana, peaches, and plums onto skewers.
Grill skewers, turning occasionally, for about 10 minutes.
Combine honey, lime juice, and mint in a small bowl. Brush dressing onto kebabs and grill about 4 minutes more.
