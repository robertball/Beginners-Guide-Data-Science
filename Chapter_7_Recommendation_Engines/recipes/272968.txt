Ingredients:
Cake:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
3 large eggs
Sweetened Cream Cheese:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
Whipped Cream:
2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Topping:
12 strawberries, halved
1 (10.5 ounce) package fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin tins with muffin cups.
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set aside.
Combine milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Set aside.
Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in flour and milk mixtures alternatively, both beginning and ending with flour, until thoroughly combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely before transferring to a wire rack.
Meanwhile, place a medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add vanilla and salt; combine. Set aside.
Remove the medium-sized mixing bowl and whisk out of the freezer. Pour heavy whipping cream into the bowl and whip until stiff peaks are about to form. Add confectioners' sugar and vanilla; whip until stiff peaks form, making sure not to overwhip.
Mix together cream cheese and whipped cream mixtures until combined. Frost cooled cupcakes and top with strawberries and blueberries.

Description: 
After I couldn't find a great strawberry shortcake recipe for cupcakes, I decided to make my own for Memorial Day. Even people who don't like blueberries loved these! The frosting is great just to dip strawberries in and eat!
