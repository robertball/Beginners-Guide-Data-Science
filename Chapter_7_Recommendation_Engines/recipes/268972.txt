Ingredients:
Pork Marinade:
2 teaspoons hoisin sauce
2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
10 ounces pork belly, thinly sliced into 1.5-inch pieces
6 ounces king trumpet mushrooms, cut on the bias into 1/4-inch slices
1/2 cup packed napa cabbage kimchi, chopped
1 yellow onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
salt to taste
2 teaspoons sugar

Directions:
Mix hoisin sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, sugar, sesame oil, white pepper, garlic powder, and bouillon together in a bowl and add pork. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes to overnight.
Heat a wok over high heat. Add pork to the hot wok and stir immediately. Cook until pork is slightly golden around the edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate, reserving rendered fat in the wok. Add mushrooms to the wok and fry over high heat without stirring for 1 minute. Cook and stir until mushrooms release liquid and are cooked through, about 7 minutes more. Add kimchi; cook and stir about 1 minute. Add onions and cook 4 minutes more before returning pork to the wok. Fry everything together for an additional 2 minutes. Season with salt, if necessary.
