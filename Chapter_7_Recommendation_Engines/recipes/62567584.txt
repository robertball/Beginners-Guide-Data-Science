Ingredients:
1 box macaroni elbows
1 stick butter
1 (14 oz.) can evaporated milk or cream
1 lb. Velveeta cheese

Boil macaroni in salt water for approximately 7-8 minutes. You do not want it completely done because the process finishes cooking it; drain the water off leaving about 1 cup of water in it/reserved.
Mix in 1 stick of butter, 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 lb. Velveeta cheese.
Heat on medium on stove until all is blended.
Put in glass dish and lay slices of cheese on top. Place in oven on broil until top is melted.
