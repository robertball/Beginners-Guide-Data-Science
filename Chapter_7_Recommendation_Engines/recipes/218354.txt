Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
2 quarts beef stock
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
2 cubes beef bouillon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 (16 ounce) package baby carrots, chopped
6 potatoes, quartered
2 stalks celery, chopped

Directions:
Heat the shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the beef stew meat. Cook and stir until the beef is evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Transfer beef to a large pot, and add beef stock, onion, garlic, bay leaves, beef bouillon, salt, and pepper. Cook on medium heat until beef begins to tender, about 1 hour.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the carrots; cook and stir until the carrots begins to tender. Stir in the potatoes and celery. Continue to cook and stir until all the vegetables are tender. Transfer the vegetables to the large pot. Simmer until the beef is very tender, about 1 hour more.
