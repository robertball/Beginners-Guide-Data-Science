Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package cheese tortellini
1 pound flank steak
garlic powder to taste
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 heads romaine lettuce, torn into bite-size pieces
2 (2.25 ounce) cans small pitted black olives, drained
1 cup Caesar-style croutons
2 small fresh tomatoes, chopped
1 (8 ounce) bottle Caesar salad dressing

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 7 to 9 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Preheat the oven broiler. Season steak with garlic powder, salt, and pepper; rub with olive oil. Place steak in a baking dish, and broil 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. Slice diagonally into thin strips.
In a bowl, toss the cooked tortellini, lettuce, olives, croutons, tomatoes, and dressing. Top with steak strips to serve.

Description: 
A well-balanced meal in a bowl! Goes well with a nice slice of Italian or French bread. This is a FAVE to take to work or school for lunch with both my teenaged daughters and son! I vary how much meat, pasta, and salad I use depending on how many servings I need. If you want to make it in advance or have leftovers, don't add the dressing and croutons beforehand.  Mix croutons right before packaging and send dressing on the side. I make this whenever I have leftover steak!
