Ingredients:
2 medium tart apples, sliced
1 cup diced, cooked chicken breast
1/2 cup shredded fat free Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup fresh or frozen corn, thawed
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 (8 inch) (8 inch) flour tortillas
3/4 cup shredded lettuce
3/4 cup salsa
6 tablespoons fat free sour cream

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Place about 3/4 cup on half of each tortilla. Fold tortilla in half over filling and secure with toothpicks. Place on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
Carefully turn quesadillas over; bake 5-8 minutes longer or until golden. Discard toothpicks. Cut each quesadilla into three wedges; serve with lettuce, salsa and sour cream.

Description: 
My sister came up with easy recipe that can be served as a main course or an appetizer. People are surprised by the combination of chicken, apples, tomatoes and corn inside the crispy tortillas, but they love it.                                       --Stacia Slagle of Maysville, Missouri
