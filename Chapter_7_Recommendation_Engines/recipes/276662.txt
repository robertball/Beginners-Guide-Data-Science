Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons peanut oil
2 beefsteak tomatoes, quartered
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Season beaten eggs with salt.
Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 1/2 of the oil. Pour eggs into the skillet; cook and stir until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove eggs to a plate. Heat remaining oil in the skillet. Add tomatoes; stir briefly. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all juices are released, about 7 minutes.
Stir in sugar to dissolve; add eggs back in and return heat to high. Cook until sauce starts to thicken, 2 to 4 minutes.
