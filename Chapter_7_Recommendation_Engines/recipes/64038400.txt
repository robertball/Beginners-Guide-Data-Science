Ingredients:
1 tbsp. vegetable oil
8 oz. smoked ham
1 large onion - chopped
2 cloves of garlic - minced
2 cups ketchup
1 cup light brown sugar
3/4 cup light molasses
1/2 cup whole grain mustard
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tbsp. hot pepper sauce
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
3 - 15oz. cans of navy beans - drained and rinsed
4-5 slices of bacon
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
Salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Heat oil over high in a large skillet and add ham, onion and garlic.
Cook, stirring often, until onion caramelizes - about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low and add ketchup, brown sugar, molasses, mustard, Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce and red pepper flakes and 4 cups of water.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Let sauce simmer about 10-15 minutes or until slightly thickened.
Stir beans into sauce, cover and put pot into oven.
Bake beans until juices are bubbly and thickened - about 2 hours.
Meanwhile, place bacon slices on a baking pan and roast in oven until crisp - about 10-15 minutes.
Transfer to paper towels to cool and drain.
Reserve 1 tbsp. of bacon drippings.
When bacon is completely cool, coarsely crumble then place in a food processor with reserved drippings and panko.
Pulse until bacon is very finely chopped then season with salt and pepper to taste.
Remove beans from oven and set oven to broil.
Sprinkle beans with bacon breadcrumbs and broil until crumbs are golden brown - about 8-10 minutes.
