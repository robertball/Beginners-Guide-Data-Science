Ingredients:
Crust
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
Filling
3/4 cup + 2 tbsp sugar
3 tbsp all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
4 large eggs
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tbsp butter, melted and cooled
2 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a 9Ã—13-inch baking pan.
Begin by making the crust. In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter, until smooth and fluffy. Working at a low speed, gradually beat in flour and salt until mixture is crumbly. Pour mixture into prepared pan and press into an even layer. Bake for 15-17 minutes, until it just begins to turn golden brown.
While the crust bakes, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, or the bowl of a food processor, combine all filling ingredients and whisk (or pulse) until mixture is well combined and very smooth.
When crust is done, pour the filling into the hot crust and return to oven. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until filling is just set. Cool bars on a wire rack. Chill before slicing.
