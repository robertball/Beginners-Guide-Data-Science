Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 Philly-Gourmet Steaks for Sandwiches (Steak Ems)
1 onion, sliced, not chopped.
1 green pepper, sliced.
1/2 cup soy sauce.
Cajun seasoning
2 slices Pita Bread
2 pieces of swiss cheese
4 TBS Ranch dressing
2 TBS Texas Pete optional
Lettuce, tomato optional

Directions:
The first thing you want to do is slice up the onion and green pepper and put the slices in a pan. Cover them with the soy sauce and cajun seasoning. Cook covered on medium, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened some. Usually about 5 minutes. Put the Pita bread between 2 wet paper towels and microwave. Times vary but usually about 15 seconds, or until Pita bread is soft. Cook the Steak Ems for 45 seconds on one side, and 15 seconds on the other. Add swiss cheese to the Pita bread, then the steak, then the onions and peppers. Garnish with whatever you like such as lettuce and tomato. You can either put ranch on top of it all, or I mix together Texas Pete and ranch and pour on for a spicy taste.

One of my favorite parts of the state fair is getting to eat their amazing gyros! I taught myself a simple way to make them anytime I want!
