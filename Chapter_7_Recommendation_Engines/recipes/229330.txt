Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1/2 onion, chopped
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup small chunks of bread
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon sage
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup ketchup, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Thoroughly mix ground beef, onion, eggs, bread, milk, green bell pepper, salt, sage, and black pepper together in a bowl. Press into a loaf pan. Spread ketchup over the top of the loaf.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a family recipe that is a big favorite at our house. By using fresh bread instead of dried bread crumbs, you get a meatloaf that is moist and delicious.
