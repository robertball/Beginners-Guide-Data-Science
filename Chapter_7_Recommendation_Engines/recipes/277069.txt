Ingredients:
1 Fuyu persimmon, stem removed and sliced into rounds
1 (4 ounce) ball burrata cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic glaze
1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
5 leaves fresh basil, or more to taste
freshly ground black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Place persimmon rounds on a platter. Cut burrata ball into 5 or 6 pieces, ensuring that each piece has some of the firm outer shell (mozzarella) as well as some of the creamy inside (stracciatella and cream). Distribute burrata pieces around persimmon rounds. Drizzle with balsamic glaze and olive oil. Scatter basil leaves on top and sprinkle with pepper.
