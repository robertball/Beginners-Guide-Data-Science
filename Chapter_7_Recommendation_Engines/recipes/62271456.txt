Title:
The World's Best BBQ Chicken Breasts Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless Chicken Breasts
6 Tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Juice from 1/2 lemon
2 crushed garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
Coarsely ground black pepper
Salt used just before dropping them onto the BBQ, 'cos we don't want it in the marinade!

Directions:
Slice each chicken breast horizontally in half ALMOST through, then open it up like a book.
Place between 2 sheets of clingfilm (Saran wrap) and flatten with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Be careful not to flatten it too much or the meat texture will be ruined and it will taste dry).
Mix the Olive Oil, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, rosemary and black pepper to make a marinade.
Put the chicken pieces in a large shallow dish, cover with the marinade and refrigerate for 6 hours (can even be made the day before and taken out when wanted!).
Just before putting on the BBQ, or in a very hot griddle pan, season each of the breasts with around 4 pinches of salt.
Cook for 2 minutes each side, or until attractive brown sear marks make it look good.
Serve immediately, maybe with my Courgette (Zucchini) Ribbons.

Description: 
Simple, quick to prepare, easy to cook. Moist, tender, succulent. Everyone I know has asked me for this recipe. And it can be done the day before to give you more time with your guests.
Another recipe from a Michelin-starred Chef, it is always a very popular thing for the BBQ. Can be cooked indoors, but it might spray a fine oil mist around so you may need to cover your pan with a thin mesh thingy!
