Ingredients:
2 large sweet potatoes, cooked until tender
1/3 cup tahini
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons cold fresh water (optional)
1 pinch ground Aleppo pepper
freshly chopped parsley leaves for garnish

Directions:
Scoop sweet potato flesh into a bowl. Let cool to room temperature.
Add tahini and garlic to the sweet potatoes. Season with salt, cumin, chipotle, and cayenne. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil and lemon juice. Mash until hummus reaches desired smoothness. Add water to lighten the texture; whisk in 1 tablespoon at a time.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Transfer hummus to a serving bowl. Drizzle remaining olive oil, Aleppo pepper, and parsley over the top.

Description: 
This was simply a case of me wanting hummus, not having garbanzo beans, and making it anyway with sweet potatoes. I don't blame you if you're skeptical, but this stuff has the same taste and texture as hummus, just with a slightly sweet finish reminiscent of red pepper hummus. My wife, Michele, who has a much more discerning palate than I do, said that if blindfolded, she'd have trouble distinguishing this from real hummus.
