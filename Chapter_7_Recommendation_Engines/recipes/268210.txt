Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
1 bunch fresh basil, chopped
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
3/4 cup blanched almonds
4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti

Directions:
Crush garlic using a mortar and pestle. Add basil leaves gradually, making circular movements with the pestle, until a smooth paste forms. Season with salt. Transfer to a bowl and mix in olive oil.
Add almonds to a skillet over medium heat and toast, while stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add to mortar and pestle and crush into a coarse flour. Mix with basil paste in the bowl. Stir in tomatoes and add more olive oil if you like more sauce. Mix in Parmesan cheese and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and mix with pesto.
