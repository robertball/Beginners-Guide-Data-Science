Ingredients:
6 (12 inch) whole wheat tortillas
6 leaves romaine lettuce
1 1/4 pounds sliced roast beef
1 cup chopped tomatoes
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons ground cumin

Directions:
For each roll-up, tear off about a 15 inch piece of wax paper or aluminum foil. Place the tortilla on the paper or foil. Place a romaine lettuce leaf on top of the tortilla. Add about 3 ounces of beef on top of the lettuce for each tortilla. Divide the tomatoes, red and yellow bell peppers, oil, vinegar and cumin over each tortilla.
Begin rolling the paper or foil over the tortilla to encase the filling. Roll until the sandwich is completely rolled up. To eat, peel back the paper or foil.
