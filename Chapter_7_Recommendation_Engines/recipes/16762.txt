Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, divided
2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided
3 tomatoes, cubed
4 ounces fresh basil, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 (6 ounce) swordfish steaks

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place 1/4 cup butter and 1 teaspoon garlic in a medium pot over medium-low heat. When the butter is melted, stir in the tomatoes, basil, and lime juice. Just before the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low.
In a small pot, melt the remaining butter, and mix in the remaining garlic.
Arrange the swordfish in a baking pan, and drizzle with the butter and garlic mixture from the small pot.
Bake the fish for 7 minutes in the preheated oven. Turn fish, and continue baking 7 minutes, or until easily flaked with a fork. Spoon the tomato mixture over the fish to serve. Also top with remaining butter and garlic sauce from the baking pan.
