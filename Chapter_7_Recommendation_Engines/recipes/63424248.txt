Ingredients:
9 inch pie shell, baked and cooled
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cups water
3 egg yolks, slightly beaten
3 tblsp. butter or margarine
2 tsp. grated lemon peel
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 drops yellow food color
3 egg whites
1/4 tsp. cream of tartar
6 tblsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Heat oven to 400F.  Mix sugarand cornstarch in medium saucepan.  Gradually stir in water.  Cook over medium heat,stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils.  Boil and stir one minute.  Gradually stir one half of the mixture into the beaten egg yolks.  Stir egg mixture back into the remaining hot mixture.  Boil and stir another 1 minute.  Remove from heat; stir in butter, lemon peel, lemon juice and food color.  Pour into baked pie shell.
Make Meringue:  Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy.  Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Continue beating until stiff and glossy.  Do not underbeat.  Beat in vanilla.
Heap meringue onto hot pie filling.  Spread over filling, carefully sealing meringue to edge of crust to prevent shrinking or weeping.
Bake about 10 minutes or until a delicate brown.  Cool away from draft.
