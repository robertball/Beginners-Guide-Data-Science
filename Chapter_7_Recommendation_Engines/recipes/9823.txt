Ingredients:
1/2 cup corn oil spread
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 egg whites
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 cup golden raisins
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray a large cookie sheet with non-stick  spray.
In a large bowl, with a mixer set on low speed, beat corn-oil spread and brown  sugar until blended.  Increase speed to high; beat until well combined, about 3 minutes.  At low speed, add egg whites, egg, and vanilla; beat until smooth.
With spoon, stir in flour, oats, raisins, baking powder, and salt until combined.
Drop dough by heaping tablespoons, about 2 inches apart, on cookie sheet.    Flatten dough into 3-inch circles.  Bake cookies 16-18 minutes or until golden   brown.  With a pancake turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool for 15   minutes.  Store cookies in tightly covered container.
