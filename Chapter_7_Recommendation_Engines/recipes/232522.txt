Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
1/3 pound cottage cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 pound shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 pound shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.
Mix spinach, cottage cheese, eggs, nutmeg and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Stir flour into Cheddar cheese and Swiss cheese in another bowl until cheeses are coated; add cheese mixture to spinach mixture. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the spinach mixture does not wiggle, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Not really a souffle since the eggs are not separated, but it is not as tricky either. 
You can use fresh spinach by steaming two 1-pound bags.
