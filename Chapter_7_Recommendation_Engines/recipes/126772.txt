Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 lemon grass, minced
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces
2/3 cup water
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the lemon grass, cooking until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.  Place the chicken into the skillet. Cook and stir the chicken until no longer pink in the center and the skin is browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the water, fish sauce, and curry powder. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
Mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of the curry sauce in a small bowl, until smooth. Stir cornstarch mixture into the skillet and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro before serving.

Description: 
This recipe has been passed down from my grandmother in Vietnam and makes the best aromatic, slightly spicy chicken curry ever. Fresh lemongrass is the secret! Serve over white or sticky rice and you're in heaven.
