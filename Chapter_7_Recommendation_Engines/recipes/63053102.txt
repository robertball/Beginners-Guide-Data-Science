Ingredients:
2 Cups all purpose flour
2 Tbsp sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 C low fat buttermilk
1/3 Cup melter butter
2 large eggs
1 tsp pure vanilla

Directions:
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in medium size bowl.  Whisk to combine ingredients well.
In large microwave safe bowl, places butter, cut in pieces.  Melt on high setting about 30 seconds.  Check--some small pieces might remain, and you can just stir them with melted part until blended.
Add buttermilk to butter, and whisk.  Add lightly beaten eggs and whisk all together well.
Add wet to dry ingredients, and like any "quick bread" stir until just combined.  There will be some lumps remaining--DO NOT OVER BEAT.  Add vanilla.
Let set while you heat your waffle iron.
You can heat the oven to about 250 to 275, and place a rack on a cookie sheet to keep waffles warm as you make the whole batch.
Put enough batter in your iron to fill til about 1/2" from edge, or according to the instructions that came with your appliance.
I have made only tradional waffles with this, but want to try it as a Belgian waffle soon.

Description: 
An easy waffle recipe that results in a nice crisp outside, and tender middle waffle.
I love the results this gives, while not having to separate the eggs, and take time to whip egg whites!
