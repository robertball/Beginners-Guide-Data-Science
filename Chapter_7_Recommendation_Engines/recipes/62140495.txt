Ingredients:
For The Plantain Crisps:
4 Green Plantains, peeled and sliced thinly on the bias
Oil for frying
Chili Powder (to taste)
For The Stewed Goat:
2 lb. bone in should of goat
2 Carrots, roughly chopped
1 Large onion, quartered
4 Cloves of garlic, roughly crushed
2 Adobo chilies
4 jalapenos
4 Cups red wine
Water
Salt and pepper (to taste
For The Pico de Gallo:
4 Large tomatoes, seeded and chopped finely
1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped finely
juice of 1/2 lime
1/4 Cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 red onion, finely chopped
Accompaniements:
Soured Cream
Crumbled Mexican Queso Fresco (or feta)
Chopped spring onions
lime wedges

Directions:
For The Plantains:
1. Preheat oil to high heat, about 360 F. Add plantain crisps and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
2. Drain excess oil and sprinkle on chili powder.
For the goat:
1. Add all of the ingredients to a large stockpot or souppot, and add enough water to cover.
2. bring up to a boil, then reduce to a vigourous simmer.  Cook for 45 minutes, or until goat falls off of the bone.
3. Remove from the heat, remove the goat from the stock, then allow to cool.
4. Once cooled, shred all of the meat, removing all of the fat and bone, leaving only the shredded meat.  I use two forks for this.
5. Set aside.
For The Pico De Gallo:
1. Mix all of the ingredients together, and set aside.
Assembly:
place even amounts of plantain crisps on each plate.
On top of this place even amounts of shredded goat.
Allow guests to serve themselves the pico de gallo and acommpaniments.
