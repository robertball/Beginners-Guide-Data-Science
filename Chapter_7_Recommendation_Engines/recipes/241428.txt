Ingredients:
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
4 matzo crackers, broken into small pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 (8 ounce) package assorted sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
6 large eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate or 2-quart casserole dish.
Heat broth in the microwave or on stovetop until hot, but not boiling. Pour broth over matzo pieces in a large bowl; let soak until matzo absorbs broth, about 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Cook and stir onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in the hot oil until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted and browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
Stir mushroom mixture and parsley into matzo mixture. Beat eggs with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a bowl until blended; stir into matzo mixture and pour into prepared pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before serving.
