Ingredients:
1 pound split peas
2 cups diced ham
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 cups water
1 medium onion, diced
2 medium carrots, finely diced
4 celery stalks, trimmed
1 tsp black pepper
2 tsp ham soup base (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except the soup base in a slow cooker and cook on Low for 6 hours or high for 3 hours, until peas are creamy and onions are dissolved. Do not disturb.
Remove celery stalks. If the soup needs a bit more ham flavor, add the soup base, stir and wait 30 minutes before serving, to allow the soup base to completely dissolve and the flavors to mellow. Serve with hot honey-buttered cornbread.
Variations: If you have a leftover ham bone, by all means, use it instead of the diced ham. Toss the bone into the soup at the start, even if frozen. It doesn't matter. When the soup is done, remove the bone, shred off the meat and return the meat to the soup. Be sure to taste before adding any soup base, you may not need any. Skim off any fat before serving.
