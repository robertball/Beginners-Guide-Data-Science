Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1/2 cup soy milk
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
1 pound ground turkey
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/4 cup non-dairy Parmesan cheese substitute
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
coarsely ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil over a rimmed baking sheet.
Combine milk and oats in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until milk is very hot, but not boiling. Reduce heat and simmer until mixture is the consistency of oatmeal, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
Combine turkey, egg, Parmesan cheese substitute, parsley, garlic powder, nutmeg, and pepper in a large bowl. Add cooled oatmeal mixture. Stir with a sturdy spoon or spatula until well combined. Form into 28 meatballs and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway, until cooked through and evenly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
