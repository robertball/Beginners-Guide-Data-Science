Ingredients:
1/2 can (14-16 oz) black beans, drained
1/4 tsp cumin
Juice of 1 lime
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 Tbsp canola or olive oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 oz each)
1 cup prepared salsa, preferably salsa verde
1 cup shredded Pepper Jack cheese
Chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 F. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper and sear in the hot pan for 3-4 minutes on the first side, until a nice crust develops, then flip. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, then spoon the salsa over the meat, top with cheese and place in oven. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is fully melted and bubbly, no more than 5 minutes. While cooking, prepare beans.
Combine the black beans and cumin in a saucepan and heat all the way through. Squeeze in the lime juice and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Keep warm.
Divide beans among 4 plates, top with chicken, and garnish with cilantro.
