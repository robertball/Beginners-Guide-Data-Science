Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus spears, trimmed and cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces
1 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
1  yellow squash, peeled and diced
1 medium onion, chopped
6 tablespoons butter, melted, divided
6  chicken breasts, sliced in half horizontally
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine asparagus, mushrooms, squash, and onion in a baking dish. Add 3 tablespoons melted butter and stir to combine.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir; leave oven on.
Place chicken breasts on top of vegetables in the baking dish and pour remaining melted butter on top. Season with seasoned salt. Return baking dish to the oven and cook 15 minutes more.
Remove from the oven, turn chicken breasts over, and stir vegetables. Spoon juices from the bottom of the baking dish over chicken. Return to the oven and bake until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and juices are clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
