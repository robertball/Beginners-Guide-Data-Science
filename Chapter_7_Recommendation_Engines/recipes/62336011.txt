Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds cod
1 cup salsa
1 cup shredded Colby/Jack
1/2 cup coarsely crushed corn chips
1/2 tsp ground cumin
Shredded lettuce
Tomato(s) cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). LIne one 8x12 inch baking dish with foil to ease cleanup. Spray lightly with cooking oil.  Rinse fish fillets under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Lay fillets side by side in the prepared baking dish. Pour the salsa over the top, and sprinkle each filet evenly with a pinch of ground cumine. Top with the crushed corn chips, then cover with the shredded cheese.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until fish is opaque and flakes with a fork. Seperate filets with a spatula and serve on a bed of shredded lettuce with tomato wedges for added color.

Description: 
A pinch of cumin on each filet adds another notch to a near perfect dish.  Putting the cheese on last makes it easier to serve. Lining the dish with foil speeds cleanup.Modified from: Mexican Baked Fish
