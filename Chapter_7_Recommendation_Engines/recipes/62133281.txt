Ingredients:
130 pound fully dressed hog
80 pounds charcoal
32 ounces apple juice
3 cinnamon sticks
2 lemons, squeezed and quartered
1 cup honey
Water, if necessary
BBQ Sauce and Buns

Directions:
Preheat the roaster with half the charcoal (40 pounds) for 30 - 60 minutes.
Wrap the hog in chicken wire to hold it all together.
Place hog in roaster.
In a saucepan add the apple juice, cinnamon sticks, lemons and honey to make the injection.  If it needs thinned out, add some water.  Simmer for 15 minutes.
After the hog has cooked for about an hour (the skin is softer and easier to puncture), inject half the liquid mixture into the thicker parts of the hog.
Inject the remaining liquid mixture as often as you want (we do it at least twice).
Add remaining charcoal when needed.
Cook hog to an internal temperature of at least 170 degrees (we let ours go to 180).
Remove hog from roaster and put on a covered table.
Cut away the chicken wire and pull off the skin.
Let the hog cool for about 30 minutes.
Put on latex gloves and pull the pork off the bone.
Place the pork into large pans (ours are roasters that plug in to keep the pork hot).
Serve with BBQ and buns.

Description: 
We have co-hosted an annual Pig Roast for the past six years with our neighbor.  A few hundred kids and adults attend the event.  We play yard games and eat lots of great side dishes that everyone brings.  Everyone always comments about how great the pork tastes and how tender it is.  People are truly disappointed when they cannot attend!
