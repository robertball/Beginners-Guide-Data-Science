Ingredients:
Seafood Boil Seasoning
Andouille sausages
Corn
Potatoes
Crab legs
Shrimp

Directions:
First, and foremost, wash your seafood and vegetables thoroughly.
In a large pot pile seafood boil seasoning, Andouille sausages, corn and potatoes. Fill pot with water just enough to cover your food pile so far.
Boil for 15-20 minutes, or until potatoes are cooked. Potatoes are cooked once you can easily poke a fork through them.
You should still have plenty of water in your pot to steam the seafood, but it wouldn’t hurt to double check. Make sure you have 1-2 inches of water left in your pot.
On top of your current sausage, corn, and potatoes pile, stack crab legs, shrimp, and any other seafood that you are adding to your crab boil.
Steam for 5-7 minutes, just enough until your shrimp turns pink. You don’t want to overcook your seafood, so turn your stove off as soon as your shrimp turn pink.
Congratulations, you made your first crab boil, and now you can get fancy with it next time.

They are so easy to make, but if you don’t know what you are doing, it is very easy to ruin your precious dinner. Our first crab boil was an over spiced seafood soup because we had no idea what we were doing. Once you learn how to stack your ingredients correc
