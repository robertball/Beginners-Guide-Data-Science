Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Blend together cream cheese, butter, brown sugar, vanilla, and almond extract with an electric mixer until starting to become stiff. Pour in honey. Beat together until mixture is whipped, making sure not to overmix as it will collapse.
Use immediately or store in a sealed container in the refrigerator until use.

Description: 
This is an alternative to the classic recipe that calls for powdered sugar. We use it to frost cocktail cake. Try it on applesauce, spice, banana, or carrot cakes too.
