Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups AP flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
12 tablespoons butter
1 cup sugar
3 large Gala apples
2 tablespoons cinnamon
1 cinnamon stick
4 tablespoons honey
1 cup toasted pecans

Directions:
Grease a 9 by 5 by 3 inch loaf pan.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Peel the apples and cube.
Put the apples along with 4 tablespoon of butter, cinnamon stick, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, and 4 tablespoons of honey in a pot. Put a top on the pot on medium heat. Let them cook for ten minutes, stirring every two.
While apples are simmering, sift flour, baking powder, and salt, set aside.
In a stand mixer, cream butter, remaining cinnamon, and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time until fully incorperated and add vanilla.
When apples are done, fully mash them and add to the mixture in the mixer.
Chop up toasted pecan pieces and add to the mix.
With a rubber spatula, mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated.
Transfer batter to the greased loaf pan.
Bake for about 60 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool on a wire rack and then enjoy!
