Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, (unsalted) softened
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1  teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, butter, cream cheese, salt, almond and vanilla extracts, and egg. Beat until smooth. Stir in flour until well blended. Chill the dough for minimum 2 hours up to overnight.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
On a lightly covered with powdered sugared surface, roll out the dough 1/3 at a time to 1/4 inch thickness, refrigerating remaining dough until ready to use. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters dusted with powdered sugar. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Leave cookies plain for frosting, or brush with slightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with candy sprinkles or colored sugar.
Bake for 7 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light and golden brown. Cool cookies completely before frosting.
