Ingredients:
2 fajita size flour tortillas
1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese (or white Mexican cheese appropriate for melting)
2 slices ham (sandwich type)

Directions:
Warm a griddle to medium heat, or a flat pan on a stove burner set to medium.  Sprinkle half the cheese over one of the tortillas, add the ham slices, then sprinkle the rest of the cheese over the ham.  Top with the second tortilla.  Cook the sincronizada on the griddle or pan until tortillas are lightly toasted and the cheese has melted, turning with a spatula or tongs to toast both sides.

Description: 
Sincronizadas are quesadillas made with ham and chesse.  They were a common light meal in the part of Mexico where I stayed this year and make a quick and easy breakfast or lunch.  Serve with your favorite salsa or canned chile slices.
