Ingredients:
8 cups water
2 tomatoes, halved
12 jalapeno peppers, stems removed
1 large white onion, quartered
10 tomatillos, halved
8 serrano peppers, stems removed
6 cloves garlic, peeled
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine water, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, onion, tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until vegetables are fork-tender, about 30 minutes.
Transfer the vegetables to a blender with a slotted spoon, allowing the cooking liquid to drain back into the pot. Cover the blender and hold the lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times to combine. Blend until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is my go-to enchilada sauce recipe. It is definitely better than the canned stuff and you can use it for anything! I use it for enchiladas, Mexican casseroles, and as a smother for burritos. Blend the sauce with equal parts plain Greek yogurt for a delicious green chile 'sour cream' for your next taco bar! I always save the spicy liquid that remains in the pot for a broth for soups.
