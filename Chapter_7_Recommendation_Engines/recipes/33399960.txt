Ingredients:
5-6 Thick Slices of Good Crusty Bread, cubed
5 Eggs
1 Pint Half & Half
1 Tbsp Dried Parsley
1 Tbsp Dried Tarragon
Salt & Pepper to taste
2 1/2 to 3 Cups Shredded Fontina Cheese
2-3 Small Tomatoes, diced
Several Fresh Basil Leaves, chopped
3-4 Slices Prosciutto Ham, chopped
Cooking Spray

Directions:
Spray the bottom and sides of an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray.
Place the cubed bread in the pan.
Add the tomatoes, basil, prosciutto and all but one cup of the cheese and combine until ingredients are evenly distributed.
Whisk the eggs and combine with the half & half, parsley, tarragon, salt and pepper.
Pour the egg mixture over the bread mixture.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight.
When you're ready to bake it, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Remove the casserole from the refrigerator at least 20 minutes before baking.
Remove the plastic wrap and top the bread/egg mixture with the remaining 1 Cup of cheese.
Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.
Remove the foil and continue baking for 15 minutes or until all cheese is melted and beginning to brown and the egg mixture is browned and bubbly and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Allow to sit for about 5 minutes before serving.
Enjoy!
