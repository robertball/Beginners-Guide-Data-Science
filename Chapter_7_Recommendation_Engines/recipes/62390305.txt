Ingredients:
12 oz fresh goat cheese
1/2 C toasted pine nuts
1 small onion, diced and saut√©ed in 1/2 T olive oil
1 finely grated carrot
1 t grated fresh ginger (or 1/4 t ground ginger)
12 large mint leaves
6 leaf lettuce leaves
6 large rice papers

Directions:
In a small skillet, toast the pine nuts on medium heat without any oil. Stir constantly to avoid burning. Reserve in a medium bowl.
In the same skillet heat 1/2 - 1 T olive oil and cook the onions until transparent. Add to the bowl with the toasted pine nuts. Allow to cool.
When cool, add the fresh goat cheese, ginger and grated carrot. Mix well with a fork.
One by one , wet a rice paper carefully in a shallow dish of water. Place on a level, non stick working surface. Place 2 large mint leaves in the center and cover with a piece of leaf lettuce to fill the size of the rice paper. Add the goat cheese mixture in the center in a "roll" of about 3/4" in diameter. Roll carefully, tucking in the ends of the rice paper at mid-roll so that nothing leaks out.The humid rice paper should stick to itself to "seal" the ends and edges.  Cut a rectangular piece of plastic wrap to hermetically protect each roll. Refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the cheese to set.
When ready to serve, unroll each and slice into 1/2" - 3/4" slices, serve on a platter.

Description: 
An interesting mix of tastes most are not used to. This is something I make for summer dinner buffet parties. Everybody always leaves with the recipe.
