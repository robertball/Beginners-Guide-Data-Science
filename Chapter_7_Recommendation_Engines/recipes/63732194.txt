Ingredients:
1 Tub Cool Whip (8 oz.)
1 Cup White Sugar
1 Tablespoon Vanilla Extract
1 Cup Sour Cream
1 Brick Cream Cheese
1 Graham Cracker Crust
Topping of Choice

Directions:
Mix the first four ingredients well until blended.
Remove wrapper and cut the cream cheese into six small bricks. Microwave at 30 second intervals until warm and slightly melted but not discolored. Blend with the first four ingredients.
For a light and fluffy cheesecake, use and electric blender and beat very well at a higher speed. For a heavier cheesecake, mix by hand until blended.
Once blended pour the mixture into the graham cracker crust.
When putting on the topping, if it is anything frozen, for example frozen fruit, do not put it on until just before serving. If it is something like chocolate chips or a premade pie filling such as cherry, you can put on before refrigeration or right before serving.
Refrigerate for 4-5 hours or until set (aka it doesn't jiggle if lightly shaken.)

Description: 
This is a quick and easy cheesecake recipe created by my grandmother and handed down through three generations. Each has made their own special touch to it but the overall taste is the same. Blue Ribbon flavor for years of happy memories!
