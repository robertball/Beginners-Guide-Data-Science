Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 cloves garlic
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup concentrated chicken stock
3/4 cup water
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (ground can be used)
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Season the flour with salt and pepper and dredge the chicken breasts in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat and saute the chicken until it is nicely browned on one side (about 3 minutes).
Add the garlic. Turn the chicken breasts and continue frying. Cook for about 3 minutes, then add the vinegar, broth, bay leaf and thyme. Cover tightly and simmer over medium low heat for 10 minutes, turning occasionally.
Transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter and cover with foil. Set aside. Continue simmering the sauce, uncovered, over medium high heat for about 7 minutes. Swirl in the butter or margarine and discard the bay leaf.
Roughly chop the chicken breasts.  Serve over linguine, spooning the sauce over both.
