Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup instant coffee crystals (such as Folgers® Classic Roast)
2 cups light brown sugar
2 cups lightly packed dark brown sugar
1 (750 milliliter) bottle 190 proof grain alcohol (such as Everclear®)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise and halved

Directions:
Combine water and instant coffee in a pot; bring to a boil. Stir light brown sugar and dark brown sugar into coffee, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring every 15 minutes, for 3 hours. Remove from heat and cool completely.
Pour coffee mixture into a clean, large glass jar. Add grain alcohol, vanilla extract, and vanilla bean; cover with a tight-fitting lid. Let sit in a dark place, shaking occasionally, for 1 month. Divide into bottles, leaving a piece of vanilla bean in each.

Description: 
This recipe I love to make around Thanksgiving to drink or give as presents at Christmastime. The longer you wait the better it is, try and wait 4 weeks. I got this recipe from one of my own concoctions from trying several different recipes.
