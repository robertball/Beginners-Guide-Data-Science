1 cup whole natural almonds
1 cup unsalted peanuts
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl stir together oats, coconut, almonds, peanuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a small saucepan melt butter and honey over low heat, stirring occasionally. Pour butter mixture over oat mixture and toss to combine well.
