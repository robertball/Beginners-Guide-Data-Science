Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup raw almond slivers
Salt

Directions:
Boil green beans for five minutes until al dente.  Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in large skillet over low heat.
Add olive oil to melted butter and mix thoroughly.
Add raw almond slivers to butter and olive oil.  Mix thoroughly and spread almonds out evenly in the bottom of the pan.
Continuously stir the almond slivers on low heat until they turn the slightest golden brown.  (You don't want to scorch them, or they'll turn bitter and you'll have to start over)
Once almonds are toasted, remove from skillet from heat and continue stirring for one minute.
Once mixture is cool enough to taste, add salt to taste and pour over green beans.
Toss green beans to ensure even coating.
Serve while still warm
