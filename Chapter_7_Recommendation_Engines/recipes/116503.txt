Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups biscuit baking mix
2/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
3 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine biscuit mix, milk and Italian seasoning. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 10 times. Divide into 30 portions; set half aside. Roll the remaining 15 pieces into 7-in. ropes for broom handles; fold in half and twist. Place on ungreased baking sheets.
Shape reserved pieces into 2-1/2-in. circles; cut with scissors to form a bundle of broom twigs. Place below each broom handle; pinch edges to seal. Brush with butter; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm or cool on a wire rack.

My family loves bread, so I try to serve some with every meal. Halloween isn't the same without these oh-so-good breadsticks.
