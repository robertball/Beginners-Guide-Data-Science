1 cup softened cream cheese
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

8 (1/2 inch) slices egg bread
6 extra large eggs, beaten
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a medium bowl, blend the cream cheese with brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg and cinnamon
Spread 4 slices bread with the cream cheese mixture, and top with remaining bread slices, creating sandwiches.
Mix eggs and milk in a shallow bowl. Dip bread into the egg and milk to coat thoroughly.
Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Cook coated bread slices 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.

Description: 
A French toast sandwich with a cream cheese and brown sugar center.  My family loves this, and it can be cut into wedges and served at brunch. Can be served with syrup or jam, or eaten without either. Dust with powdered sugar for prettier presentation!
