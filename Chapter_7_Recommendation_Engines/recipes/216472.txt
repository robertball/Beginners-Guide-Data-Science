Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 cups water
1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, and cool to warm, about 20 minutes.
Once the quinoa has cooled, stir in the pecans, cranberries, olive oil, and lemon juice; season to taste with salt and pepper to taste. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
A very easy salad and a nice twist on the usual cranberries-pecans salad with contrasting flavors and textures. Nice in the fall/winter with a bowl of pumpkin soup!
