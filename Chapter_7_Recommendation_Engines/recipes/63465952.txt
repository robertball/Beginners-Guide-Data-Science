Ingredients:
1 pound butter
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons light corn syrup
3 tablespoons cold water
10 ounces chocolate (bar or chip for melting)
1 1/2 cups chopped roasted/salted almonds (divided)

Directions:
Butter a 10x15 inch jelly roll pan.
Over medium heat, melt together butter, sugar, corn syrup and water. It is important to use a heavy duty saucepan.  Do not use a non-stick pan!
Once the ingredients are melted together, turn heat to high and insert a candy thermometer into the pan.  Heat the mixture, stirring constantly to 280 degrees.  Stir in 1 cup chopped almonds.
Continue stirring the candy/nut mixture until it reaches 300 degrees.  Candy will smoke a little bit.  That's ok.  The burned sugar is what gives it such a great flavor!
Once you reach 300 degrees, immediately pour candy into buttered jelly roll pan and spread evenly.  Set aside to cool
While the candy is cooling, melt chocolate in a double boiler at medium heat.
Drizzle the melted chocolate over the candy while it is still hot but starting to get firm.  Spread the chocolate evenly over the candy using a spatula.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup chopped almonds over the melted chocolate.
Set aside to cool for at least 1 1/2 hours.
When the candy is completely cool and the chocolate has fully set, remove the toffee from the jelly roll pans and break into pieces.
