Ingredients:
2 Chicken Breast, butterflied, pounded thin
1/2 onion, diced
1 tomato, seeded, diced
10 oz spinach, roughly chopped
1/4 c (or more) feta , crumbled
Sauce:
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
1  Juice of Lemon (about 1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Butterfly chicken and pound to a 1/4 inch thickness. Preheat oven to 375.
Season inside of chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder (to taste) then layer inside of chicken with spinach, tomato, onion and feta. Roll chicken keeping the stuffing inside and tie ends with butchers twine.
Make sauce. Mix together all of the ingredients for the sauce.
In cast iron skillet, arrange chicken breast side up and brush half of the sauce over top of the chicken. Cook chicken for 30 minutes. Take out add additional sauce over chicken and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes or until chicken registers 160 degrees F. (If chicken gets to brown cover loosely with tin foil for the last 10 minutes).
Take chicken out and let it rest for 5 minutes then slice into pinwheels to serve with pan juices. Enjoy!
Notes:
In hind sight, browning the chicken in the cast iron skillet prior to cooking in the oven would add more flavor and a nice color. Heat cast iron skillet on stove top until hot then add the stuffed chicken, cook over high heat for 5 minutes per side then transfer entire skillet to oven.
Double the sauce recipe for more pan juices.
