Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
1 1/2 cups frozen diced potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (9 inch) frozen pie crusts, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and cut into 1-inch pieces.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add flour and cook for about 1 minute. Add mushroom soup and chicken broth; whisk until smooth. Add cooked chicken, mixed vegetables, potatoes, salt, and pepper. Cook until combined, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, roll out 1 pie crust and fit into a 9-inch pie dish. Poke holes in crust using a fork.
Pour filling into crust and cover with top crust. Cut a few slits into top crust for steam to vent.
Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
