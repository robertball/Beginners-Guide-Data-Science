Ingredients:
1 large apple
1 tsp sugar (or brown sugar)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon butter

Directions:
Cut apple in half and scoop out the core with a spoon.  Place cut side up in a microwave-safe bowl or dish.
Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.  Dot the top of each apple half with 1/2 tsp butter.
Microwave for 1 minute to 1 1/2 minutes until cooked to desired consistency (I did 1 1/2 and it was pretty mushy)
Let cool before serving.

Description: 
I reduced the sugar and cut it down to a single serving.  I made this as a whim at work, so no apple corer - instead I just halved the apple and places it cut side up in a microwave safe bowl.  This might have been why cooking time was a lot less that the original recipe.  I can see myself doing this EVERY DAY! (But with a butter substitute, maybe spray butter...used the real butter we keep on hand at the office).  Original recipe called for nutmeg - would be great but I didn't have it on hand so I left it out)Modified from: Microwave Baked Apples
