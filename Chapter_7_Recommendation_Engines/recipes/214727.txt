Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons buttermilk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 egg

Directions:
Whisk flour, sugar, buttermilk, vegetable oil, baking soda, poppy seeds, and lemon extract together in a bowl until smooth. Beat in the egg. Pour batter into a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic mug or cereal bowl.
Heat in the microwave on high until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
I read a recipe a while back about a chocolate cake that was cooked in 3 minutes in the microwave.  I didn't really believe it, but I tried it out and then proceeded to alter it to suit my own tastes because I thought it was too heavy and the texture was a bit wonky - if decent for an instant chocolate fix at 12:00 in the morning.  Still, the unpleasant texture just became more pronounced as I experimented with vanilla variations.  At last, here is my 5-minute lemon-poppy seed cake that rises beautifully and is light and airy - unlike the chocolate cake.
