Description: 
Mayonnaise, a famous sauce which is, essentially, an emulsion of oil and vinegar (or lemon juice) stabilized with egg yolk and seasoned to taste. As a French word mayonnaise, meaning the sauce, first appeared in print in 1808. However, an interesting curiosity is its appearance in the phrase 'mayonnaise de poulet' in a German cookbook of 1804. After reading some popular Mayonnaise jar ingredients, and a few recipes I came up with my own mayonnaise recipe.
