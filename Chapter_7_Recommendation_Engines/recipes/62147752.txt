Ingredients:
1 cup pre-cooked chicken
1/2 cup Barbecue sauce sauce
1 package refrigerated pizza dough
Olive oil
1 cup Shredded colby and monterey jack cheese

Directions:
Heat grill to medium.
While grill is heating, dice chicken into bite sized pieces. Place in a bowl and toss with a 2 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce.
Roll dough out onto a cutting board. Cut pizza dough in half to form two rectangles. Brush oil onto top of each piece of dough.
Place dough onto grill, oiled side down. Cook about 5 minutes, until underside is cooked and top is bubbled up. Brush oil onto top, rawside, of dough.
Flip dough over.
Place sauce and toppings onto the dough â€“ the side up is now the side that is already cooked.
Close lid on grill and cook 2-3 minutes until top of pizza is cooked. Remove from grill and let cool before cutting.

Description: 
Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like (That looks like America!) For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.
