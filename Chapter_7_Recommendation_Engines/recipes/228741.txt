Ingredients:
1 yellow onion, chopped
1/4 pound pork belly, diced
4 cups water, more if needed
1 cup vegetable broth, or more if needed
1/2 cup white wine
2 cups split peas
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
2 bay leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir onion and pork belly in a large pot over medium heat until pork is browned and onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Add water, vegetable broth, white wine, split peas, thyme, celery seed, bay leaves, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors have combined, about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Description: 
An easy and flavorful take on split pea soup. (Note: I often strain out the pieces of pork belly and run the soup through my food processor - I like my split pea soup really thick and creamy!)
