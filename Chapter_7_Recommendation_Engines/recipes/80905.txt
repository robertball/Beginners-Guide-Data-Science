Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 boneless pork chops
1 (16 ounce) package tater tots
1 (15.5 ounce) can French-style green beans, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
3/4 cup sour cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown pork chops on both sides. Remove chops, reserving pan dripping.
Arrange tater tots in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer green beans over the tater tots. Place browned chops over the beans. In a bowl, mix reserved pan drippings, cream of celery soup, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Pour evenly over chops.
Cover dish with foil, and bake casserole 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until pork chops are done.
