Ingredients:
2 and 1/4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 ounces elbow gluten free pasta, such as Barilla Â®
1 cup whole milk
4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon gluten free Dijon mustard

Directions:
Pour water and salt into a medium pot and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the water has cooked down a bit, about 4 minutes.
Stir in the milk, and continue boiling for 3-4  minutes until al dente.  Add the Cheddar, Parmesan, pepper, and mustard; stir until the cheese melts and the sauce is thick and creamy. Turn off the heat and cover. Allow to sit, covered, for about 1 minute. The starch from the pasta thickens the sauce as the pasta cooks. Uncover, stir once then serve hot.
