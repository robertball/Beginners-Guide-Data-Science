Description: 
Good ole red beans and rice with lots of smoked sausage. I put lots of garlic in it which makes it tasty. I take it to my bingo crowd and they love it!  Normally I don't measure, so I decided to write it down while I was making it. This is medium on the heat but make it hot as you like!
