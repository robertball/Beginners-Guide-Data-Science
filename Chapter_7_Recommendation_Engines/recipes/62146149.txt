Ingredients:
2 Small yellow onions
4 to 5 Cups turkey
2- 28 Ounce can diced tomatoes
1- 15 Ounce can diced potatoes, drained.
6 Cups Water
1 Cup Ketchup
1 Cup Hickory barbeque sauce
1/4 Cup vinegar
1 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon Pepper
1/2 Teaspoon Tabasco
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 -29 Ounce can whole kernel corn, drained (white or golden)

Directions:
Use a food processor to chop the onion and turkey.  Saute onions in a large stock pot or a crock pot if you have one that is big enough.  Add all the ingredients except for the corn.  Bring stew to a boil and then simmer on low for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Ingredients will break down and some of the water will evaporate.
Add corn and reduce heat to lowest setting cooking for 30 minutes.

A delicious and easy way to use your leftover Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey.  I use leftover fried turkey breast with skin and dark meat, quick prep time if using a food processor.  My version of brunswick stew has become a family favorite!
