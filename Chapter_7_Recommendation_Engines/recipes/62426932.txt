Ingredients:
3/4 of a 1-pound package of orzo pasta
4 green onions, chopped up
1 1/2 c. feta cheese
1/3 c. fresh dill. . .fresh is sooo much better in flavor then dried
4 T. fresh lemon juice
3 T. olive oil (I use extra-virgin)
2 pounds of medium shrimp, cooked, peeled and deveined (I cooked mine simply in salted water)
1 cucumber (My cucumber was about 1 foot long and not overly fat.)
Quarter the cucumber lengthwise so that you have 4 long strips and then cut into 1/4-inch thick pieces
1/2 cucumber (Used for full, thin slices on top of salad)
1 (12-ounce) basket cherry tomatoes, cut in half and divided
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
fresh dill sprigs for Decorating the top of the salad.

Directions:
Cook orzo in a large pot of water. Bring salted water to boiling and cook until tender, about 9 minutes. Stir orzo occasionally. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain well. . .this is important for later.
Transfer to a large bowl and add green onions, feta cheese, chopped dill, lemon juice, and olive oil. Mix well.
Make sure there is no excess water on the cooked medium sized shrimp. Add to salad and mix well. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. '
Mix in cucumber pieces, 3/4 of the cherry tomatoes that have been cut in halves. Arrange whole cucumber rounds and cherry tomato halves around edge of bowl and garnish with the pretty little dill sprigs.
Chill salad until ready to serve. This makes a big bowl of salad but mine only made it 2 days
