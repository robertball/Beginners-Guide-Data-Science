Ingredients:
* 1 1/2 cup(s)  pearl barley
* 3 teaspoon(s) olive oil
* 4  (about 1 pound) skinless, boneless chicken thighs , cut into 1-inch chunks (Sub breasts)
* 2 medium carrots, chopped
* 2 stalk(s) celery, chopped
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 1 package(s) (8-ounce) sliced mushrooms

* 2 cup(s) water
* 1/2 teaspoon(s) dried thyme
* 1/4 teaspoon(s) ground nutmeg
* Salt and ground black pepper

Directions:
1.  Heat deep nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add barley and cook 4 to 6 minutes or until toasted and fragrant, stirring occasionally. Transfer barley to large bowl.
2. In same skillet, heat 2 teaspoons oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken and cook about 5 minutes or just until it loses its pink color on the outside, stirring occasionally. Transfer chicken to bowl with barley.
3. In same skillet, in remaining 1 teaspoon oil, cook carrots, celery, and onion over medium heat 7 to 8 minutes or until tender-crisp. Stir in mushrooms and cook about 10 minutes longer or until most of liquid evaporates and vegetables are tender and lightly browned.
4. Return chicken and barley to skillet; stir in broth, water, thyme, nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Heat to boiling over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 30 to 35 minutes or until barley is tender and chicken is no longer pink in center. Serve pilaf garnished with parsley leaves.

Description: 
When barley is added to the mix, comfort food gets a dose of heart-healthy whole grain, as well as a toasty, nutty flavor. Serve this one-pot meal with a simple green salad and, voila, dinner is done.
