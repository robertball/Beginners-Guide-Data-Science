Ingredients:
1 large white onion
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon mirin
1 tablespoon sake
1/2 pound beef ribeye steak, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or to taste (optional)
2 green onions, thinly sliced, or to taste (optional)
2 teaspoons pickled ginger (beni shoga), or to taste (optional)
1 sheet dried seaweed, cut into strips, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Halve the onion and discard the central-most part. Cut halves into thin slices.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until it starts to brown, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low; add water, soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, and sake and simmer until flavors combine, about 3 minutes.
Stir beef into the skillet. Cook, covered, until beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Divide between serving bowls and garnish with sesame seeds, green onions, ginger, and seaweed strips.
