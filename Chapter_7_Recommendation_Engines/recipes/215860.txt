1 teaspoon minced garlic
16 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brown beef, onion and garlic in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Once browned, drain fat and stir in spaghetti sauce.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a layer of sauce. Top with 1/2 of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, another layer of sauce and the rest of the cheese. Top with crescent rolls, pinching seams together.
