Ingredients:
1 pint cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
1 cup pepper flavored vodka
2 tablespoons lemon pepper
2 tablespoons celery salt

Directions:
Remove the stems from the tomatoes, and place them in a shallow bowl. Pour vodka over them so that they are covered. Stir in the hot pepper sauce. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
To serve, mix together the lemon pepper and celery salt in a small dish. Serve tomatoes floating in vodka. Provide toothpicks so that your guests may pick up the tomatoes and dip them in the seasoning before eating.
