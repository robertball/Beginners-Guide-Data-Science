Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup peanut butter chips
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1 egg
3/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups flour
3/4 tsp baking soda

2/3 cup peanut butter or chocolate chips
1 Tbsp vegetable shortening

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Place peanut butter chips and butter in a saucepan, melt over low heat, stirring constantly.
Pour butter/chips mixture into a mixing bowl, add brown sugar, egg, and vanilla. Mix well.
Add flour and baking soda, mix well.
Refrigerate 20 minutes until firm enough to roll.
Working with half at a time, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4' thick.
Cut out shapes with cookie cutters.
Place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake for 7 minutes or until almost set.
Cool for one minute before removing to wire rack.
Cool completely before frosting.
To make the glaze, microwave the chips and shortening in a small dish for 1 minute, stir until smooth.

Description: 
A nice change from the traditional cut-out cookie. I like to make these in football shapes and cover with chocolate frosting. Yum!
