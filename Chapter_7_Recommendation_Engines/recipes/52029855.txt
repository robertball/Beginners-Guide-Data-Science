4 cups uncooked elbow macaroni

2 1/2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

1 large onion, chopped (red is best)
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup grated carrot (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped pimento peppers (optional)
1 cup frozen peas/can tuna or chicken/red onion/cubed cheddar cheese /hard boiled eggs (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Rinse under cold water and drain.
In a large bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper. Stir in the onion, celery, green pepper, carrot, pimentos and macaroni and any optional items you wish to add.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving, but preferably overnight.
Can also be used as a base for potato salad.
