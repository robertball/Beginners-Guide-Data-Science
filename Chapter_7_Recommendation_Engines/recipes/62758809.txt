Ingredients:
1 yellow cake mix (I prefer Betty Crocker)
1 stick (1/2 cup) butter softened
3 eggs
1/2 cup water
1 8 oz. crushed pineapple (with juice)
2 very ripe large bananas, mashed
1 cup chopped pecans - opt
1 cup shredded coconut - opt
Your favorite cream cheese icing

Directions:
Beat the butter until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs, the water and the cake mix.
Stir in the pineapple and bananas.
Add the nuts and coconut.
Pour into a 9x13 greased and floured cake pan.
Bake at 350° for 35-45 minutes.
Cake is done when toothpick comes out clean.
Cool in pan for about 10 minutes.
Turn out on rack and cool completely before frosting.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
