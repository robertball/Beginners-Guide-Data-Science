4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 cubes chicken bouillon
2 stalks celery, chopped

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, combine the water, potatoes, bouillon, celery and onion. Bring to a boil and cook until soft. Reduce heat to low and use a masher to mash down the potato mixture in the pot to desired consistency.
