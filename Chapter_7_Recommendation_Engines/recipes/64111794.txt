Ingredients:
2 14-oz can pineapple tidbits, undrained, reserve 1/2 cup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 t. ground cloves

Directions:
In a medium sized sauce pan, add all the ingredients.
Heat slowly on the stove for about an hour.
The sauce will naturally thicken as it reduces.
If it reduces too much add some of the reserved juice.
