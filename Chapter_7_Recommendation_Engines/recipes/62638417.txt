Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg
Cinnamon-Sugar
2 tbsp. granulated sugar
2 tsp. ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine all ingredients instead of the cinnamon-sugar coating.
Make a stiff dough, kneading lightly once combined.
Roll walnut-sized balls in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Place on greased baking sheet and flatten with a fork lightly dipped in water so it won't stick. (flattening not essential)
Bake at 400F for 10-12 mins., or until browned.
Cool cookies on wire racks.
