Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1 (2 ounce) jar chopped pimento peppers
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning
ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
2 green bell peppers, cored and cut into quarters
8 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Stir the feta cheese, pimento peppers, Greek seasoning, black pepper, and olive oil together in a bowl; place about 2 tablespoons of the mixture on each of the 8 bell pepper segments. Wrap each segment with a slice of bacon; secure with toothpicks and arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and beginning to crisp, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
This is another one of my creations. I was messing around in the kitchen and this is what happened. I'm still working on it so I am looking for feedback. This is more of an appetizer or finger food.
