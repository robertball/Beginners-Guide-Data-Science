Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
1 (29 ounce) can sliced peaches, juice reserved
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter or margarine with 1/2 cup sugar.
In another bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt.  Alternately add these ingredients and the milk to the creamed mixture.
Spread batter in greased casserole dish or loaf pan.  Top the batter with the fruit, and pour 1 cup of juice over the top of the fruit.  Top the fruit with the other 1/2 cup of sugar.  (Can omit sugar if the fruit is already sweet enough to your liking.)
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes.

Description: 
Easy to make, and oh so good. You can use frozen or canned fruit of your choosing, as well as fresh. The crust rises to the top while baking.  A family favorite! If preferred, use water instead of fruit juice.
