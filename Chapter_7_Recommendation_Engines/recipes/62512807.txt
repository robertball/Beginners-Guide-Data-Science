Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package extra firm tofu
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 ounce) packages Oriental flavored ramen noodles
2 tsp garlic minced
1 1/2 cups water
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
1/2 inch ginger, slivers
Sesame oil to taste
1 green onion - thinly sliced
basil (optional
Chili sauce (optional)
1 (16 ounce) package frozen stir-fry vegetables or
1/2 carrot thinly sliced
2 celery stalks sliced diagonally in 1/2"
1/2 red bell pepper strips (1")
1/2 green pepper strips (1")
1/2 cup green peas
2 baby bok choy chopped

Directions:
Press tofu between paper towels to remove some of the water (or squeeze strips over the sink); cut in to bite size cubes.  Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu, and fry until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
Meanwhile bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add noodles from ramen packages, reserving the seasoning envelopes. Boil for about 2 minutes, just until the noodles break apart. Drain.
Add the stir-fry vegetables to the pan with the tofu, and season with the ramen noodle seasoning packet. Cook, stirring occasionally until vegetables are tender, but not mushy. Add noodles, and stir to blend. Season with soy sauce to taste and serve. Top with green onions and a dash of sesame oil

Description: 
This easy-to make recipe is very inexpensive. I made this with selective recommendations from other AR cooks, and use only fresh veggies (I do not use frozen vegs)but as the original postings states try different ingredients to spice it up and try different Ramen noodle flavors.Modified from: Fast and Easy Tofu Lo-Mein
