Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
3 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 broccoli stalk, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup chopped chorizo sausage
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup finely chopped kale
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup light cream

Directions:
Bring chicken broth and water to a boil in a saucepan; cook potatoes in the boiling broth mixture until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Mash or blend potatoes into the broth using a potato masher or fork.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and broccoli stalk until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chorizo to onion mixture and cook over low heat until chorizo is heated through, about 5 minutes; stir in garlic.
Stir onion-chorizo mixture into potato mixture; bring to a simmer. Add kale, about 1/4 cup at a time, to mixture, cooking until kale wilts before adding more. Season soup with salt and pepper.
Reduce heat to low and stir heavy whipping cream and light cream into soup; cook until heated through, about 1 minute.

Description: 
I invented this soup with what I had in my fridge. I live alone, so this version only makes two servings. Scale up for more deliciousness! Garnish with spring onion and serve.
