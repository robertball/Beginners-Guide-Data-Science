Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown lentils
4 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked long grain rice
1 cup elbow macaroni
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine the lentils and water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat for 25 minutes. Add the rice to the lentils, and continue to simmer for an additional 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.
Fill a separate saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is lightly browned. Pour in the tomatoes and season with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Simmer over medium heat for 10 to 20 minutes.
In a large serving dish, stir together the lentils, rice and macaroni. Mix in the tomato sauce until evenly coated.

Description: 
Lentils, rice and pasta are cooked and then served in a spicy tomato sauce. This is a typical Egyptian dish that is very good and cheap over here! Puree the sauce in a food processor if you like a smoother texture.
