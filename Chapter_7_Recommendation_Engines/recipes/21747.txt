Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/3 cup sour cream
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce

Directions:
To make crepes: Mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in medium bowl.  Stir in remaining ingredients.  Beat with hand beater until smooth.  Lightly butter 6 inch skillet; heat over medium heat until bubbly.  For each crepe, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter into skillet; immediately rotate skillet until batter covers bottom.  Cook until light brown.  Run wide spatula around edge to loosen; turn and cook other side until light brown.  Stack crepes, placing waxed paper between each; keep covered.
Beat cream, brown sugar and cardamom in chilled small bowl with electric mixer on high speed about 2 minutes or just until soft peaks form.  Fold in sour cream.
Spoon about 2 tablespoons cream mixture onto each crepe; roll up.  Place 2 crepes, seam sides down, on each plate.  Top with a dollop of cream mixture and cranberry sauce.
