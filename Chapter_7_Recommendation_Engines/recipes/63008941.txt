Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup all purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups brown sugar, packed
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1/2 cup dried cherries, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup almonds, coarsely chopped
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 cups quick oats
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Whisk or sift together flours, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
In large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
Beat in eggs, one at a time; add vanilla and almond extracts and mix well.
Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture - I add in thirds, beating well after each addition.
Stir in cherries, almonds, chocolate chips, oats and coconut.
Place dough by heaping tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2" apart.  Flatten slightly, if desired.
Baking 10 - 12 minutes or until just starting to turn golden brown.  Let cool on sheets 5 minutes, then remove to wire racks to col completely.
