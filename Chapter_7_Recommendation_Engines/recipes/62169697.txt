Ingredients:
1 Tb oil
1 Tb shortening
1 Tb flour
4 (1 ounce) squares of unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup water
2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
4 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
4 egg whites
5 tablespoons all purpose flour
1 1/4 cups milk
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 cup shortening
1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together oil, flour, and shortening. Grease 3 9" round cake pans with mixture.
Microwave chocolate and water on high for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Stir halfway through. Stir until all is melted and smooth.
In a medium bowl, mix together flour, soda and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream 1 cup butter and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy. Add 4 egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in chocolate and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with buttermilk. Start with flour and end with flour.  Beat after each addition until smooth.
In a separate bowl, beat egg whites on high until soft peaks form. Gently fold into batter. Pour equal amounts into prepared cake pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Cool completely.
While cake bakes, combine flour and milk in saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat back of spoon. Cool completely. Cream 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and shortening for at least 15 minutes.  Add cooled milk mixture, and beat well.  Spread over cooled cake layers and place in fridge for 1 hour.
Place the chocolate into a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil.  When the cream has come to a boil, pour over chocolate, and whisk until smooth.  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Whisk with fork for a second to fluff.  Pour over center of cake and spread out evenly.
