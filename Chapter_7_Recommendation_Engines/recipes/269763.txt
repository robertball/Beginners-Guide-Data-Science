Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 medium russet potatoes, or more to taste, sliced into even strips
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1/2 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pour olive oil into a large resealable plastic bag and add potatoes. Seal the bag and shake to coat every piece with oil.
Combine Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a second resealable bag. Pour oiled potatoes into the bag, seal, and toss well to coat.
Spread potatoes on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip potatoes over and bake until crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, about 15 minutes more.
