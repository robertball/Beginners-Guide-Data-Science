Description: 
I made this recipe out of what we had. My daughter had a garden this summer and even though BP's don't always agree with me, I was going to use them somehow! I really liked the way that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them turned out. It also dramatically cut down on the baking time which makes it a more reasonable weeknight dish. These turned out to be the best stuffed peppers I have ever had!
