Ingredients:
2 cups quinoa, rinsed well
4 cups water
1 tsp salt
extra virgin olive oil
4 medium/large potatoes
1 large onion
1 clove garlic
1 cup nuts (I used walnuts)
1-2 cups asparagus

Directions:
1. Combine quinoa, water, and salt in a pot. Cook according to package instructions. Drain, set aside.
2. While the quinoa is cooking, dice the potatoes and chop the onions.
3. Heat some olive oil in a pan on the stove. Add potatoes and cook until tender and a little crispy (I like mine extra crispy, though).
4. Meanwhile, cook asparagus however you’d like to. (I simply boiled/steamed mine. It took about 5 minutes.) Also, place nuts on a cookie sheet in a single layer and toast in the oven until slightly browned.
5. When potatoes are done cooking, salt to taste and set aside. In the same pan, heat some more oil. Cook onions for a bit, then add minced garlic. Cook until desired softness.
6. Combine everything together in a large bowl: quinoa, potatoes, toasted nuts, cooked asparagus, and onions/garlic. Salt and pepper to taste.
7. Enjoy!
