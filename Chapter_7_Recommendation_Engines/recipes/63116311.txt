Ingredients:
1 (3.5 ounce) green bell pepper
1 (3.5 ounce) yellow onion
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp chicken stock (optional)
1 lb ground beef
3 Tbsp taco seasoning
2 (4 ounce) Roma tomatoes
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 lb cheddar cheese, shredded
8 oz romaine hearts (approximately 12 leaves)

Directions:
Chop the green pepper and onion into small pieces, and place the pieces in a saute pan.  Add the olive oil and chicken stock (if desired), and cook on medium heat until the onions are clear.
Slice the ground beef into small pieces.  In a separate saute pan, combine the ground beef and taco seasoning, and cook on medium heat until the meat turns brown.
Chop the tomatoes and place in a small bowl.  Sprinkle the salt on the tomatoes.
If needed, shred the cheddar cheese, and place the shredded cheese in a small bowl.
Once the beef, peppers, and onions are finished cooking, remove them from heat.
Pull the leaves from the romaine hearts.  Place on a plate like a taco shell and fill with beef, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and cheese.

Description: 
For those on a low-carb kick that love Mexican but dread all the beans and bread, try this alternative for taco night.  It uses lettuce leaves instead of taco shells to make a dish that's halfway between a lettuce wrap and a taco.  Low on carbs and still delicious!
