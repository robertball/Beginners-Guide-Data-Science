Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon Gum-Tex
3 cups Powdered Sugar
1 Tablespoon Glucose
1/4 cup water
1 cup powdered sugar
Shortening as needed

Directions:
In a bowl combine Gum-tex with 3 cups powdered sugar. Combine water and glucose and heat for 30 seconds until glucose is dissolved. Combine with Gum-tex mixture and mix until blended. Place in tightly sealed bag and let rest overnight at room temperature.
Knead remaining cup of sugar into gum paste mixture. As you knead gum paste will become soft and moist. Roll out and shape on powdered sugar to prevent sticking. If mix becomes dry add small amounts of shortening.
