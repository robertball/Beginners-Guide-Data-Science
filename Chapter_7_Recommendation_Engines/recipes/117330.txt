Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
SAUCE:
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons grated onion
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
TOPPINGS:
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
4 ounces Canadian bacon, diced (optional)
1 (3.25 ounce) package sliced pepperoni
1 medium red bell pepper, sliced
1 medium green pepper, sliced
1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced ripe olives, drained
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup minced fresh basil

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add oil, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rest in a warm place for 10 minutes.
Combine sauce ingredients; set aside. Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to two greased 12-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Spread with sauce; sprinkle with toppings. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
Even if you've never made pizza from scratch, I hope you'll try this recipe. it's the highlight of my favorite casual meal. You have to plan ahead to allow rising time for the dough, but it is easy to work with and the crust is so good.
