Ingredients:
10 (1 ounce) slices white bread, torn into pieces
2 1/2 cups milk
2 pounds ground smoked ham
1 pound ground beef
6 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons flour
2 teaspoons prepared mustard
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the bread in a large bowl, pour in the milk and soak until soft.  Mash well, then mix in the ham, beef, eggs, salt, dry mustard, and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Mix thoroughly and pack the mixture into a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Stir together 1 cup of brown sugar, flour, and prepared mustard.  Stir in enough vinegar to make a spreadable paste.  Spread the topping over top of the meat.
Bake in preheated oven for one hour until the ground beef has cooked, and the topping has browned nicely.
