Ingredients:
1 loaf Italian bread (18 inch), cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup KRAFT Grated Parmesan Cheese, divided
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
8 slices OSCAR MAYER Butcher Thick Cut Hickory Smoked Bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt'sÂ® Diced Tomatoes No Salt Added, undrained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fat-free reduced-sodium chicken broth
6 cups loosely packed chopped kale

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spread bread onto baking sheet; drizzle with oil. Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. cheese and crushed pepper. Bake 10 min.
Meanwhile, cook and stir bacon in large saucepan on medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard all but 1 Tbsp. bacon drippings from pan. Add onions to pan; cook and stir 5 min. or until crisp-tender. Return bacon to pan along with the beans, tomatoes, broth and 1/4 cup of the remaining cheese; stir. Simmer on medium-low heat 20 min., stirring occasionally. Add kale; cook 10 min.
