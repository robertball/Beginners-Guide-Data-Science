Ingredients:
16 bratwurst, casings removed
6 cups diced potatoes
3 onions, chopped fine
12 cups water
12 cups milk, divided
12 tablespoons all-purpose flour
12 ounces Swiss cheese, diced
3 tbls. pepper supreme

Directions:
On the grill over medium high heat, saute the sausage for 10 minutes, or until browned and crumbled. Drain well and discard the fat.
In a large pot over high heat, combine the browned sausage, potatoes, onion and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes. Add 3 cups of the milk and heat slowly to just under a boil. (Note: Don't try to do this too fast, or the milk will burn on the bottom of the pot.)
In a separate small bowl, mix the flour and seasonings with the remaining milk, and add to the pot slowly, stirring constantly, so that the flour does not clump. (Note: Make sure you get out all the lumps because they will not cook out on their own.)
When the mixture in the pot thickens, add the cheese and stir until the cheese has melted.
