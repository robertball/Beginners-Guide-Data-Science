Ingredients:
8 large sweet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
4 granny smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced
5 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup apple cider
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup minced fresh sage leaves
1/2 cup bacon bits
Ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
In a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish, make thin alternate layers of potatoes, apples, and shallots.
In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and whisk in the flour gradually, until the mixture is smooth. Gradually add the broth, cider, water, and salt. Simmer until thick and bubbly. Stir in the sage, pepper, and most of the bacon bits. Simmer for 2 minutes more.
Pour the sauce over the vegetable/apple layers. Sprinkle with remaining bacon bits. Cover with aluminum foil and and bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours or until the potatoes are fork-tender.

Description: 
If you get tired of sweet potatoes made the usual way-- with sugar, marshmallow, and all that overwhelming stuff-- try this approach instead. The onions, apples, bacon, and sage make a more mellow savory flavor combination. Outstanding with ham or turkey for winter holiday feasting. You can easily make this vegetarian/vegan by using soy bacon bits, too.Modified from: Scalloped Potatoes and Onions
