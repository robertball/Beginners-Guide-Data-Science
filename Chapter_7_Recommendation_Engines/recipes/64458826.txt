Ingredients:
1 lb chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite sized pieces
2 tbsp corn starch
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
2 cups sugar snap peas or snow peas
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 1/2 tbsp ketchup
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 orange, zested and juiced
1 20 oz can pineapple chunks, drained, juice reserved
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper or to taste
1 bunch green onions, diced

Directions:
Coat chicken with corn starch.
Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook chicken until edges are golden brown, about 7 minutes.  Add bell pepper and peas.  Cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes.
In a small bowl, combine reserved juice, salt, sugar, vinegar, ketchup, orange juice, red pepper, and soy sauce.  Add to pan and cook an additional 3 minutes.  Stir in pineapple, orange zest, and green onions and heat through.  Serve over rice.

Description: 
One kid loves sweet and sour pork.  The other loves orange chicken.  In order to forestall an argument one night, I made this combination of the two.  Both kids agree it's better than either!
