Line the prepared baking pan with speculoos cookies, making sure there are no gaps between each cookie.
Melt white chocolate according to package instructions. Pour over cookies. Smooth top using an off-set spatula.
Place cereal, jelly bird eggs, chocolate kisses, chocolate wafer cookies, and mini jelly bird eggs on top of the melted white chocolate. Place in refrigerator to set, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove bark from the pan by gently pulling on parchment paper. Break into pieces.
