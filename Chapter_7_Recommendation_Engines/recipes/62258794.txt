Ingredients:
2 cups frozen mango chunks
1 cup frozen sliced strawberries (unsweetened)
3/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1 cup water
2-3 tbs. frozen juice concentrate (I like a mango/apple/passionfruit blend, but another sweet-tasting blend would work well)
3/4 cup vanilla yogurt

Directions:
In a blender, combine all ingredients. Puree until smooth, adding more water if necessary. Serve immediately.
