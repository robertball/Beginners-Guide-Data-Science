Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/3 cup water
1/4 cup corn syrup
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In medium saucepan, measure in sugar, water, corn syrup, and salt over medium heat.  Stir to dissolve.  Cook to soft ball stage, 240 degrees F (115 degrees C), without stirring.  It should fall from spoon in a thin thread.
Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form; do this shortly before syrup has reached the soft ball stage.  When ready, pour syrup in a thin stream over stiff egg whites, being careful to beat continuously the whole time. Add vanilla and beat until the right spreading consistency is achieved.
