Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package fettuccini pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, sliced
4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic in olive oil until golden. Remove garlic, and reserve oil.
In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, and cream. Stir until cheeses are melted. Stir in the oil from the garlic pan. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
Toss sauce with hot pasta, and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
