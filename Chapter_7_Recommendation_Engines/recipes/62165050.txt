1 1/2 cups + 2 Tsp + 2 tsp cup warm water (110 deg, F)
1 (.25 ounce) packages (2 tsp) active dry yeast
1 Tsp + 1 tsp. bread flour
1 tsp white sugar
2/3 cups quick cooking oats
2/3 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp salt
3 Tsp + 1 3/4 tsp brown sugar
3 Tsp + 1 3/4 tsp vegetable oil
3 1/3 cups bread flour

3  With fod processor running pour in yeast mixture as fast as dough will absorb it and process until dough forms a ball away from sides of container and then process for another 30 seconds to knead.
4  Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface. Cover with a damp cloth or oiled lid. Let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour.
5  Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Shape loaves, and place in greased 8 x 4 inch pans. Let rise until dough is 1 inch above rim of pans, usually 1 hour.
6  Bake at 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until tops are browned. Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.
