Ingredients:
6 graham crackers
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package unflavored gelatin
boiling water
1 (12 ounce) container whipped cream cheese
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups vodka, divided
1/2 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored gelatin (such as Jell-O®)
1/4 cup boiling water
3 ice cubes

Directions:
Crush graham crackers in a blender or food processor; add melted butter and sugar and blend until evenly combined. Gently press graham cracker mixture into 12 tall shot glasses.
Mix unflavored gelatin and 1/4 cup boiling water together in a bowl until well mixed.
Combine cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract, and gelatin mixture in a blender; pulse a few times. Add 1 cup vodka; blend until smooth. Taste mixture and adjust confectioners' sugar if necessary. Pour cream cheese mixture over graham cracker layer, leaving about 1 inch on the top. Chill for at least 1 hour.
Mix strawberry gelatin and 1/4 cup boiling water together in a bowl; stir well and add remaining 1/2 cup vodka and ice cubes. Stir until ice melts and mixture starts to thicken; pour over cream cheese mixture layer. Chill shots for at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
These are pretty darned adorable, and tasty, too. You could skip the graham cracker layer... but it really adds a nice texture to this velvety creation.
