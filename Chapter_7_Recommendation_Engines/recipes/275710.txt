Ingredients:
1/2 pound bulk pork sausage
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried sage
kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
2/3 cup heavy cream
2 cups chopped cooked turkey
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
Topping:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 tablespoons salted butter, melted
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon minced fresh chives
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and line a sheet pan with aluminum foil.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate and set aside, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Melt sausage drippings and 3 tablespoons butter together in the skillet over medium heat. Add onion and mushrooms; cook until soft, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup flour and cook for 2 minutes; mixture will thicken as flour cooks. Stir in chicken broth and continue to cook and stir until flour lumps dissolve and mixture begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and add sage. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir heavy cream into the mixture and add reserved sausage, turkey, and mixed vegetables. Adjust seasoning if necessary and pour into the prepared baking dish.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl for topping. Stir in 1 cup heavy cream at first; gradually add remaining cream to form a wet, sticky dough.
Drop large tablespoon-sized dough balls on top of the meat and vegetable mixture, evenly spacing 15 to 16 balls in total.
Combine melted butter, parsley, chives, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Brush mixture lightly over each dough ball. Place the baking dish onto the prepared sheet pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and topping is browned, about 45 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for about 30 minutes before serving.
