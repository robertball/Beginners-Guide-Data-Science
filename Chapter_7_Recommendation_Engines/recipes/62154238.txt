Ingredients:
6 slices white bread
3/4 c white sugar
2 tsp cinnamon (more or less to taste)
1 - 2 tbs milk
splash vanilla extract
1 tbs melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Melt butter in coffee cup in microwave.
Add sugar and cinnamon to melted butter in the coffee cup, stir around until mixed (does not need to be perfectly mixed).
Splash a little vanilla over the mixture.
Add milk, 1 tbs at a time and stir until the mixture has a consistency that is not chunky but not super runny. Should pour off the spoon slowly.
Spread slices of bread over a cookie sheet.
Pour a spoonful of mixture in center of each slice of bread. Spread out with back of spoon. Use enough on each slice to cover top of bread completely, including crust. If the bread is soaking up the mixture completely, the consistency is too runny.
Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes (until top is bubbly and crusty and bottom is toasty). Let sit for 5 minutes then eat warm.
