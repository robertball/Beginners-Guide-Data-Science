Directions:
Add the beer and vinegar, then add water to make the level of liquid about 4 inches in big stock pot.Add garlic powder, salt and red pepper flakes, and bay leaves, cover and heat to boiling.Add empty beer cans to bottom of pot to keep the crab out of the liquid. Add frozen crab legs, sprinkle with the Old Bay, cover and cook for 7 minutes, just to heat thru. Remove crablegs with tongs and drain in colander in sink. Serve with melted butter,a cold beer, nutcrackers, and plenty of paper towels!If you have big crab eaters, you can easily double the crab, and use the same water for the second batch, you'll just need additional Old Bay to sprinkle on the additional crablegs!

Description: 
I don't live on the Florida Coast anymore so snow crab is the only crab readily available. So I adapted this recipe from the way my Grandaddy used to make crabs in Florida! Very easy, very tasty!
