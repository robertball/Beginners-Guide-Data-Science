Ingredients:
1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)
1 (2 pound) butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 pound seedless red grapes
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 fresh sage leaves, chopped

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir pine nuts until toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix squash, grapes, onion, olive oil, salt, pepper, and sage leaves together in a large baking dish to coat squash, onion, and grapes in oil and seasoning.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash and onion are golden and slightly caramelized, about 50 minutes; sprinkle pine nuts over the dish.
