Title:
Banana Oat Gluten-Free Pancakes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 ripe banana
1 egg
1/4 cup quick oats
1/4 tsp baking powder
Dash of salt
1/8 tsp vanilla (optional)
Dash of cinnamon (optional)
Butter or substitute for frying pancakes (optional)

Directions:
In blender, mix banana, egg, oats, baking powder, salt, vanilla, and cinnamon until well-blended.
Heat a large non-stick skillet to low-medium.  Melt a little butter in pan, if desired.  Spoon tablespoons of batter into skillet to make small pancakes (they are easier to flip when they're small).  Cook for about 2-3 minutes.  Flip when a darker golden brown, and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until a darker golden brown on both sides.  (I prefer them cooked pretty well, so don't take them off when they're still kind of light golden brown).  Serve with butter, maple syrup, whipped cream, and/or fresh fruit.

Description: 
Easy and delicious pancakes - taste very similar to the real thing! Note - I had to cook these in two batches when using a large frying pan, because they wouldn't all fit in one pan.  If you want to cook them all at once, then maybe use two frying pans or a double-burner-sized skillet.  Adapted from simply-delicious-food.com/easy-healthy-banana-oat-pancakes/
