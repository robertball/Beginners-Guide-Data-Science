Ingredients:
Onions, yellow or white.
oil
flour tortillas
feta cheese

Directions:
First caramelize the onions. Slice them thinly.  In a skillet over medium heat, add 1 T oil and the onions.  Stir to coat with the oil but then let them sit and brown/caramelize.  You should not stir onions when caramalizing. Be sure they don't burn.  You can turn them once.  When they are nicely caramel colored, remove and set aside.
Heat a griddle for making the quesadillas.  Place one flour tortilla on griddle over medium heat.  Sprinkle feta cheese all over.  Spread onions over cheese.  Add another flour tortilla on top.  Heat until cheese is melting and bottom tortilla is slightly browned.  Flip quesadilla over and heat other side.  When cheese is melted and tortillas are browned, remove and slice into quarters using a pizza cutter.  Enjoy.

I had this at a cocktail party and duplicated it at home.  You can add pork or chicken.  But even without meat, it's great!
