Ingredients:
1 cup walnuts
1 cup tightly packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
1/4 cup fresh sage leaves
5 cloves garlic, smashed
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste
1/3 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Process walnuts, parsley, sage, and garlic together in a food processor until coarsely ground. With the food processor still running, slowly stream olive oil into the mixture until completely integrated into a smooth mixture. Add Pecorino Romano cheese, salt, and pepper; continue to process until the mixture has the consistency of a loose paste.

Description: 
Very tasty, quick, and easy pesto. We use it on soups and sandwiches. It's ready to use right away but I like to make it a day or two before I need it so the flavor can develop. I usually use my NinjaÂ® since its easier to clean than the food processor.
