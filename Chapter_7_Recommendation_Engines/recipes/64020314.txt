Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 egg yolks
2 cups flour
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup Smuckers seedless black raspberry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325. Spray an 8x8 baking pan. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until creamy. Gradually add sugar, beating until mixture is light and fluffy. Add egg yolks; beat until well-combined. Gradually add the flour and blend until thoroughly combined. Fold in walnuts. Spoon half of the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Spoon jam over batter, spreading it as much as possible without disturbing the bottom layer. Spoon remaining batter over jam without spreading. Bake 1 hour, or until lightly browned. Cool completely on wire rack, then cut into 12 bars.
