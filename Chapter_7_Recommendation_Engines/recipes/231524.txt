Ingredients:
1 pound ground ham
1 pound ground pork
2 cups cracker crumbs
1 cup milk
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon dry mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine ground ham and pork in a bowl; stir in cracker crumbs, milk, and eggs. Shape mixture into 14 small oval loaves. Place loaves into prepared baking dish.
Mix brown sugar, cider vinegar, water, and dry mustard in a bowl, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved. Pour mixture over ham loaves.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; flip and bake until juices run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 more minutes.

Description: 
This is a family favorite. My aunt used to make them every Easter. The recipe comes from an old church cookbook.  Whenever I order the meat from the meat market, I order ground ham and pork from a local meat market premixed. I order triple the meat required, packaged into three packages, give one to my mother, use one, and freeze one to use later. Serve these with horseradish.
