Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package sugar snap peas
1 teaspoon olive oil, or to taste
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Toss sugar snap peas with olive oil in a bowl and in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle more olive oil on top; season with salt and pepper. Combine cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl; sprinkle onto sugar snap peas.
Cook in the preheated oven until sugar snap peas are lightly browned and sugar has caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I was trying to get a little creative in the kitchen the other night and stumbled across this combination that ended up tasting really great! Although my 2 year-old is still on the fence (as she is with most green veggies), my husband and I loved them. A very easy and inexpensive way to dress up your sugar snaps! Serve immediately or at room temperature.
