Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 sweet potato
2 cups biscuit mix (such as Pioneer®)
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 cup milk
1 zucchini, grated
2 eggs
2 tablespoons margarine
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray muffin tins with cooking spray.
Cook sweet potato in the microwave until tender, about 6 minutes. Peel and dice sweet potato; transfer to a large bowl.
Mix biscuit mix, brown sugar, milk, zucchini, eggs, margarine, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and nutmeg into sweet potato. Spoon 1/3 cup batter into each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Inspired by Starbucks® zucchini bread. I thought sweet potato would be the perfect complement to the zucchini.  This is just a great breakfast treat that even the kids will enjoy! Serve with a little butter and syrup. Yum!
