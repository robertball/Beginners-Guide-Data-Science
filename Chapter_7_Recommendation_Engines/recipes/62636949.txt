Description: 
Old faithful! I've used this recipe for years because it's just so easy. It has a nice sweet crust on the top which I know is probably because the recipe calls for too much sugar. I actually like it like that because then I don't have to frost it! :-) So, I thought I'd post it anyway. Adjust sugar according to your taste. To each his own!!
