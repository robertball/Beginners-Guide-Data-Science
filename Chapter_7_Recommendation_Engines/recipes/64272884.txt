Ingredients:
1/4 cup lard or shortening (I used coconut oil)
2 cups fine yellow cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 large eggs
2 tsp No-Salt seasoning from Costco

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.  Heat the lard over medium heat, once melted make sure you coat all sides of pan with it.
In a large bowl whisk together all your dry ingredients, then in small bowl whisk together the eggs and buttermilk.    Fold the egg mixture into the dry ingredients.
Pour the batter into your skillet,  make sure your skillet is really hot, this is the key to a nice crust.  Bake for 30 min. until golden brown, serve hot and enjoy.
