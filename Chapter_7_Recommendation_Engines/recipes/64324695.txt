Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds zucchini, grated
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup grated parmesan
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large egg, beaten
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place grated zucchini in a colander over the sink. Add salt and gently toss to combine; then let sit for 10 minutes. Using a clean dish towel or cheese cloth, drain zucchini completely. In a large bowl, combine zucchini, flour, Parmesan, garlic and egg; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Scoop tablespoons of batter for each fritter, flattening with a spatula, and cook until the underside is nicely golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side, about 1-2 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
