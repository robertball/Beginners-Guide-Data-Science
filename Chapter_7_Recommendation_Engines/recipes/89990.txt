1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup fine cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup skim milk
2 large eggs
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8-inch baking pan.
In a bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, stir together milk, eggs, and applesauce. Fold the wet mixture into the dry; mix together well. Then pour the combined mixture into baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy, quick recipe for cornbread that's dense, and adjustably sweet. It will smell great as it bakes and comes out with a great golden crust. It can accompany anything. I love it served with salad, soup, or chili.  Add herbs for extra flavor.
