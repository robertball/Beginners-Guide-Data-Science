Ingredients:
18 slices sandwich bread
3 cups bite-sized cooked ham
8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
8 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
6 eggs
3 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
3 cups crushed corn flakes
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Grease a 9x12-inch baking pan with butter. Combine Cheddar cheese and Swiss cheese in a bowl.
Remove and discard bread crusts. Arrange 1/2 the bread on the bottom of the pan. Top evenly with 1/2 the ham and then 1/2 the cheese mixture. Repeat layers of bread, ham, and cheese mixture.
Combine eggs, milk, onion salt, and dry mustard in a bowl. Pour over layers in the baking pan, cover, and refrigerate strata 8 hours to overnight.
The next morning, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Remove strata from the refrigerator and uncover.
Combine corn flakes and melted butter in a bowl and pour evenly over strata.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let strata sit for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This recipe was first served to me 35 years ago while up North snowmobiling with a number of families. Now it typically gets served Christmas morning and on Memorial Day weekend while up North with friends.  This is always a crowd pleaser and makes great leftovers.
