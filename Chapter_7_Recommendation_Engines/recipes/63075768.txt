Description: 
I was surprised to find there was no recipe for ham, cabbage, and potatoes on AllRecipe. This is so easy to make and tastes great. my mom taught this to me when I was very young. She was from Pennsylvania, And had cooked many Pennsylvania dutch recipes so maybe that's where it came from. We normally have this after we bake a ham for dinner, and use the bones and left over meat. I have even cooked this in a slow cooker. You may need to cook the cabbage longer in the slow cooker however. You can adjust the time that you cook the cabbage to your desired firmness.
