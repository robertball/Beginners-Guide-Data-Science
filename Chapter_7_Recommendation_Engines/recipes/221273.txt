Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a large cookie sheet with no-stick cooking spray. Combine flour and sugar in large bowl; mix well. Cut in 1/2 cup butter with pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in apricots.
Beat egg in 1-cup measuring cup. Add enough buttermilk to egg to make 1 cup. Stir in almond extract. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture; stir gently until soft dough forms. Drop dough by 1/4 cupfuls about 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheet.
