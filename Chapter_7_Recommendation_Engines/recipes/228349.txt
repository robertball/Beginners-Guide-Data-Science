Ingredients:
2 cups boiling water
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
3 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup warm water
3 cups bread flour, divided
3 cups whole wheat flour, divided
1 cup rye flour
1/2 cup powdered milk
1/4 cup vital wheat gluten
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 cup oil

Directions:
Combine boiling water, raisins, cherries, 1/4 cup honey, and dark brown sugar in a blender. Let stand until raisins and cherries have plumped up and liquid has cooled, about 10 minutes. Puree until liquefied.
Mix yeast, 1 tablespoon honey, and warm water together in a large bowl; let stand until bubbly, about 10 minutes.
Combine 2 cups bread flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour, rye flour, powdered milk, vital wheat gluten, and salt in a bowl.
Stir liquefied fruit mixture into the yeast mixture. Add the flour mixture. Stir until combined and a dough is formed, 6 to 8 minutes.
Mix oil into the dough. Add the remaining 1 cup whole wheat flour. Mix in the remaining 1 cup bread flour 1/4 cup at a time; dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl but still be sticky.
Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface; allow to rest for 10 minutes.
Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Dust with as little additional flour as possible; dough should be tacky, not dry.
Turn dough into an oiled bowl and cover with a loose cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
Turn dough onto a work surface and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces and shape into rounds. Place on a baking sheet. Score the top of each loaf with a sharp knife. Cover and allow to rise again until doubled, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (82 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes more.
Cool loaves on racks for at least 20 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This semi-dark bread is delicious any time of year, but it's perfect for autumn and Thanksgiving. While sturdy enough for sandwiches, it is wonderfully soft and moist for a dinner bread. Nobody will ever guess the secret ingredients of raisins and dried cherries.
