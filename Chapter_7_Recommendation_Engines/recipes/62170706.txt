Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 lb. bulk sausage (can use reduced fat like Jimmy Dean)
1/3 cup liquid egg whites (or one, large beaten egg)
1/3 cup grits
1 Tbsp. onion powder
1 Tbsp. garlic powder
1/2 cup catsup or your favorite barbeque sauce
2-5 shakes of liquid smoke (optional or according to taste)

Directions:
Line slow cooker with two 16X3 inch strips of aluminum foil in a crisscross pattern.   This can be done with a 16 inch sheet of aluminum foil that has been halved lengthwise and each half folded in half.  They should fit inside the cooker and not hang outside the edges.   Grease strips and inside cooker with non-stick cooking spray.
In a deep bowl combine all ingredients.  Shape into rounded loaf and place on top of foil strips in slow cooker.  Cover.  Cook on Low 5-6 hours.  Remove by carefully grasping ends of strips and lifting meatloaf out onto serving plate.  Loaf can be sliced immediately.  Serve alone, with gravy, or with catsup/BBQ sauce.  Refrigerate leftovers.  Makes great sandwiches cold or warmed in buttered fry pan.

Description: 
With this recipe you can enjoy a taste of sausage and grits in a meatloaf.  This gluten-free recipe uses the grits as a binder instead of the bread crumbs used in a traditional meatloaf recipe.  The slow cooking method results in a firm yet moist meatloaf that not only tastes great for dinner, but can be thinly sliced for next day lunch sandwiches.
