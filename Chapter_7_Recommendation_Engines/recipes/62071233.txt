Description: 
Mrs. Stapelton's applesauce is a legend in our household.  I can remember as a child getting to taste this delicious cake during the holidays.  We looked forward to getting her cakes every Christmas.  It's the most moist and delicious cake I have ever tasted.  It needs no frosting, it's delicious plain.  Makes 2 10 cake pans.
