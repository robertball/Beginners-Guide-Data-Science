Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons maple extract
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
10 dried Mission figs, chopped
1 (5 inch) fresh rosemary sprig

Directions:
Bring water, brown sugar, and maple extract to a boil in a non-reactive saucepan. Add cranberries and figs. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rosemary and cook until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes more.
Carefully remove rosemary sprig and discard. Remove pot from the burner and let cool, about 10 minutes. Pour sauce into a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.
