Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup pearl barley
8 ounces uncooked orecchiette pasta

Directions:
In a saucepan, bring the 1 1/2 cups water to a boil. Stir in the barley. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 30 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add orecchiette pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a food processor, finely chop the cilantro, green onions, and 1/2 the tomatoes. Mix in the broth and Parmesan cheese, and process until well blended.
In a large bowl, toss the barley, pasta, cilantro mixture, remaining tomatoes, and arugula. Season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

Description: 
This pasta dish is completely virtuous and completely delicious. And it's easy! Use any short, substantial pasta you like if you can't find orechietti. You can also make this with other fresh herbs. Good with more Parmesan on top!
