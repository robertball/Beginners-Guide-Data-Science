Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
1 teaspoon ginger paste
1 teaspoon garlic paste
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups plain yogurt
1/4 cup ground almonds
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
6 green chile peppers, mashed into a paste
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1 cup shredded coconut
salt to taste
1 cup water
1/4 cup heavy cream (optional)

Directions:
Thoroughly rub chicken pieces with ginger paste, garlic paste, and 1 teaspoon salt.
Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan or a kadhai over medium-high heat; fry the chicken pieces in the oil on both sides until well browned, about 5 minutes.
Mix the yogurt, almonds, cumin, coriander, and turmeric together in a bowl. Pour the yogurt mixture over the chicken and turn to coat; cook another 10 minutes. Stir the mashed chile peppers, cilantro, and mint into the pot; season with salt. Add the water, cover, reduce heat to low, and continue cooking until the chicken is tender, about 20 minutes more. Stir the cream into the sauce just before removing from heat to serve.

Description: 
This is a very flavourful and fresh tasting recipe for chicken with fresh herbs. It is a welcome change from heavy spiced chicken curries. This curry tastes great with plain cooked rice or jeera (cumin) rice.Modified from: Hara Masala Murgh
