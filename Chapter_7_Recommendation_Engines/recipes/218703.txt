Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Garlic Powder
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, softened
1 egg white
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine 1-1/2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar, salt and garlic powder in a large mixer bowl. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F). Add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft dough.
Cover and let dough rest 10 minutes in bowl.
Portion dough evenly into 12 to 15 greased muffin cups (2-1/2 x 1-1/4 inches).
Tip: Use an ice cream scoop to make portioning easier. Cover; let rise in warm, draft free place until doubled in bulk, about 35 minutes.
Combine egg white with 1 tablespoon water. Carefully brush tops of rolls with egg mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 to 18 minutes, or until lightly browned on top. Remove from pans and cool on wire rack.
