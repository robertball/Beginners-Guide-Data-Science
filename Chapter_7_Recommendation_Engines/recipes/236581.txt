Ingredients:
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon spicy brown mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (4 ounce) fillets mahi mahi

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Whisk lime juice, olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, mustard, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; brush over mahi mahi to coat.
Bake on the preheated grill for 5 minutes, flip, brush again with the lime juice mixture, and continue grilling until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Wonderful and easy. You can adjust all ingredients to taste. I usually serve with a salad and use reserve marinade as a dressing. When grilling, I flip often and continue brushing to obtain a strong flavor. Is also excellent as a stand-alone dressing.
