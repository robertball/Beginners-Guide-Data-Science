Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 large egg  beaten
2 tbsp coconut oil
1/2 cup coconut sugar or regular white
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp coconut aminos or gluten-free soy sauce/tamari
1/4 cup ketchup or Low FODMAP Ketchup
1/4 cup chicken broth or stock
1 red bell pepper cut into chunks
1 cup pineapple chunks
3 green onion stalks

Directions:
First prepare the sauce by adding the coconut sugar, vinegar, coconut aminos, chicken stock and ketchup to a medium sauce pan. Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low heat and leave until later.
Add chicken pieces and beaten egg to a large ziplock bag. Seal and shake to coat chicken. Then add the arrowroot starch to the bag, shaking again to lightly coat all the chicken pieces.
Add coconut oil to a large non skillet. Add the coated chicken. Fry over medium heat, a couple of minutes on each side until the coating begins to crisp. Add pepper and pineapple chunks.
Continue to saute over medium heat until chicken is browned and cooked through.
Add the sauce to chicken and peppers. Cover and reduce the heat down to a simmer and allow the juices to soak into the chicken for a few minutes. Top with sliced green onions. Serve over rice and enjoy!
