Ingredients:
• 2 Cups All-purpose Flour
• 2 T. Crisco Shortening
• 1 t. Salt
• 1/2 Cup Hot Tap Water

Directions:
Blend flour, salt & shortening until the mixure looks "mealy"
Slowly add water and mix until dough forms a soft ball.  (I use a food processor)
Empty dough onto a well-floured board and roll out until about 1/8 inch thick.  Sprinkle flour over dough to prevent sticking. Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut into 2 inch strips and cut again into 2 inch squares
Drop squares into hot boiling broth - cover and cook about 15 minutes on top stove or 30 minutes in oven.  Broth should make nice smooth gravy.  These dumplings are great for chicken, beef and pork.  ENJOY!!!!

Description: 
This is a recipe I have used that my Mother used when I was a kid.  We had Chicken & Dumplings for every Sunday Dinner. I like to use a fresh old hen for the best broth. Submitted by: Dorsey Marshall, Jr.
