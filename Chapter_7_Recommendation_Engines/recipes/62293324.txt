Jim's Basic Scones With Variations Recipe

Ingredients:
3-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup powdered sugar
4 tsp baking powder
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
1 cup milk
2 eggs
Egg wash (1 egg + 1 Tbs water or milk)
2 cups of any combination of diced fruit and/or chocolate

Directions:
In a medium mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients and mix well.
Add any 2-cup combination of your choice of diced fresh or dried fruit and/or chocolate.  Mix well.
Add the butter and cut it into the dry mixture with a pastry blender or two butter knives.
Add the milk and 2 eggs and mix just enough to combine.  Turn onto a floured surface and knead a couple of times to make the dough come together.  (Remember - you're not making bread here, so cut out the gluten production!)
Divide the dough in half and roll or pat each half into a 6 to 8-inch circle approximately 1-1/2 high.  Cut each circle into six wedges and place on a parchment lined baking sheet.
Combine the egg wash ingredients and lightly beat together.  Brush the tops only of the scones with the egg wash, reserving extra egg wash.
Place the tray of scones in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Remove the chilled scones from the fridge and brush the tops with egg wash one more time.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and the scones are cooked through.

Description: 
I cajoled this recipe out of my co-worker after he gave me one of the scones he had baked.  They are light and fluffy and the best part is you can adapt them with any add-ins you choose!
