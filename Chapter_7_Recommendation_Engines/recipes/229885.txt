Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
3/4 pound bulk chorizo sausage
1/2 cup cooked rice
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup taco sauce
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 poblano peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons taco sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chorizo in hot oil until completely browned and broken into small pieces, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; stir rice, onion, 1/4 cup taco sauce, Cheddar cheese, and cumin with the chorizo until evenly mixed.
Fill poblano pepper halves with the chorizo mixture; place in a small casserole dish or a pie pan. Drizzle 1 tablespoon taco sauce over each pepper. Pour water into bottom of the dish; cover loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.
