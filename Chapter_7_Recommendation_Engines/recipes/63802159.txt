Ingredients:
1/2 pound to 1 pound of bratwurst or your favorite sausage, sliced
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
About 1/2 pound of kale, chopped and tough stems removed
1 quart chicken broth
1 large potato, peeled and chopped
1 large can white beans, rinsed
Seasoned with ... salt, pepper, 2 bay leaves, and nutmeg

Directions:
Cook bratwurst until done. Set aside. Our bratwurst is rather lean so there is really a very small amount of residual fat left in the pan. I use that little bit of rendered fat to saute the onion and garlic for a minute or two. Add the kale, potato, and cooked sausage. Add the broth and seasonings. Stir well. Simmer on low to medium low for about 40 minutes. Add the beans and cook on low for another ten minutes. Enjoy!
