Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless chicken, with skin,
2 cups self-rising flour,
1 1/2 cups cold water,
1 can cream of chicken soup,
salt and pepper to taste,
1/2 stick melted butter.

Directions:
Boil chicken in water enough to cover, and chicken soup,and salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl, mix flour, water and melted butter.  If mixture is too thin, add a little more flour, and if it is too thick add a little more water.  You want it to be the consistency of biscuit dough.  Roll Dough onto a floured surface, to about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into one inch strips.  Add each dumpling to boiling water, and cool until done about 20 minutes.  Season again to taste with salt and pepper.
