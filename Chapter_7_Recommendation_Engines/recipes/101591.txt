Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 envelope dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 cup sour cream
Â¼ cup sherry wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), and grease a 7x11 inch baking dish.
Pound the chicken breasts with a meat mallet until flattened. Place 1 tablespoon of butter on each breast, and sprinkle with Italian dressing mix. Roll up the breasts, secure them with toothpicks, and place in the baking dish.
Whisk together the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and sherry in a bowl until smooth, and pour over the chicken rolls.
Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and tender and the sauce is bubbling, about 1 1/2 hours.
