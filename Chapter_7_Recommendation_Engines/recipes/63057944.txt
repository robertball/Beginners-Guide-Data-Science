Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup chunky homestyle applesauce
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
1-2 small (4 ounce) boxes butterscotch instant pudding
3 medium carrots, shredded
Cream Cheese Frosting
Caramel Glaze

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with cinnamon-sugar mixture of 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar.
Pour the batter evenly into loaf or cake pans.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
Prepare caramel glaze (see footnote.) Poke top of warm cake every 1/2 inch with handle of wooden spoon, wiping handle occasionally to reduce sticking. Reserving 1/2 cup caramel glaze, drizzle remaining caramel topping evenly over top of cake; let stand about 15 minutes or until caramel topping has been absorbed into cake.
Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled.
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the remaining 1/2 cup caramel glaze. Stir remaining glaze into cream cheese frosting and spread.
Drizzle with reserved 2 tablespoons caramel topping. Store covered in refrigerator.
ENJOY!
