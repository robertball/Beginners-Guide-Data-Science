Ingredients:
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium zucchini, cubed
1 clove garlic, minced
8 large tomatoes, cored

1 tablespoon chopped fresh red chile pepper
1 (14 ounce) can vegetable broth
1 tablespoon dried tarragon
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the zucchini and garlic in the skillet until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.
In a blender or food processor, puree the tomatoes, onion, and chile pepper, leaving a few small chunks.
In a large pot, mix the tomato puree and vegetable broth. Season with tarragon, dill, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and mix in the zucchini and garlic. Cover, and cook 45 minutes.

Description: 
At a point of abundance with tomatoes and zucchini from my garden I came up with this soup. A friend said it was like a soup you would get at one of those chic 5 star restaurants! Serve with crusty French bread and salad. This soup tastes wonderful after a little cooking or simmering a long time. Sometimes I add cooked rice to give a bit more substance.
