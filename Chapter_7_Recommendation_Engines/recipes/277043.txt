Ingredients:
Beans:
2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
48 ounces water
1 1/2 pounds smoked ham, cut into chunks
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Soup:
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons quick-mixing flour (such as WondraÂ®)
1/2 onion, finely diced
1 teaspoon dried minced onion
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Cover green beans with water in a large pot. Add ham, bouillon, paprika, and cayenne. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and let simmer until beans are tender, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add flour and cook until almost brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in diced onion; cook until it begins to brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir dried onions in the mixture until they begin to lightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes, being careful as they burn easily. Add paprika and pepper. Pour in water and stir until mixture is smooth.
Whip sour cream in a bowl and mix into flour mixture until smooth. Stir sour cream mixture into cooled green beans. Heat soup over medium heat until simmering; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve.
