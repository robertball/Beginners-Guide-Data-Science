Ingredients:
1 - 8oz.   Cream Cheese
1 - 8oz.   Cool Whip
1/2 Cup    Sugar
1 can      Crushed Pinneaple, Drained
1 cup      Crushed Pretzels
1 stick    Butter
1/3 cup    Sugar

Directions:
Mix softened cream cheese with 1/2 c sugar, add pineapple.  Mix well.  Add Cool Whip and mix.   Chill
Combine 1 cup crushed pretzels (recommend crushing with rolling pin), 1 stick of butter melted and 1/3 cup sugar together.   Spread on teflon cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 6-8 minutes.   Mixture will form a toffee like bar.  Break up baked pretzels when cool and add to cream cheese mixture.
I recommend not to add pretzels until ready to serve.
I usually double this recipe for parties.   If you want to use for a dip for pretzels, one batch should be enough
Enjoy!
