Ingredients:
2/3 cup canned small white beans, undrained
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 cups brown sugar(I used coarse, unrefined Turbinado sugar)
2 eggs
2/3 cup buttermilk(or sour milk)
3 cups whole wheat flour
1/4 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease three large cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
2. In a blender or food processor, puree white beans until completely smooth and no chunks remain, to make 1/2 cup puree. Add 1-2 Tbsp water if needed to make smooth.
3. In a large bowl, cream butter with an electric mixer. Beat in white bean puree, sugar, eggs, and buttermilk. Sift together flour, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, and baking powder. Gradually beat into butter mixture. Stir in oats.
4. Drop dough by tablespoons onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake in preheated oven about 7-10 minutes, or until slightly  browned on bottom.

Description: 
This is a recipe that has been passed down in my family for I don't know how many generations! When my grandmother passed away, I inherited some of her recipe cards...this was one of them! I'm particularly concerned with making recipes a little healthier for my family so in this I substitute a combination of white bean puree and butter for the original shortening. The change is completely indistinguishable!
