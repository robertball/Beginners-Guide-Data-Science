Ingredients:
5 small zucchini (about 1 1/4 pounds)
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 eggs
6 ounces crumbled feta
One frozen 9-inch regular or whole-wheat pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Slice 1 zucchini very thinly and set aside. Grate the remaining zucchini, firmly squeezing them by the handful to remove as much liquid as possible.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs. Reserve Â½ cup of the cheese, and then stir the grated zucchini and remaining cheese into the egg mixture.
Transfer to the pie crust, top with the sliced zucchini (arranging it in circles, if you like) and reserved cheese, and bake until firm and golden brown, 50-55 minutes. Set aside to let cool, and then serve warm or cold.
