Heat non-dairy butter in a 10-inch non-stick saucepan over high heat. Pour in water when butter has completely melted. Add pasta, reserving included sauce packet. Bring to a boil; let boil until most of the water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Pour in soy milk; reduce heat to medium-low.
Stir in reserved macaroni sauce packet rapidly using a whisk to mix smoothly. Let simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
