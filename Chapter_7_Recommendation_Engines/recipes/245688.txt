1 (3.5 ounce) package microwave popcorn
3 (1.55 ounce) bars white chocolate almond bark, broken into pieces

Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Stir melted white chocolate and peppermint candies into popcorn. Spread evenly on a baking sheet; allow to cool and harden, about 15 minutes.
