Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1.5-2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast
Salt and Pepper to taste
3 Cloves garlic- minced
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 can sliced bamboo shoots
1 can pineapple chunks
1 can sliced water chestnuts
1 can mandarin oranges
2 stalks celery
1 cup raw broccoli
6-8 ounces teriyaki or stir fry sauce

Directions:
1) Cut chicken into bite size pieces and heat in oil over medium heat with salt, pepper, garlic and crushed red pepper.
2) While chicken is cooking drain juices out of canned fruits and veggies.  Wash fresh veggies and cut into bite size pieces.
3) When chicken is just about thoroughly cooked add broccoli, celery, bamboo and water chestnuts.
4) When veggies are almost tender to your liking, add pineapple and a minute later toss with your choice of sauce.
5) Turn off heat and carefully add mandarin oranges so they do not fall apart.
6) Serve immediately with steamed white rice.
