Ingredients:
3/4 beef cup stock, canned is fine
1/4 cup artichoke juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 to 1-1/2 pound tenderized chuck steak, cut into about six to eight pieces.
A bit of flour (half cup,you will only use about half))
1 pinch salt
1 can artichoke hearts, chopped, liquid reserved
1/2 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1/2 can chili's chopped (small 4.25 oz can)
2 teaspoon capers
3 tablespoons prepared horseradish (creamy)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)(lower shelf of the AGA)
Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe Dutch oven over high heat.
Season the chuck steak on both sides with salt and dredge in just a little flour, and cook in the hot oil until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. At this point remove the meat and set aside.
Pour 3/4 cup beef stock and 1/4 cup artichoke juice into the Dutch oven, scrape up the bits (the "bloom") from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the artichokes, red peppers, chili's, capers, and the creamy horseradish. Bring to a boil, return the beef to the pan then cover, and place into the preheated oven. Bake until the meat is tender, approx. 45 to 60 minutes depending on the amount of beef.
Let it sit in the dutch oven for about fifteen minutes before serving for the flavors to marry.
Serve over/with rice, noodles or even spaghetti.

Description: 
Artichokes and canned vegetables combine for a easy steak dish to make for a any occasion. Most if the ingredients will be found in your pantry. If you don't have artichokes use mushrooms....this dish is very forgiving!Modified from: Braised Skirt Steak with Artichoke
