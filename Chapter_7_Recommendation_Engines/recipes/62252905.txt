Ingredients:
1 Box (9oz.) No-Boil Lasagne Noodles
2 Eggs
15 oz. Ricotta Cheese
16 oz. Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (Divided)
1/2 Cup (2 oz.) grated Parmesan Cheese
1 Lb. Italian Sausage or Ground Beef (optional)
2 Jars Italian Baking or Marinara Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
(Optional)Brown meat in a saute pan, drain and put aside.
Spray baking pan (13x9x3) with non stick cooking spray.
In medium bowl, beat eggs and stir in ricotta, 2 cups of mozzarella and the parmesan.
*If using a 2-inch pan, make three layers to avoid possible boiling over.  Use same amount of filling and 12 uncooked noodles.  Spoon half jar of sauce on bottom of pan, layer with 4 noodles, half ricotta mixture and (optional) browned meat, add remaining sauce from first jar.  Add 1 cup of mozzarella.  Layer 4 noodles, remaining ricotta mixture and (optional) browned meat and half of the second jar of sauce.  Top with 4 noodles, remaining sauce and 1 cup of mozzarella.  Bake as directed below.
To Assemble:
When layering lasagne, slightly overlap noodles.  Lasagne will expand to the edges during cooking.  Spread fillings to edges to seal in and cook the lasagne during baking.  Layer in the following order.
1) Spread 1 cup of sauce on bottom of baking pan.
2) Layer 4 noodles, 1/3 of ricotta mixture, half of (optional) browned meat, 1 cup of mozzarella, and 1 cup of sauce.
3) Layer 4 noodles, 1/3 of ricotta mixture, and 1 1/2 cup of sauce
4) Layer 4 noodles, the remaining ricotta mixture and (optional) browned meat, and 1 cup of sauce.
5) Layer 4 noodles, the remaining sauce, and remaining 1 cup of mozzarella.
6) Spray foil with non-stick spray and seal pan.
To cook and serve:
Bake, covered with foil until bubbly.  50-60 minutes.  Uncover and continue cooking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.  Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.
