Ingredients:
3/4 cup natural creamy peanut butter
2/3 cup white sugar, or to taste, divided
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
24 milk chocolate candy kisses (such as Hershey's KissesÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Beat peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, butter, and brown sugar together in a bowl until creamy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract until combined.
Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir into the peanut butter mixture. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Roll in remaining white sugar to coat. Place on baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cracks form on the surface of the cookies, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and place a milk chocolate kiss in the center of each cookie, pressing down gently. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
