Ingredients:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large ripe bananas, mashed
2 eggs, well beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
Frosting:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square glass baking dish.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl on low power in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add melted chocolate, bananas, eggs, and vanilla extract; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-blended. Stir in pecans. Spread batter in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool, about 25 minutes.
Combine butter and cocoa powder in a saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth, about 3 minutes. Stir in confectioners' sugar and milk. Add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until frosting is spreading consistency.
Spread frosting over cooled brownies. Cut into squares.
