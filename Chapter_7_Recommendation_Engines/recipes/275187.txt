Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground raw turkey
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup instant oatmeal
1 cup grated carrots
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Mix together turkey, flour, oatmeal, carrots, eggs, and olive oil in a bowl. Let sit until liquid has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 12-cup muffin tins.
Spoon turkey mixture into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool on a rack.

Description: 
This easy, quick, and healthy dog snack recipe comes from my aunt who lives on a farm and makes her own dog food. I make it often for my favorite rescue dogs and other furry friends--a jar of this makes a great gift for a friend adopting a new dog. The kitties agree with my dog that these snacks are delicious. Make a batch to store in the fridge, and another for the freezer!
