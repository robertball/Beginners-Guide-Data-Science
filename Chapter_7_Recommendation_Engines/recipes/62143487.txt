Ingredients:
1 loaf day old french bread
5 eggs
2 1/2 Cups milk
3/4 Cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1-2 tsp. cinnamon
Filling:
8 oz cream cheese, softened
2 Tbl brown sugar
Zest and juice from 1 orange
1/2 Cup chopped pecans
additional pecans and zest for garnish

Directions:
In a bowl, combine eggs, milk, brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon; set aside.
Slice loaf into 12 1" slices.
In a mixer combine cream cheese, brown sugar, zest and juice, mix well until softened.
Spread some of this between half of the french bread slices, top with a second slice to make a sandwich, sprinkle with some pecans.
Arrange sandwiches in a 9x13 baking dish.
Pour egg mixture over all in pan (the bread will absorb most of this by morning).
Cover and refrigerate for 8 hrs or overnight.
Remove each sandwich from pan and place on a lined baking sheet.
Garnish with additional pecans and zest.
Bake uncovered at 350' for 35-40 minutes.

Description: 
This is not your traditional fried french toast, it's more like a custard bread pudding-like french toast. The insides will be soft and delicious from soaking overnight, and flavorful with this cream cheese filling.
