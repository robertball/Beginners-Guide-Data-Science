Ingredients:
25 ounces nonfat plain yogurt
1/2 large English cucumber - halved, seeded, and grated
1 carrot, grated
salt to taste
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Spoon yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined colander; set aside until most of water has drained, at least 30 minutes.
Place grated cucumber and grated carrot in a cheesecloth-lined colander; sprinkle with salt. Place a heavy object, such as a bowl, atop cucumber and carrot to drain excess water, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix yogurt, cucumber, carrot, onion, red bell pepper, celery, parsley, lemon juice, mint, and cumin in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Refrigerate for flavors to blend, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
I'm a huge fan of raita but I always find myself wanting more veggies in it. So over time I developed this recipe. It's high in protein and tastes great. I've largely given up on dipping anything in it. I just eat it by the spoonful. 

The recipe takes a while, but it makes enough to merit it.
