Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup coconut sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup cane sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground Ceylon cinnamon
1 teaspoon Himalayan salt
1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 1/2 cups chickpea flour (besan)
3 cups grated, drained zucchini
1 cup pecans
1 cup fresh raspberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf plans with coconut oil and sprinkle with gluten-free flour.
Beat eggs in a large bowl; stir in coconut sugar, coconut oil, applesauce, cane sugar, vanilla extract, baking soda, baking powder, Ceylon cinnamon, and Himalayan salt. Mix in gluten-free flour and chickpea flour, 1 cup at a time; stir until mixed well. Fold in zucchini, pecans, and raspberries. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 1/4 hours.

Description: 
In an effort to eat healthier, I came up with this recipe for a much healthier zucchini bread, and I was pleasantly surprised that something that is good for you tastes so good. I have raspberry plants and a garden with zucchini so these are plentiful at this time of year. I also have an apple tree where I cook the apples down with no sugar added and then jar them for later use.
