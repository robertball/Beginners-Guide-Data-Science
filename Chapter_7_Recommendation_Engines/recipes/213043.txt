Description: 
Combining two of the holiday season's best flavors, this dessert is easy to make and a crowd pleaser! If you are feeling fancy, you can pipe your top layer of whipped cream on the trifle. Since I normally travel with this dessert and put a lid on it, I just spread a nice thick layer on top and then sprinkle with some chopped dried cranberries and crumbled gingerbread cookies.
