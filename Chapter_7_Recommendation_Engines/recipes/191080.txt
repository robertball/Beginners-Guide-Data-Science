Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
3 small summer squash, sliced
salt to taste
4 (7 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped tomato

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add the squash in three batches, making sure the first has softened slightly before adding the next. Season with salt.
Heat the tortillas in the microwave until warm, about 10 seconds. Spoon the squash mixture into the center of the tortillas; top with the Cheddar cheese and tomato. Roll into a burrito to serve.

Description: 
Every time I make these, they taste soooo good, but I love summer squash. I hope you enjoy them too. Also try these with zucchini or yellow squash.
