Ingredients:
1 egg white, room temperature
1/3 cup coconut sugar
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon slivered almonds, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 8x8-inch baking dish with parchment paper.
Whisk egg white, coconut sugar, and almond extract together in a bowl. Fold almond flour into egg mixture until just combined; spread batter into baking dish. Sprinkle almonds over top of batter and press down lightly.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack using the parchment to lift it out of baking dish. Cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.

Description: 
I was looking for a mildly sweet treat to have with tea that wasn't filled with butter or artificial ingredients in general.  These are delicious! They happen to be paleo-friendly as well. The best things really are the simplest. I like coconut sugar because it's less sweet, but any sugar would work. These cookies freeze really well.
