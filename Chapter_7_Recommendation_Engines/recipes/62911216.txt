Ingredients:
1 whole butternut squash, cubed
1 1/4 c chicken broth
1 1/2 c milk
2 garlic cloves
1 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 Tbsp sour cream or ricotta
1 1/4 c swiss cheese
1 1/4 c GOOD parm, grated
1 box pasta
1 tsp olive oil
1/2 c Panko
2 Tbsp parm

Directions:
Combine squash, milk, broth, & garlic in saucepan.  Bring to a boil then reduce heat & simmer until squash is cooked (about 25 minutes).
Cook pasta.
Place the contents of the saucepan in the blender and blend until smooth.  Add salt, pepper, & cheese and mix until cheese is melted (mixture must still be hot!)
Combine pasta & squash/cheese mixture. Pour into a casserole dish (add milk as needed). Can be made ahead up to this point (just may need to add more milk!)
Heat oil. Add panko and cook until brown (about 2 min). Removed from heat & add remaining parm.  Sprinkle over top of Mac & Cheese.
Cook in oven for about 25 min.
