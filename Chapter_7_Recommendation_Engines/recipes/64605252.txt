Ingredients:
1-1/2 pounds ground beef
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed tomato soup, undiluted
3/4 cup water
1 envelope taco seasoning
1 tube (16.3 ounces) large refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
Optional toppings: shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, salsa, sliced ripe olives, sour cream and thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Fold an 18-in. square piece of heavy-duty foil in half to make an 18x9-in. strip. Place strip on bottom and up sides of a 6-qt. crock pot. Coat strip with cooking spray.
In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat 6-8 minutes or until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles; drain. Stir in soup, water and taco seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 3-5 minutes or until slightly thickened.
Cut each biscuit into four pieces; gently stir into beef mixture. Transfer to crock pot. Cook, covered, on low 3-4 hours or until dough is cooked through. Sprinkle with cheese. Cook, covered, 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Serve with toppings of your choice.
