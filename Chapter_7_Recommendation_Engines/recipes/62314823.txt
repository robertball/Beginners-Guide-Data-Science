Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
1 Tbs baking powder
1 Tbs sugar
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup or one stick butter, unsalted
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
16 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
4 Jalapeno peppers, seeded, diced
1 cup buttermilk
1 egg + 1 Tbs water, lightly beaten
Optional: jalapeno chile powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Shred cheese and set aside.
Remove the seeds and ribs from the jalapenos and finely dice. You may want to wear gloves. Don't wipe your eyes.
Into a large bowl, combine flour, black pepper, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or fork until butter is in pea sized lumps. Add cheese and jalapenos and toss in flour mixture. This prevents the cheese from clumping. Add the the buttermilk and work into a sticky dough. Be patient, not like me, and mix the dough. Don't be tempted to add additional liquid unless necessary.
Gather ingredients into a ball and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into two equal amounts. With your finger tips, form 2 eight inch circles of 3/4 inch thickness. The thickness is more important than the diameter. Cut each circle into 8 wedges with a sharp knife. Transfer wedges to a baking sheet leaving 1/2 inch between each of the wedges. For a deeper, shiny color paint the tops of the wedges with the lighly beaten egg plus water. Bake until golden brown, 22 to 23 minutes. Remove from the oven. For bolder flavor, dust lightly with jalapeno chile powder. Best served warm.

Caution, only for those who like scones with a strong cheese presence and a little jalapeno pepper bite. This is for my friend Patrick.
