Ingredients:
3 chicken breast halves
1 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1 cup nutritional yeast
1 t ground rosemary
1 t crushed red pepper
1 t oregano
1/2 t salt
1/2 t black pepper
3 eggs
2 T milk
2 T vegetable oil

Directions:
Cut the chicken into medallions about half an inch thick.
Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium.
Beat the eggs in a bowl, and mix in the milk with the eggs.
Combine the nutritional yeast, spices, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of the flour, and place them on a large plate. Put the rest of the flour on another plate.
Coat each piece of chicken with flour by placing it on the plate full of flour and then turning it over to coat the other side, dip the chicken in the egg mixture, then coat it in the yeast mixture, and place it in the skillet, making sure it does not overlap other pieces.
Cook for about five minutes per side, or until golden-brown.

Description: 
I developed this recipe while trying to batter-fry my chicken without using a deep fryer. It uses nutritional yeast, but you can substitute breadcrumbs if you want. The spices are also highly flexible depending on your tastes!
