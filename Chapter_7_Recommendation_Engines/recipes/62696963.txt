Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 cup celery (optional)
2 cups cubed cooked chicken
1/2 cup sliced pitted ripe black olives
1/2 cup chopped green pepper (optional)
2 tablespoons grated onion
1 cup mayo and miracle whip
1 tablespoon brown spicy mustard
2 cups seedless red or green grapes, halved (optional)
1 pkg Chow mein noodles
Lettuce Leaves(optional)
Sliced almonds
DRESSING:
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
Combine cooked chicken, celery, oranges, olives, grapes, green pepper and onion.  Blend mayo and mustard, toss gently with chicken mix.  Cover and chill several hours. (I often skip that step!)  Just before serving, mix in chow mien noodles, turn salad into lettuce lined serving bowl.
This salad does not keep well.  Ingredients are to taste so be creative!
