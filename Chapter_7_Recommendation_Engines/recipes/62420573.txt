Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut in half (or boneless chicken breasts)
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp lemon juice

Directions:
Rinse chicken halves, and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken cut side down in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine sugar, soy sauce, grated ginger, lemon juice and garlic. Mix well, and pour mixture over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven for 1 hour, basting frequently. Test for doneness, making sure there is no pink left in the meat. Let cool slightly, then cut into smaller pieces to serve.
