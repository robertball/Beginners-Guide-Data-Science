Ingredients:
1 cup Butter, softened
1/2 cup Sugar
1 cup Almonds (skins on), finely chopped
1 1/2 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract
1/2 tsp. Pure Almond Extract
2 cups Flour
Sugar for pressing out cookies

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 350Â°.
2. Beat butter and sugar until creamy.  Add both extracts and beat another 30 seconds.
3. Add the almonds then the flour.  Dough will be slightly crumbly but will resemble something like a pie crust.
4. Using a teaspoon sized cookie scoop (or larger if you prefer) scoop out dough onto an ungreesed cookie sheet.  Using a flat bottomed glass dipped in sugar, flatten each cookie.
5. Bake for 8 minutes.  Do not brown bottoms.  Remove from oven and cool on a rack.  Store in an air-tight container.

Description: 
This is my all time favorite cookie recipe.  My mom used to make these around Christmas time every year and I just couldn't ever get enough of them.  I'm so glad I carried on the tradition of making these delicate subtlety sweet and nutty cookies!
