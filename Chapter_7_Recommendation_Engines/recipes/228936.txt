Mix flour, sugar, and milk together in a large bowl; pour into baking dish with melted butter. Spread peaches over the batter and sprinkle with cinnamon.

Description: 
I have some amazing friends on the East coast that shared with me their mom's peach cobbler. I have never liked peaches no matter how prepared. But I make this at night and chill it overnight for a delicious and quick breakfast. The only change I made was adding cinnamon. We substituted the regular sugar with SplendaÂ®, so my son could eat a big piece.
