Ingredients:
Soup:
1/2 cup butter, cut into cubes
3 baking potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
1 small onion, diced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
3 cups whole milk
6 cups water
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon
Knoephla:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
7 tablespoons whole milk, or more as needed
1 egg, beaten
2 teaspoons dill weed
2 teaspoons parsley
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; saute potatoes, onion, and 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper until just tender, about 20 minutes. Stir 3 cups milk into potato mixture and heat until almost boiling, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Bring water and chicken bouillon to a boil in a Dutch oven or heavy pot.
Combine flour, 7 tablespoons milk, egg, dill, parsley, 1 teaspoon pepper, and salt together in a bowl until dough is stiff. Add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed. Roll dough into ropes about 1/2-inch thick on a work surface. Cut ropes into 1/4-inch pieces and drop into boiling broth. Reduce heat, cover Dutch oven with a lid, and simmer until knoephla begin to float, about 10 minutes.
Stir potato mixture into broth and knoephla; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is not a soup for those watching calories! A German potato soup with small dough balls that I grew up with. It is rich, creamy, and will stick to your ribs. The women in the family have been making this soup for generations, and I've added my own twist to the base recipe.
