Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter; (1 stick) room temperature
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter; resist the temptation to use more ;-)
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar; packed
2 eggs
2.5 cups regular flour
1.5 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 cups chocolate chips; either semi-sweet or milk chocolate

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix butter, shortening, peanut butter, granulated and brown sugars, and eggs. If you use a mixer, blend on medium.
Separately, mix together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add to other mixture. If you use a blender, start on low speed (don't want to poof flour everywhere!)
Mix in chocolate chips.
I love recipes that you can freeze - this freezes great! If you're going to freeze, make large tablespoon-sized balls and lay them out in a Tupperware container separating each layer with parchment or wax paper.
If you're going to cook right away, preheat oven to 400F and place the the tablespoon-sized balls onto a cookie sheet lined with Silpat pad or parchment paper.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes from room temp, or 12 - 14 minutes from frozen. Time depends a lot on just how big you make them - what you're looking for is a nice golden doneness.
Let cool on the cookie sheet

Description: 
More Chocolate Chip than Peanut Butter... but there's just a hint of peanut butter in these cookies that will leave everyone asking for more!
