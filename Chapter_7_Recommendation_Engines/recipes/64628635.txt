Ingredients:
2 Lg chicken breasts
2 minced garlic cloves
2 tsp chicken bouillon or to taste
½ -1 tsp ground cumin
2 cups chedder cheese
4oz can of green chilies undrained ( I use ¾ of the can but you can use the whole can if you like).
½ cup chopped onion
3 Tbsp Margarine or butter
1 cup hot water
2 cups half and half or 1 cup cream and one cup milk
16 oz can of creamed corn
3-4 slices of cooked bacon ( crumbled)

Directions:
I like to bake my chicken breast in the oven and shred it but you can also cook it while cooking the onions. Add chopped onions and minced garlic in a deep pot and brown in butter until soft. Dissolve chicken Oxo powder in 1 cup of water. Add to pan, along with the cumin; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add cooked bacon and creamed corn, cream, and chilies, cook for 10 minutes then add the cheese and stir till cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
