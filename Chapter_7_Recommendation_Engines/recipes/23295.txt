Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter, softened*
1 egg
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa

Directions:
Combine sugar and butter in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy (1 to 2 minutes).  Add egg and almond extract; continue beating until well mixed (1 minute).  Reduce speed to low; beat, gradually adding flour and cocoa and scraping bowl often, until well mixed (1 to 2 minutes).
Divide dough into thirds.  Wrap each third in plastic food wrap; refrigerate until firm (2 hours or overnight).
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Shape dough with floured hands, one-third at a time (keep remaining dough refrigerated), into 1-inch balls.  Form balls into desired shapes (balls, squares, logs, etc.).  Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until set (surface may crack slightly).  Cool completely.  Decorate as desired.
