Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup white sugar
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 eggs
48 chocolate-covered caramel candies (such as Rolo®)
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 ounces chocolate almond bark (chocolate confectioners coating) (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a small bowl. Beat 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add vanilla extract and eggs; beat well. Stir flour mixture into sugar mixture; mix well.
Lightly flour hands. Shape about 1 tablespoon dough around 1 chocolate-covered caramel candy, covering it completely. Repeat with remaining dough and caramel candies.
Place 2 tablespoons white sugar in a small bowl. Press one side of each ball into sugar. Place balls, sugar sides up, onto a baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookie is set and slightly cracked, 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for about 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
Melt almond bark in a saucepan over low heat. Drizzle over cookies.
