Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups rice, cooked
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
3 pita bread rounds, cut in half
lettuce leaves
tomato slices

Directions:
Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer under cold running water until no longer cloudy. Transfer to a medium saucepan and cover with 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, remove from heat and let stand for at least 10 minutes, or until all liquid has evaporated. Set aside to cool.
Cook onion and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon oil over medium high heat until tender. Add ground beef and thyme, and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally and reducing heat if necessary.
In a bowl, stir together cooked rice, meat mixture, avocado, and parsley. In a separate bowl, whisk together olive oil, rice vinegar, and desired amount of salt and pepper. Pour over rice mixture, and toss lightly. Line each pita half with lettuce and tomato, and fill each with rice mixture. Serve warm or cold. Enjoy!

Description: 
This is a unique, light beef and rice mixture that is fabulous served warm in pita pockets, or even cold the next day. I got the recipe from my mom, who had modified it from a cookbook she got a long time ago.
