Ingredients:
6 dried whole wheat lasagna noodles
2 1/2 cups zucchini and/or yellow summer squash halved lengthwise and sliced
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1/3 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup light ricotta cheese
1/4 cup snipped fresh Italian (flat leaf) parsley
3 tablespoons finely shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups Classico® Four Cheese pasta sauce
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup chopped, seeded tomato

Directions:
Cook noodles according to package directions; drain and rinse with cold water. Drain well.
Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet cook and stir squash, mushrooms*, and onion in hot oil over medium-high heat about 5 minutes or until tender; remove from heat and set aside. In a small bowl combine ricotta cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, and pepper. *TIP: Baby portobello mushrooms taste great in this recipe.
To assemble, place 3 lasagna noodles in the bottom of a 2-quart rectangular baking dish, trimming to fit as necessary. Spoon half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with half of the vegetable mixture, half of the Classico(R) Four Cheese pasta sauce, and half of the mozzarella cheese. Layer with remaining noodles, ricotta cheese mixture, vegetable mixture, and sauce.
Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with tomato and the remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes more or until heated through. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
