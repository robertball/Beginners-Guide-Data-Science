Description: 
A slice of toast with a schmear of Burrata is already a beautiful thing, but when you add a nice pinch of Herbes de Provence salt, then a slice of peach brulee, you are talking about a whole new level of beautiful. This is perfect for any kind of entertaining that occurs while fresh peaches are still in season.
