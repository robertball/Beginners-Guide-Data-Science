Baked Mini Meatballs Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
4 cloves fresh garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup sundried tomatoes, finely chopped (drained of oil)
1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 well beaten eggs
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients (except for the olive oil) thoroughly.  I prefer using my hands to blend all ingredients together.
Place a small amount of the meatball mixture in your hands and roll into a ball that is an inch and a half in diameter.
I cook these meatballs in a nonstick mini muffin pan to enable me to control them better than a standard cookie sheet, but either can be used.  Use the olive oil to grease your pan or cookie sheet to avoid having the meatballs stick.
If using a conventional oven, cook for 6 minutes, then flip the meatballs over and cook for another 6 minutes.
If using a convection oven in convection/bake mode, reduce the time to 5 minutes on each side.
The internal temperature of the meatballs should be 160 degrees.

Description: 
These mini meatballs are very versatile and can be added to any dish, including soup.  I love to serve these as an appetizer with pasta sauce or in a pasta dish with sauce and vegetables.
