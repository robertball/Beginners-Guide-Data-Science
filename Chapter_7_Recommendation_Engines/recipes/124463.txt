Description: 
I found this recipe on a trip to Southern California. Since then, this versatile dish has become one of my family's favorites. I serve it as a special breakfast, for brunch or even Sunday night supper. Sausage or ham goes well with this snappy dish...and don't forget some corn muffins!
