Ingredients:
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
cooking spray
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) or preheat outdoor grill.
Arrange the asparagus on a baking sheet for the oven, or use a grill basket or make asparagus "rafts."  To make a raft, line up the asparagus and skewer them together in three places with either metal grilling skewers or soaked bamboo skewers. Coat with cooking spray, and season with salt and pepper.
Bake asparagus 12 minutes in the preheated oven, or 10 minutes on the grill, or until tender.
Brown the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat, and stir in soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a simmer and reduce the mixture to half.  Pour over the baked asparagus to serve.
