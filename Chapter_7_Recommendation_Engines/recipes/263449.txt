Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds smoked ham, cubed
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup chopped celery, including some leaves
1/2 cup shredded hot pepper Cheddar cheese (optional)
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce, or more to taste
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup mayonnaise, divided, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine ham, onion, and celery in a food processor. Pulse on and off until very finely ground, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture into a large bowl. Add Cheddar cheese and mustard. Drizzle in sriracha sauce, sprinkle cayenne pepper on top, and add Worcestershire sauce. Finish off with 2/3 cup mayonnaise and season with salt.
Mix together thoroughly with a spatula until smooth and spreadable. Taste; add remaining mayonnaise if too dry and crumbly. Cover the top with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator until flavors meld, at least 2 hours. Transfer ham spread to a serving bowl.
