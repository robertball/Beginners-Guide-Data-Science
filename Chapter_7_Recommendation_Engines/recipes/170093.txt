Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped carrot
2 habanero peppers, chopped
2 jalapeno peppers, chopped
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup fresh oregano leaves
1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar

Directions:
Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and carrots. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent and the carrot has softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a blender, and add the habanero peppers, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, oregano, parsley, salt, pepper, and vinegar. Blend until smooth and pour back into the saucepan.
Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside until cool; pour into a bottle and refrigerate.
