Ingredients:
2-6 pork chops (I use boneless pork loin chops)
1 box Uncle Ben's Original Wild & Long Grain Rice (not the quick-cooking)
1 3/4 cups water
1 (8 ounce) can canned mushrooms
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream
of mushroom soup
salt and pepper to taste
*If making 5-6 pork chops I would add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and an additional 1/2 cup of water.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a skillet, heat a small amount of oil (about 1 TBSP or less for fewer chops) over medium until oil is hot. Season the chops with salt and pepper and cook in oil just until the outsides are a little brown (few minutes per side).
Spray a large 9x13 inch casserole dish with nonstick spray. Sprinkle the box of rice evenly in bottom of dish.
Add water and mushrooms. Sprinkle with the enclosed seasoning packet from the box of rice. Arrange the chops on top and spoon cream of mushroom soup over chops and rice. Cover casserole with aluminum foil and seal tightly. Bake for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours or until rice and chops are tender. Check with meat thermometer (pork chops will be 180 degrees when done).
