Ingredients:
1 medium head of cabbage
1/4 tsp. salt
water to boil cabbage
1 1/2 lbs. lean ground beef (90/10)
1 1/2 lbs. ground pork
1 & 1/2 c. cooked white rice
1/4 c. finely chopped onion
2 Tbsp. chopped fresh parsley
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
28 oz. tomato sauce
12 oz. reserved cabbage water
1/4 cup white vinegar

Directions:
Using a paring knife, remove the core of the cabbage.
In a large stock pot, place the cabbage in enough water to cover it.
Add 1/4 tsp. of salt to the water and cabbage.
Bring water to a boil.
Turn cabbage every 2-3 minutes and remove leaves that separate from cabbage and place in a strainer to cool. Boil for approximately 15 minutes or until all the leaves have cooked.
Reserve 12 oz. of cabbage water.
Trim thick center vein off of bottom of each cabbage leaf.
In a large bowl mix together, ground beef, ground pork, rice, chopped onion, fresh parsley, egg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
Mix thoroughly.
Lightly pack a small amount of meat mixture and place in the center of the cabbage leaf.
Fold sides over the filling and start at the stem and roll the cabbage up until the meat is encased.
Repeat with remaining leaves and filling.
Take leftover leaves, cut them up and place into the bottom of a roasting pan.
Layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over top.
In a separate bowl, mix 28 oz. tomato sauce, 12 oz. reserved cabbage water, 1/4 cup white vinegar, and 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. of white sugar.
Pour sauce mixture over stuffed cabbage rolls.
Cover roasting pan with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 2 & 1/2 hours.  Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour.

Description: 
Halupki, also known as stuffed cabbage on the Russian/Ukranian side of my family, is a dish made of rice, beef & pork encased in cabbage drizzled with a thin, sweet tomato sauce. My Grandma Eugenia is 98 and she taught me how to make this comfort food classic. Every family has their own twist on this traditional dish- I hope you enjoy these with mashed potoates just as we always do in my family!
