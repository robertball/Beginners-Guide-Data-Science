Ingredients:
3 gallons water
2 large onions, quartered
10 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half
2 lemons, quartered
2 oranges, quartered
5 stalks celery, quartered
4 tablespoons black pepper
4 tablespoons seasoned salt
6 fresh jalapeno peppers (optional)
2 fresh live lobsters

Directions:
Pour the water into a large pot and add the onions, garlic, lemons, oranges, celery, black pepper, seasoned salt and jalapeno peppers. Bring to a full rolling boil and boil for 20 minutes.
Add the lobsters and place a lid over the pot. Boil for 15 minutes (depending on the size of your lobsters). Remove the lobsters from the pot, and place in a colander under cool running water to stop the cooking. Serve.

Description: 
I learned this style of cooking from my mother-in-law. This recipe will work with crawfish or shrimp. You can add as many lobsters as you want, but cook no more than two at a time.
