Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1/3 cup of butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Sift dry ingredient into a medium bowl.  Cut in the butter until the dough resembles coarse crumbs.
Mix in the milk.  Stir quickly with a fork, just until the dough follows the fork around the bowl.
Remove the dough from the bowl and put onto a lightly floured surface.  (Dough should be soft.) Knead gently 10-12 strokes. Roll or pat dough to about a 1/2 inch thick.
Cut out biscuits and place on an ungreased baking sheet or a pizza stone (the pizza stone helps keep the bottoms of the biscuits from burning).
Place the biscuits in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes or until biscuits are golden.
