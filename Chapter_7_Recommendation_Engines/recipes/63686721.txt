Ingredients:
1 small onion finely chopped
1 Tbsp butter
10 ounces Doritos nacho flavored tortilla chips
2 1/2 cups chopped, cooked chicken
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1/3 cup milk
2 Tbsp sour cream
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.
Lightly grease a 13x9-inch baking dish and spread the tortilla chips over the bottom - press down and into place if needed.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté 6 to 7 minutes, or until tender.
In a separate bowl, stir together the milk, sour cream, condensed soups, tomatoes, chiles, and seasonings.  Add the chopped cooked chicken, and onions.  Stir to combine.
Top the chips with the soup mixture and cheddar cheese.
Bake for 55 minutes to 1 hour, or until bubbly. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
