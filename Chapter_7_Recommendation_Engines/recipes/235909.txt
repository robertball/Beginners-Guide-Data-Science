Ingredients:
Creamed Spinach:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 (6 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon minced shallots
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/8 teaspoon salt
Pinch of black pepper
BÃ©arnaise Sauce:
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons minced shallots
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup melted butter
18 RITZ Crackers
3 ounces thinly sliced, cooked beef tenderloin, but into bite-sized pieces

Directions:
Heat olive oil in saute pan over medium heat. Add spinach and cover for 1 minute to steam. Uncover and stir spinach until it is wilted. Drain spinach, dry between paper towels, and chop. Melt butter in the same pan over medium heat. Add shallots and saute for a minute. Add heavy cream and nutmeg; stir to combine. Add chopped spinach and combine thoroughly. Remove from heat when spinach is creamy. Add salt and pepper. Set aside.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a separate saute pan; add shallots and white wine vinegar. Cook until all liquid has evaporated, about a minute. Remove from the pan; set aside to cool.
Add egg yolk and lemon juice to blender; slowly blend in half cup of melted butter until mixture is smooth and creamy. Pour into shallots mixture. Stir in chopped fresh tarragon.
To assemble bites, place about 1-1/2 teaspoons creamed spinach on top of a RITZ Cracker. Place a slice of steak on top of the creamed spinach, then drizzle with about 1-1/2 teaspoon bearnaise sauce over the steak.
