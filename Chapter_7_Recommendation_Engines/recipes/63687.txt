https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound flank steak
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fat-free chicken broth
1 medium onion, cut into 1/4-inch thick rings

Directions:
In a large non-aluminum baking dish, combine the oil, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and garlic. Add the steak; turn to coat. Cover; refrigerate for 30 minutes or overnight, turning once.
Coat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Place over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the steak with the pepper and salt. Brown for 2 minutes per side. Add 1/2 cup of the broth; cook, turning once, for 5 to 6 minutes per side (for medium-rare). Remove the steak from the skillet; cover the steak loosely to keep it warm. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion slices to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Add the remaining broth as needed to prevent the onions from sticking.
Thinly slice the steak across the grain; serve with the onions.
