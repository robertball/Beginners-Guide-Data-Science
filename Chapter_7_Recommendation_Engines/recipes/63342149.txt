Image:

Ingredients:
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar (you can cut back on this a little and still have success)
2 Tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 pinch of salt
2 Tablespoons vegetable oil or olive oil
3 Tablespoons water

Directions:
Combine the dry ingredients in a large, microwave-safe mug and mix thoroughly. Add the oil and water, then mix just until combined. Cook in the microwave for approximately 1 minute & 40 seconds (in my high-powered microwave, it only takes 1 minute & 10 seconds). Carefully remove the mug from the microwave. Let the brownie cool a few minutes before eating it, because it will be VERY hot.

By now, many of you have heard of the Cake In A Mug and have probably tried it at one time or another. I'm not very fond of it, because it's too eggy, even if you lightly beat the egg and only use part of it. Because of that, I was skeptical when I first saw this recipe posted by a friend...until I tried it. In the past five days, I have made this twice and my kids have made it at least three times. It's PHENOMENAL!
