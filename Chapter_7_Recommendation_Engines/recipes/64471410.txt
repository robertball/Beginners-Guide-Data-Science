Ingredients:
Fluffy Bite Base:
2 16 oz cans refrigerated biscuits
1/2 cup granulated white sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 cup dried cranberries, cherries, or exciting red fruit of choice!
1/2 cup melted butter
Fluffy Bite Icing:
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2-3 drops of blue food coloring
Optional:
A super rad drawing of Dinomite
1 Toothpick

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 350Â°F and lightly grease a tube or bundt cake pan. Take your sugar and cinnamon, put 'em in a large bowl, mix, mix, mix-it-up.
2. Slam those bisbutts. Cut them into 4 pieces each and give 'em a tumble in your cinnabowl mix. Add to pan, sprinkling in dried fruit as desired.
3. Pour melted butter over top of the biscuit bits, babe.
4. Bake 35 minutes until done. TIP: Deep bundt pans will take longer than a shallow and wide tube pan. You can test doneness with a knife or short sword. It's done when no longer doughy on the inside or once you're really hungry.
5. Let cool in pan as you prepare icing. Mix the powdered sugar, lemon juice, and blue food coloring.
6. Invert cake (that means flippin', ya turkey) on plate and drizzle sweet sweet icing on top.
7. Decorate with a beautiful drawing of Dinomite and impress all your rad GISHWHES friends!
8. Eat with yo haaaands.
