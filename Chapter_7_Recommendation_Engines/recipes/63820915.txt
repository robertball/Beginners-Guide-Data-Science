Reserve 1 cup of cake mix from the package.  In a bowl, combine remaining cake mix, 1 egg and melted margarine.  Press mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9x13 inch pan to form a crust.
Mix together the pumpkin, 3 eggs, sugar, spices, evaporated milk & vanilla until blended.  Pour over the crust.  Combine the brown sugar & reserved 1 cup cake mix,  then cut in the margarine until mixture is crumbly, then gently stir in pecans.  Sprinkle over the filling.
