Ingredients:
Soft butter, for greasing the pan
Flour, for dusting the buttered pan
4 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
8 ounces melted butter
1 1/4 cups cocoa
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan.
Beat the eggs until fluffy and light yellow. Add both sugars. Add remaining ingredients, and mix to combine.
Pour the batter into a greased and floured 8-inch square pan and bake for 45 minutes. Check for doneness with the tried-and-true toothpick method: a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan should come out clean. Allow to cool.
Feed to Dinomite as needed. Normalcy is overrated.
