1/2 cup green onions, sliced(stem as well)

In a gallon size freezer bag or shallow baking dish, place the chicken breast. Set aside.
In a medium size bowl, combine vinegrette, onions, garlic powder and salt. Pour marinade over chicken and gently coat well. Cover chicken and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours or over night.
When ready to cook, Preheat grill. Lightly coat grill with cooking oil. Remove chicken from marinade and discard leftover marinade.
Place chicken on hot grill and cook for at least 6-9 minutes on each side depending on how hot your grill is or until internal temp is 155-160 degrees, or until juices run clear.
Remove and serve immediately. Best served with a nice side, or over a salad.

Description: 
I love the flavor of this salad dressing and it made a wonderful addition to my list of marinades. While the flavors are soo nice, it's not salty nor over powering in flavors that the chicken gets lost. The best way I love to eat this is grilled and cubed over a salad.
