Ingredients:
•  1 cup water
•  2 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
•  6 whole cloves
•  1 teaspoon anise seed
•  2 oz of ginger
•  1 cup of rice
•  1 cup of water
•  4 cups of coconut/evaporated milk (unsweetened)
•  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
•  3/4 teaspoon salt
•  3 of the 1 1/2 oz small box of raisins
•  1 1/2 cups white sugar
•  2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place 1 cup of rice in a bowl and add 1 cup of water.  Let it soak for 2 hours.  (Optional:  To wash rice twice before letting it soak in water for 2 hours.)
Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat.  Add the cinnamon sticks, cloves, anise seeds and ginger.  Cover, and set aside to steep for 15 minutes.  Strain the spice tea through a fine mesh sieve to remove the spices.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat combine the set aside rice with water, 4 cups of coconut/evaporated milk, and spice tea.  Stir mixture until evenly mixed.  Stir occasionally to ensure rice does not stick to sides or bottom of pan.  (Note:  Some will stick to the bottom of the pan; this is okay and is to be expected.)
Once half of the milk has evaporated, turn down heat to medium-low.  Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 3 small boxes of raisins, and 1 ½ cups of sugar.  Stir until evenly mixed.
Once most of the milk has evaporated, pour mixture into a 9” pie pan.
Sprinkle lightly ground cinnamon on rice pudding.
Allow to cool at room temperature before refrigerating.
Serve cold or at room temperature.
Can be cut into pie slices or brownie squares.
