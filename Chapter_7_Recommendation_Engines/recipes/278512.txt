Description: 
Risotto in the Instant Pot® has been a life-changer for me! Risotto used to be something that I'd make on special occasions, due to the time it took to make. No more standing at the stove, stirring and adding broth one ladle at a time for 40 minutes! Use that extra time to make something delicious to accompany this simple risotto. Our favorite is pan-seared scallops with a lemon-garlic sauce.
