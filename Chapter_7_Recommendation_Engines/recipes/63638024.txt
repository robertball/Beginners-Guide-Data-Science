Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups, or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Stir in eggs until well mixed. Add vegetable oil, stir to combine. Whisk sour cream, milk, and lemon zest into butter mixture until smooth.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
Stir half the flour mixture into the butter mixture until combined. Add remaining half of flour mixture and blueberries into the batter, folding together until just combined.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Place muffin cups on center rack of the preheated oven and bake until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
