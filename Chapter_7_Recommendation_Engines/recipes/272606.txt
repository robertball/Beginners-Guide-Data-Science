Ingredients:
Steak:
4 pounds porterhouse steak
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
1 pinch kosher salt, or to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
Chimichurri Sauce:
1 shallot, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 pinch kosher salt, or more to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, or more to taste
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Bring steak to room temperature 30 minutes prior to grilling. Preheat an indoor grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Brush steak with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until slightly charred, firm, and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 11 minutes per side. Hold steak with tongs to sear edges. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steak to a cutting board; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pulse shallot, garlic, parsley, oregano, red pepper flakes, kosher salt and pepper together in a food processor until roughly chopped. Add red wine vinegar, olive oil, and water; pulse to a textured sauce. Transfer to a serving bowl.
Slice steak and serve with prepared chimichurri sauce.
