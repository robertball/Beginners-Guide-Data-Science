Ingredients:
2 cups almond meal
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
6 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
2 tablespoons blackstrap molasses
2 tablespoons reduced-sugar maple syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon sea salt, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
Combine almond meal, coconut sugar, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, baking power, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; mix with a fork to break up any clumps.
Combine coconut oil, molasses, maple syrup, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; mix lightly with a fork just until blended.
Make a well in the center of the almond meal mixture and pour in coconut oil mixture. Fold with a baking spatula until dough is blended and gooey.
Scoop dough onto the prepared baking sheet using a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are firm to the touch, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle a little bit of sea salt over each cookie. Cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
