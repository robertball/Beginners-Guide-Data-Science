Ingredients:
2 cups bread crumbs
1/2 cup milk
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
3 egg
1 cup chopped yellow onion
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon ground cardamom
1 cup butter, divided
6 cups sliced yellow onions
1/2 cup sugar
salt and pepper to taste
3 cups beef broth
2 cups heavy cream
3 tablespoons dry gravy maker mix
1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water

Directions:
In large mixing bowl, soak bread crumbs in milk for 5 minutes. Mix in meat, eggs, and chopped onions. Season with cardamom and salt and pepper to taste. Roll into 1 to 1 1/2 inch meatballs.
Saute meatballs in 1/4 cup butter for approximately 20 minutes.
In a separate skillet, saute sliced onions with 1/4 cup butter and sugar until caramelized, about 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Remove mixtures (the meatballs and the onions) from both pans, and place on separate plates. Deglaze both saute pans with the remaining 1/2 cup butter and beef broth, scraping up the browned bits. Cook over high heat for 1 minute.
Place the contents of both saute pans into one large pot, and stir in the cream and onions. Season with gravy maker seasoning, monosodium glutamate, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a simmer. Make a slurry with cornstarch and water; whisk the slurry into the cream sauce.  Add meatballs, and simmer approximately 20 to 30 minutes.
