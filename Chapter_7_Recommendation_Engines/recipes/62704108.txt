Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Line a 9 inch square baking pan with aluminum foil.  Spray the foil with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, stir together the oats, flour, cereal, and cinnamon.  Add the egg, applesauce, honey, brown sugar, and oil.  Mix well.  Stir in the sunflower seeds, nuts, and dried fruit.  Spread mixture evenly in the prepared pan.
