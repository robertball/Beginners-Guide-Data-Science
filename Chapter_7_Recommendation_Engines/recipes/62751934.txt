Ingredients:
1 loaf whole wheat bread
1/2 loaf white bread
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup onion chopped fine
1 cup celery chopped fine
1/2 cup parsley chopped fine
2 eggs
3 cups of black walnuts
1 tbsp ground sage
1 3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp thyme
2 1/2 cups milk (could use soy milk)

Directions:
Cube and brown half of the bread in a skillet in vegetable oil (or regular olive oil). Saute onion and celery in another fry pan. Mix all ingredients except for milk. Add enough milk to make recipe moist but not enough to allow milk to stand in the bottom of the bowl. Grease a large bread loaf pan or two regular loaf pans. Bake 50 minutes at 350 degrees. Cut around edge to loosen. Turn out on platter. Decorate with parsley and cranberry sauce.

Description: 
A holiday loaf that is dry in texture and darkly nutty, much like the people you are eating the loaf with. Just kidding.
