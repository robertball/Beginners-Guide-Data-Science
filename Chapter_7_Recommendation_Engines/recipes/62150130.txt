Chocolate Chip Cream Cheese Coffee Cake Recipe

https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/4 lb butter (1 cube)
8 oz cream cheese
1 1/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 cup of milk
1/2 to 1 full bag chocolate chips -any kind you like!
Topping:
1/3 cup of sugar
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup of chopped pecans

Directions:
Mix together first 4 ingredients in a large bowl until creamy.  Add the ingredients, continually mixing.  Add in the flour last and in small increments to aid in smooth mixing.  Add the rest of the ingredients and finally the milk last.  Batter should be creamy bot not drippy.  Stir in chocolate chips using a large spoon.
Spoon or pour mixture into greased pan(s).  If using a bundt pan, fill half full.  You will need to slice off the excess to serve so don't bother filling it overfull. If using 2 bread pans, pour mixture half into each pan.
Mix topping and sprinkle over all.  Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  Cakes will rise and become golden brown. Test by inserting a knife of toothpick into the center.  When done, the knife will come out almost dry.
Note: I like to sprinkle some of the topping in the greased bread pans or bundt pan.  It makes a sweet crusting around the sides and bottom.

This is a great recipe for a delicious coffee cake I found from Morning Coffee and Afternoon Tea.  It was love at first taste!  I give these loaves away around Thanksgiving and Christmas time. Excellent with a nice big cup of coffee or hot chocolate!
