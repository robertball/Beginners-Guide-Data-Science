Increase heat to medium-high; boil, without stirring, for about 15 minutes or until caramel colored. Quickly pour over bottom and sides of 12 six-ounce custard cups (if syrup hardens, soften over low heat).
PLACE evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, cream cheese, butter, Choco Bake, eggs and vanilla extract in blender container; cover. Blend well. Pour mixture into prepared custard cups. Arrange in one or two large pans; fill pans with hot water to 1-inch depth, creating a waterbath.
