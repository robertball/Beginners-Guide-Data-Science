2 U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish fillets
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced artichoke hearts
1 red bell pepper, cut into julienne strips

Directions:
Cut catfish fillets in half crosswise and slice into thin strips.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add catfish strips and saute for 1 minute. Stir in artichokes, bell pepper, carrot and zucchini and saute until vegetables are tender and fish flakes easily when tested with a fork. Stir in cream or milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep sauce warm while preparing the pasta.
Cook pasta according to the package directions. Drain and place in a serving bowl. Pour cream mixture over the pasta, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and toss well. Sprinkle with nutmeg and serve immediately.
