Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon sesame oil, or as needed
canola oil, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cubed
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
2 cups broccoli florets
1/4 cup chopped cashews
1 (10 ounce) package frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
1/2 cup unsweetened soy milk
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup reduced-fat coconut milk
1 teaspoon tahini

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir eggs and soy sauce together in a bowl. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat; pour in egg mixture and cook until firm, 3 to 5 minutes. Slide eggs onto work surface and cut into bite-size cubes.
Heat sesame oil and canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add tofu; cook until golden brown on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer tofu to a plate. Add mushrooms and broccoli to skillet; cook until broccoli is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Place cashews in a baking dish; cook in preheated oven, tossing occasionally to avoid burning, until toasted, 8 to 12 minutes.
Place edamame in a microwave-safe bowl, cover and cook in the microwave until hot, 1 to 2 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles, bring back to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Combine soy milk, peanut butter, coconut milk, and tahini together in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until peanut butter and tahini have dissolved, 2 to 4 minutes. Add egg, tofu, mushroom and broccoli mixture, edamame, and egg noodles; toss to combine. Top with toasted cashews to serve.
