Ingredients:
5 Plain Bagels
1 cup Sausage Gravy-warmed
1 Pkg Precooked Bacon
1 8 ounce Bag of Mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cut bagels in half and lay cut side up on a cookie sheet. Cut the bacon into about 1/4 inch pieces and sprinkle on bagels. Pour or spoon gravy in a circle around the bagel to cover the top surface(not too much or it will be messy). I used The Tennessee Pide Frozen pouch of sausage gravy. Sprinkle with cheese and bake about 10 minutes at 350 or untill cheese is melted.
