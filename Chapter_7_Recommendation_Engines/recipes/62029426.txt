Ingredients:
1-1/2 lb. salmon fillet
1 Tbsp.	Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp. mayonnaise
2 Tbsp. honey
1-1/3 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger root
1/4 c up Japanese panko bread crumbs
2 Tbsp. dried parsley
2 Tbsp. pecans, finely crushed
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â°F.
Blend mustard, mayo, honey and freshly grated ginger in small bowl; set aside.  Mix panko bread crumbs, finely crushed pecans (I used a coffee grinder that I use specifically for nuts and herbs/spices) and dried parsley in another small bowl; set aside.
Season salmon fillet with salt and pepper.  Brush salmon with mustard-mayo-honey-ginger mixture lightly on the skin side of the salmon fillet, and more liberally on the flesh side.  Place skin-side down on non-stick or spray-coated baking sheet.  Pat bread crumb mixture onto top surface of salmon.
Bake for 10-15 minutes per inch of thickness, measured at thickest part, or until salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork.
