Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
4 pounds cubed beef stew meat
2 teaspoons sage
10 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 carrots, diced
1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 small onion, chopped
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cube beef bouillon
salt to taste
water to cover
1 tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed
1/4 cup warm water

Directions:
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef to the oil and season with the sage; cook the beef until browned on all sides; drain.
Place beef, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, onion, celery seed, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and beef bouillon in a slow cooker; season with salt. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover. Set slow cooker to HIGH and cover. Cook for 4 to 5 hours, stirring occasionally.
Whisk together the cornstarch and warm water in a small bowl until smooth; stir through the stew. Allow the stew to cook until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a stick-to-the-ribs stew I learned as a child from my Gram's. If you like a thicker stew, you can use more cornstarch.
