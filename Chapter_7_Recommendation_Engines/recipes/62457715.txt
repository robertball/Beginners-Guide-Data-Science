Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup sweetened coconut flakes
12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugars until fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla and beat well.  In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.  Add flour mixture to butter mixture and beat until well combined.  Stir in oats, coconut, and chocolate chips.
Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets (or line sheets with parchment paper for easier clean-up) and bake for 10-12 minutes.  Cool for a minute on baking sheet then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container.
Makes about 4 dozen cookies.
