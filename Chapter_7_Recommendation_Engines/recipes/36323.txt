Ingredients:
1 package McCormick® Grill Mates® Spicy Caribbean Marinade
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 red onions, cut into 3/4-inch thick slices (do not separate into rings)
2 tablespoons olive oil
kosher salt and McCormick® Ground Black Pepper
Salsa:
1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped (about 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup chopped red onion
1/4 cup pineapple juice
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon McCormick® Crushed Red Pepper
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1/8 teaspoon McCormick® Black Pepper, Ground

Directions:
Combine marinade mix with water, oil and vinegar in glass dish or large self-closing plastic bag.  Add chicken, turning to coat all sides.  Marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes, or longer for extra flavor.
Preheat grill or grill pan to medium.  Cook chicken 4-5 minutes per side or until done, basting with remaining marinade halfway through cooking, if desired.  Discard any leftover marinade.
Rub or brush red onion slices with olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Grill over medium heat 3-4 minutes per side.
In a medium bowl, combine salsa ingredients.  Serve chicken atop grilled red onion slices; top with salsa.
