Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced

1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups ketchup
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Cut boneless pork shoulder crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Partially freezing it will make slicing easier.
In the slow cooker, combine sliced pork, onion, garlic, brown sugar, dry mustard, salt, pepper, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce; mix well, and cover. Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 hours or until the meat is tender.
OR : In a Dutch oven or large saucepan, combine pork, onion, garlic, brown sugar, dry mustard, salt, pepper, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce; mix well.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours or until pork is tender.
