Ingredients:
2/3 cup butter
1 heaping cup granulated sugar (don't use Splenda)
2 beaten eggs
1 t. baking soda
1 1/4 t. cream of tarter
1/4 cup milk
1 t. vanilla
1 pinch salt (optional)
4 cups flour
1 cup flour to roll dough

Directions:
Cream soft, not melted, butter and sugar until fluffy.  Add the beaten eggs to the mixture and stir until creamy.  Dissolve the soda and cream of tarter in the milk and add to the butter mixture.  Add the vanilla and beat until combined.  Add the pinch of salt with the flour and stir doughy.
Take a chunk of the dough, roll out on a floured surface and use your choice of cookie cutters, preferably larger ones.  Bake on nonstick cookie sheet for apprx. 12 minutes.  Top with your favorite cream cheese or basic cookie frosting.  I find it's best with almond extract and coconut on top.  Enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe I revised from my grandma's Christmas Angel roll-out cookies.  They are sort of cakey, but this can be reduced by omitting half of the cream of tarter, though I prefer them thick and soft.
