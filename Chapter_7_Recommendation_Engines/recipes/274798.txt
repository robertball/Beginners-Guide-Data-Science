Description: 
My grandmother first served this wonderful dish with tomatoes fresh from her garden when I was a child. It's great on a hot day for a crisp side dish. Often times I use the leftover marinade when the first batch is gone and add it to the next batch. It's tangy taste is much loved, even by my non veggie-loving kids!
