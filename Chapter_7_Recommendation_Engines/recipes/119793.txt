Description: 
A popular side dish for our Independence Day menu, this hearty pasta salad is practically a meal in itself. It fit into our theme with the bright red cherry tomatoes, white noodles and cauliflower plus blue cheese. The creamy dressing is pleasantly zesty. -Laurie Neverman, Green Bay, Wisconsin
