Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breast cutlets
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 TB finely chopped pickled jalapeno chiles
1/2 cup pecans, finely ground
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup EVOO
4 kaiser rolls, split
1 peach, thinly sliced
8 green-leaf lettuce leaves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the chicken and buttermilk.  In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise and pickled jalapenos.
In a shallow bowl, combine the pecans and bread crumbs.  Working with one piece at a time, remove the chicken cutlets from the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off, and coat with the pecan mixture.
In a large skillet, heat the EVOO over medium heat.  Add the cutlets and cook, turning once, until golden-brown, about 2 minutes on each side.  Drain on paper towels.
Spread the jalapeno mayo on the cut sides of each kaiser roll.  Assemble sandwiches with the chicken, peach and lettuce.
