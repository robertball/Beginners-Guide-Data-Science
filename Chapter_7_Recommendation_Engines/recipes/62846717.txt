Ingredients:
4 cups fresh strawberries
3 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cups vegetable oil
3/4 applesauce
4 eggs, beaten
1 1/4 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter and flour two 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.
Slice strawberries, and place in medium-sized bowl.  Sprinkle lightly with sugar, and set aside while preparing bread mixture.
Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking soda in large bowl:  mix well.  Blend oil and eggs into strawberries.  Add strawberry mixture to flour mixture, blending until dry ingredients are just moistened.  Stir in pecans.  Divide batter into pans.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until tester inserted comes out clean.  Let cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes.  Turn loaves out, and cool completely.
