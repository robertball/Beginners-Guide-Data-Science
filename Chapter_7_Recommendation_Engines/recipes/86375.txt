Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2  pork chops
2  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2  green bell peppers, seeded and cut into strips
1  onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 sprig fresh rosemary

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops and chicken thighs in the skillet, and cook until browned on all sides, chicken juices run clear, and pork chops are done. Remove from skillet, and set aside.
Stir bell peppers into the skillet, cook until tender, and set aside. Stir in onion and garlic. Mix in rosemary, thyme, cloves, and bay leaves. Add rice to skillet, and water amount listed in rice package directions. Continue cooking 10 minutes.
Place pork chops, chicken, rice, peppers, and peas over the rice in the skillet. Continue cooking 10 minutes, or until rice is tender. Discard rosemary, thyme, and bay leaves. To serve, squeeze lemon juice over the meats and rice, sprinkle with diced jalapeno, and top with chili sauce.

Description: 
I learned this dish while in France - I use rice that comes prepackaged with the spices, but you can use plain rice and saffron to do the trick. I also sometimes throw shrimp in at the last minute.
