Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup old-fashioned oats
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups extra crunchy peanut butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
18 fun size bars chocolate-covered crispy peanut butter candy (such as Butterfinger®), crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Process flour, oats, baking soda, and salt in a food processor until blended.
Beat peanut butter, brown sugar, white sugar, shortening, and unsalted butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until well-blended. Add vanilla.
Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture; add crushed peanut butter candy and stir until just combined. Drop 1-inch spoonfuls of the dough, 2 inches apart, onto baking sheets.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.
