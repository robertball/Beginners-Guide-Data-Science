Ingredients:
6 Medium Russet potatoes (boiled, cooled, peeled and cubed)
1 heaping teaspoon cumin powder
1 heaping teaspoon coriander powder
1 heaping teaspoon cumin seeds
1 level teaspoon dried mango powder
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper (add more if you want spicier)
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon oil

Directions:
After preparing the potatoes, toss with all the spices EXCEPT the whole cumin seeds and oil.
On medium heat, heat oil in a nonstick pan.  When heated, fry the cumin seeds (it should only take a few seconds otherwise they burn fast), and add the potato mix to the oil.  Carefully stir, until the potatoes are coated with the oil and then lower heat and cook until potatoes are heated through.
