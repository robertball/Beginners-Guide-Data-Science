Ingredients:
1 (10 oz) pkg vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips (such as Nestle Toll House Allergen Free Simply Delicious Semi-Sweet Baking Chips)
1 (10 oz) pkg  vegan dark chocolate chips (such as Nestle Toll House Allergen Free Simply Delicious Dark Baking Chips)
1 tbs coconut oil
1 tsp peppermint extract
36 Ritz crackers

Directions:
Line cookie sheets with parchment paper
Combine semi-sweet chips, dark chocolate chips and coconut oil in large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute; stir.
Continue heating 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each time, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth.
Add peppermint extract.
Drop crackers into chocolate mixture, one at a time.
Using a spoon push cracker down into chocolate mixture until evenly coated. (If chocolate begins to thicken, reheat 20 seconds in microwave.)
Place on cookie sheets. Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, about 10 minutes. Store covered in refrigerator.
Note: For a non vegan cookie, try substituting peanut butter and milk chocolate chips in place of dark chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips for a chocolate covered peanut butter cracker. Omit peppermint extract.
