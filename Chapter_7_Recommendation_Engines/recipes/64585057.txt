Ingredients:
1 cup of raw cashews
1-1/2 cups of non-dairy milk (plus a little more, if needed)
4 medium beets (red and yellow)
4 servings of dry pasta, about 2 cups cooked
1/2 cup diced chives
1/4 cup tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon oil
1 shallot

Directions:
Soak cashews in water for 2-3 hours. Drain.
In a blender, process the cashews and non-dairy milk, adding more milk as needed until a creamy, yet pourable consistency is achieved.
In a small bowl, stir together cashew cream, chives (reserve 1 tablespoon for garnishing), salt, nutritional yeast, and onion powder.
Cut off the ends of the beets and peel outside layer off with a potato peeler.
Continue to use the potato peeler (or you can use a mandolin) to create thin beet "petals." Set aside.
Slice the shallot into thin pieces.
Cook the pasta according to the package's instructions.
Pour 1 teaspoon of oil into a small skillet on medium heat. Add shallot slices and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside.
In a large bowl, toss together pasta, beets, shallots, and chive cashew cream sauce.
Serve garnished with chives.
