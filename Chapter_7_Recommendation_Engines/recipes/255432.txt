Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 teaspoon maple flavoring
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Transfer bacon to a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.
Combine confectioners' sugar and butter in a stand mixer; beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add maple flavoring. Mix in milk a little at a time until icing is spreading consistency. Fold in bacon.
