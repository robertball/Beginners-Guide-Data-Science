Ingredients:
1 cup barbecue sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 (16 ounce) cans Dr PepperÂ® soda
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
8 pork chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
In a bowl, stir together the barbecue sauce, brown sugar, soda, garlic, and pepper until the sugar has dissolved. Set the sauce aside.  Place the pork chops on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake the pork chops in the preheated oven until the juices start to run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C.) Transfer the pork chops to a baking dish big enough to lay the chops into the dish without overlapping. Pour the sauce over the chops, and cover the dish with foil.
Bake the chops until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
