Description: 
I'm one of those people who need chocolate on a regular basis. I looked high and low for a rich brownie recipe that called for cocoa instead of chocolate squares...and this is it. My family loves these brownies - they never last more than a day at our house. -Karen Trapp, North Weymouth, Massachusetts
