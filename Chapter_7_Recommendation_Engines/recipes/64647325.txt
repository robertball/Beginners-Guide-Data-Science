Ingredients:
18-ounce package of white Almond Bark
2 cups (or more, depending on your preferences) chocolate chips
24-ounce jar lightly salted peanuts

Directions:
1. Break up the almond bark into pieces and turn your crockpot to high.
2. Add the almond bark to the crockpot, stir occasionally until mostly melted, and then turn the crock pot to low.
3. Add in the chocolate chips until it gets to a nice, dark, chocolatey color
4. Pour in about 3/4 of the peanuts and give it a stir.
5. If the chocolate to peanut ratio is too high, add some more peanuts.
6. You can test this by dropping a spoonful of the chocolate/peanuts onto a wax paper or parchment lined counter top.
7. It should be thick and peanut-y (technical term!) and not spread out all over the place.
8. Add more peanuts or chocolate chips as needed to get the consistency you prefer.
9. Drop by spoonfuls (or use a melon baller, if you have one) on the parchment-lined baking sheet and allow to harden.
10.  This makes lots and lots of peanut clusters, so be sure to clear off some counter space before hand.
11. These should harden in about one hour, depending on how big you make them.
