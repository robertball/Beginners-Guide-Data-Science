Ingredients:
2 leeks
3 green onions
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Avocado Vinaigrette:
1 ripe avocado, pitted, flesh scooped from skin
3/4 cup light olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Discard green tops and the bottom 1/2 inch of the leeks. Cut leeks in half lengthwise.
Place leeks and green onions on a sheet pan. Drizzle with ghee. Add sea salt and pepper.
Roast in the preheated oven until browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
Prepare vinaigrette by blending avocado, 3/4 cup olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and pepper thoroughly in a food processor.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Crack eggs into opposite sides of the skillet and cook until whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove leeks and onions from oven and top with the sunny-side up eggs. Sprinkle almonds and red pepper flakes on top. Finish with a drizzle of the avocado vinaigrette.
