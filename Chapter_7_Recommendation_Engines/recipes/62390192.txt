Description: 
This quick and easy salad is so tasty as a replacement for other salads at picnics, pitchins, and barbecues. No mayo to spoil, and goes together in a snap. I've left out the tomato and it's still great. In winter, I make this with hamburgers to remind us summer is not far away. I use super-sweet, sweet yellow & white, or Summer Crisp corn. If you use fresh sweet corn, be sure to blanch it first and then give it a bath in ice water to keep it crispy. Tasty ! Easily doubled--this batch makes just enough for my husband and I.
