Ingredients:
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
2/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
2 teaspoons dried minced onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well (mixture will be moist.) Shape into a round loaf; place in a 5-qt. slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
In a small bowl, whisk the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon over the meat loaf. Cook 15 minutes longer or until heated through. Let stand for 10-15 minutes before cutting.
his was the first meat loaf I've ever made, and my husband and I absolutely loved it! I used Stove Top dressing mix for the seasoned bread crumbs and baked it at 325 for 90 minutes instead, and I also decreased the mustard by 1/2 and omitted the sugar. Best meat loaf I've ever had! Thanks!

Description: 
'When my husband and I were first married, he refused to eat meat loaf because he said it was bland and dry,' recalls Suzanne Codner of Starbuck, Minnesota. 'Then I prepared this version, and it became his favorite meal.'Modified from: Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meat Loaf
