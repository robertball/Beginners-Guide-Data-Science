https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
2 1/2 pounds lean ground pork
1 cup of water
3 onions, chopped
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 1/2 cups saltine crackers
2 teaspoons Bell's Seasoning
3/4 teaspoon ground cloves
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine beef, pork and water.  Cook over a low heat while crumbling the meat as fine as you can for a good blend until no pink remains.
In another pan, saute onions in butter or margarine until translucent.  If necessary, add a little water to keep from sticking.
Add onions and seasonings to meat mixture mixing well.  Form a well in the center.  You should see about a cup of liquid there.  If not, add some water.
Grind saltine crackers in a food processor (or place crackers in a plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin) to make at least 2 1/2 cups.
Stir enough crackers into the well to absorb the liquid.  It should be similar to meatloaf in texture, not too dry.
This can be done a day ahead and refrigerated.  Filling should be lukewarm before filling pie shells.
Fill your favorite pie shells, using the piecrust cooking time as your guide.  Bake at 375 until crust is golden brown, about an hour.
