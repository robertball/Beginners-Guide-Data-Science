Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed cream of mushroom soup, divided
4 (4 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup milk, divided
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
ground black pepper to taste
4 cups peeled and thinly sliced potatoes
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup French-fried onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking pan.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix 1 can cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, 3/4 cup milk, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl; fold in potatoes.
Spread half the potato mixture into the prepared baking pan; top with Cheddar cheese. Spoon 1/2 the ground beef over cheese layer. Top ground beef layer with remaining potato mixture; layer with remaining ground beef.
Mix remaining 1 can cream of mushroom soup with 1/4 cup milk; pour mixture over ground beef layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Sprinkle French-fried onions over casserole; return to oven for 5 more minutes.
