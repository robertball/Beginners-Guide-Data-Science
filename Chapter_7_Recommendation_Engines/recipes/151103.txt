Description: 
WARNING: EXTREMELY MEGA HOT!!! Not for the faint of heart. Lip and mouth numbing HOT!!! Make sure to use rubber gloves when handing and chopping the habanero chili peppers. This relish is very sweet but extremely hot. Remember too cool off mouth with eating bread or drinking milk. This will reduce the high acidic shock it puts upon your tastebuds.
