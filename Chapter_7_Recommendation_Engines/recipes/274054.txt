Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen French-cut green beans
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch curry powder, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon green curry paste
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 bunch green onions, chopped
3 cups cooked jasmine rice

Directions:
Remove green beans from freezer and set aside to thaw.
Heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large, deep skillet. Add chicken and brown until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with black pepper and curry powder. Stir in garlic and curry paste to 'wake up' the flavors. Pour in coconut milk, fish sauce, and brown sugar and stir to combine. Adjust seasoning to taste.
Stir thawed green beans and green onions into curry mixture. Cook until green beans are tender, making sure not to boil, about 5 minutes. Serve over cooked jasmine rice.
