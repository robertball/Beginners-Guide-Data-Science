Saucy Pineapple Fried Duck Recipe

Ingredients:
1 whole duck
2 tablespoons salt, or more to taste
2 lemongrass stalks
2 onions, sliced
4 cloves garlic
vegetable oil for deep-frying
1 3/4 cups cubed potatoes
1 (10 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved, or more to taste
1 (32 fluid ounce) bottle lemon-lime soda (such as SpriteÂ®)
1 (14 ounce) can evaporated milk

Directions:
Place duck on a work surface. Coat skin with salt and fill the cavity with lemon grass. Transfer duck to a pot and cover with water. Add onions and garlic; boil until meat is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Let duck cool, 15 to 20 minutes. Carve.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Deep-fry the duck meat until crispy and brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Fry the potatoes until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
Layer the duck, pineapple juice, soda, evaporated milk, potatoes, and pineapple chunks, in this particular order, in a large saucepan. Simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This is an all-time favorite dish in my husband's family. At every occasion it's there...from the first taste to the last, I love it. The more pineapple you add, the tastier the dish! It will taste slightly salty and sweet.
