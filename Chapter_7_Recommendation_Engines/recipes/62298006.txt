Ingredients:
1 lb penne rigate
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts (1 1/4 oz)
2 teaspoon chopped garlic
2 (8- to 10-oz) bags mixed salad greens with radicchio (often labeled “Italian” or “Mediterranean”; 16 to 20 cups)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano plus additional for serving

Directions:
Cook penne in boiling salted water in a 5- to 6-quart heavy pot (see Tips) until al dente or according to package directions, then drain in a colander.
Combine butter, oil, and pine nuts in cleaned and dried pot and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until nuts are pale golden, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Stir in greens and cook, stirring, until they wilt, about 3 minutes. Add penne, salt, and pepper and toss to coat. Stir in cheese and serve immediately with additional cheese on the side.
