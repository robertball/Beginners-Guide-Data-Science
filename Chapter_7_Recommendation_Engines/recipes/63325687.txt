Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. ground lamb
6 tbsp. grated onion
2 tbsp. extra足virgin olive oil
4 tbsp. dried ground aleppo pepper
or paprika
1 tbsp. kosher salt
2 tsp. ground cumin
2 tsp. dried oregano leaves
2 tsp. dried mint leaves, crumbled
with your fingers
1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
1. Combine lamb and onion in a large bowl; set aside. Heat oil in a 10" skillet over medium足high heat. Add aleppo pepper, salt, cumin, oregano, mint, and pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Pour
the spice mixture over the reserved lamb mixture and mix thoroughly with your hands.
2. Divide lamb mixture into 4 portions and roll each into a thin cylinder about 10" long and 1" thick. Slide a flat metal skewer (see page 100) into each cylinder and press the meat around the skewer. Transfer skewers to a parchment lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up.
3. Meanwhile, build a medium足hot fire in a charcoal grill or heat a gas grill to medium足high (alternatively, heat broiler and position rack 7" from heating element). Grill or broil the kebabs, turning once, until browned and nicely
charred on the outside and medium on the inside, about 4 minutes per side.

Description: 
Wide, flat metal skewers are ideal for grilling this style of ground-meat kebab. The spiced meat mixture can also be formed into patties if you don't have skewers.
