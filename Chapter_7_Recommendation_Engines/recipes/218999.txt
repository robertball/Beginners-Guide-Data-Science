1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce (such as Lee Kum KeeÂ®)

Directions:
Stir the vinegar and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely, 7 to 10 minutes; add the salt, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir the chili garlic sauce into the mixture. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
