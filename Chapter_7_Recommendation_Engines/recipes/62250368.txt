Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless beef roast
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon beef bouillon
1 bay leaf
1  teaspoon dried rosemary
1  teaspoon dried thyme
1  teaspoon garlic powder
8 red peppers
16 slices of Swiss Cheese
16 French Rolls
mayonnaise or creamy horseradish

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, bouillon, bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, and garlic powder. Pour mixture over roast, and add enough water to almost cover roast.  Cover, and cook on Low heat for 10 to 12 hours, or until meat is very tender. Add peppers in the last hour of cooking.
Remove meat from broth, reserving broth. Slice meat very thin (I prefer an electric knife), and distribute on rolls for sandwiches. Cover meat with swiss cheese, and broil on high for approximately 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted. Serve with mayonnaise or creamy horseradish.
