Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
2 cups mashed ripe bananas

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and cinnamon.  In another bowl, beat the eggs, oil and vanilla; add pineapple and bananas. Stir into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
'Our four kids like slices of this moist tropical-tasting banana bread for breakfast,' comments Mary Watkins of Chaska, Minnesota. 'I sometimes bake it in mini loaf pans, then freeze the loaves so we can enjoy a small portion at a time.'
