Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1  onion, chopped
4  chicken legs, rinsed and patted dry
4 cloves garlic, pressed
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
15 fluid ounces water
2  bay leaves
1 pinch ground cloves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Â½ (16 ounce) package uncooked orzo pasta

Directions:
Warm the oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Brown the chicken legs in the pot on all sides. Add the garlic; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Pour the tomato sauce and water over the chicken. Drop the bay leaves into the pot. Season with cloves, salt, and pepper. Lower the heat to medium-how; allow the mixture to simmer until the chicken meat is very tender and begins to pull off the bone, about 45 minutes.
Stir the orzo into the liquid in the pot and cook until the orzo is soft, another 15 to 25 minutes. Remove the bay leaves to serve.
