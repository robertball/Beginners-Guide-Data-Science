Ingredients:
2 ½ pounds skinless chicken thighs
⅓ cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 clove garlic, minced
½ teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon minced green onion (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Arrange chicken thighs in an 8x12-inch baking dish.
Combine apricot preserves, soy sauce, sherry, garlic, and ginger in a small bowl. Brush mixture over the thighs.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting chicken with the preserve mixture 3 to 4 times, until juices run clear, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thighs should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Sprinkle green onions over thighs.

Description: 
Original recipe for these apricot chicken thighs was for the microwave. I've adjusted it for a conventional oven but included directions for the microwave. So easy and tasty, yet low in calories!
