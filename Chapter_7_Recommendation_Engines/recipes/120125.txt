Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/4 cup buttermilk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
FROSTING:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add the eggs, vanilla, bananas and buttermilk. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to banana mixture. Fill 18 paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove to wire racks to cool completely. In a small mixing bowl, cream the butter, sugar and enough milk to achieve desired spreading consistency. Frost cupcakes.

Description: 
'This recipe was given to me by my mother, and I've since handed it down to my daughters,' says Wanda Thole of Leonard, Minnesota. 'The moist cupcakes are topped with frosting that comes together in no time. And if you'd like even more banana taste, stir some mashed banana into it.'
