Ingredients:
2 TBSP olive oil
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
3 large hothouse or heirloom tomatoes, diced (or about 2lbs. other tomato variety - Roma will have less liquid, and are great for sauces)
1 TBSP dried oregano
2 tsp. fresh or dried thyme
2 tsp. sugar
1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
cayenne pepper, to taste (optional)
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil and saute garlic until golden and fragrant. Add the tomatoes, oregano, thyme, sugar, and half of the fresh basil. Adjust heat to simmer, and let cook uncovered for about 30 minutes, or until reduced by about half. Stir in the rest of the basil, and season to taste with salt, pepper, and cayenne.
Remove from heat and let cool. Transfer to a jar or other airtight container and store in the fridge for up to a couple of weeks, or freeze.

Description: 
This is beyond easy to make, and is great to have on hand - store it in the fridge, or freeze it for later use. Perfect for pizzas, but just as great for pasta or casseroles. Not overly fancy on its own, but easy to spruce up with extra herbs or spices... this is my new go-to tomato sauce!
