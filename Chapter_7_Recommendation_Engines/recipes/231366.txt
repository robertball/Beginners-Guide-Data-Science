Ingredients:
2 slices bread
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 ½ teaspoons dried basil
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bread into a food processor and blend until crumbled. Transfer bread crumbs to a shallow bowl. Add 1 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic; stir to combine.
Press chicken breast halves into bread crumb mixture until coated; arrange on a large baking dish. Drizzle chicken with vegetable oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
