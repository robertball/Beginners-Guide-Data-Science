Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup cold butter or margarine
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
Red colored sugar
Cherry, raspberry or strawberry jam

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients; cut in butter until crumbly.  Stir in buttermilk just until moistened.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead 10-12 times.  Roll to 2/3-in. thickness; cut with a 3-1/2-in. heart-shaped cookie cutter.  Place on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with sugar if desired.  Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove to wire rack.  Split scones in half.  Spread bottom halves with jam; replace the tops.  Serve warm.
