Ingredients:
10 ounces chocolate chips (60% cacao)
1 (8 ounce) package English toffee bits
3/4 cup salted peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Line an 18-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil, making sure to cover the edges and corners.
Fill the bottom pot of a double boiler 1/4 full with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Melt chocolate in the double boiler, stirring constantly until fully melted, about 5 minutes.
Pour melted chocolate onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a spatula to spread in a thin layer. Sprinkle toffee bits and peanuts evenly on the chocolate.
Freeze until solid, about 1 hour. Break into small pieces by hand.
