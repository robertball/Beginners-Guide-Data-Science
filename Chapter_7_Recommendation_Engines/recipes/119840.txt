1 medium green pepper, chopped

1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
Pinch ground cinnamon

Line unpricked pastry shell with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 450 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
In a skillet, saute the onion, green pepper, tomatoes, zucchini and mushrooms in butter. Add the curry powder, salt, pepper and cinnamon; mix well. Spoon into crust.
In a bowl, beat eggs. Add the milk and cheese; mix well. Carefully pour over vegetables. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
