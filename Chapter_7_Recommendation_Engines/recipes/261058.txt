Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups white sugar
3/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)
3 1/2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch cake pans.
Beat sugar and 3/4 cup plus 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Add flour; mix until incorporated.
Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add to the flour mixture and mix well. Add milk and baking powder; stir. Mix in lemon juice.
Pour batter into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I like recipes that meet 3 main requirements: 1) no waiting time for butter to thaw and quick to whip up using oil, 2) doesn't require electric mixer and a hand whisk will do, and 3) would be great if it didn't need fancy ingredients as well. 

My schoolmate Najla, a self-employed baker in Calicut, who has turned out hundreds of cakes by now, graciously shared with me this easy recipe. Please adjust the baking time as per your pan size.
