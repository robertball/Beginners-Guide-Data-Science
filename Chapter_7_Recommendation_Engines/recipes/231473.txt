Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise (such as Follow Your Heart® Veganaise®)
2 tablespoons water
1/4 cup bread crumbs, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) package tofu, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the inside of a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.
Stir mayonnaise and water together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl.
Dip tofu slices in the mayonnaise mixture; press tofu into the bread crumbs until fully coated. Place coated tofu in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until tofu is fully cooked and breading is browned, about 45 minutes.

Easy, delicious breaded tofu. A vegan main dish served with brown rice. It's delicious! I use sprouted tofu, it's better for the digestion!
