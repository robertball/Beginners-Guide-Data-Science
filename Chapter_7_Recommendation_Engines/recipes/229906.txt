Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained and mashed
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 ounces caramel topping
2 cups marshmallows, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix sweet potatoes, pineapple, butter, brown sugar, salt, egg, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Pour half the sweet potato mixture into a 9x9-inch casserole dish. Pour caramel sauce over sweet potatoes; top with 1 cup marshmallows. Spread the remaining sweet potato mixture over marshmallow layer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Add the remaining 1 cup marshmallows and bake until marshmallows are golden brown, about 10 more minutes.

Description: 
I took my mom's childhood candied yam recipe and added a layer of caramel. It is now a must at every Thanksgiving and Christmas and is often requested with much anticipation by anyone who has had it. One recipe will serve 6, but barely. I promise there won't be leftovers. If you're going to feed 6 or more, I suggest doubling the recipe in a 9x13-inch pan.
