Ingredients:
300 grams chicken tenders
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup hazelnut meal (ground hazelnuts)
1/2 cup gluten free bread crumbs
2 TBSP grated parmigiano reggiano
2 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground pepper
2 TBSP fresh parsley, chopped
1 egg

Directions:
Soak the chicken tenders in the buttermilk in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
In a large (approx. one gallon) plastic storage bag add the hazelnut meal, bread crumbs, cheese, paprika, pepper and parsley.
Preheat oven to 220°C.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place the beaten egg in a bowl add two tablespoons of the buttermilk, mix well.
Take the chicken from the buttermilk and put it in the egg mixture.  Coat well.
Add the chicken to the hazelnut/bread crumb mixture and close tightly.
Shake well until all the chicken is coated well.  Press on the chicken from the outside of the bag to ensure the coating sticks to the chicken.
Place the pieces of chicken onto the baking sheet and bake for approximately 8 minutes.  Turn the chicken over once and bake until golden brown and juices run clear.  The internal temperature of the chicken should be at least 74°C.

Description: 
This light and tender coating for chicken fingers was suggested to me by semigourmet on the Buzz.  It is a healthy, gluten free version of those fast food chicken tenders.  The resting time for the chicken in the buttermilk helps give it a smooth flavour and texture too.  Enjoy with your favourite dipping sauce!
