Ingredients:
1 pound beef liver, cut into 1/4 inch slices
1/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup tarragon vinegar
1 lemon, cut into thin slices
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Dredge liver slices in flour, shaking off excess, and season with salt and pepper.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Cook liver for 5 minutes per side, reducing heat if necessary. Transfer to a heated serving dish, and keep warm.
In the same skillet, increase heat to medium high and add tarragon vinegar, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. If necessary, add a small amount of water to increase sauce. Lay lemon slices over liver, and pour sauce over the top. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a delicious way to serve liver.  The tarragon vinegar and lemon enhance the flavor of the liver.  It's a pleasant change from liver with onions and bacon.  It is also very eye-appealing.
