Ingredients:
1 cup pre-cooked grilled boneless chicken breast, diced
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese
4 tablespoons salsa
1 tsp butter

Directions:
Pre-heat a large griddle to medium-high heat.  LIGHTLY butter one side of each tortilla.  To assemble, place butter side down in griddle.  Spoon 1 tablespoon salsa onto the tortilla and spread evenly leaving a 1/2 in edge clean.  Sprinkle 1/3 cup of chicken onto the tortilla spreading it out evenly (leaving the edge).  Sprinkle 1/4 cup of cheese over everything. Place other tortilla directly over it butter side up.  Cook on griddle 3-4 minutes or until cheese starts binding everything.  Carefully flip.  Cook another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.  Remove to plate, slice with pizza slicer and serve.
