Ingredients:
1 ½ cups water
¼ cup margarine
1 (6 ounce) package stuffing mix (such as StoveTop(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
3 cups cubed cooked chicken
1 (16 ounce) package frozen California-blend vegetables (broccoli, carrot, cauliflower)
12 slices American cheese
2 (10.75 ounce) cans light cream of mushroom soup
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon dried marjoram leaves
½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
½ teaspoon ground sage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine water and margarine in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir stuffing mix into water and margarine until moistened; cover, remove from heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
Spread cooked chicken into bottom of the prepared baking dish and spread frozen vegetables over chicken. Top vegetables with American cheese slices in a layer. Mix cream of mushroom soup, garlic powder, marjoram, thyme, and sage in a bowl and spread over cheese slices. Sprinkle stuffing over top of casserole in an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and browned, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy casserole combining a few of my favorites (chicken and California-blend vegetables) mixed together with my favorite gravy spices. My family can eat the entire pan and still want more!
