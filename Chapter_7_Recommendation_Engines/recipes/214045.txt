Ingredients:
10 ounces uncooked spiral pasta
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1 cup sour cream
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart casserole dish.
Mix together the ham, sour cream, mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese, yellow mustard, and 1 tablespoon of parsley in a bowl until well combined. Fold in the cooked pasta, season to taste with salt and pepper, and spoon the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle top of casserole with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of parsley.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is hot and bubbling, and the cheese topping has melted and begun to brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This came from a long line of VanVoorst women from rural Illinois. It's a goodie to pass along and works great with leftover ham as well as ham steak! We serve it up with garlic bread and green beans or broccoli. You may also top with Parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs to change it up.
