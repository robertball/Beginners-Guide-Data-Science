Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
2 tablespoons warm water, or as needed
1 tablespoon shortening
1/4 cup white sugar
ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray, or line with parchment paper.
Mix flour and salt together in a bowl, and use a pastry cutter to cut in 1/3 cup of shortening until the mixture forms pea-size balls. With a fork, form a small well in the center of the mixture, and pour in water, a couple of teaspoons at a time, and stir with the fork to mix in the water and form a dough. Incorporate each addition of water before adding the next, until about 3/4 of the flour mixture has formed a stiff dough. Work a little more water in with your hands, and shape the dough into a ball.
Working on a well-floured work surface with a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out into a rectangle about 12 by 16 inches, and about 1/8-inch thick. Spread 1 tablespoon of shortening over the surface of the dough with a soft spatula, and sprinkle sugar all over the dough square. Sprinkle the dough with cinnamon. Pick up a long edge of dough, and tightly roll the dough into a log shape. With a sharp knife, slice the log into 3/4-inch thick slices. Place the slices onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are lightly browned and sizzling on the bottom, about 8 minutes. Cool on paper towels; freeze extras for later.

Description: 
Crumbly sugar and cinnamon cookies that you can make as fast as they disappear. My father told me about these cookies that his mother used to make. When she made a pie, she would take the excess dough and make these simple cookies. You don't have to make a pie first, all you need is pie dough. My father loves when I make them for him, and I think you will be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't. My father said she called them Piggies. That's what I call them.
