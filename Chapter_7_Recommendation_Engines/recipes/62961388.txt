Ingredients:
1 1/3 cup butter flavored shortening
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
GLAZE:
2 cups sugar
1 cup hot water
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, shortening and sugar. Stir in the eggs and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, stir into the creamed mixture until dough comes together. Chill for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough out to 1/4 inch thickness and cut with cookie cutters. Place them on an parchment paper lined cookie sheet about 1 inch apart.
Bake cookies 9 to 11 minutes in the preheated oven, Do not wait to see tan edges, if you see tan edges they are burned. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. Let cool before glazing
Glaze:
In a saucepan, combine sugar, water and cream of tartar; bring to a boil over low heat. Cook and stir until a candy thermometer reads 226 degrees F (thread stage). Cool to 110 degrees F (do not stir). Stir in extract and enough confectioners' sugar to achieve spreading consistency. Add desired food coloring as you like. Spread over cookies while warm.
