Ingredients:
Raspberry-Rhubarb Sauce:
1 teaspoon coconut oil
2 cups frozen chopped rhubarb
1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)
1 cup raspberries
1 packet stevia powder, or to taste
Porridge:
2 cups water, or as needed
3/4 cup small tapioca pearls
2/3 cup coconut milk
2 dates, pitted and chopped
1 tablespoon maca powder (such as Organic BurstÂ®)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 packet stevia powder, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Grease a saucepan with coconut oil and place over medium heat; add rhubarb. Cook until rhubarb starts to soften, adding water if needed, about 10 minutes. Stir raspberries and 1 packet stevia powder into rhubarb; cook until sauce is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.
Fill a pot halfway with water and bring to a boil; add tapioca. Simmer over medium heat, stirring often, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until tapioca is completely translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.
Blend coconut milk, dates, maca powder, and vanilla extract in a blender until smooth.
Strain tapioca porridge through a fine-mesh strainer and transfer back to the pot over low heat. Stir coconut mixture and 1 packet stevia powder into porridge. Simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more.
Pour porridge into 3 wine glasses and top with raspberry-rhubarb sauce.
