Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
Icing:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 mini muffin pans.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.
Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips.
Drop rounded tablespoons of the dough into the prepared mini muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light golden brown, 9 to 12 minutes. Cool before removing from the pans.
Meanwhile, beat shortening, butter, and vanilla extract together with an electric mixer in a mixing bowl. Beat in confectioners' sugar gradually, 1 cup at a time. Beat in milk until icing is smooth. Add a little more milk if icing is still dry.
Fill the center of each cooled cookie cup with icing.

Description: 
This recipe came about as a total accident. When I was a teenager, I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies in mini muffin pans, but the centers sank in. In a pinch, I filled the centers with icing and voila! The cookie cup. My friends would beg me to make these every week.
