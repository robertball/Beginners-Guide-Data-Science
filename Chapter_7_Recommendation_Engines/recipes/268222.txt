Ingredients:
Apple Base:
3 baking apples, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
Batter:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon apple pie spice
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup applesauce
3 tablespoons buttermilk
1 egg, lightly beaten
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Stir apples, brown sugar, butter, and salt in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and syrupy, about 30 minutes. Stir in walnuts.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin; divide apple mixture among muffin cups.
Whisk flour, brown sugar, baking powder, apple pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a small well in the center and set aside.
Combine butter, applesauce, buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour into the well in the flour mixture. Mix until just combined; batter should be lumpy. Pour batter over apple mixture in the muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of each muffin. Carefully flip pan onto a serving platter; serve hot.

Description: 
I've made these a couple different times and they have been an absolute hit - like a there-were-none-left hit. Soft and tender apples covered in a caramel glaze are the stars of this show! Haven't tried it yet, but vanilla ice cream probably wouldn't be a bad idea!
