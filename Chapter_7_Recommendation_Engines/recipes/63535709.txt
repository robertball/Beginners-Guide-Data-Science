Slowly whisk in milk a little at a time.

Open 1 can of crescent rolls and spread in the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking pan; making sure to pinch the perforations closed.
Spoon in pot pie mixture.
On a piece of foil, spread out the second can of rolls until it's long enough and wide enough to cover top of pie mixture; pinching close the perforations.
