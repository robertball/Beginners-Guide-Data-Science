Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large sweet onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
6 tablespoons chili powder
3 tablespoons ground cumin
3 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
4 cups cooked turkey meat, chopped
3 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) can beer
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until it starts to soften, about 1 minute.
Stir in chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper. Add turkey and stir until well coated with spices. Pour in crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, beer, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. Reduce heat to medium low and bring to a simmer, uncovered. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chili has thickened, about 50 minutes. Add black beans and cook until heated through, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
I made this with leftover turkey but would also work well with leftover chicken, too! Garnish with sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips, if desired.
