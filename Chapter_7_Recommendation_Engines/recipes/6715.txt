Ingredients:
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons white sugar
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  Set aside until creamy.
In a large bowl, mix together oil, 2-1/3 cups water, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar.  Add yeast, and gradually mix in flour.  Place dough in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with a damp tea towel, and place in a warm place to rise for 1-1/2 hours.
Form dough into balls about the size of eggs, then roll flat to make ovals about 1/4 inch thick.
Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep fryer, pot, or electric frying pan.  Fry doughnuts one at a time, until light brown on both sides.  Place on paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice while still hot.

Description: 
If you ever visited Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in the winter months on the Rideau Canal, which is the longest skating rink in the world, they serve 'Beaver Tails,' a sweet pastry that is essentially a flat doughnut with sugar on top. I could not get the authentic recipe since it is their trade secret, but I created a replica of what they serve.
