Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1/4 cup margarine
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable broth, or as needed
2 tablespoons white wine
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup light ricotta cheese
1 egg
1 egg white
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups coarsely shredded carrots
2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
