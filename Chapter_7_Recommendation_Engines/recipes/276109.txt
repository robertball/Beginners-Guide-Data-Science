Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package frozen riced cauliflower
cheese cloth
1 egg
1 tablespoon dry ranch salad dressing mix
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place riced cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a cheesecloth-lined strainer and allow to cool for 15 minutes. Squeeze moisture out of the cooled riced cauliflower.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine riced cauliflower, egg, ranch mix, and cayenne pepper in a bowl and mix well. Stir in Parmesan cheese until incorporated.
Drop mixture with a small cookie scoop onto the prepared cookie sheet and flatten with a small hand rolling pin, a cup, or your hand to approximately 1/16-inch thickness. The thinner the dough, the crispier the cracker.
Bake crackers in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, flip, and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
