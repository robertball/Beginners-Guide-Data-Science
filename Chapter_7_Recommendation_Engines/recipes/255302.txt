Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups Italian Tipo "00" flour, or more to taste
2 eggs
2 egg yolks, or more as needed
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Pile flour onto a work surface and make a small well in the center; place eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, and salt into the well. Gently stir the egg mixture with a fork, gradually drawing in flour until dough comes together.
Knead dough with hands until smooth and leathery, about 10 minutes.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap; let rest until malleable, 1 to 2 hours. Remove plastic wrap.
Cut dough into four pieces; roll out with a rolling pin. Run flattened pieces through a pasta roller to create desired noodle shape.
