Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
6 pork chops
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups uncooked rice
3 cups water
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, or more to taste
1/2 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 red bell pepper, sliced into rings
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer chops to a 9x13-inch baking dish and season with salt. Pour rice around the pork chops.
Mix water, tomato sauce, and taco seasoning together in a bowl. Pour over pork chops and rice. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until rice is tender and liquid is mostly absorbed, about 1 hour. Remove cover and top with bell pepper rings and Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes more.
