Ingredients:
8 roma (plum) tomatoes, halved lengthwise and seeded
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons white sugar
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package fresh salted mozzarella cheese, sliced 1/4-inch thick
8 leaves fresh basil, cut in very thin strips
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Arrange tomatoes, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with garlic, sugar, sea salt, and black pepper.
Roast tomatoes in the preheated oven until they begin to turn brown and the juices become thick and sticky, about 2 hours. Let tomatoes cool to room temperature.
Place tomato halves and slices of mozzarella cheese onto a serving platter, alternating tomatoes and cheese to make an attractive pattern; sprinkle salad with basil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar.
