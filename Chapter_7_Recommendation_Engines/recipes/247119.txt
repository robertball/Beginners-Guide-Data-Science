Ingredients:
3 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup barley
1 large mango, peeled and diced, divided
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups cooked black beans
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper

Directions:
Bring water and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan. Add barley; cover and simmer until tender yet firm to the bite, about 20 minutes. Drain any excess cooking liquid and let cool completely, 20 to 30 minutes.
Mash 1/4 of the mango against the side of a large bowl using a fork or potato masher. Whisk in lime juice, olive oil, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add barley, remaining mango, black beans, grape tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno; toss until well-combined.
