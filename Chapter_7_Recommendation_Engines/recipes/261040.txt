Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray
1 (12 ounce) package vegan beef crumbles (such as Trader Joe's Beef-less Ground Beef速)
1 cup mild green salsa, or to taste
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots速)
1 (8 ounce) package shredded vegan cheese (such as Daiya速)
1 cup vegan sour cream (such as Tofutti速) (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spray a skillet with cooking spray and add vegan crumbles. Cook and stir over medium heat until heated through and uniformly broken up, about 5 minutes. Stir in salsa and black olives. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.
Spread taters on a baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn taters over; bake until crispy, about 10 minutes more.
Transfer taters to a shallow, oven-safe serving dish. Spread crumbles-salsa mixture evenly on top. Sprinkle vegan cheese on top.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Place baking dish in the oven. Broil, watching closely to prevent burning, until vegan cheese is melted, about 3 minutes.
Top with dollops of vegan sour cream.
