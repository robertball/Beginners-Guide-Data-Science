Ingredients:
1 pound flank steak, thinly sliced
5 tablespoons soy sauce
2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons minced garlic

2 tablespoons sesame oil

Directions:
Place the beef in a shallow dish.  Combine soy sauce, sugar, green onion, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and ground black pepper in a small bowl.  Pour over beef.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Quickly grill beef on hot grill until slightly charred and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Description: 
I use this recipes at least once a week. Sometimes I add some fresh veggies to the pan -- spinach and green onion -- at the very end. Top with LOTS of sesame seeds and serve with Jasmine rice.Modified from: Beef Bulgogi - Korean Beef
