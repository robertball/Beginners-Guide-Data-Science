Ingredients:
2 cups shredded peeled apples
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 cup chopped fresh or frozen cranberries
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup chopped nuts
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a bowl, combine apples and sugar; let stand for 10 minutes. Add cranberries, carrots, nuts, eggs and oil; mix well. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, coriander if desired and salt; stir into apple mixture just until moistened. Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
It's sometimes difficult to get our daughter to eat healthy foods, but she gobbles up these fruit-filled muffins. Although these are a 'must' around the holidays, I keep cranberries in the freezer so I can whip up a batch any time of year.                                --Esther Bowers, Westland, Michigan
