Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1/3 cup sunflower seed kernels
1 large head broccoli, cut into bite-size pieces
1/3 cup diced red onion
1 cup seedless red grapes, halved
1 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble 7 slices of bacon; mix with sunflower seeds in a resealable bag.
Combine broccoli, onion, and grapes in a bowl.
Crumble the remaining bacon slice. Whisk mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and black pepper together in a bowl; fold in the 1 slice crumbled bacon. Pour dressing over broccoli mixture; toss to coat evenly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for flavors to blend, about 2 hours.
Sprinkle bacon-sunflower seed mixture over salad before serving; mix well.
