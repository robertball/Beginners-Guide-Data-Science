Ingredients:
Ingredients:
4 ounces smoked Gouda
4 ounces part-skim mozzarella
1 Granny Smith apple, cored and very thinly sliced
8 slices high-fiber, low-fat whole wheat bread
spray butter

Directions:
Build your sandwiches so that the cheese is against each slice of bread and 1/4 of the apple is in the middle. Lightly spray the outside of each slice with the spray butter and grill over medium-high heat in a non-stick skillet. I suggest covering it as you grill to ensure the cheese melts.
