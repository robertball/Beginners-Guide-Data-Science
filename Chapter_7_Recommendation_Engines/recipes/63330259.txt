*Garlic cheese is sometimes hard to find.  If you can't find it, just use 6 oz. Velveeta and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.

Saute onions in 1/4 cup butter for 10 to 15 minutes.  Cook broccoli per directions; drain.  Mix soup, mushrooms, and broccoli with onion.  Add cubed cheese.  Pour into 13x9 inch dish.  Mix dressing with remaining 1/4 cup melted butter.  Sprinkle over top.  Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30 to 45 minutes.
