Description: 
I love corned beef and you don't have to wait until St. Patrick's day to enjoy this dish.  It can be pricey though, so keep your eye out for it to go on sale at your local grocer, can be frozen for later use.  I am not a big fan of the cabbage, so I only put a small head of cabbage in mine and replace the carrots with an onion.Modified from: Corned Beef and Cabbage I
