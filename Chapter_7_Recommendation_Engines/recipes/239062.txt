Ingredients:
1 (7 ounce) can whole fire-roasted mild green chiles (such as La VictoriaÂ®), or more to taste, diced
1/2 cup dried minced onion
1/3 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/3 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
8 hamburger buns, split
16 slices deli ham
8 slices Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix green chiles, onion, mustard, butter, and poppy seeds together in a bowl; spread about 1 tablespoon onto each cut side of each hamburger bun. Layer two pieces of ham around each slice of Swiss cheese and place onto the bottom halves of the buns, sandwiching the meat and cheese with the top halves.
Wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil.
Bake sandwiches until the cheese is melted, 6 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
Minced onion and prepared mustard put a flavorful spin on these ham and cheese sandwiches. I like to add chiles to about half of them. One can for four of them or two cans to do all eight.
