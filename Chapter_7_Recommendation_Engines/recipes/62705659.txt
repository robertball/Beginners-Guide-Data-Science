Black Bean Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
15 oz. can Kuner's Southwestern Black Beans with Cumin and Chili Spices (undrained)
15 oz. can plain black beans (undrained)
1-2 cups chicken broth (use less for thick soup, more for thinner soup)
8 oz. can tomato sauce
2 tsp. chili powder (or to taste)
2 tsp. ground cumin (or to taste)
1/8 tsp. coriander (optional, gives a slightly mid-east flavor)
1 Tbl. dried, chopped onion, or to taste (I like Kirkland brand)
Juice of 1 lime

Directions:
Add all ingredients except for lime juice in a medium pot. Bring to a simmer and simmer uncovered, over medium-low heat, for about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally. Mash the beans with a potato masher until the soup thickens (I leave the soup pretty chunky). Squeeze the juice of one lime in and stir. I generally don't need to add any salt. Serve with Corn Tortilla Chips, Sour Cream, Grated Cheddar Cheese and Sliced Green Onions.
