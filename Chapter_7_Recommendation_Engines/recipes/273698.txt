Beat sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract.
Sift flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to creamed mixture. Pour in milk, lemon zest, and lemon juice and mix until you achieve a smooth batter. Spoon batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
