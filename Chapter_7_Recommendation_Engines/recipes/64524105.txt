Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 stick unsalted softened butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons bourbon whiskey
3 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 cup butterscotch chips, slightly chopped
3/4 cup pecans, slightly chopped
1 beaten egg for glaze top

Directions:
preheat oven to 350.
In large bowl whip together eggs & sugar until light and fluffy. Add butter, vanilla extract and whiskey.
In small bowl sift or whisk together flour and baking powder. Add to egg mixture. Fold in chips and nuts.
Turn dough out on lightly floured surface and divide into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a log and place on baking sheet. Shape logs to about 2" wide and length of baking sheet.
Brush tops of logs with beaten egg.
Cook for 25 minuets. Cool for 15 Minuets.
Cut on diagonal with sharp knife about 1 inch thick. Place flat on cookie sheet and brown to desired color- about 10 minuets EACH side.
You do not have to use the Bourbon but it does give it a little something extra. You can also drizzle melted butterscotch on them but remember that will make them sweeter.
