2 tablespoons milk
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/4 cup pizza sauce
10 slices pepperoni sausage

Directions:
In a bowl, beat eggs and milk. In a skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add egg mixture. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.
