Ingredients:
1/4 cup flour
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp poultry seasoning (I use Bells')
Salt & Pepper
ABout 6 pieces chicken thighs/legs
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green pepper
1 cup chopped red pepper
3 cloves garlic, chopped
10 oz sliced mushrooms
2 15-oz cans diced tomato
1/2 cup water or wine
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp basil
Salt & pepper
1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Combine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, poultry seasoning and salt & pepper in large plastic bag; add chicken pieces, one at a time, shaking to coat.  Meanwhile heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat; add onions and peppers and saute about 5 minutes; add garlic and saute another 2 to 3 minutes.  Add mushrooms (or remove pepper mixture and saute mushrooms - then return other vegetables to pot) and cook about 5 minutes.  Add tomatoes, water/wine and remainder of seasonings.  Bring to boil.
Nestle chicken pieces into vegetable mixture.  Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook about 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally.
Remove bay leaf.  If you used skin-on and/or bone-in pieces, you can remove skin and/or remove chicken from bones before serving, if preferred.
Serve over egg noodles, pasta or rice.

Description: 
My version of chicken cacciatore - you can use any cut of chicken or a whole chicken cut up, with or without skin and bones, but I prefer to use thighs and legs.
