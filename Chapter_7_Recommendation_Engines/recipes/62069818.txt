Ingredients:
8 raw egg yolks
2 c. sugar
2 c. butter
5 c. flour
8 egg whites
Cube sugar

Directions:
In one bowl beat the egg yolks slightly.  Add sugar and mix until smooth.
In a large bowl mix softened butter and flour together like a pie crust until crumbly.
Combine both mixtures and knead together with hands to make the dough.
Let chill for an hour for easier handling.
To make cookie, roll a strip approximately 1/2 inch thick and 3 - 5 inches long.  Loop ends over to shape an oval with tails.
Lay cookies on parchment paper covered cookie sheets and chill overnight or until firm.
When cookies are firm:
Crush sugar cubes until fine with small chunks.  Regular sugar does not provide the correct consistency.
Beat egg whites until frothy but not stiff.  Whites will need to be re-beaten periodically to maintain froth.
Dip cookie in egg whites, then sugar.
Bake at 325 degrees for 12 - 15 minutes.
Be prepared to have these gobbled up!

Description: 
Although a German name, this is a Norwegian cookie that has been a family tradition for years and is the best cookie I've ever had.  My sister and I have made this a holiday tradition to make these together each Christmas.  Even though there is some effort involved it is well worth it!
