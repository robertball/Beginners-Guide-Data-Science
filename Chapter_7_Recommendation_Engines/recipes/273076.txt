3 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3 cups sugar, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out 1 1/2 packages of crescent roll dough into a rectangle and place into a 11x13-inch baking pan. Press together to form a crust.
Combine cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy.  Spread mixture over crescent rolls.
Roll out remaining 1 1/2 packages of crescent roll dough and place on top of the cream cheese mixture.
Cream together butter, remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Spread over the second crescent roll layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up and golden, 30 to 35 minutes.
