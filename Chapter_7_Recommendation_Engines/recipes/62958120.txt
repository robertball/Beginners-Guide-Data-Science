In oven at 325F about 50 mins, but always go by temp, listed below
Rare: 120 to 125 degrees F center is bright red, pinkish toward the exterior portion. Medium Rare: 130 to 135 degrees F center is very pink, slightly brown toward the exterior portion. Medium: 140 to 145 degrees F center is light pink, outer portion is brown. Medium Well: 150 to 155 degrees F not pink. Well Done: 160 degrees F and above steak is uniformly brown throughout.
Allow the roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can retain its juices.
