Ingredients:
1 pound thick sliced bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
4 cups fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
2 large onions, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cups water
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon, and cook until browned, but not yet crispy. Push bacon to the sides of the skillet and add the onions and garlic to the bacon grease. Cook and stir until onions are barely translucent. Stir in the green beans, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Pour in the water, and mix in the brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. Simmer over low heat uncovered until water has evaporated and green beans are tender, about 1 hour.
