Place the pork roast in a crock pot and add approx. 1/2 C. water, season liberally with salt and pepper and cover & cook on low for 8 hours. Remove the meat & strain the meat juices left behind. Store the pork & juices covered in the fridge overnight. The next day, remove any fat that hardens on the surface and discard. With 2 forks, shred into good sized chunks.
Peel and cut into chunks the potatoes. Place in a pot of cold, salted water and bring to a boil. Add the whole garlic cloves and cook til fork tender. Drain and mash. (including the garlic) Add the 1/2 C. of cream, salt & pepper. Set aside.
In another skillet, add the olive oil, the shallots, garlic, & rosemary. Cook over medium heat til the shallots begin to wilt. Add the reserved pork and it's juices, along with the Dijon mustard. Cook til heated through and the juices reduce. Add an additional 2-3 Tbsp. heavy cream to make a velvety sauce.

Description: 
Comfort food at it's best. What beats meat and potatoes? In a more traditional Cottage or Shepherds Pie, the addition of veggies is enclosed. This version, cuts to the chase and is great as a stand alone meal or served with a side salad.
