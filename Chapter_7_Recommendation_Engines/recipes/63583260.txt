Ingredients:
1 stick ( 1/2 cup) butter
1 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
16oz fresh strawberries, capped and washed, cut in half (about 2 cups cut strawberries)
4 ounces cream cheese, cut in small pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Melt butter and pour into a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish.
In a small bowl, mix together, milk, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Pour directly over the butter in the baking dish.
Add the strawberries, arranging in a single layer.
Sprinkle cream cheese pieces around strawberries. Place in preheated oven and bake for 30-45 minutes, or until top is golden brown and edges are bubbling. (Crust rises up and around the fruit, but fruit will still peek out of top.)
