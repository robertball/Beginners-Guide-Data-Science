Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
3 1/2 slices smoked bacon
2 cups sour cream
1 (12 ounce) container cottage cheese
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain well.
Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp; drain, crumble, and set aside.
Place the drained noodles in a large baking dish. Stir the sour cream into the noodles. Spoon the cottage cheese evenly over the top of the noodle mixture. Sprinkle the crumbled bacon over the top; season with salt.
Bake in preheated oven until the cottage cheese softens, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is great for nights when you get home and need something to wind down. 'Turos Csusza' is a Hungarian dish I learned from my Dad last year when I turned twelve. It consists of bacon, egg noodles, sour cream, and cottage cheese. 'Elvezet!'
