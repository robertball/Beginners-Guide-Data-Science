Ingredients:
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
1 eggplant, sliced into 1/2 inch rounds
1 quart vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a shallow dish, combine corn meal, chili powder, oregano and salt. Dredge each eggplant slice in this mixture until coated on both the sides. Shake off excess.
Heat a small layer of oil in a large skillet. When the oil is hot arrange a layer of the the eggplant rounds in the oil and fry uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the rounds over fry until golden brown. Continue adding oil and frying the rounds until they are all fried. Serve either hot or cold.

Description: 
Savory grilled eggplant or brinjal. If you're having a barbeque we recommend grilling these rounds rather than frying. They are delicious either fried or grilled!
