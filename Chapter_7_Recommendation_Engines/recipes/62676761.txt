Ingredients:
6 pounds chicken wings, separated at joints, tips discarded or
6 -8 boneless skinless chicken breasts (plenty of marinade)
1 1/2 cups Louisiana-style hot sauce
1/2 cup butter
1 cup honey
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

Directions:
reserve 1 cup marinade for basting in separate bowl
Marinate chicken for at least 4 hours or over night before cooking
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill the chicken 8 to 12 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear.  (you can bake the chicken instead if you want to, but it is best when grilled.) Serve with favorite side dishes and a salad, when using boneless chicken we love this cut up in salad.
