Ingredients:
1 1/4 c. dry quinoa
1/2 c whole wheat flour
1/2 c flaxseed meal
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 tbsp chia seeds
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ginger powder
2 c pumpkin puree (baked neck pumpkin works well)
1/4 c honey
1/4 c coconut oil
2 tbsp walnut oil
1.5 c milk
1 egg
1/2 c water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
While oven is pre-heating, roast quinoa on a baking sheet for 5 minutes, shaking the pan half way through.
Put roasted quinoa in a blender or chopper until a consistency like corn meal.
Combine all ingredients, mix well
Let sit for 15 minutes to allow the chia and flaxseed meal to hydrate
Line muffin pan with muffin cups (reusable silicone cups work very well)
Pour batter into muffin cups ~3/4 full
Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until firm.  These muffins will be moist in the middle.

Description: 
Moist and delicious, I came up with this recipe for my young vegetarian daughter because it is high in protein, fiber, vitamins and good fats.  It has been a hit with everybody who's tried it.  Makes a great breakfast, after-school snack, or addition to a kids lunch.
