16 oz grated sharp cheddar cheese
8 oz softened cream cheese
4 oz blue cheese
4 oz butter (optional)
2 tbsp finely-grated onion
1 tsp bottled Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c finely-chopped filberts
1 c chopped filberts to coat
2 cherry halves and fresh parsley leaves for garnish

Directions:
Mix all ingredients but the filberts with a mixer or food processor until thoroughly blended. Stir in the finely-chopped filberts. Divide and form into 2 balls with wet hands. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate about an hour until cool and firm. Smooth and shape, then roll firmly in chopped filberts. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Remove from refrigerator and garnish an hour before serving. If tightly wrapped, will keep in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.If you want to freeze it for up to 3 months, use butter in the mix to keep the thawed product smooth and creamy.

When I set one of these out on a plate with knife and crackers, it draws a crowd! It disappears so fast, I keep a spare in the refrigerator, and a couple in the freezer for the holidays.
