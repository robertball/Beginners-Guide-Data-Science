Ingredients:
1 lb. dried black beans
1 medium diced (or halved) red onion
3 minced (or whole) garlic cloves
3 to 4 bay leaves
Water, enough to cover the beans with 1
1 Tbsp. Salt, added during last 30 minutes of cook time

Directions:
1. Sort beans (remove any small stones, broken, or wrinkled beans) and give them a good rinse before before cooking them (put beans into a bowl and cover with water, moving them around to remove any dirt).  Drain and repeat.
2. Place black beans, onion, garlic cloves, and bay leaf in a slow cooker. Add enough water (about 6 cups) to cover the beans plus 2 inches.
Note:  Keep an eye on your water and if all of the water has been absorbed, add more to prevent them from burning.
3. Cook on high for about 3-4 hours, testing after 3 hours. To test doneness, spoon out a few beans and blow on them. If the skins peel back, they beans are ready. Taste just to make sure.
4. Add the salt and let cook, or sit with heat off for another 20-30 minutes, to absorb the salt. Remove the bay leaf, garlic cloves, and onion before using, if desired.
