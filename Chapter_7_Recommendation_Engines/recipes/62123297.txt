Title:
Low Fat, Delicious, Easy Potato Soup on a Budget Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
3 lbs potatoes (about 9 russet potatoes), cubed
3 c Instant nonfat dry milk powder
8 c water
16 oz of canned whole kernel corn, drained
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 8 oz. package baby carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 TBSP Margarine or Butter
3 TBSP Ham bullion / Soup base
(I use Orrington Farms or Knorr)
1 TBSP Onion Powder
1 TBSP Garlic Powder
1/2 TBSP Celery salt
Salt and pepper to taste
1 c. cubed ham or crumbled bacon (optional)

Directions:
Place all vegetables in a large stock pot with 6 cups water and a bit of salt and bring to a boil.
Turn heat down to medium/low and simmer for 15 minutes.
If you keep the skins on your potatoes like me, skim the top of the water to remove any dirt or residue that has foamed up on top of the water.
Mix the powdered milk with 2 cups of cold water and stir until smooth.
Stir in the milk mixture, seasonings, and butter. You may also add bacon or diced ham now if you choose to.
Simmer for 20-30 minutes
To thicken the soup, I take a potato masher and squish down to the bottom of the pot 4 or 5 times and stir up until I have my desired thickness.
If you choose to add salt before serving, I recommend stirring in about a teaspoon at a time until it tastes right, because the line between just enough and too much can really ruin it.
