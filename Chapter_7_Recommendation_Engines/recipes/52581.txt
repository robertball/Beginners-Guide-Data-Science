Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, beat eggs with a wire whisk. Mix in milk, flour, sugar, salt, and melted butter.
Preheat a non-stick electric skillet to medium heat. Pour a thin layer of batter on skillet, and spread to edges. Cook until top surface appears dry. Cut into 2 or 4 sections, and flip with a spatula. Cook for another 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Roll each pancake up, and serve.

Description: 
This recipe is so delicious and easy to make.  I come from a really Swedish town - Rockford, Illinois - where Swedish pancakes are a favorite for Sunday morning breakfast.  My Dad used to make these for us at home for a special treat. Serve with butter and maple syrup, or lingonberries if you've got them.
