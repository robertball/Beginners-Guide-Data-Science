Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 small onions, chopped
1 pound vegetarian beef crumbles (such as BocaÂ®)
1 (10 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained (optional)
1 cup frozen peas
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn
1 pinch paprika (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place potato chunks and garlic cloves in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain. Mash using a potato masher. Stir in Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper until evenly mixed.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in vegetarian beef crumbles, mushrooms, and peas; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire sauce and pepper.
Pour onion and beef crumble mixture into a deep 9-inch casserole. Spread creamed corn on top. Spread mashed potato mixture carefully over the creamed corn. Sprinkle paprika over mashed potatoes.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling around the sides and hot in the center, 30 to 40 minutes.
