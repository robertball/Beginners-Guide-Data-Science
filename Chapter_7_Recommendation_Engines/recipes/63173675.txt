Ingredients:
1 cup rinsed quinoa
2 cups vegetable broth
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 T. minced garlic
3 green onion with both green/white part,chopped
1 - 1.5 lb. raw shrimp, deveined
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 zucchini, diced
1 yellow squash, diced
2 tomato, diced
4 ounces crumbled feta cheese
8 fresh basil leaves
lime juice from 1/2 fresh squeezed lime

Directions:
Bring the quinoa and vegetable broth to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to a simmer and cover the pan. Simmer until the broth is absorbed, the quinoa is fluffy, and the white line is visible in the grain, about 12 minutes.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet; cook and stir the minced garlic and green onion until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the raw shrimp and cook until shrimp is pinkish, about 5 more minutes. Remove shrimp and set aside. Pour 2 more tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet. Cook and stir the zucchini, yellow squash and tomato until both squash are tender, 5 to 8 minutes.  Season with fresh ground pepper and a pinch of sea salt.  Return shrimp to skillet and mix in with vegetables.  Add fresh basil leaves (minced) and lime juice. Sprinkle with Feta cheese.  Serve over hot quinoa.
