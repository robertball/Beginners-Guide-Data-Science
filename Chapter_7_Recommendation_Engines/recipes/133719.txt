Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3 (12 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuits, separated and cut into quarters
3 apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.
Combine the sugar and cinnamon together in a large sealable plastic bag; add the biscuit dough in batches of 6 to 8 pieces and shake to coat. Alternate layers of the chopped apple and the coated dough pieces in the prepared pan.
Melt the margarine in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir the brown sugar into the melted margarine. Bring to a boil; cook at a boil for 1 minute, remove from heat, and pour over the apple and biscuit layers.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before turning out onto a plate to serve.
