In the same saucepan, melt the butter and add onion, garlic, red bell pepper and green bell pepper; saute and stir until transparent, but do not brown.
Add flour and mix well until all the vegetables are coated; add some seafood broth slowly, but stirring constantly. Add the imitation crabmeat and mix; add the milk and salt and pepper to taste and mix.
Add the marjoram, basil and tarragon and simmer very gently; stir constantly until the wanted thickness is obtained. Take off of heat and reserve.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until al dente; drain and cover with the seafood sauce. Serve.
