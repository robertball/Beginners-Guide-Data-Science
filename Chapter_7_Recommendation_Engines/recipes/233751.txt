Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
6 cups canned whole tomatoes with juice, chopped
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir in shrimp and scallops. Cook, stirring frequently, until shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir shrimp, scallops, mussels, and parsley into tomato mixture. Cook until sauce begins to bubble and mussels open, about 7 minutes. Pour sauce over linguine and serve.
