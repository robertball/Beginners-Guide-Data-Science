Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Canola oil
2 jalapenos, seeded and chopped
1 shallot, chopped finely
2 minced garlic cloves
2 Tbsp. butter
1 Tbsp. flour
1/4 cup milk
12 oz. can fat-free evaporated milk
2 Tbsp. finely grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Pulse jalapenos, garlic and shallot in a food processor until finely chopped, not pureed.
Butterfly breasts, pat very dry and add salt and pepper and cook over medium-heat in 1 Tbsp. canola oil.
While the chicken is cooking, heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add butter. Once sizzling, add in the chopped jalapeno mixture, stirring to coat, and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When fragrant (do NOT put your face directly over the jalapenos!), whisk in flour and stir continuously to create a roux. Cook mixture for 1-2 minutes, then add in milks, reducing the heat to medium-low. Continue to stir continuously until mixture begins to thicken (about 6-8 minutes), adding in Parmesan cheese. Cook to desired thickness.
Serve sauce over chicken with brown rice or other desired sides.
