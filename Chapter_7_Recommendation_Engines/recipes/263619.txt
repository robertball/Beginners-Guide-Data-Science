1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 teaspoon white sugar, divided
1 3/4 pounds white asparagus - peeled, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch pieces
3 tablespoons orange juice
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons creme fraiche with herbs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups hulled and quartered strawberries
To Serve:
4 leaves green leaf lettuce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Fill a pot with water; add 1/2 teaspoon each salt and sugar. Bring to a boil. Add white asparagus, reduce heat to low, and simmer until soft and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Combine orange juice, yogurt, mayonnaise, and creme fraiche in a large bowl. Season with remaining salt, sugar, and pepper. Add cooled asparagus and strawberries and mix well.
Arrange lettuce leaves on plates and distribute asparagus salad on top. Sprinkle with chives.

Description: 
White asparagus has a much milder taste and works well with the sweet fruitiness of strawberries. This salad is served with a creamy yogurt-mayo dressing with orange juice.
