Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup whole milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups mashed fig preserves
1 cup pecan pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray.
Combine sugar and eggs in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until sugar dissolves. Stir in vegetable oil. Pour in milk; mix well.
Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Mix into the creamed sugar mixture until blended. Fold fig preserves and pecan pieces into the batter.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.
