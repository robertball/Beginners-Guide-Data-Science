2 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
4 cups confectioners' sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons salt
3 cups shortening
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Sift together flour, confectioners' sugar and salt in large mixer bowl.  Add the shortening, vanilla and chopped walnuts.  Using low speed of an electric mixer, mix all ingredients until just blended.
Roll dough on floured counter into 1 1/2 inch cylinders.  Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until firm enough to slice.
