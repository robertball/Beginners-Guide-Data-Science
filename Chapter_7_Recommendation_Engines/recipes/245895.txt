Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 tablespoons sliced black olives
2 tablespoons cooked black beans
salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)
3 tablespoons salsa
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 tablespoon sour cream

Directions:
Combine water, oats, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high in the microwave until the water is absorbed and oats are tender, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
Cook onion, red bell pepper, olives, and black beans in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir onion mixture, salsa, and Cheddar cheese into cooked oatmeal.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat; cook egg to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes. Top oatmeal with fried egg. Garnish with diced avocado and sour cream.
