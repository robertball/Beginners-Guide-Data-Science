Dash of ground nutmeg

Dash of white pepper
1 cup milk
2/3 cup shredded Swiss or cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat.  Stir in the flour, bouillon, nutmeg, cayenne and white pepper; cook over low heat, stirring constantly,until mixture is smooth and bubbly. Stir in milk; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.  Add cheese; cook and stir just until it melts.  Remove from the heat and set aside.
Place spinach in an ungreased 12x8x2in. or 8-in. square baking dish, depending on how many fillets.  Sprinkle with lemon juice.   Arrange fish over spinach; sprinkle with salt.  Spread sauce on top.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with Parmeasan cheese and paprika; return to the oven for 5 minutes.
