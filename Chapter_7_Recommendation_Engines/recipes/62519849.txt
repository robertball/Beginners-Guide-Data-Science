2 cups Jiffy® Baking Mix
2/3 cup sugar
1/3 cup milk
1 egg

*your favorite frosting and sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients together.
Spoon onto grease baking pan (or) parchment paper lined pan.(best with parchment)
Bake 8-10 minutes.
Remove from oven, let cool completely. Frost and decorate with sprinkles of your choice.
***Batter is quite sticky, my suggestion is this and I have done this numberous times with success. Pipe batter into a decorator's piping bag, using a large star tip (1M size) and pipe batter onto a lined parchment baking pan. you can get 18 nice size cookies with this recipe or 33-36 small cookies.
