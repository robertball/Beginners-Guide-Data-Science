Ingredients:
1 cup semi-pearled farro
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
2/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil and garlic, slivered
8 oz mushrooms, cubed
1 pound summer squash (any variety), cubed
1 tablespoon dried basil or italian seasoning
Garnish: 1/4 cup shredded cheese (parmesan, mozzarella, provolone)

Directions:
Rinse farro and cook according to package directions with bouillon until done.  Drain.
While farro is cooking, in a large sautee pan sautee tomatoes and mushrooms for five minutes or until mushrooms are softened slightly.  Add squash and sautee until squash is tender but not overdone.
Add farro and seasoning to sautee and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.
Serve garnished with cheese.

Description: 
This is a versatile dish.  Substitute rice for farro if needed (though farro has more protein, fewer calories and more fiber so it's worth hunting for) or add a pound of meat (diced chicken works well) to make this a main dish for 4.
