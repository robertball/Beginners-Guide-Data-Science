Ingredients:
8 fresh oranges
2 bars dark chocolate (high cocoa content, eg 80%+)
1 cup sugar
1 cup water
3 whole allspice
3 whole cloves
1 small piece of cinnamon bark

Directions:
Cut oranges in half and juice
Cut top off of orange halves leaving a 1/2 to 3/4 inch ring and cut open to produce an 8 inch strip
Pull off pulp
Slice or scrap off pith (optional, but produces a firmer, "orangier" twig)
Cut strip in half lengthwise and then in half, making four 4 inch by 1/4 inch twigs
Blanching 3 times:  Put orange twigs into 2 cups of water and bring to a boil, empty, refill with 2 cups water, bring to a boil, empty, refill and bring to a boil, empty
Add sugar, water and spices and bring to a boil then simmer until reduced by about a half about 20 to 30 minuites.  Don't stir or you might produce sugar crystals. Gently swirling the pan a couple of times is OK
The twigs turn translucent when ready
Remove twigs from sugar bath and let dry for an hour on a wire rack
Save orange sugar syrup to use in mixed drinks or desserts
Chop chocolate into small pieces
Melt 1 and 1/2 of the chocolate bars in a bowl over a pan with very hot water and stir. Don't let the bowl touch the water. Or drip water into the chocolate
When melted add remaining chocolate and stir until all is melted
Check temperature and keep at around 89 degrees for dipping
Dip twigs into chocolate (I use sugar pincers) and place on parchment paper to cool

Description: 
The first time I tasted these as a student in France, I was hooked.  Brindilles a l'Orange (orange twigs) are covered in dark chocolate and have just enough sweetness in the candied orange center that make these a perfect combination.  These take some time, so double the batch for gifts.
