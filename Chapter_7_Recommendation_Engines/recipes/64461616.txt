Ingredients:
4c Sugar
5c Heavy Cream or Half-and-Half
1tsp Coarse Salt
2tsp Vanilla Extract

Directions:
1. Spread the sugar in an even layer over the bottom of a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place over medium to medium-low heat, watching carefully.
2. When the sugar begins to liquefy, use a heatproof spatula to gently stir towards the center. Continue stirring very gently until all the sugar is melted, taking care not to over stir.
3. Once the caramel reaches a deep amber color, immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. To test the color, spoon a drop onto a white plate or bowl.
4. Carefully whisk in about half of the heavy cream. Use caution, as the mixture will steam and bubble violently. Stir until the cream is well incorporated, reheating over medium-low heat if necessary.
5. Whisk in the remaining cream, then stir in the salt and the vanilla.
6. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If needed, it can be rewarmed in the microwave or in a saucepan over low heat.

Description: 
My mom was trying to remember how she made caramel sauce as a kid, so I simply googled it and we combined her memories with what we found and got this! I usually serve it on my Frappuccino Cake, but it is delicious on top of ice cream or in a sundae.
