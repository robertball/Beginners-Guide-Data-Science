In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in 1 cup milk, pudding mix, and lemon rind. Add remaining 1/2 cup milk, and beat until smooth. Spread mixture into pastry shell. Arrange apples over cream cheese layer.
In a small saucepan, heat preserves until runny. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat apples. Refrigerate pie for at least 1 hour before serving.
