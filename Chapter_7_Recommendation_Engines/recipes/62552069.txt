Ingredients:
1 c. peanut butter (chunky or smooth)
1 c. sugar
1 egg

Directions:
mix together all 3 ingredients until they form soft ball of dough
roll into 36 balls or use a tsp cookie scoop
press down with a fork in a criss cross pattern (#)
bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 10 min.  (I bake 5 min on middle bottom rack and then 5 min on upper middle rack.  This makes them both crispy and chewy.)
