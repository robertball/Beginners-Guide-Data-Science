6 large (or 8 medium) very ripe (brown spotted/striped) bananas, peeled
3 cups flour
2/3 cup oil
1-1/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
4 eggs

2 tsp baking soda
2 loaf pans (or 2 mini loaf tins/large muffin tins
non-stick spray to coat

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Using a potato masher or similar utensil (large fork or pastry/shortening cutter also work) coarsely mash bananas.
Add flour gradually, still using masher, followed by baking soda.  Mix through.
Beat eggs in a cup.  Add beaten eggs, oil, and vanilla.  Mix into banana mixture with spoon until mixed through.  Banana lumps should still be visible.
Gradually add sugar.  Mix in until just mixed through.
Pour batter into prepared pans, about 2/3 full.  Bake for approximately 23-26 minutes for mini loaves/muffins, 45 minutes for loaves.
Loaves are done when toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Allow to cool approx 10 minutes before turning out onto rack.
