Ingredients:
one unbaked 9 inch pie shell
3 eggs
2/3 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 cup light or dark corn syrup
1/2 cup black walnuts, either halves or pieces
1/2 cup pecans, either halves or pieces
(1/2 tsp salt, optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375o.
Prepare pastry, set aside.
Beat the eggs in a medium bowl.
Add the sugar, vanilla, butter and syrup (and salt) and beat until it is completely mixed.
Pour this into the pie shell.
Place the nuts on top of the pie.  You can be as creative as you like in arranging them, or you can just toss them on.
Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until filling is set.
Take it out of the oven, and let it cool before serving.  Store it in the refrigerator.

Description: 
This is a pie that started out with a disaster: an all black walnut pie that I attempted was far too oily!  So I baked a second pie using this recipe and it was an outstanding success.  Both kinds of nuts turn into a flavorful delight that is always in demand for the holidays.
