Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 tablespoons miso paste
2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1 pound salmon fillets

Directions:
Toast sesame seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Watch them closely and remove from heat once sesame seeds are a golden brown. Set aside.
Combine miso paste, mirin, soy sauce, ginger, and honey in a small bowl. Mix well. Stir in toasted sesame seeds.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking pan with foil and lightly grease with oil.
Coat salmon well in the miso sauce and place skin-side up on the baking pan.
Broil in the preheated oven, watching closely, until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
