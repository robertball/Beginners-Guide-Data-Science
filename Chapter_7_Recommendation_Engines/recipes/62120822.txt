Ingredients:
16 ounces of cream cheese softened
Grated onion to taste
1 small drop of green food coloring
2 cucumbers or 3 if small
Salt and pepper to taste
Small Cocktail Pumpernickel or rye bread slices or fresh chopped vegetables

Directions:
Remove skin and seeds from cucumbers.
You can grate the cucumbers or I cut up in small pieces and
put in small food processor and pulse a couple of times. I also add the onions in with the cucumbers.
Place grated or processed cucumbers and onions in a colandar and drain out all of the juice. I usuallly use my flour sifter and press with a spoon.
Mix all ingredients in bowl with cream cheese.
Be careful when adding the food coloring or it will look really green

Description: 
This is a refreashing dip/spread that is good to serve as an appetizer. You can usually find this at the grocery store in Kentucky but the last time I went home and bought some I thought my homemade rendition was better.
