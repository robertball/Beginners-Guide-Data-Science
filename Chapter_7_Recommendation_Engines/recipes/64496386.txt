Directions:
Brown beef chunks in a stock pot or dutch oven, Season with onion and garlic powder (i sprinkle over the top of the meat).
Throw in diced Onions and cook until starting to turn clear.
Add all beef broth and seasonings (ginger, brown sugar, soy sauce & Franks) bring pot to a rolling boil, reduce to simmer  throw in the rest of the Veggies as well as the rice noodles then cover and simmer on low for 3 minutes while tossing lightly.   Feel free to modify ingredient amounts to your taste!! Simmer for about  5 minutes or until the rice noodles  have finished cooking through.
Try not to eat the entire pot before anyone else shows up for dinner!
Check the rice noodles for done-ness and then fill your bowl and eat it. Try not to eat the entire pot in one sitting. :)
