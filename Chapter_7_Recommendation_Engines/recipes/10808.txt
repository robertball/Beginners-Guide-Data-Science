Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
6 cups miniature marshmallows
1/2 cup peanut butter
5 cups toasted oat cereal

Directions:
Spray a 13 x 9 inch pan on bottom and sides with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl in microwave, melt margarine.  Add marshmallows, stir to coat.  Microwave on high 1 1/2 minutes or until smooth when stirred for 45 seconds.  Stir in peanut butter.
Add cereal all at once and stir quickly to coat.  With buttered spatula, press into prepared pan.  Cool and cut into squares.

Description: 
This version has no chocolate topping, but it would be easy to melt chocolate chips and spread them over the top.  We have a nut allergy in our family and I omit the peanut butter and substitute 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips melted with the margarine instead.
