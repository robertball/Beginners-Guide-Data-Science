Ingredients:
For the paste:
- 4 red-hot chillies (less if you want; I doubt many will want more though!)
- 1 Tablespoon coriander seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
- 4 cloves
- 10 black peppercorns
- 6 curry leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon grated ginger root (it's easily peeled with a teaspoon!)
For the body of the dish:
- 1 Tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 450 gms (1 pound) mutton, chopped into small pieces
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 900 ml (3 3/4 cups) good quality lamb or beef stock (I think that this is called broth for some reason in the U.S.)
- 2 Tablespoons tomato purée (tomato paste)
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1 large cooking (baking) apple, peeled, cored and diced
- 2 lemons, sliced; for garnish

Directions:
First prepare the paste by grinding all the ingredients together to get a smooth even mixture.
In a large skillet, heat the ghee, then add the onion, and fry over a moderate heat until golden.
Add both the mutton and the paste to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes, stirring continuously.
Add the salt, the stock and the tomato purée, bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes or so, until the meat is tender.
Add the carrot and apple and cook for a further 15 minutes, before removing from the heat and allowing to cool a little.
Fish out the pieces of meat and reserve, before whizzing the rest thoroughly and straining it (you ARE allowed to press on the contents of the strainer!) to remove any final large and hard pieces, which will be discarded.
Return the strained liquid and the meat to the skillet and cook for a further 5 minutes.
Serve in warmed bowls, garnished with lemon slices.

Description: 
THE Ultimate Mulligatawny, this is far more than a mere spicy soup! I first cooked this under instruction in a 5-star hotel in India, where it was one of the best sellers. The paste can also be used in other Indian dishes.
