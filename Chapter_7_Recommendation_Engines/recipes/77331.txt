Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRANDÂ® Sweetened Condensed Milk
1 egg white, whipped
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 (14 ounce) package flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven 325 degrees F.  Line baking sheets with foil; grease and flour foil.  Set aside.
In large bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, egg white, extracts and coconut; mix well.  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets; slightly flatten each mound with a spoon.
Bake 15 to 17 minutes or until lightly browned around edges.  Immediately remove from baking sheets (macaroons will stick if allowed to cool); cool on wire racks.  Store loosely covered at room temperature.
