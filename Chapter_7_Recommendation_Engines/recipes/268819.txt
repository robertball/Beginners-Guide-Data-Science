Ingredients:
1 medium pumpkin - peeled, seeded, and cubed
2 frozen pie crusts, thawed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 very ripe persimmons
3/4 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup milk
2/3 cup heavy whipping cream
4 tablespoons mascarpone cheese
3 tablespoons apricot preserves
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
4 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place pumpkin in a shallow baking pan and lightly coat with olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender when poked using a fork, 55 to 65 minutes. Remove pumpkin from oven and allow to cool 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 pie plates with the pie crusts.
Cut the tops off of the persimmons and scoop pulp out into a bowl. Mash slightly and transfer to a food processor. Add roasted pumpkin, brown sugar, milk, cream, mascarpone cheese, apricot preserves, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt and blend well. Pour mixture into a large bowl and add eggs; blend using a whisk. Pour the filling equally into the 2 pie crusts. Sprinkle additional cinnamon on top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. If crust is overcooking, wrap edges with aluminum foil. Continue baking until set, about 10 minutes more.
Remove pies from oven and let cool before serving. Top with confectioners' sugar and additional nutmeg.

Description: 
I tracked down a great recipe online for a pumpkin-persimmon pie, but it called for canned pumpkin and making your own crust which I didn't want to do. So I found another couple recipes for using fresh pumpkin and came up with this gem. The pies turned out great. This was by far the best pumpkin pie I've ever had, and when you discover something wonderful you share it with the world.
