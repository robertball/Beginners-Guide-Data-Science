Description: 
This super-flavorful lighter version of chorizo is made with lean ground turkey instead of pork. Form into burger patties, stuff inside sausage casings, use as taco meat, or fry some up with eggs! This is what I use to make my Chorizo-Stuffed Spaghetti Squash, also found on this site. The possibilities are endless!
