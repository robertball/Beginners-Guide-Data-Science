Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup ground flax seeds
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 ripe bananas
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup margarine
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup vanilla yogurt
1 ripe pear, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, ground flax seeds, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
Combine bananas, white sugar, brown sugar, and margarine in a separate bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Stir in vanilla extract. Beat in vanilla yogurt gradually. Beat in flour mixture until well blended. Fold pear into the batter.
Fill muffin cups 1/3 of the way with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool.
