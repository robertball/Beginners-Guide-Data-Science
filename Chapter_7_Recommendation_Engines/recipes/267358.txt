Ingredients:
For the Syrup:
2 cups maple syrup
2 cups heavy cream
For the Batter:
3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon fine salt
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Butter a deep baking dish and place it on a sheet pan.
Bring maple syrup and heavy cream to a boil in a deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn off heat once mixture starts to bubble, stir, and set aside.
Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl using a spatula or electric mixer until creamy and well combined. Whisk in vanilla extract and 1 egg until incorporated. Mix in the other egg. Sprinkle in baking powder, salt, and flour. Mix with a spatula until batter is just combined.
Transfer batter to the prepared dish and pour the maple-cream sauce on top, stopping between 1/2 to 1-inch from the top of the dish. Reserve any extra sauce.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until pudding is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes; serve pudding with any extra maple-cream sauce.

Description: 
Though it translates to 'unemployed man's pudding,' pouding chomeur isn't cheap to make. The good news is you don't really need to eat this more than a few times a year anyway. It's the perfect dessert to pair with summer fruit or vanilla ice cream. If you use a bigger baking dish than I did, and pour over all the maple cream syrup, your cake should float over a pool of what will eventually be your sauce. If you just use a deep pie dish like I did, then just serve the extra sauce on the side.
