Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1-2 coils vermicelli (birds' nest pasta)
1 cup Uncle Ben's CONVERTED Rice
2 cups chicken broth (homemade is best, but canned will do!)

Directions:
Over medium heat, melt butter in medium saucepan.
When melted, crumble vermicelli nests into butter and stir constantly until golden brown.
Add converted rice and stir for another 30-45 seconds (until butter appears absorbed).
Pour in chicken broth and raise heat from medium to high to bring to a quick boil.  As soon as boil is reached, place lid on the pan, lower heat to a gentle simmer and set timer for 45 minutes.
When timer goes off, remove lid, fluff mixture with a spoon, recap and set aside (off the heat) for 5 minutes, then serve!
