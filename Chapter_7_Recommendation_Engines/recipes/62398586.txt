Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 stick butter or margarine, softened
2 eggs, beaten with fork
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
Cinnamon
Powdered Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Mix the first 4 ingredients together in a large bowl. Stir in the butter until dry ingredients are moistened.
Take out 1 cup and reserve for topping.
Dissolve the baking powder and soda in the buttermilk and add to the remaining mixture, along with the beaten eggs.
Stir together gently with a fork until all is wet. Do not beat.
Pour into one lightly greased 9"x13" pan or two 8" pans. (I use a cooking spray)
Top with reserved crumbs. Sprinkle with Cinnamon and Confectioners Sugar.
Done when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Description: 
Delicious treat for breakfast or that late night snack. Not too sweet, perfect with a cup of coffee or tea. My neighbor insists I make an extra pan for him whenever I bake this. An old family recipe from Dad's side. (He was the typical short-legged Welshman.)
