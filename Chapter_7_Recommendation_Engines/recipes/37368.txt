Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
8 cups fresh or frozen blackberries, thawed
1/4 cup orange juice
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons shortening
1/4 cup ice water
butter flavored cooking spray
1 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
COMBINE first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; gently stir in blackberries. Spoon into an 8-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle with orange juice. Set aside.
COMBINE 1 cup flour and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, evenly over mixture; stir with a fork just until dry ingredients are moistened.
PRESS pastry gently into a 4-inch circle on heavy-duty plastic wrap, and cover with additional plastic wrap. Roll pastry, still covered, into a 9-inch square; chill 10 minutes or until plastic wrap can be easily removed.
REMOVE top sheet of plastic wrap, and cut pastry into 9 (1-inch) strips. Arrange pastry strips over blackberry mixture in a crisscross pattern.
COAT with cooking spray; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar. Bake at 425 degrees for 35 minutes or until pastry is golden.
