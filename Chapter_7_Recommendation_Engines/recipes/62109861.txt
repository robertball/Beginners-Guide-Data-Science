Ingredients:
1 tube Pillsbury Refrig. pie crust dough
4 oz. cream cheese
1/4 c. white sugar
1 stick butter
1 cup water
1 cup flour
3 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
1 jar pre-made cream cheese icing

Directions:
Soften pie crust dough, let come to room temp. On a lightly floured surface, roll crust out and flatten with a rolling pin. Using a 2 1/2 inch biscuit or cookie cutter circle, cut 12 shapes out of the pie crust. Place on a greased cookie sheet.
In a microwave safe bowl, melt 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1/4 cup of sugar together for about 30 seconds in microwave. Stir to blend. Using a teaspoon, spoon onto pie crust rounds. Set aside.
Meanwhile in a heavy sauce pan, bring stick of butter and water to a boil. As soon as the mixture boils, add 1 cup of flour all at once. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition, to pan. Add 1 tsp. vanilla, stir well, remove from heat. Using a Tablespoon, spoon dough onto pie crusts and cream cheese mixture.
Bake in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes until golden brown. Let cool for 10 min. and then ice with icing when slightly warm.
