Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into strips
2  potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (5.5 ounce) package red beans & rice mix
10 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
In a large skillet, prepare rice and beans according to package directions.
Meanwhile, in another large skillet, saute chicken until cooked through (meat is no longer pink), about 15 to 20 minutes over medium heat. Drain saute oil/grease from skillet. Add the potatoes and cook until just tender. Add seasoning according to package directions. Cook all together, stirring often, until potatoes are done.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Take a tortilla. Place some of the chicken/potato mixture and some of the beans and rice (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup total filling) onto the tortilla, add a little cheese to taste, and roll up. Place rolled tortilla in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Repeat with other tortillas until dish is full. Top with the rest of the cheese and bake in the preheated oven 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly.
