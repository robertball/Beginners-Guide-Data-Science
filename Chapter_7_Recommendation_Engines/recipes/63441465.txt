Ingredients:
Bread
1 C Sourdough Starter
3/4 C Lukewarm Water
2 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 T sugar
1 PKG Yeast
2 1/2- 3 C Bread Flour
Cornstarch Glaze
1/2 C cold water
1 tsp cornstarch

Directions:
Place all ingredients except (corn starch glaze items)into a stand mixer with a dough hook.  I personally use a Cuisinart and find it has the power to handle bread dough better than other stand up mixers.  Start the mixer slow until everything incorporates, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides as necessary and gradually turn the mixer up to the highest setting for a bout 2 minutes and a nice dough ball forms.  Remove dough from the mixer and place it in a well oiled bowl, turning it to ensure the top of the dough ball is covered as well - let rise until double about 1 hour.  Punch down, knead for about 3 minutes and then shape the dough into the shape you desire, if creating a free form loaf I will typically slice the top with a razor knife (just prior to putting it in the oven) let rise for approximately 45 minutes, then bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
Cornstarch Glaze
place all ingredients into a saucepan until thick and translucent - allow to cool.
Brush loaf of bread with this mixture 10 minutes into baking and then again about 2 minutes prior to taking it out of the oven - you can use this as a Glue to sprinkle herbs or seasonings on top if you desire, however it will give your bread a beautiful bakery sheen -
