Ingredients:
1 egg
1/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
1 - Beat the egg and sugar until thick
2 - Add flour, salt, baking powder and milk.
3 - Add melted butter and mix until smooth
4 - Cook by tablespoonfuls in a frying pan or on the griddle - use butter to keep them from sticking, not cooking spray.  Only use margarine if you have to.
