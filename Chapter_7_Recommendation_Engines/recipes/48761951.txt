Ingredients:
1-2 teaspoons olive oil
1-2 chicken breasts, cooked or raw, cut into bite-size pieces
8 oz. macaroni or other pasta
1/4 C chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, diced
Several slices jalapeno peppers (from jar), chopped
1 cup milk thickened with sour cream or plain yogurt to resemble heavy cream
1 can diced tomatoes (w/peppers/garlic/whatever), drained
2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
If using raw chicken, cook until done in 2 tsp. olive oil with chopped onion and garlic. Set aside.
If using cooked chicken, add chopped onion and garlic to pasta water before it starts boiling. Add 1 tsp. olive oil to water. Add pasta and cook until al dente.
Mix milk & sour cream or plain yogurt until smooth and as thick as heavy cream. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir in the tomatoes. Mix in the flour and black pepper, and simmer until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the chicken, and simmer another minute or two.  Stir in the Parmesan cheese, and remove from heat. Allow sauce to cool for a few minutes before serving over pasta.
