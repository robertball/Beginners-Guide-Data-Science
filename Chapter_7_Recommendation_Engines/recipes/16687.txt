Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon ground black pepper, divided
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Melt butter in a small skillet. Pepper the skillet with 1/2 tablespoon of the pepper, then lay the chicken breast onto the pepper. Squeeze fresh lemon juice onto the chicken, then season with the remaining pepper.
Saute chicken breast for about 5 to 7 minutes, then turn to the other side, squeeze lemon juice onto the other side and saute for another 5 to 7 minutes (or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear).
