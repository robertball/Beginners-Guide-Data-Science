Image:

Ingredients:
3 egg whites
1 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
20 buttery round crackers (such as RitzÂ®), coarsely crumbled
1 cup chopped pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pint heavy cream
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch pie plate.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add 1 cup sugar and baking powder, continuing to beat until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak.
Fold crackers and pecans into the egg whites. Add vanilla and stir.
Bake pie in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 30 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
Beat cream with pinch sugar in a bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the cream will form sharp peaks. Top cooled pie with whipped cream to serve.

Description: 
When it comes to family get-togethers, there is one thing Papa will always be remembered for, and that is his famous 'Angel Pie'. This is the first year that the whisk has been passed down, and I hope to one day pass it down to my grandchildren, too. Here's hoping it brings as much love to your table.
