Description: 
Ricotta and spinach make the most classic vegetarian pairing in Italian cooking. In the traditional tortellini di magro, it's used also as filling for tortellini, the famous ring-shaped stuffed egg pasta from Bologna served in a clear beef stock for Christmas or any special occasion. This version, with green spinach dough and a vegetarian filling is a very much appreciated alternative to the classic recipe. Serve with your favorite sauce. Great with a simple butter and sage sauce or with your regular tomato sauce.
