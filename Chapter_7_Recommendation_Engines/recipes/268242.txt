Ingredients:
1 cup coconut milk
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
2 teaspoons vegan margarine (such as Earth Balance®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons margarine, and vanilla extract in a saucepan. Heat on low, watching carefully and stirring occasionally, until mixture registers 236 degrees F (113 degrees C) on an instant-read or candy thermometer. Remove from heat. Mix in any grease that separated from the mixture, or carefully pour it off.

Description: 
I use this caramel for making diary-free Twix® bars! It has a delicious caramel flavor, and is just as yummy as all those non-vegan alternatives out there. In fact, I'm not vegan, and I prefer it! You could make it a little harder to make caramel candies, or a little runnier for dipping caramel apples.
