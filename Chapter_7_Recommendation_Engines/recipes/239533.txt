Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can water

Directions:
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 6 oblong patties.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Stir golden mushroom soup and water together in a bowl; pour over the patties in the skillet. Turn patties to coat in the liquid. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until steaks are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
These are delicious steaks my mom used to make when I was growing up. They are easy too! They go great with mashed potatoes or white rice and have a flavorful sauce left over, almost like a gravy.
