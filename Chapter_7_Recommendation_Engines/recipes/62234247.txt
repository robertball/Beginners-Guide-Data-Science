Ingredients:
2 1/4 c bisquick
1 T sugar
2/3 c milk
1 T lemon juice

Directions:
Measure bisquick and sugar in bowl.  Slowly add buttermilk and stir/mix as little as possible (just until it comes together).  Turn out onto floured surface and knead VERY briefly - 5 or 6 times - just to bring together.
Pat out flat, fold dough, repat.  Repeat if dough doesn't feel as if it's been overworked (to create layers).
Roll or pat out and cut with biscut cutter or glass dipped in flour.  Don't twist as you cut - just press down and pull away.
If desired, brush top of biscuit with butter or milk before baking.
Bake at 450 for 8 to 10".
