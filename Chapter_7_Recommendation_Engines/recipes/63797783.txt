Ingredients:
One pork sirloin roast (between 2-3 lbs should work)
One bottle Central Market brand Hoisin sauce
1/4 cup or so rice vinegar
Sour Cream Sauce
4 parts sour cream
1 part mayo
Garlic powder to taste
Cayenne pepper to taste
fresh diced jalapenos, without seeds, to taste

Directions:
Put roast in ziplock bag with sauce and vinegar and marinate overnight.
Add all to crock pot in morning and cook on low all day or at least five hours.  Then shred the meat and put back in the crockpot for one or two more hours to let it absorb the sauce.
**For bunko, I used a 16oz. container of sour cream, 4 oz of mayo and 2 jalapenos. Can't say how much garlic power and cayenne pepper I added.  I just kept adding and tasting until I had some zing.  I'm sure the mayo can be left out for those who don't like it.  The sauce will just be a bit thicker.
