Oregano to taste

Directions:
Using Reynolds wrap create a “pan” that is the shape of the bottom of your air fryer, with 2 inch sides.  Spray with non stick cooking spray.
Preheat airfryer to 390 degrees for 15 minutes.
Roll pizza dough into 1 inch balls, and place in a single layer in the pan.
Sprinkle with pepperoni, oregano, red pepper and garlic salt.
Brush with melted butter and sprinkle parmigiana on top.
Place pan in the bottom of the air fryer and cook for 15 minutes.
Sprinkle with mozzarella and cook an additional 2 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly.
To remove from airfryer use two tongs to pull the sides up and out of the machine.  Place on a serving tray.
