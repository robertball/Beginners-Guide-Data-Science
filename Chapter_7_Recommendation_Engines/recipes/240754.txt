Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup egg substitute

1 teaspoon mint extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a baking sheet or plate with waxed paper.
Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula.
Beat confectioners' sugar, egg substitute, and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add melted chocolate and beat until incorporated. Beat mint extract and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture until light and fluffy.
Drop chocolate mixture by the heaping teaspoonful onto prepared baking sheet. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
This recipe was passed on to my mom from her dear friend Erika Brooks who was an amazing cook, baker, and cake decorator in 1984. This recipe is based on the famous FrangoÂ® candy that was sold at the Bon Marche in Seattle, WA. I have substituted other extracts for different flavors. If I want a pretty look, I pipe the chocolate into small candy papers with a pastry tip. The result is a soft smooth chocolate candy.
