Ingredients:
4 lbs. Tomatillos, husks removed
2 Poblano Chiles
2 Large Onions (skin on)
1 Head Garlic
4 T. Cooking Oil
4 lbs. Cubed Lamb
24 oz. Lager
1 T. ground Cumin
3 t. Salt
3 t. Black Pepper
3 Chipotles in Adobo Sauce
Condiments:
Toasted Flaked Almonds
Crumbled Cotija Cheese
Home-made Croutons

Directions:
Preheat broiler on oven to high.  Place Tomatillos, Onions, and Poblanos on a cookie sheet, and place under broiler.  Broil until skins are charred, then rotate all vegetables, and repeat on the other side.  Remove from broiler, and remove the root and outer skin from the onion, and the stem and seed from the chiles.
While veggies are broiling, heat oil on high in a deep-sided saucepan.  Brown Meat on all sides.
Place charred veggies, Lager, Cumin, Salt, Pepper, and chipotles in a blender, until a smooth puree (you might have to do this in batches.)
Place seared meat chunks, and sauce in a slow cooker.  Cook on high for four hours.
Serve with condiments on the side!

Description: 
This Easter, I was unable to find a leg of lamb to roast, as is traditional in my family.  The best I could find was chunks of lamb, in my local Mexican Market.  So I decided to defy tradition, and use the ingredients around me.  
Best Irish-Mexican Easter EVER!
