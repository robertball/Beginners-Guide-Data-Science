Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
8 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
4 large eggs, beaten
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnishing
salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain and return cooked spaghetti to pot. Cover to keep warm.
While pasta cooks, fry bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 to10 minutes.
Remove bacon with a slotted spoon. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings in the pan. Add onion and cook until soft, about  4 minutes. Stir in garlic and continue to cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine; simmer to blend flavors, about 1 minute longer. Stir in cooked bacon.
Pour contents of skillet into pot of cooked and drained spaghetti. Turn heat to lowest setting and toss to heat through. Add beaten eggs, tossing constantly with tongs or large fork until eggs are cooked but not scrambled. Quickly add Parmesan cheese, and toss again. Add salt and pepper to taste (remember that bacon and Parmesan cheese are very salty).
Serve immediately. Garnish with parsley and extra Parmesan cheese.
