3/4 cup coconut flour
10 tablespoons butter, softened
8 teaspoons refined coconut oil
1 teaspoon xanthan gum

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x6-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.
Beat eggs with an electric mixer in a bowl until thoroughly combined, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix in coconut flour, butter, coconut oil, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, and sugar substitute to the beaten eggs; beat until smooth and combined. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
