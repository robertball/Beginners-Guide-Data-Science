Description: 
This is a recipe my husband found and adapted. It is supposed to be good for clearing your sinuses, but we love it as a warm winter treat. Use any hot sauce you like; we have found the fruitier ones taste best. This also makes a great Bloody Mary mix. Serve in mugs, with a stick of celery.
