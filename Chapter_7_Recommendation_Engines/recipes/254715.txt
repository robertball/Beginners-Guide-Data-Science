vegetable oil for frying
8 all-beef hot dogs
8 slices bacon
16 toothpicks

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Pour onions into a small pot over low heat. Stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Arrange fried hot dogs in rolls. Garnish with onions and crushed corn chips.
