Ingredients:
6 ounces spaghetti
2 1/2 quarts boiling water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup cottage cheese
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped tomatoes
6 ounces tomato paste
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook spaghetti in water with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 tablespoon oil until tender but still firm. Drain. Add eggs, Parmesan cheese, and butter. Mix and shape into a crust in a greased 10-inch pie plate or springform pan.
Spread cottage cheese over crust. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the beef, onion, and green pepper until beef is thoroughly browned. Mix in tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and garlic powder. Spread mixture over cottage cheese.
Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and bake 5 to 10 minutes more, until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.
