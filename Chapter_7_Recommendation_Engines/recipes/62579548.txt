Ingredients:
Rustic Potato and Poblano Gratin (serves 4); ingredients: 4 poblano chiles, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter or olive oil, 4 large russet potatoes, peeled and thinly slice, salt to taste, 1/4 lb. jack or sharp cheddar cheese (grated or sliced), 1/2 cup water, 3 cloves garlic (peeled), 1 cup heavy cream or half and half. DIRECTIONS: 1.) Roast chiles by using foil lined baking sheet and broiling them in the oven until skin blisters and turns black. Cool chiles. Carefully peel skins with a paring knife or your fingers then remove seeds and veins. Cut chiles into thin strips. 2.) Melt butter in bottom of slow cooker. Place a layer of sliced potatoes in bottom of slow cooker, sprinkle lightly with salt. Sprinkle with a thin layer of cheese (about 1/3 of called for amount). Place about half of chile strips on top of cheese. Repeat with another layer of potatoes, salt, cheese and chiles. Finish with a layer of potatoes. 3.) Pour the water over the potatoes. Cover and cook on low for about 1 1/2 hours or until potatoes are beginning to get tender. 4.) Using a garlic press, press the garlic into the cream; pour the cream mixture over the potatoes then add a last layer of cheese sprinkled with a bit of salt. 5.) Re-cover and cook for another 3 hours or until the sauce has thickened and the potatoes are quite tender.
