Description: 
The best cookies ever, hands down.
Some of you may remember this recipe from the early days of the internet, when it was widely circulated by email chain, supposedly by a disgruntled customer in Texas who paid $250 for it. 
It makes a lot of cookies, so I would recommend halving it, or having some people in mind to give some away to. 
Enjoy.
