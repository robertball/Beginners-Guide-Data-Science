Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef
2 (1 ounce) packages dry onion soup mix
3 slices white bread
2 tablespoons half-and-half
1 (28 ounce) bottle ketchup
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Remove the crusts from the white bread and tear into small bread crumbs. In a medium size mixing bowl, combine beef, soup mix, white bread crumbs and half-and-half cream. Roll mixture into 1 inch balls and arrange in 9x13 inch baking dishes (as many baking dishes as it takes or bake the meatballs in shifts).
Bake 10 to 15 minutes; or until browned.
In a slow cooker with the temperature set to high, mix together ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Cook until the mixture comes to a boil, then reduce temperature to low until you are ready to serve the meatballs.
Place the meatballs in the sauce and serve.
