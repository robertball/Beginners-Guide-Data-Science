Ingredients:
1 large yellow onion, sliced into thin rings
1 (3 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chili-seasoned diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 cup cold coffee
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced (optional)
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Layer half the onion rings into the bottom of a slow cooker. Place chuck roast on top of onions.
Pour diced tomatoes, beef broth, and coffee into the cooker over the roast; stir in diced green chiles, jalapeno peppers, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Spread remaining onion rings over the mixture.
Cover the cooker and cook on Low until beef is very tender, 6 to 10 hours.
Transfer chuck roast to a bowl and shred meat. Return meat to sauce. Remove onions and serve with meat.

Description: 
This recipe was created for a Cinco De Mayo work potluck taco bar that was a big hit. The coffee in the recipe adds a hint of smokiness and assists with tenderizing the meat as it cooks. Serve with warm tortillas and your favorite toppings. For less heat, omit jalapenos.
