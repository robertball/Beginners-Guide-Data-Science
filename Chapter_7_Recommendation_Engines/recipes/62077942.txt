Ingredients:
4 1/2 c. Sugar
1 can Evaporated Milk
1/4 c. Butter
2 (8 oz) Large Milk Chocolate Candy Bars
2 bags Milk Chocolate Chocolate Chips
1 pint Marshallow Fluff
(opt.)2 c Chopped Nuts

Directions:
In large saucepan, combine butter, sugar and evaporated milk under medium heat. With minimal stirring, boil for 10 minutes. In separate bowl, break chocolate bars into pieces and stir in chocolate chips. After 10 minutes, combine marshallow fluff into sugar mixture, then pour over chocolate. Stir well. Pour into large greased pan. Let set for 4-6 hours.
Hint: If using nuts, let sugar mixture boil for 8 minutes instead of 10. Best to make this fudge in winter time, with less humidity. It sets up better.
