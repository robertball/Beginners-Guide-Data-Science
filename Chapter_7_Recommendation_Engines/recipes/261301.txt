Ingredients:
5 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons dry sherry
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
4 teaspoons canola oil
4 dried red chile peppers, seeded, broken into small pieces
4 green onions cut into 1-inch pieces
2 cups coarsely chopped bok choy cabbage
2 teaspoons grated fresh gingerroot
1/4 cup chopped, unsalted dry-roasted peanuts
1 1/3 cups hot cooked brown rice

Directions:
Stir together 2 teaspoons soy sauce, the sherry, and sesame oil in a bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate at room temperature 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together water, rice vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, and remaining 3 teaspoons soy sauce; set aside.
Heat 2 teaspoons canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir-fry chicken until nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken. Add chile peppers, green onions, and remaining 2 teaspoons canola oil to skillet; stir-fry 1 minute. Add bok choy and ginger; stir-fry 1 minute more. Add chicken and soy sauce mixture; cook until bubbling. Sprinkle with peanuts and serve with rice.
