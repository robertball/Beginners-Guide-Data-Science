Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
1 chicken bouillon cube
1 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
4 tab BUTTER
2 Tab all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped, cooked chicken meat (1 breast)
1 1/2 cups milk, divided
1 Tab more or less dried minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, combine the celery, onions, rice, bouillon, and broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid. Remove from heat and set aside.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter or margarine. Slowly add the flour, stirring often, to make a roux. Add milk 1/2 cup at a time, while constantly stirring. Add this and the chicken to the rice mixture and return the rice mixture to the stovetop over low heat.
If the soup seems too thick, add milk 1/2 cup at a time.  Season with garlic, salt and pepper to taste and allow to simmer for at least an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
