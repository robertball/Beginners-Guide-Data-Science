Ingredients:
2 (7.25 ounce) packages macaroni and cheese mix
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 (16 ounce) jar pizza sauce (such as PregoÂ® Traditional Italian Sauce)
1 (4 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, or to taste
dried oregano, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Add butter, milk, and cheese mix to macaroni; stir until evenly mixed.
Stir eggs into macaroni and cheese until incorporated. Add 1 cup mozzarella cheese; stir until just combined.
Spread macaroni and cheese mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with pasta sauce. Sprinkle the remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese over sauce. Cover the cheese layer with pepperoni and season with oregano.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
