Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups bread crumbs, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil onto the prepared baking sheet; place zucchini slices in the oil. Drizzle 3 more tablespoons olive oil over zucchini slices; season with salt and black pepper. Toss coated zucchini slices with 1 cup bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Toss zucchini slices with remaining 1 cup bread crumbs. Return to oven and bake until zucchini is soft and bread crumbs are lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
These aren't really like French fries because the zucchini really can't become crispy in the oven, but they're still delicious!
