Ingredients:
7 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons salt
2 cups shortening
2 cups cold water
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/2 pound boneless round or chuck steak, cut into 1 inch cubes
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 onions, chopped
1/2 rutabaga, cubed
2 carrots, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup beef stock
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
salt and fresh ground black pepper
3/4 cup butter

Directions:
Combine flour and salt in a large bowl.  Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Stir in water until mixture forms a ball.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line baking sheets with parchment paper or non-stick foil.
In a large bowl, combine all remaining ingredients through salt and pepper.
Divide dough into 12 pieces and shape into balls.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a six inch round, then stretch it to become more of an oval.  Place about 1 cup filling on one half of each.  Dot each with 1 tablespoon butter. Draw the other half of the pastry over the filling and crimp edges to seal.  Prick with a fork, brush the top and sides of each pastie with egg white and place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.

Description: 
A traditional U.P. Michigan pastie is not complete without the addition of rutabaga. I usually whip up a double batch of these so I can put some up in the freezer and pass some out to friends and family.  These are traditionally eaten plain or with ketchup, but we prefer to top them with gravy.  I've also heard of people eating them with steak sauce or barbecue sauce.
