Ingredients:
Servings: 6 people
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 60 minutes
Ingredients:
1.5 lbs ground chuck or beef
2 (1.25 oz) packets chili powder (medium or hot)
1 medium sized potato, cubed
1/2 yellow onion, diced
2 tbsp red chili pepper flakes
5, 6 dried red chili peppers
1 large can tomato, diced
5, 6 garlic cloves, minced
1 (15 oz) can black beans
1 (15 oz) can kidney beans
1, 2 cups water (or beef broth)
salt and pepper to taste
sesame seeds (garnish)
shredded cheese (optional)

Directions:
Brown ground meat in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Cook until brown and add the minced garlic. Discard excess fatty oil either by draining or using a strainer.
After cutting hard vegetables into cubes, add to the pot with water, chili powder, and seasonings like soy sauce and red pepper flakes. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring continuously.
Add remaining ingredients like canned tomatoes and bean varieties; slow boil on low heat for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Serve with rice and/or desired toppings like sesame seeds, diced onions, cheese, or even crackers.
*Instead of using premade chili mix packets (like we do), you can also combine the following ingredients to make your own chili seasoning: chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, and salt.
