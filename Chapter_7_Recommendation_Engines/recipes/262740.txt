Ingredients:
2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup low-fat milk
cooking spray
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1/4 cup pure maple syrup
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup mixed berries

Directions:
Combine oats and milk in a large bowl or measuring cup. Cover and let soak in the refrigerator until much of the milk is absorbed, at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.
Stir egg, maple syrup, oil, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt into the soaked oats until well combined. Spread the mixture into the prepared pan. Top with mixed berries.
Bake the oatmeal until it springs back when touched, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Cut into twelve 2x2-1/2-inch bars. Loosen and remove with a flexible spatula. Serve warm.

Description: 
These baked oatmeal bars could almost pass as cake, but they're way healthier. Loaded with whole grain oats, plus mixed berries and a bit of pure maple syrup to add sweetness without a ton of sugar, they're the perfect grab-and-go breakfast before work or school.
