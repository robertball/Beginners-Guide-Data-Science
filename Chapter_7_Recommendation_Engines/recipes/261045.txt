Ingredients:
1/2 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1/2 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
1 (7 ounce) jar roasted red peppers
1/2 (8 ounce) package buttery round crackers
32 green peppercorns in brine, drained
16 capers
1 rib celery, thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine feta cheese, cream cheese, and milk in a bowl and stir to combine. Press through a fine-mesh sieve, so cheese mixture is very fine. Spoon cheese mixture into a piping back with a round tip.
Pipe a semi-circle of cheese mixture over the top third of each cracker. Cut red peppers into triangles and place into the semi-circle for Santa's hat. Pipe 2 small dots for the eyes and 1 for the nose. Place 1 peppercorn into each 'eye dot' for the pupils and 1 caper into the 'nose dot'. Pipe a beard on the bottom of the cracker and place 2 celery slices, curved side facing down, on top of the beard.

Description: 
I live to serve some cute, non-sweet foods on Christmas day and these little Santa crackers were a big hit last year. Serve them rather soon after making, so the crackers don't get too soggy.
