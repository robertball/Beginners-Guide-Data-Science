Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 1/2 cups 2% milk
2 ounces cream cheese
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons half-and-half
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in flour until a light paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in parsley.
Whisk milk slowly into the saucepan. Bring sauce to a simmer; cook until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and whisk in cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, and half-and-half until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
I wanted to make an Alfredo sauce for a pasta dish, but didn't have a lot on hand (no butter or heavy cream). Here is my hacked version, which is probably a lot less fattening than a classic Alfredo. Play around with it and with what you have on hand. I used this sauce in the Spicy Sausage Alfredo dish I also posted on the site.
