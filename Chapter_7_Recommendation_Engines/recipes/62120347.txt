Ingredients:
12 Corn on cob, whole
5 stalks celery, diced
1/2 medium green pepper, diced
1 small onion, diced
2 tablespoons pimiento, diced
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 teaspoon sugar
black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Turn grill on to direct medium heat. Grill corn until husks are charred on all 4 sides. This will take about 5 minutes per side. Remove corn from gril and allow to cool. Shuck husks and silk from corn cobs.
Cut the corn off the cob. Place a towel under the cob while cutting the corn. This will prevent those runaway kernels. Place corn kernels in a large bowl and add the celery, green pepper, onion and pimiento. Toss ingredients until well combined.
In a small bowl whisk together the vinegar, salt, dijon mustard, sugar and pepper. Add to corn mixture and toss well.
Let set at least 1/2 day before serving. This can be made up to 3 days before. Serve at your next summer party.
