Ingredients:
1 1/4 c. all purpose flour
3/4 c. yellow corn meal
1 ½ Tsp. baking powder
½ Tsp. Kosher salt (regular table/sea salt)
2 lg. eggs
1 1/4 c. 2% milk  or buttermilk (both work beautifully)
1 stick of butter (melted)
1/4 c. chopped peppers (red & green)
1 lg. Jalapeno/Serrano pepper sliced (do not devein)
1/8 c. honey
1/2 c. sugar
½ c. sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Mix together corn meal, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.
Melt butter and add to the mixture followed by the milk and eggs and honey then add the sweet peppers red/green and then the jalapeno (make sure you  don't remove the seeds), in that they hold the heat.
Add cheese and stir to ensure everything has been incorporated and to remove any lumps.
Bake at 350-425 degrees (depending on the oven and altitudes) until golden brown and a toothpick inserted to the center comes out clean.
Enjoy!

Description: 
This homemade cornbread is a wonderful compliment to any southern/creole meal. The red & green pepper not only add color, they add flavor, as does the sharp chedder and honey.  It is especially goes well with my Sensual Soulful Chile recipe.
