Ingredients:
3 pounds boiled potatoes, peeled and cubed
6 boiled eggs, chopped
1/4 cup dill relish
1 cup mayonnaise
Â½ cup yellow mustard

Directions:
Peel and dice potatoes. Add to large pot and top with water. Bring to boil over high heat. When water starts to boil, turn heat down to maintain a boil but not boil over. Cook approximately 10 minutes or until fork tender but not mushy. The cook time will depend largely on the size of the potato cubes.
Alternately, (the way my grandma does it) you may add whole potatoes to the pot, cover, and cook until fork tender but not mushy.
Drain water. If you pre diced your potatoes, add them to a large mixing bowl. If you boiled them whole, let them cool a couple minutes, then while still hot, peel the skins off. Dice the potatoes, then add to a large mixing bowl.
Place eggs in a large saucepan. Cover them with cool water by 1 inch. Slowly bring water to a boil over medium heat; when the water has reached a boil, cover and remove from heat. Let sit 12 minutes.
Transfer eggs to a colander; place under cool running water to stop the cooking.
Peel eggs and dice.
Add mayo, mustard, and relish to potatoes and stir gently. Add eggs and stir gently to combine.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
May be served warm at this point or chilled for a few hours.

Description: 
This is very similar to my grandma's potato salad, if you want to make it just like her, add cooked and crumbled bacon to the top before serving. You may also purchase pre made potato salad.
