Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 smoked turkey leg, meat removed and chopped
1/4 yellow onion, sliced
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 whole cabbage, chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 dash togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey in hot oil until warmed, about 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour chicken broth over the turkey mixture; stir. Bring liquid to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes.
Stir cabbage with the turkey mixture; season with salt, pepper, and togarashi; cook and stir until the cabbage has begun to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and continue to cook until the cabbage is completely tender, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
I hate cooking after work! This can be a great quickie side or main dish depending on your appetite and/or level of laziness. It's also a bit healthier, as I used smoked turkey leg instead of pork. Hope you enjoy!
