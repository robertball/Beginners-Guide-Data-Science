Description: 
This is a delightful early Spring find. Garlic Mustard or Alliaria petiolata is a wild perennial that has a pungent garlicky flavor and taste. The young plants are good in salads, as a trail nibble, in pestos and sauces, and as a seasoning.
This despised invasive plant is actually one of the best and most nutritious common wild foods.
The pungent, mildly bitter, garlic-flavored basal leaves are good from late fall to early spring. 
Below is a basic pesto recipe that is surprisingly savory.
