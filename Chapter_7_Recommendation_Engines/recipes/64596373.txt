Ingredients:
4 oz ( 110g) plain flour
6 oz ( 175g) granulated sugar
3 oz ( 75g)  desiccated coconut (sweetened/unsweetened depending on how sweet your tooth is).
3 oz rolled oats ( quick cook)
3 1/2oz ( 85g) salted butter
1 Tbs golden syrup ( I use Tate and Lyle's)
1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
2 Tbs boiling water

Directions:
Put oven on at 350F or 160C.
Grease a baking tray.
Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl with a fork.
Melt the butter and syrup together in a bowl ( use the microwave for about a minute).
Dissolve the bicarbonate of soda in the boiling water in a small dish. Swish or mix with a spoon to dissolve it all.
Stir the bicarb and water into the melted butter and sugar.
Add this to the dry ingredients and mix well.
Add walnut sized dollops to the baking tray leaving room to expand.
Bake for about 15minutes until golden brown. I usually turn the tray around half way through and pat down the centre of the biscuits.
Leave in the tray to cool for 5-10 minutes then transfer to a cooling rack. Once completely cool transfer to an airtight tin / container.
