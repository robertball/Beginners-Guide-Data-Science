Ingredients:
Cinnamon Roll:
2 cans of Crescent Rolls
1/2 cup White Sugar
1/4 cup Brown Sugar
1 T. Cinnamon
1/4 cup crushed Walnuts
1 Apple, Diced (I use Golden Delicious)
Sauce:
2 sticks of Butter, softened
1 1/2 cup White Sugar
12 oz. Mountian Dew

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Roll one package of crescent dough out on cutting board. Make one single piece of dough by rolling the dough with a rolling pin, makes a 9x 13 almost (make sure the seams don't seperate). Do the same thing with the other package of dough and set one dough sheet on top of the other to make a double crust.
Mix the white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, crushed walnuts, and diced apples in a bowl. Sprinkle evenly over the dough (reserve the extra sugar mixture if there is any.
Roll the dough length wise so you end up with a long tube. Cut into 1 inch slices. Place the rolls into a greased 9x13 dish face up.
In a sauce pan over med high heat, melt the butter and sugar mix until sugar dissolves. Add any reserved sugar mix from rolls if you had any. Once sugar is dissolved take the pan off the heat and whisk in Mountain Dew. Pour mixture over the cinnamon rolls.
Bake for 30 min. Once it comes out the oven and cools for a few minutes, flip the pan upside down on a cookie sheet and let all the gooey-ness drip down onto the rolls.
Top with whip cream!! :)
