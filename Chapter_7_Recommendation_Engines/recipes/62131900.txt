Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 pounds of red new potatoes
Either 2 large or 3 medium heads garlic
About three large sprigs fresh rosemary (to taste)
1 stick butter
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup good white or blush wine
salt and fresh ground pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Wash and dry potatoes. Cube them into 1 inch pieces and place in a large roasting pan. Cut the tops (the pointy part, about 3/4 of an inch) off of the garlic heads, leaving the head whole. Nestle the heads, cut side up, in between the potato cubes. Cut butter into pieces, dot the potatoes and garlic with cut butter. Pull rosemary leaves off of stems and coarsely chop, sprinkle chopped leaves over potatoes. Drizzle the potatoes with the olive oil and wine, salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. Bake, uncovered, in a 400 degree oven for about 45 minutes, until golden and the top of potatoes are crispy and the garlic is soft when squeezed. Can also be cooked over a grill, loosely covered with foil, for about 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
This wonderful dish is great for a cookout, I've even made it while camping, cooked over a charcoal grill. Squeeze the roasted cloves of garlic over your potatoes, or on crusty buttered chunks of french bread. A taste sensation!
