Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 egg white
1 cup white sugar
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries

Directions:
Prepare the cake according to package instructions for three 8 inch round cake pans. Bake as directed on the package. Cool on wire rack.
To make the Frosting:  In a large bowl, beat the egg white, sugar and strawberries on high speed until very stiff peaks form.  This takes about 20 minutes.  The frosting really grows so be sure you use a large bowl.
To assemble the cake:  Place one layer on a serving plate, put in a couple toothpicks (this helps to hold the layers together) and frost with 1/4 of the frosting. Repeat with second layer. Place third layer on top, and frost top and sides of cake with the remaining frosting.

Description: 
This is a great easy cake that my grand mother made for every family memeber's birthday. It's a pretty pink color and is light and fluffy. Garnish with additional sliced fresh strawberries if desired.
