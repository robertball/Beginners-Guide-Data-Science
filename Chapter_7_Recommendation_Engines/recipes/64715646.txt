Ingredients:
1 pound country sausage
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 large jalapeno, seeded and diced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 10 ounce can diced tomatoes with green chilies
1 12 ounce can light beer
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
2 cups shredded monterey jack cheese

Directions:
1. Crumble sausage in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Drain.
2. Set the Instant Pot to the saute setting and add olive oil, onion, and jalapeno.
3. Cook for 3 minutes. Add chili powder and cumin and cook 2 additional minutes.
4. Stir in sausage, tomatoes, and beer. Secure the lid, seal, and set the manual setting for 5 minutes.
5. Let it release naturally for 5 minutes and then do a quick release. Carefully remove the lid.
6. Add cheeses and whisk vigorously until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
7. Cook's note: If you are not serving immediately, you can use the keep warm setting but you will need to stir it every 20 minutes to keep the cheese from clumping.
