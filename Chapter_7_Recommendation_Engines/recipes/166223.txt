Ingredients:
For Satays:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch by 2-inch strips
1 cup low sodium teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 package wooden skewers (6-inch long)
Salt and black pepper to taste
1 12-inch sheet aluminum foil
For Sauce:
1/2 (15 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Black Beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 (15.8 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Great Northern Beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup frozen shelled soybeans, thawed and ready to eat
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon minced ginger
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 chopped Serrano chile (optional)
2 teaspoons sesame oil

Directions:
For the Satays: Season chicken with salt and pepper. Combine teriyaki sauce, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil in a medium bowl.
Toss the marinade with the chicken. Let marinate for 45 minutes minimum. Weave meat onto skewers. Discard marinade.
Cooking: Preheat the grill to medium hot. Take a 12-inch sheet of heavy duty foil, fold in thirds lengthwise. Place on the grill by the edge.
Place satays on the grill laying meat end over fire, and the wood end on the piece of foil. This will help keep the exposed wood from burning.
For the Sauce: Combine beans, soybeans, green onions, ginger and cilantro into a medium bowl. Mix well.
In a small bowl, combine sugar, lime juice, and soy sauce.
Mix until the sugar dissolves. Add garlic, chile, and sesame oil. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Add soy sauce mixture to the beans, gently toss to coat.
Serve the satays with bean salad. Drizzle some of the liquid from the salad on top of the satays.
