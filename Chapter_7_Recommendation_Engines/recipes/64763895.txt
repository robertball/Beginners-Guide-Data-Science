Ingredients:
2 organic lemons, 3 if very small
2 Tbsp multi colored peppercorns
1/4 tsp dehydrated (dried) garlic
1/4 tsp dehydrated (dried) onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200° f. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Wash and dry the lemons. Using a vegetable peeler, peel away the zest from both lemons making sure not to get any if the pith.
Spread out the peels in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. Bake in oven for about 30 minutes or until the peels have curled up and dried. Allow to cool inside the turned off oven, using a wooden spoon to prop the door open so any moisture can escape. For about 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely before proceeding to the next step.
Put the dried lemon peels and peppercorns in a food processor fitted with a blade. Blend until course. Add dehydrated garlic and onion. Blend until fine and thoroughly combined.
Allow to rest for a few hours before using to allow the flavors to meld. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
Cook's Note: You can dehydrate your own garlic and onion or purchase “dried” versions at your local grocery store.
