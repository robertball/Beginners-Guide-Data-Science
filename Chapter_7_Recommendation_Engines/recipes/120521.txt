Ingredients:
2 teaspoons coarsely ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 bone-in center cut pork chops (1 inch thick)
2 medium onions, thinly sliced
2 medium tart apples, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the pepper, salt and garlic powder. Rub over pork chops. Grill chops, covered, over medium heat for 7-9 minutes on each side or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and juices run clear.
Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onions and apples in butter until tender. Add brown sugar; cook until thickened and bubbly. Serve with the pork chops.
