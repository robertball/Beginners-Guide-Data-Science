Ingredients:
1.5 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups rolled buckwheat flakes
1 tsp cinnamon, or to taste
1/4 cup flax seeds, raw
1/3 cup butter
1/8 tsp baking soda
2 tablespoons honey
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp madagascar vanilla
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/3 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add buckwheat flakes and flax seeds then cook and stir until starting to brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and spread out on the lined baking sheet to cool.
Toast the sliced almonds in the same pan. Once browned add them to the baking sheet with the buckwheat.
Melt the butter in the same pan over medium heat. Stir in the honey, cinnamon, baking soda, vanilla, and brown sugar; cook, stirring constantly, until bubbly. Return the buckwheat mixture to the pan. Cook and stir until all is well combined and well coated, about 3 minutes. Add cranberries and toss to coat. Pour out onto the cookie sheet and spread to cool.
Once cool, break apart into clusters and transfer to an airtight container.
