Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins
3 tablespoons rum
2/3 cup whipping cream
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 eggs
3/4 cup chopped toasted pecans

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper.
Combine the raisins and rum in a small bowl; set aside to soak.
Heat the whipping cream in a small pot over medium-low heat until hot, but do not allow to boil. Remove from heat and stir the chocolate chips into the hot cream until completely melted. Set aside to cool.
Sift the flour, brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon together into a bowl. Beat the eggs into the flour mixture individually; mix gently. Stir the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture until incorporated. Fold the raisins, any remaining rum, and the pecans into the batter; spread into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
These brownies are more on the cakey side, but very moist regardless. The rum does an amazing job bringing out the flavor of raisins. Serve with a scoop of rum-raisin ice cream!
