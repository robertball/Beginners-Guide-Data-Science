1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

1/4 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
2 teaspoons orange extract
1 cup whipping cream, whipped
2 teaspoons grated orange peel
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin orange sections, drained and patted dry

Directions:
Combine crust ingredients and press into the bottom of a 9-in. pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F for 6-8 minute or until lightly browned. Cool.
