Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained and juice reserved
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce, drained and juice reserved
1 1/2 cups water, or as needed
2 (3 ounce) packages raspberry-flavored gelatin mix (such as Jell-O速)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese at room temperature
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 cup frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip速), thawed
1 tart apple, peeled and finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip速), thawed - or to taste

Directions:
Pour juice from crushed pineapple and cranberry sauce in a measuring cup and add enough water to equal 2 cups of liquid; bring to a boil in a saucepan. Remove from heat and dissolve raspberry gelatin in the liquid. Pour gelatin into a bowl and refrigerate until partly set, about 45 minutes.
Beat cream cheese with mayonnaise in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy; gradually beat partially set gelatin into cream cheese mixture. Gently fold 1 cup whipped topping into the mixture. Stir crushed pineapple, cranberry sauce, apple, and walnuts into gelatin mixture. Transfer to a serving bowl and refrigerate until set, about 4 hours. Serve frosted with 1/2 cup whipped topping, or as desired.

Description: 
This is my favorite Thanksgiving dish! The sweetness is a nice contrast to the saltiness of the turkey. The walnuts and apples give a nice texture, but make sure they are chopped small enough. The mayo seems like a strange addition, but you don't taste it, and it improves the texture of the cream cheese. Enjoy!
