1 pastry for a 9-inch pie crust
1 pound sweet potatoes, boiled and mashed
1 cup white sugar

1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
She tasted the first sweet potato pie, 'This is too grainy! Like mashed potatoes in a pie crust.' She tasted the second pie, 'This is too plain, like pumpkin pie, only less so.'  She tasted the third pie 'Ahh, this is just right. Strong sweet-potato flavor, but still a nice texture. Yum. Yum. Yum.'
