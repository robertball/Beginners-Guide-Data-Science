Ingredients:
4 4- to 5-ounce fresh or frozen skinless catfish or white-fleshed fish fillets, 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick
1 tablespoon lemon or lime juice
1 teaspoon Famous Dave's Rib Rub, lemon-pepper seasoning, Jamaican jerk seasoning or Cajun seasoning
4  round hard rolls, hoagie buns, Kaiser rolls or, other crusty rolls, split and toasted

Directions:
Thaw fish, if frozen. Rinse fish; pat dry with paper towels. Brush fish with lemon juice. Sprinkle desired seasoning evenly over all sides of fish.
Place fish in a greased grill basket, tucking under any thin edges. (Or, grill fish on the greased rack of the grill.) For a charcoal grill, place grill basket on the rack of an uncovered grill directly over medium coals and grill until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork (allow 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch thickness of fish), turning basket once halfway through grilling. (For a gas grill, preheat grill on high for 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Place grill basket on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as above.)
Remove fish from grill basket. Serve fillets on buns. Makes 4 servings.
