Ingredients:
Carrot cake:
1 3/4 cups grated carrots
3/4 cup almond flour
2/3 cup flour
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup butter
4 eggs
2 tablespoons Maille® Old Style mustard
5 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons chopped walnuts
3 tablespoons white dried raisins
Lemon zest
Orange zest
Lime zest
1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh grated ginger
10 coriander grains ground with a mortar
Icing:
1 egg white
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
Orange zest

Directions:
Carrot cake: Mix the butter and the crushed walnuts in a sauce pan and warm slightly until butter softens. Set aside. Beat the sugar and the eggs with a mixer until it starts forming bubbles. In another bowl, mix the almond flour, baking powder, salt and flour. Blend with egg and sugar mixture until no lumps remain. Add the butter mixture, grated carrots, Maille(R) Old Style mustard, crushed walnuts, raisins, citrus fruit zests, cinnamon, ginger and chopped grains of coriander and mix everything carefully together. Divide mixture into small silicone cooking molds.
Cook in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 minutes (depending on the size of the cake molds). Once cooked, remove the cakes from the molds and let them cool down all the way.
Icing: Mix all the ingredients together. Cover the mini carrot cakes with icing and let them harden for 2 hours in the open air.
