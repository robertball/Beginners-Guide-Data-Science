Bake 10 to 12 min. or until golden brown; cool slightly. Remove to wire racks; cool completely.
Meanwhile, beat pudding mix and milk in medium bowl with whisk 2 min. Stir in COOL WHIP; spoon into resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate until tart shells are cooled.
Cut off one bottom of corner of filling bag; use to fill tart shells. Top with berries just before serving.
