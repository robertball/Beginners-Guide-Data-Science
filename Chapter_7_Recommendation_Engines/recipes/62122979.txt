Ingredients:
1 large onion - chopped
4 garlic cloves - minced
2 TBS canola oil
3 - 15oz. cans of black beans - undrained
2 cups of smoked ham - cubed
6 cups chicken broth
28 oz whole tomatoes - undrained
1/2 cup loosely packed cilantro
1 TBS oregano
1 tsp cumin
2- 3 tsp adobo seasoning
1 tsp chipotle pepper

Directions:
Put the cumin, chipotle and adobo spices in the bottom of a large soup pot and stir on medium high for a few minutes until fragrant.  (Be careful not to burn the spices.)
Saute the onions and garlic with the spices in the oil until tender.
Add the tomatoes, beans, ham, broth and oregano.  Bring to a boil for 3 minutes and then turn down to a simmer for 1/2 hour.
Strain the soup with a large bowl underneath and RESERVE THE LIQUID.
Blend 2 cups of the solid ingredients with a little of the reserved liquid and then pour back into the pot.  Then blend another 2 cups and so on until it is all blended.  Do not be tempted to do it all at the same time!
After it is all blended, add back the reserved liquid and mix everything together.   Garnish with a sprig of cilantro and serve with some good bread.

Description: 
This soup explodes with flavor from all sides and the first time I made it I was fairly inexperienced in the kitchen and the heat from it literally blew the top off the blender so make sure that you are careful with that step!  This soup will freeze beautifully too.
