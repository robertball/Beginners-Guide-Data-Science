CREAM OF CELERY SOUP Recipe

Ingredients:
1 bunch celery (about 6 cups)
1 sweet yellow onion
1 cup coconut milk (or other non-dairy milk)
2 cups water (or broth)
1/2 teaspoon dill
pinch of sea salt

Directions:
Dice celery and onion.
Add all ingredients into an Instapot. Seal lid, and then press the “Soup” button. (Or if making on the stove top simmer ingredients together for 30 minutes)
The “Soup” setting will run for 30 minutes and then automatically go into “keep warm mode” for a few hours (which is so nice if you are busy knitting on the couch and don’t feel like getting up just yet!)
After Instapot has depressurized, remove lid, and then very carefully blend soup using an immersion blender. Keep immersion blender submerged to avoid hot soup splattering. Blend until creamy. (Or you can transfer to a blender in small batches to puree. Just be extra careful and have the lid slightly open so steam can escape. You can let the soup cool down first for safer blending.)
You could also do this in the VitaMix. Just put all ingredients in the jar and let run on high for 6-7 minutes, or until everything is cooked and steaming hot.
