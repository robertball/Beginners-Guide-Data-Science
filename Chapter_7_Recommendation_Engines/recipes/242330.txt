Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 ripe bananas
6 eggs
1/4 cup coconut sugar, and more for topping
1 teaspoon alcohol-free vanilla extract
1/3 cup sunflower seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or line with parchment paper.
Combine coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mash bananas in a separate bowl; whisk in eggs. Stir coconut sugar and vanilla extract into banana mixture; stir into coconut flour mixture using a wooden spoon, folding until batter is combined. Spoon batter into the baking dish; top with sunflower seeds and extra coconut sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool bread in the refrigerator, about 20 minutes. Store in refrigerator.
