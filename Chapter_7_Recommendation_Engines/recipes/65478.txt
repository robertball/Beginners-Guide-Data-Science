Ingredients:
1 cup thousand island salad dressing
1 cup pineapple-apricot preserves
¼ cup grated onion
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
½ teaspoon cinnamon
1  whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces, washed and patted dry
4 large potatoes - peeled and halved lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a bowl, stir together the thousand island salad dressing, pineapple-apricot preserves, grated onion, dry onion soup mix, and cinnamon until well blended. Place chicken in a large, oiled baking dish. Arrange potato halves around the edges of the pan, fitting chicken and potatoes tightly together in a single layer. Brush sauce over chicken, coating completely. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and remove foil. Continue baking 15 minutes more, or until potatoes are fork-tender and chicken is no longer pink in center. Both should have a beautiful golden brown glaze.

Description: 
Not your same old chicken, this recipe has a slight twist & shake to it from its unusual sauce. Serve with green vegetables for a complete meal in one. Mmm Mmm good!
