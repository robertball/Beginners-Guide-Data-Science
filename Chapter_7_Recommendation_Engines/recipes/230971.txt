Ingredients:
2 cups heavy whipping cream
2 cups half-and-half
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons instant coffee granules

Directions:
Mix heavy cream, half-and-half, sweetened condensed milk, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl; stir in coffee granules until dissolved. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until softly frozen. Transfer ice cream to a lidded container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours to overnight.
