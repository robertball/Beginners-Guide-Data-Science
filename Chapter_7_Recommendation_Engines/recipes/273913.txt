Ingredients:
1 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella®)
1/2 cup peanut butter chips
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
Combine chocolate hazelnut-spread, peanut butter chips, flour, egg, and brown sugar in a mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Place dough in the freezer for 10 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to firm up, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet until the cookies are set, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Stuff your face with deliciousness! I made these for a friend's birthday party and they were a huge hit. There were only four of us and they were gone in seconds! For a different taste, sprinkle salt over cookies when cooled.
