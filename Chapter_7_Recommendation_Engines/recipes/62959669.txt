Ingredients:
Small onion, diced
1/2 T olive oil
1 1/2 cup rinsed golden lentils
5 cups vegetable or chicken broth
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 T cr√©ole seasoning salt
1/2 T curry powder
3 T heavy cream
Cilantro or flat parsley leaves for garnish
juice of one lemon

Directions:
In a soup pot, saute the onion in olive oil until translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
Add the rinsed lentils and broth, bring to a boil, and turn back to simmer for about 30 minutes.
During this time, slice the mushrooms and saute in olive oil. Dice the tomatoes. Reserve about 1/4 cup of cooked mushrooms for garnish.
At the end of 30 minutes, add the mushrooms, tomatoes and spices to the lentils. Cook for another 10-15 minutes to blend the flavors. The lentils should be very cooked and the soup thickened. Correct the texture with additional broth if necessary.
Add the lemon juice and heavy cream and blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
Serve in flat bowls with reserved mushrooms and cilatro or parsley leaves as garnish on the top.

I'm trying to find ways of getting teenagers to have good lowfat high protein meals. The sauteed mushrooms steal the show, complementing the milder taste of golden lentils.
