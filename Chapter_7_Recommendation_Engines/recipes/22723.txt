Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon butter
1 small onion, minced
1 strip celery, minced
1 pound fresh crabmeat
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups milk
5 slices day-old bread
3 eggs, beaten
3 cups dry bread crumbs
oil for frying

Directions:
Place one egg in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and celery until the onions are translucent; remove and let cool.  In a mixing bowl combine the cooled onion mixture with crabmeat. Mix thoroughly. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Remove crab mixture from refrigerator and add hard cooked egg and Worcestershire sauce.
Pour milk into a separate bowl. Dip the bread slices, one at a time, quickly into the milk and squeeze most of it out. Add soaked bread to the crab mixture. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until firm.
In a wide shallow bowl, beat the 3 eggs. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Remove crab mixture from refrigerator, shape into hamburger shaped patties. Dip each one into the beaten egg and then into the bread crumbs, coating well.
In a medium skillet, heat canola oil over medium heat and fry crab cakes until they are a nice  golden brown.
