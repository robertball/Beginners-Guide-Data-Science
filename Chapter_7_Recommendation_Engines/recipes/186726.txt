Ingredients:
¼ cup butter
3 tablespoons minced shallot
½ cup dry white wine
½ cup heavy cream
½ cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
salt to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the shallot; cook until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 3 minutes. Pour in the wine, cream, chicken broth, and lemon juice. Simmer until the liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rosemary, season to taste with salt.

Description: 
A light, nice sauce that is a perfect addition to Parmesan chicken instead of the typical marinara sauce.  Also goes nicely over garlic mashed potatoes.
