Ingredients:
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°)
1 cup warm 2% milk (110° to 115°)
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons sugar
1 egg yolk
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
4 to 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 egg white
2 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt or kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried minced onion
1 teaspoon each sesame, caraway and poppy seeds

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add milk, butter, sugar, egg yolk, salt and 2 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough into thirds. Shape each into a 20-in. rope. Place ropes on a large greased baking sheet and braid; pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350°. Combine egg white and water; brush over dough. Combine salt, onion and seeds; sprinkle over bread. Bake 22-28 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool.
