Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds new potatoes, cut into wedges
4 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons fresh rosemary
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a hot skillet, melt the butter. Stir in rosemary, salt and pepper. Coat potatoes evenly with the melted butter. Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking pan.
Bake in a preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown, approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Toss them occasionally to ensure that they brown on all sides.

Description: 
Simple, yet delicious! These potatoes, when young, are so good by themselves they don't need anything else.  This would be great as a breakfast side dish.
