Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
1 large onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 28oz cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 15oz can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
2 cups water (can also substitute beef broth or red wine)
1/2 cup fancy molasses, more to taste
2 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp cumin powder
1 tbsp crushed oregano
1 tbsp ground black pepper
1 1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Heat oil in the base of a good sized soup/stock pot set on medium-high. Brown the ground beef until cooked through. Add onions and garlic, cook until onions become translucent.
Add the beans, molasses and spices, stirring to mix evenly. Add tomatoes and liquid plus water. turn down to a simmer, and allow it to cook on low heat for at least two hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it's allowed to cook, the better the flavor.

I came up with this recipe while working as the chef in a small local cafe. It was a hit, and acclaimed more than once as the best chili in town!
