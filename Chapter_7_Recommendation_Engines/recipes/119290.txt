Ingredients:
3 cups honey graham cereal
1 cup miniature pretzels
1 cup salted peanuts
1 cup pecan halves
1 (10 ounce) package vanilla or white chips

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the cereal, pretzels and nuts; set aside.  In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the chips at 70% power for 1 minute; stir. Microwave 30-45 seconds longer or until chips are melted; stir until smooth. Immediately pour over the cereal mixture and toss to coat evenly. Spread on waxed paper-lined baking sheets to cool; bread into pieces.
