½  onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Place the orzo in a small bowl. Pour enough beer into  the bowl to cover the orzo; set the remaining beer aside.
Heat the oil in a large, non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Drain the fat from the skillet and lower heat to medium. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onions are translucent.
Pour in the orzo mixture, the rest of the beer, chicken broth, tomato sauce, pimentos, and turmeric; cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the peas; simmer another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
