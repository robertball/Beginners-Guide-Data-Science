Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
6-10 Baby Red Potatoes washed - cut into halves - with or without skin
***Or baked potato washed/cut with a few baby reds - this gives them a chunkier texture (which I prefer)
1/4-1/2 cup Almond Milk - unsweetened (any non-dairy milk will do)
1-2 Tablespoons melted Soy-Free Earth Balance (or whichever non-dairy butter you prefer)
1 lemon
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional or to taste)
1-3 teaspoons minced garlic (I used jarred)

Directions:
Boil water - add potatoes...boil until potatoes are done/fall apart with a fork
Drain water
Place potatoes in a medium-large deep bowl
Beat slightly, then add salt, almond milk, melted butter, garlic, juice of 1/2 squeezed lemon or more to taste
Beat until desired consistency (I prefer chunky - with skin)

Description: 
I recently have gone vegan - which I LOVE - but I missed one of my favorite things - mashed potatoes! I decided to create my own simple, vegan/soy free for the un-chef - ME:-) So here it is - a nice base recipe.
