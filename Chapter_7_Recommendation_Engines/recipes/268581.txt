Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed in the refrigerator
1 (14 ounce) jar pasta sauce, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)
1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Gather all of your ingredients and a cookie sheet; you'll have to work quickly once the puff pastry is out of the fridge.
Melt butter in a microwave-safe bowl; stir in Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.
Remove 1 sheet puff pastry from fridge. Keep the other sheet chilled. Very gently unfold the sheet onto your work surface. Press pastry back together if it cracks. Slice into 6 squares and place them 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart on the cookie sheet. Brush the edges of each square with some of the garlic butter. Add a spoonful of sauce to the center of each square. Top with some Italian cheese, mushrooms, and bacon.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and golden, about 15 minutes.
In the meantime, repeat slicing, brushing, and topping the second sheet of puff pastry. Bake second batch for 15 minutes.

My daughter loves these puff pastry pizzas. You can use them as a meal or as an appetizer. The best part is you can add whatever you want to make them special.
