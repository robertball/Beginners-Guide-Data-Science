Ingredients:
3 medium red onions, halved and thinly sliced
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half lengthwise
3 (1/8 inch thick) slices fresh ginger
3/4 teaspoon multicolored peppercorns
1 cup water
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1 cup distilled white vinegar
3 tablespoons real maple syrup
3 teaspoons kosher salt

Directions:
Divide sliced onions, garlic halves, ginger slices, and peppercorns among 3 pint-sized jars.
Combine water, apple cider vinegar, distilled vinegar, maple syrup, and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and ladle vinegar mixture into each jar. Gently press down on onions with a spoon until they are submerged. Allow to sit, uncovered, until liquid is room temperature, about 30 minutes, then cover and store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
These pickled red onions are simple to make. Add them to pasta or potato salads or use them on top of burgers, fish tacos, or pizza. Don't toss the pickling liquid--it's great in vinaigrettes or other recipes that call for vinegar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
