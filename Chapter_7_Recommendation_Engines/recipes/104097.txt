1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/3 cup chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes

2 (16 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
Salt
Monterey Jack or Cheddar Cheese
Sour Cream

Directions:
Heat oil over medium heat in a large pan. Add onions, peppers, and all spices except salt. Cook until vegetables are soft.
Increase heat to medium-high and add beef, breaking up and stirring until it loses its pink color.
Add beans, tomato products, and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for an hour, stirring occasionally. Simmer uncovered for another hour, stirring occasionally.
Cover the bottom of the bowls with cheese to create the Super Bowl. Add chili and top with sour cream in the style of laces for that added football flavor.
