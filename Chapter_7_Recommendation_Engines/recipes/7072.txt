Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 1/2 tablespoons lard
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup raisins
3 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order suggested by the manufacture
Select the Basic or White Bread setting. There is no need to select Fruit Bread setting, nor to add the raisins in later. Start the machine. After first knead, bread should be smooth, elastic, and dry to touch. Adjust if necessary with additional flour.
After baking, remove pan immediately. Rest for 10 minutes in the pan. Remove bread from the pan, and cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before serving.
