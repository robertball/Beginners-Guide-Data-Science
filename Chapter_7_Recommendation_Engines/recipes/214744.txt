Ingredients:
1/4 (8 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped pimentos
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the angel hair pasta in boiling water until the pasta has cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pimentos, lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, 1 tablespoon parsley, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder to the oil and stir; cook until the herbs are heated and fragrant. Stir the Parmesan cheese into the mixture. Add the pasta to the skillet and toss to evenly coat with the seasonings. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with remaining parsley, and serve hot.

Description: 
Angel hair pasta cooked and served with essentially a hot pasta salad dressing and cheese. I came up with this recipe as I could not find anything to eat, so I went through my spice cabinet and refrigerator, found these ingredients and threw them together. Serve with fresh chopped tomato.
