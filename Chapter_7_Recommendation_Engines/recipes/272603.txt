Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
2 cups coconut water
1 teaspoon salt
2 limes, juiced, divided
1/2 cup shredded carrots
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 lime, quartered

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 1-quart covered baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in jasmine rice and cook until slightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in coconut water. Season with salt. Mix in juice of 1 lime. Reduce to a simmer and stir occasionally until liquid begins to be absorbed, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until the coconut water is completely absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Remove the cover and add carrots, green onions, cilantro, and remaining lime juice. Fluff with a fork; cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with lime wedges.
