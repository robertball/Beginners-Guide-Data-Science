Ingredients:
1 cup chicken, cooked and diced/shredded
1 small can green chilies
1 small can mushrooms, drained
2 pieces of bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 cup cheddar cheese (or montery/pepperjack)
4 flour tortillas

Directions:
Saute chicken, chilies, mushrooms, and bacon just until warmed through.
Preheat pan or grill.
Prepare tortillas by spreading a little butter on the outsides
Place a tortilla, butter side down and add chicken, mushrooms, bacon and then the cheese but DO NOT OVERFILL. Place the other tortilla on top, butter side up.
Flip (carefully) once bottom side is golden and do the same to the remaining side.
Serve with honey/mustard sauce, sour cream, and salsa if desired.
