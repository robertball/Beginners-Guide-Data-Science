Ingredients:
2 egg whites
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup corn syrup
2 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine the egg whites, sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt in the top of a double boiler over water that is at a hard boil.  Start beating right away with a beater until the mixture stands in stiff peaks.  Remove from heat and add vanilla or your favorite flavoring and keep beating until it is thick enough to spread easily.
