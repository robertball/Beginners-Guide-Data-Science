Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups chopped onions
pinch sea salt
ancho chili powder
unsweetened cocoa
2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into small cubes
3 tablespoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
2 teaspoon diced jalapeno
1 28 ounce can diced or crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 cups beef stock
2 cups beer
2 teaspoons dark molasses

Directions:
In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions and saute until the vegetables start to wilt, 3 to 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt, ancho, and cocoa.
Stir in the stew meat, chili powder, cumin, crushed red pepper, and oregano. Brown the meat for 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and jalapeno and saute for 2 more minutes, then stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, beef stock, and beans. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the liquid, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the beef is tender, 1 to 1 1/2. Cover and cook another 1/2 hour.
