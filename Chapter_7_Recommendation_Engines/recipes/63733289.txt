Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
2 tbsp. olive oil
1-1/2 lbs . ground turkey
1 28 0z, tin tomatoes, pureed
1 can kidney beans rinsed and drained
1 can of tomato soup
I can of Ro-tel
2-3 tbs. of chili powder
1 teaspoon  rubbed cumin seeds, or ground cumin

Directions:
Heat olive oil in large pot. Add chopped onion and saut√© for a few mins til soft. Add ground turkey and cook thoroughly. Add pureed tomatoes, beans, soup and Ro-tel. Stir everything together. Stir in chili powder and cumin. Simmer for at least 30 mins. Chili will be ready in 30 mins, but can be simmered for as long as you like. The longer it is simmered the thicker it will be and will also be more flavourful. I serve this over rice, or with tortilla chips, or on its own with crusty bread.
