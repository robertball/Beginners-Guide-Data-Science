Ingredients:
1 package prepared cornbread (2 cups cornmeal mix, 1 egg, 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup veg oil, salt)
1 stick butter
2 onions, chopped
6 stalks celery, chopped
1 loaf white bread
2 teaspoons dried sage
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup parsley flakes
2 eggs
1 can Cream of Chicken soup
1 large can chicken in water (use all)
3 +/- cups chicken stock

Directions:
Two days before the event, prepare corn bread as directed on package. Cool, and crumble, leave out to dry along with the loaf of white bread.
The day of, melt butter in a large skillet (I use my cast iron skillet) over medium heat. Cook onions and celery in butter until tender, but not brown.
Place corn bread and bread slices in a food processor. Pulse until they turn into a crumbly mixture. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Season with sage, thyme, poultry seasoning, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper. Mix in cooked vegetables, soup, chicken and eggs. Stir in chicken stock until the mixture is a bit mushy (may or may not take the entire 3 cups). Transfer to a 9x13 inch pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.
