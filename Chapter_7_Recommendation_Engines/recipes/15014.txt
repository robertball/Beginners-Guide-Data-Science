Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf sandwich bread
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pound bacon, cut in half

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Cut the crusts off of the bread slices, then cut each piece of bread into three equal rectangles.
In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, garlic powder, and parsley. Spread a layer of the cream cheese mixture on each bread rectangle, and roll it up. Wrap a slice of bacon around each of the bread rolls and secure them with  toothpicks.  Arrange the roll ups on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake until the bacon is crisp, approximately 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great, easy hot appetizer. Pepperidge FarmÂ® sandwich bread works great with this recipe, as it's square and firm. I make these ahead, freeze them on a cookie sheet, store them in a freezer bag, then cook them as I need them. Wonderful if friends drop by during the holidays!
