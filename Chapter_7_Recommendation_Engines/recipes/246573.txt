Ingredients:
Curry Paste:
3 shallots, coarsely chopped
2 red chile peppers, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
Beef Rendang:
1 3/4 pounds cubed beef stew meat
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons coconut oil
3/4 cup water
1/2 (14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream
1 cube beef bouillon
1/2 lime, zested

Directions:
Combine shallots, chile peppers, peanut butter, turmeric, garlic, and ginger in a food processor or blender; blend into a thick paste.
Season beef with salt and pepper.
Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook beef in batches until browned, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a bowl.
Fry curry paste in the same skillet until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Return beef to the skillet. Add water, coconut cream, beef bouillon cube, and lime zest, stirring well to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently, partially covered, until sauce coats the beef and beef is tender, about 3 hours.
