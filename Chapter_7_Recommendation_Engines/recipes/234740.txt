Ingredients:
1/2 yellow onion, diced small
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 head cauliflower, cut into large florets
1/2 red bell pepper, diced small
1/2 cup grape tomatoes, halved
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir onion and lemon juice together in a bowl; let rest until onion flavor mellows, about 30 minutes. Drain onion, reserving lemon juice.
Shred cauliflower in a food processor until it is the size of small rice grains.
Place cauliflower in a skillet over medium heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is steamed, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the lid and stir red bell pepper and grape tomatoes into cauliflower; cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add onion and mint to cauliflower mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.
Whisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons reserved lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour lemon juice mixture over cauliflower mixture and toss to coat. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

Description: 
This way of cooking cauliflower is an excellent substitute for most rice dishes for those looking to add more veggies and cut back on grain. Cauliflower is mild and is a great compliment to the Mediterranean flavors of lemon and mint. The recipe is both SCD and paleo diet-friendly. We served this underneath grilled lamb kabobs. It was a big hit!
