Ingredients:
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  Campbell's® Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup
1 cup water
2 cups Pace® Picante Sauce
1 16 oz. can red kidney beans, drained
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp each salt and pepper
1 1/4 cups uncooked regular long-grain white rice
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes (or just use chicken tenders)
1 tsp. lime juice (fresh or bottled)
1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped
10 flour tortillas (10-inch)

Directions:
Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then put in a large ziplock bag.  Sprinkle the lime juice, cumin, garlic powder, salt and pepper into the bag, zip the bag tight, and shake to coat chicken well.  Let sit for 5 minutes.
Stir the soup, water, picante sauce, kidney beans, rice and chicken in a 4-quart slow cooker.
Cover and cook on LOW for 5-6 hours or until chicken is cooked through.
Stir cilantro into crockpot just before serving.
Spoon about 1 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold the tortilla around the filling.
