Ingredients:
1 cup flour
3/4 cup quick oats
2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar plus
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar, divided
1/3 cup oat bran
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup low-fat cream cheese
1 cup peeled, chopped peaches, divided
1 cup skim milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 egg
1/3 cup toasted, chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray 12 muffin tins with non-stick cooking spray. Combine dry ingredients in a medium bowl, reserving 1 tablespoon brown sugar; mix well and set aside. Stir together cream cheese and the reserved 1 tablespoon brown sugar. When well blended, fold in 1/4 cup peaches. Add milk, oil, vanilla and egg to dry ingredients, mixing just until dry ingredients are moistened. Lightly stir in remaining peaches and walnuts. Spoon 3/4 of the mixture into prepared muffin tins. Place a teaspoonful of the cream cheese mixture in the center of each then spoon remaining batter over the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
