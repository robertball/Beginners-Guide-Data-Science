Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
1 cup of fat free sour cream
1 cup of salsa (strained)
2 tbsp of taco seasoning
2 stalks of green onion finely diced
1 cup of shredded cheddar/mozzarella cheese
Optional: sour cream and green onions to garnish after cooking

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F
Put the potatoes on a baking sheet and cook for 1 hour.
Remove potatoes and let cool for 5-10 minutes.
Cut them in half and spoon out the insides into a bowl leaving a thin layer to help the potatoes keep their shape.
Add the sour cream, salsa, green onions, taco seasoning and 3/4 of the cheese to the potato insides.
Mix well and then spoon the mixture back into the potato skins.
Top with remaining cheese and cook for 25 minutes with the last few minutes on broil.
Serve with sour cream and green onions on top.
