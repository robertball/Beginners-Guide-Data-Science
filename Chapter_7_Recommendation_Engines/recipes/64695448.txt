Directions:
In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil on medium-high heat adding potatoes and diced onions and any salt and pepper to taste.
Fry potatoes and onions, stirring frequently until potatoes brown and onion translucent ( approx. 10-12 minutes).
In a separate large skillet cook on medium-high heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown sliced sausage links for approximately 5 minutes.

Description: 
Who doesn't love a great sausage dish.  This is quick, easy and family friendly. Use colorful bell peppers to make this dish pop. Being a Texan, I do love my heat index and use lots of spices (and I will also add jalapenos to most anything I cook FYI). I use HOT spiced sausage but please be aware of you heat index always. Just as a post note if you do have any leftovers....this combo mixed with a egg scramble in the morning also fantastic...Don't forget that cup-of-java with leftovers.
