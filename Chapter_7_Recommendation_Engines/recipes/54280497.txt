Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour - 1/3 cup
3 lemons, juiced 1/2 - 2/3 cup
Confectioners sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour, salt and 1/2 cup sugar.  Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan or smaller for thicker bars.  Add 5 minutes extra bake time if smaller pan is used.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/12 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour.   Add zest of 2 lemons to dry ingredients.  Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.
Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar.  Store in refrigerator.
For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring . After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.
