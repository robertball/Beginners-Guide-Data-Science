Description: 
This is a quick and easy family favorite that is asked for at home and at potlucks and parties. What makes this recipe so good is the endless ways that you can season it. It's also easily converted for a very large amount. I have made it for as little as my husband and I all the way to a group of 80 for my son's engagement party. Use Greek, Old BayÂ®, seasoned salt, garlic powder - endless possibilities.
