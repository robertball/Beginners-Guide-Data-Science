Ingredients:
3 ripe bananas, mashed
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs, beaten
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Stir the bananas and vinegar together in a bowl, and set aside. Cream the sugar and butter together in a large bowl until creamy and smooth, then beat in the eggs. Stir in the reserved banana mixture. In a separate bowl, stir the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together until the mixture is free of lumps. Mix the flour mixture into the butter-sugar mixture until well blended, and stir in the chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. Spread the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool in pan about 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.

Description: 
I got this recipe from one of my aunts, who got it from an old woman she met in Hawaii while stationed there.  It is hands-down the very best banana bread I've ever tasted!!  No extra buttering required ;)
