Ingredients:
For the cake:
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 3 large eggs
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 (8ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 2 cups ripe bananas mashed
For the filling:
* 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 2 cups confectioners sugar

Directions:
For the cake: Grease three 9-ich cake pans generously and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, salt, sugars and spices) together in a large bowl, add eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until completely incorporated.  Add oil and stir gently until batter is smooth and ribbon-like. Add vanilla, pineapple, pecans, and banana, mixing until evenly distributed. Pour batter into prepared cake pans and bake, remembering to rotate cakes halfway through, until edges are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
For the frosting: Using a handheld electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl at medium speed until smooth. Turning  the mixer to low, slowly and steadily add powdered sugar, beating until frosting is light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla with a wooden spoon. Once cake has cooled, spread cream cheese frosting between layers and on top and sides of cake. The cake can be stored in an airtight container in therefrigertor for up to five days.
