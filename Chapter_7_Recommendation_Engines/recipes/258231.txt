Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons Buffalo wing sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 loaf rustic baguette, cut into 1-inch thick slices
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk eggs, milk, Buffalo sauce, and salt together in a shallow bowl. Soak bread in the egg mixture until completely absorbed, at least 30 minutes.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat until it starts to foam. Arrange soaked bread in the melted butter; sprinkle Parmesan cheese over bread, patting it into the holes of the bread. Fry until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and sprinkle more Parmesan cheese on second side. Cook until bottoms are browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip again and cook until cheese is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
