Ingredients:
1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon minced ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Combine green beans and water in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Add ginger, garlic, and sesame oil; cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.
Mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Pour over beans and cook until sauce thickens enough to coat beans, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I modified this recipe to be less oily. It is almost as good as take-out Chinese green beans. It tastes wonderful with ham and a baked yam.
