Ingredients:
1 cup of sprouts (not the flossy kind the chow mein sized)
1 TB butter
1 T of vegetarian oyster sauce

Directions:
It's 1 cup of sprouts per person. Once they cook down they don't look as bunchy and or voluminous. I think I used 2 cups for me - but I like it. Put the bean sprouts in the frying pan on high to medium high. Add the butter and it should melt quickly. The sprouts should cook quickly aswell and just when you start to see a hint of brown on the sprouts and they start to go limp add a tablespoon of the vegetarian oyster sauce. It's that simple. It's that quick. It tastes the same as chow mein without all the extra vegetables. You can add more if you like but it makes the cook time longer. For simple sprouts it's a winner and it tastes great.

Description: 
I didn't think Chow Mein or the main ingredient was so easy to cook. I just happened to buy bean sprouts and some vegetarian oyster sauce and I had chow mein in 5 minutes. (cooked bean sprouts) It's a fast easy side dish without all the extras of looking exotic.
