Ingredients:
1 slice bacon, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1/4 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/2 cup tomato sauce
1 teaspoon browning sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes
2 (14 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
3 1/2 cups water
2 cups white rice

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large saucepan over medium heat until the grease begins to render. Stir in the onion, bell pepper, and thyme; cook until the onion is nearly translucent. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the tomato sauce, browning sauce, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes; stir; simmer another 3 minutes. Add the corn; simmer another 3 minutes. Slowly pour the water into the mixture while stirring. Raise the heat to high and stir in the rice; bring to a boil; cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the rice has absorbed all the moisture, about 30 minutes; fluff with a fork to serve.
