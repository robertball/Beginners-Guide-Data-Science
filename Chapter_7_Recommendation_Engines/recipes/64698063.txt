Ingredients:
1 (12 oz) package al fresco® Sweet & Smoky BBQ Chicken Sausage, sliced on the bias 1/4" thick
2 tablespoons olive oil, extra virgin
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 jalapeno, finely diced (I doubled this!)
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper, ground
3 1/2 cups cooked brown rice (I used 2 pouches of Uncle Ben's Ready-rice Brown rice)
1 cup black beans, canned, rinsed and drained
1 cup pinto beans, canned, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup chicken broth, low sodium
1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a 12" skillet over medium high heat. Saute onion, garlic, jalapeno and red pepper for 3-4 minutes.
Add chicken sausage slices to the skillet and sauté for an additional 2 minutes. Stir in the cumin, salt and pepper, cook 1 minute.
Cook rice as directed.  Add the cooked brown rice, black & pinto beans, toss with a spoon. Pour in the chicken broth, sprinkle in the cilantro. Cook for 5 minutes or until the rice and beans are heated through.

Description: 
This recipe was from the Al Fresco website. It's delicious--I altered the recipe slightly and added more jalapeno pepper because we like it HOT.  Even without the extra heat, it's got a nice kick!  I also approximated the amount of beans--slightly less than a can of each.
