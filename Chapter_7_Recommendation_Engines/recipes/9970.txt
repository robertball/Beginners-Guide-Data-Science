Ingredients:
5 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 egg whites
1 cup super fine sugar
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Coat baking sheet  with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
In bowl of an electric  mixer, combine  egg whites and sugar; beat on medium speed for about 30 seconds.  Add flour and salt; beat until mixed.
Add butter, heavy cream and almond extract; beat until mixed.
Pour 1 tablespoon batter onto half the baking sheet.  Spread with  a spoon into a thin 5 inch circle;  repeat on other half of sheet.  Bake until edges turn golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Place baking sheet on a heat-resistant surface.  Working quickly, slide a spatula under one cookie. Lift and place  on a dish towel.  Fold cookie in half, pinching at top to form loose semicircle.  Insert index fingers into ends; press indentation into center of cookie while bending ends together to form shape of a fortune cookie.  This should  take about 10 seconds.  Once the cookie hardens, you  cannot fold it.  Repeat with other cookies.      Write your message on long strips of sturdy art paper, and  thread through cooled cookie.
