Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
2 cups all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
1/3 cup olive oil
1 pound applewood smoke bacon from Trader Joe's, chopped
1 onion, chopped
4 cloves crushed garlic
3 tablespoon tomato paste (or enough to coat rice)
2 cups white rice
1 (6.5 ounce) can minced clams
2 cups frozen green peas
1-2 tsp saffron
5 cups boiling chicken broth
1 pound small shrimp - peeled and deveined

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Dredge the chicken in flour and salt and pepper. In a large skillet, fry the chicken in 1/4 cup olive oil until brown and crispy.  Set aside.
Place 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet  and fry onion and garlic until onions are tender. Add chopped tomatoes and saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Add rice to the skillet and mix well.  This glazes the rice.
Put rice mixture, chicken, and bacon in large covered casserole dish.  Add can of clams, peas,  saffron, chicken broth and shrimp. Cover casserole dish.
Bake until all the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.  You may need to add more broth if rice is not done.  Check every 20 mins and add chicken broth if rice isn't done.
Arrange clams and mussels on top of rice and bake for another 10 minutes. Before serving, discard any clams  that do not open.
