Description: 
I have been making and eating zucchini blossoms for as long as I can remember. My nana would make sure my grandfather picked them as soon as they were perfect! As a little girl we would fill them with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, but I am going to share a delicious paleo recipe for you to enjoy.
