Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs shredded slow cooker pork meat (leftover from previous meal)
1 15 ounce can zesty refried beans
4 burrito size flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
1/2 small white onion, diced (or 4 green onions, sliced)
1 10 ounce can red enchilada sauce (we prefer medium heat)

Directions:
Heat the oven to 375 degrees.  Heat the pork meat in a microwave oven about 3 minutes- enough to get the meat warm.  Heat the refried beans in a pan. Place equal amounts (about 4 TBS) of refried bean mixture in the lower third of each tortilla and spread out lengthwise to within an inch of the sides.  The bean mixture should be about the width of a tablespoon.  Then place equal amounts of meat on top of the beans. Roll each tortilla up burrito style and place on a cookie sheet. Top each burrito with enchilada sauce and sprinkle with cheese and diced onion.  Bake burritos for 20 minutes to heat through and melt the cheese.

Description: 
After making a few pounds of slow cooker pork (recipe on this site), I use the leftover meat to make burritos.  They're great and very easy to make for a week night dinner.
