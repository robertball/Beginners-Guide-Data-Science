Ingredients:
large loaf of artisan bread, your choice
bag of baby spinach
olive oil
crushed garlic
grilled sirloin tips
gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Cut bread loaf in half, brush with olive oil and crushed garlic. Broil until crispy. Layer bread with baby spinach leaves, thinly sliced grilled tips (I grill them rare, since they'll be cooked again), and gorgonzola cheese. Broil again until cheese melts. Slice into small portions, serve hot.
Can also be made with chicken and feta swapped for the beef and gorgonzola.
