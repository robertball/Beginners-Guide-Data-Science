Ingredients:
3 ½ cups apples - peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped
2 cups white sugar
½ cup water
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup margarine, melted
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons hot water
1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the apples and sugar. Let stand about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 10x15 inch baking pans.
Stir the water into the bowl with apples. Blend eggs and margarine in a small bowl, and mix with the apples. Mix in the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in the raisins and walnuts. Transfer to the prepared pans.
Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool slightly before turning out of pans.
In a medium bowl, blend confectioners' sugar, hot water, and vanilla extract. Drizzle over the cakes while still warm.
