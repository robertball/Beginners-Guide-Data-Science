Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3 cups canned pumpkin
4 eggs, slightly beaten
Frosting:
1 lb powdered sugar
1 8-oz package cream cheese, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1/2 cup chopped raisins, optional

Directions:
Blend together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt at medium speed of mixer until well mixed.
Add oil and continue to beat until dry ingredients are moistened.
Add pumpkin and mix again until well blended.
Add slightly beaten eggs and blend one minute longer.  Do not overmix.
Turn batter into three lightly greased, paper-lined 9" cake pans.  Smooth batter out in pan with spatula so it will be level when baked.
Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  Cool.
Mix together powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, and butter until smooth.  Add raisins, if desired.  Frost the cake.
