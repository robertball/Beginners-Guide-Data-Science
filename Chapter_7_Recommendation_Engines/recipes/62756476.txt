Ingredients:
1/2 c coriander seed
12 - 14 whole dry red chili
1/2 T cumin seed
1/2 T peppercorns
1/2 T fenugreek seed
1/2 T urad dal
1/2 T moong dal
1/2 T channa dal
2 T ground turmeric

Directions:
Dry roast whole spices (except chilis) in a frying pan over Med-high heat for about 5 mins.  Add the dry chilies and continue to stir for about another min.  Remove and put aside.
Dry roast dals for about another 6 to 8 mins.  Remove, turn heat off, and set aside.
Add turmeric to the pan, still hot, but with stove burner turned off.  Dry fry for about a minute or two, till it starts to lose the raw odor it normally has.  Set aside SEPARATELY from the whole spices and dals.
Let everything cool COMPLETELY.  When cool, grind all the whole spices and dals to a fine powder in a coffee grinder.
Add the turmeric, mix thoroughly, and put in a tightly sealed container (glass jars work best).
