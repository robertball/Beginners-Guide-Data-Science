Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package corkscrew-shaped pasta (fusilli)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup toasted pine nuts
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups grape tomatoes, quartered
1 (8 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, cubed
4 stalks celery, diced
1/2 sweet onion, diced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta water; drain pasta, rinse in cold water, and return to the pot. Stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.
Combine basil, parsley, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until combined. Add toasted pine nuts and lemon juice and pulse until well combined. Add Parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup olive oil while processor is running; blend well. Season pesto with salt and pepper.
Place pasta into a large mixing bowl and stir in pesto. Add 1/4 cup reserved pasta water to thin slightly and continue to mix until pasta is thoroughly coated; add more pasta water as needed. Mix tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, celery, and onion into the salad until well combined.
Refrigerate for 1 hour to allow flavors to blend together, or eat right away.
