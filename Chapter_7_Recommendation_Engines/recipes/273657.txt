Ingredients:
1 pound chicken breast tenderloins, cut into thin strips
¼ cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon ginger puree
1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
¼ cup brown sugar
½ cup soy sauce
4  green onions, chopped

Directions:
Place chicken strips and cornstarch in a large resealable plastic bag. Shake to coat.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown on the outside and juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Whisk together garlic, ginger puree, Sriracha, sesame oil, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Add mixture to the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes.
Return chicken to the skillet. Add green onions and toss to coat. Cook over medium-high until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
If Mongolian beef is your go to when it comes to Chinese take-out, I challenge you to try this version made with chicken instead. The chicken is melt-in-your-mouth tender and requires no marinating time as beef would. Serve over rice.
