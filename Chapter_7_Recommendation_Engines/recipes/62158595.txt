Ingredients:
1 5 pound rib roast
olive oil
2 Tablespoons Kosher salt
1 Tablespoon fresh black pepper(about 30 turns on a peppermill)
1 Tablespoon Italian Herb seasoning
2 Teaspoons granulated or powdered garlic

Directions:
Bring meat up to room temperature for an hour.  Rub oil all over the meat. Mix remaining ingredients and rub liberally over the meat.  Cook in a 225 degree oven till temperature reaches 120 degrees-about 3 hours.  Remove and tent with foil till the temperature rises another 10-12 degrees.  Turn the oven up to 500 degrees.  Return the roast to the oven and cook another 10-15 minutes until well browned.  Remove and loosely cover for 30 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
I call it backwards because of the way you cook it.  It ends up evenly pink throughout and very juicy.  If you age your beef in the refrigerator wrapped in cheese cloth for at least 4 days, the flavor will be even more enhanced.
