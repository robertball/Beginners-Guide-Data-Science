Ingredients:
Non-stick cooking spray
2 cups All-purpose Flour
2/3 cup Sugar, plus additional for sprinkling
1 tsp Baking Powder
1 tsp Baking Soda
1/2 tsp Salt
1 cup Nonfat Greek Yogurt
2 Large Eggs, lightly beaten
4 Tbsp Unsalted Butter, melted and slightly cooled
Grated Zest of 2 Lemons
1 tsp Vanilla Extract
1/4 tsp Lemon Extract, optional
1 cup Blueberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom and long sides of a 9x5 metal bread pan with aluminum foil, and spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray.
Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together the yogurt, eggs, melted butter, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and lemon extract in a small bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and stir gently until just combined. The batter will be extremely thick.
Sprinkle the blueberries with flour (a teaspoon or two), and toss to coat. This helps prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread. Fold the blueberries into the batter. If any flour settled on the bottom of the bowl after tossing the blueberries, take care to avoid transferring the excess flour to the batter.
Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, and lightly sprinkle the top with sugar. Bake for 55-65 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean. If your loaf starts getting too brown, tent it with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking.

Description: 
One of my favorite cakes is a blueberry lemon cake, so I decided to make a healthier version so that I don't feel too guilty. Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt or a scoop of Vanilla ice cream.
