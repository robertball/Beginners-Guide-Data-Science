Description: 
The combination of chili powder, cumin, mace, cinnamon and red pepper flakes give this recipe its sensual kick, but the semi-sweet chocolate and dark larger beer and tequila gives it that umph..needed only for the Grown & Sexy

Makes about 12 or more large servings and can be placed in the freezer for upto 3 weeks..if there is some left over! You can even make it ahead of time. This recipe can be made milder simply by leaving out the chiles and pepper flakes. Keep in mind the chiles, chocolate, and spices are the aphrodisacs that tantilize the palate for a more fruitful evening.
