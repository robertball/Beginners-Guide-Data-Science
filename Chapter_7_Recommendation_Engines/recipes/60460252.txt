Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 tablespoon white sugar,
1 tablespoon brown sugar,
1.5 tsp cinnamon,
1/2 tsp nut meg.
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1.5 cup flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/5 tsp. nutmeg
3/4 cup melted butter
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  If you use a 9x12 pan you need to double the recipe.
mix  1 Tbsp. sugar,  1 Tbsp. brown sugar, 1.5 tsp.cinnamon,  .5 tsp nut meg. Mix with apples and place in bare pan
For topping the trick is to not over melt the butter. Just soften the butter. Wisk 1 egg, 1.5 cups flour, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/5 tsp nutmeg. Mix these altogether. Since the topping is not pourable just a large clump at a time of topping and then spread as evenly as possible over apples. It will spread out perfectly while baking. Bake at same temperature and time or until golden brown. The top comes out crispy.
Bake in preheated oven until the apples have cooked and the topping is golden brown, about 40 to 45 minutes
