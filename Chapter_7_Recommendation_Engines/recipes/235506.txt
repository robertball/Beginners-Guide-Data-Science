Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup almonds
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon light corn syrup

Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; add almonds, sugar, and syrup. Cook and stir the almonds until the mixture turns caramel in color, about 6 minutes.
Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet in a thin layer. Cool until the mixture hardens and break into pieces to serve.
