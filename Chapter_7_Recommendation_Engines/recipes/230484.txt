Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup rice wine vinegar
1/3 cup minced garlic
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 pound round steak, thinly sliced
1/4 cup peanut oil
2 cups 1-inch sliced asparagus
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 bunch green onions, chopped into 1-inch pieces
1 cup whole cashews
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)
1 tablespoon water (optional)
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, sugar, rice wine vinegar, garlic, and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add beef, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal bag. Marinate beef in the refrigerator overnight.
Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir beef and marinade until beef is well-browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in asparagus, mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and green onions; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cashews and 1 tablespoon sesame seeds; continue cooking until vegetables are tender, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into beef stir fry until sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sesame seeds.

Description: 
Very good stir-fry. A little on the sweet side. Cook in a large wok on medium-high heat. Marinating overnight is good, but not necessary.
