Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved
5 teaspoons all-purpose flour, divided
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
2 eggs
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup apple juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. In a shallow bowl, combine 4 tablespoons flour, Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. In another bowl, beat the eggs. Dip chicken into eggs; coat with flour mixture.
In a large skillet, cook chicken in 1 tablespoon butter and oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. Remove and keep warm.
In a small bowl, combine the remaining flour, salt and pepper; stir in broth until smooth. Add apple juice to the skillet, stirring to loosen any browned bits. Stir broth mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1-2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly.
Stir in lemon juice; cook for 1 minute. Add parsley and remaining butter; cook and stir until butter is melted. Serve over chicken.
