Ingredients:
4 cups dry white wine
2 1/4 cups apple juice
1 lemon, zest cut off in a spiral
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, sliced
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cinnamon stick
6 tablespoons rum

Directions:
Combine white wine, apple juice, lemon zest, ginger, sugar, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan over medium-low heat and slowly heat, but do not boil. Keep hot on low heat without simmering for 1 hour to infuse the wine.
Strain hot mulled wine through a small sieve into heatproof glasses. Add 1 tablespoon rum to each glass.

Description: 
I prefer to make mulled wine with white wine because I think it gives a smoother flavor. This recipe has a little rum added at the end for a bit of a kick!
