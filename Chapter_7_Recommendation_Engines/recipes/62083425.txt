3 ripe bananas (broken into 2 inch pieces)
1/4 C cream or milk

1. Heat butter in 10 or 12 inch skillet over med heat.
2. While pan is heating, place all remaining ingredients in a blender and blend for 30 seconds.
3.  When butter is melted and begins to brown, pour mixture into prepared pan.
4.  Cook over med heat while gently lifting the edges for liquid to run underneath.  When eggs are mostly set, use spatula to cut into pieces and flip them over.  Cook until all eggs are set and no runny mixture remains.  Some water may separate out, but be careful not to overcook the eggs.
