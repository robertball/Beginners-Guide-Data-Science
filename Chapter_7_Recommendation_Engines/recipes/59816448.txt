Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree (or 2 cups)
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 7x3 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, mix together pumpkin puree, eggs, oil, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  Fold the dry ingredients into the pumpkin mixture until just blended. Pour into the prepared pans.
Bake for about 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Loaves are done when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.

Description: 
I find that most baking recipes have too much sugar in them, and you are able to reduce the amount without sacrificing any of the flavor. I cut the sugar by a third in the original recipe and replaced half of the white sugar with brown. Use pumpkin pie spice in place of the four individual spices.Modified from: Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread
