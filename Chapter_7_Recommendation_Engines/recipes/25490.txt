Description: 
This is a delicious twist to broccoli, rice, and cheese casserole, and is VERY easy to make. You can also cut this in half. I use the 1 can cream of mushroom soup when I make half.  You can also leave out the onion. It just gives it a little added flavor, but is still very good without it.
