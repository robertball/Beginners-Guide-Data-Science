Ingredients:
cake layers:
1 1/2 c. semisweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 c. butter
2 1/4 c. sugar
9 eggs
1 1/2 c. cocoa
Filling:
3/4 c. rum, divided
1 jar apricot jam

Directions:
preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line two jelly roll pans (or two ten inch springforms) with parchment paper and spray with cooking spray.  In a saucepan, melt together butter and chocolate chips over very low heat until smooth.  Remove from heat; whisk in sugar.  Add eggs and mix well.  Sift cocoa powder into mixture and mix until just combined.  Pour batter into two pans.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the top has formed a thin crust.  (I bake mine in a convection oven, so yours may need to cook a little longer.)  As soon as the cakes comes out of the oven, brush rum over the tops until completely covered.  The tops of the cakes will look soft and wet.  Now, mix the remained rum with the apricot jam.  When cakes are completely cool, spread one cake with the apricot mixture.  Place the remaining cake layer on top of the other and remove parchment paper.  When serving, sprinkle powdered sugar over cut cake.  Or dollop a generous amount of sweetened whipped cream over each piece.

Description: 
This torte is very very rich!  And very very chocolatey!  You may choose to halve the recipe in order to just have a one layer cake.
