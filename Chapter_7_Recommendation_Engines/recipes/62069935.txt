Ingredients:
2 yellow squashes, sliced into 1/4 inch thick rounds
2 zucchinis, sliced into 1/4 inch rounds
3 tbs olive oil
1/2 tbs dried parsely (or 2 tbs fresh chopped)
1/2 tbs cilantro (or 1 tbs fresh chopped)
1/2 tsp ground paprika
dash (or more) ground cayanne pepper
salt to taste
optional:
sliced tomatoes
anything on the spice rack (I sometimes add thyme, and sage is in more or less every meal I cook)

Directions:
Slice the zucchini and yellow squash, and heat the oil in a skillet (medium heat with my skillets and range).  Add the spices to the skillet, and add the zucchini and squash in a single layer.
Flip the squash and zucchini after a couple minutes, but don't allow them to become too limp.  Sprinkle with salt if desired, and serve piping hot.

Description: 
This recipe began when I was trapped in my apartment by a snowstorm (with limited groceries), and has become one of my favorite side dishes.  It's very flavorful and filling enough to be a quick and easy lunch (at least for a college student).

I nearly always cook this as a side dish for my herbed salmon recipe.
