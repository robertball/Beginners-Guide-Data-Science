Ingredients:
2 pounds baby romaine lettuce
1 large ripe avocado, sliced
1 cup chopped ripe mango
1 cup fresh blueberries
1/4 chopped sun-dried tomatoes, rehydrated in 1/4 cup hot water
1/4 cup minced red onion
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons salted butter
3/4 pound large shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil and vinegar salad dressing (such as Newman's OwnÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Combine lettuce, avocado, mango, blueberries, sun-dried tomatoes, and onion in a large bowl.
Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over high heat until starting to brown and lightly smoking. Add shrimp. Cook until shrimp are lightly browned and cooked through, rotating often, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lemon juice and pepper at the last minute. Cook until most of the liquid is gone, about 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Add enough dressing to the lettuce mixture to moisten the ingredients. Plate salad and add shrimp on top.
