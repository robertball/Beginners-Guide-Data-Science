Ingredients:
4 Mission® Kid Size Flour Tortillas with Edible Disney® Tortilla Decals
4 tablespoons marinara sauce
1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded

Directions:
Spread 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce on two tortillas. Then sprinkle with 1/2  cup shredded cheese and 1/2 cup pepperoni.
Optional: Instead of pepperoni, add 1/2 cup sliced veggies (mushrooms, black olives), sliced or 1/2 cup cooked chicken, chopped.
Place other two tortillas on top and press down slightly.

Remove from skillet and allow pizza quesadilla to cool slightly.
Cut each pizza quesadilla into quarters.
Place Edible Disney(R)Decals on Tortillas and enjoy (instructions on back of Mission Kid Size Tortilla package).
