Ingredients:
1 pack FIRM tofu-not silk brand-I hear it doesn't bake well.
Low sodium soy sauce- about 1/2 cup
1 inch piece of fresh ginger-grated fine
1 medium yellow onion -sliced
1 large green bell pepper- cut into chunks
2 small zucchini- cut into pieces
6 small mushrooms-cut into pieces
2 tablespoons roasted peanuts-crushed a bit
Sauce-
1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 heaping tablespoon HOT chili sauce

Directions:
cut tofu into 1/4 inch pieces-one block will get 3 slices. Then lay down tofu on paper towels and top with more towels- put a heavy object on top to PRESS out water. Then in a large dish mix soy sauce and grated ginger- place tofu in mixture to marinate it. 15 min each side. Next lay tofu on baking sheet with parchment paper and bake for 40 minutes (flip over at 20 min mark) at 350 degrees.
In Wok or large saute pan heat 1 teaspoon canola oil. Add onion and bell pepper- cook until onions are slightly translucent. I prefer my veggies a little crisp still- so you can cook them as much as you like. Add zucchini & mushrooms- stir until veggies are cooked to your liking. Add in sauce and tofu-mix to coat veggies. We enjoyed this over brown rice
