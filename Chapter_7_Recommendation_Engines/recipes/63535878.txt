Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over a medium low heat, add the pancetta and, stirring often, cook for some 3 to 4 minutes or so until the pancetta is browning but not crispy;
Add the leeks and, stirring occasionally, cook for some 10 minutes or so or until softened a bit;
Increase heat to medium, add the mushrooms and season with pepper;
Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the water the mushrooms release, has evaporated;

When pasta is cooked “al dente”, drain and add it and the cheese to the sauce;
Toss until the pasta is well coated with the sauce and cheese;
