Ingredients:
3 pounds country style pork ribs
1 1/2 cups bottled barbeque sauce

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 baking dish, place the country spare ribs.  coat evenly in the 1 1/2 cups of BBQ sauce.  cover tightly with foil.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the dish for 2 hours 45 minutes.  Do not disturb while it is cooking.
Remove from the oven and place on a stable work surface.  Let it rest, unopened, for 15 minutes.  Using two forks, shred the pork right in the very liquid sauce, pulling out any large chunks of fat.  Once the meat is shreded, stir the meat gently to evenly distribute the pan juices.  Serve on hearty buns with additional bottled sauce and hot sauce for added flavor, if desired.

Description: 
This classic southern BBQ has been simplfied to the point that you can make it without a thought!  We love it with coleslaw and pickles.  Cheap burger buns turn to glue in the sauce- a more substantial bun is a better choice.Modified from: BBQ Pork for Sandwiches
