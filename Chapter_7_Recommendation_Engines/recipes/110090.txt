Ingredients:
3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks
1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, with skin
2 cups chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
2 bunches fresh parsley, finely chopped
3/4 cup sun-dried tomato and oregano salad dressing
3/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Soak the cedar planks in water for several hours or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Brush the planks with olive oil.
Cut the salmon fillet into three portions. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle parsley and sun-dried tomatoes over the top. Drizzle with salad dressing.
Place the planks on the preheated grill and let them heat up for about 5 minutes. Place the salmon fillets on the planks. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Fish is done when it can be flaked with a fork. Remove quickly to avoid over cooking and drying out the fish. Serve piping hot.
