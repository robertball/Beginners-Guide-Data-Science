Directions:
In a small bowl, combine Mayonnaise and Miracle Whip.  Mix together well.  This will be the dressing for salad. Set aside.
In a large bowl, layer all ingredients, except the dressing mixture and Swiss cheese.  You should press down after adding the lettuce and again after adding the spinach.
Spread dressing evenly over the top of the salad.
Sprinkle Swiss cheese evenly on top of the dressing.

Description: 
This colorful salad is very festive looking when made in a glass bowl.  I wind up making at least one or two during the holiday season.
