Ingredients:
1 (14.75 ounce) can salmon
1 egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 small onion, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or more as needed

Directions:
Pour salmon juice into a small bowl or measuring cup. Place salmon in a mixing bowl; clean off skin and bones.
Use your fingers or a fork to flake the salmon. Add egg and mix well; add flour and stir to combine. Add onion, bell pepper, and black pepper. Mix well.
Add baking powder to the salmon juice; beat with a fork until foamy. Pour into the salmon mixture and fold together. Form into thumb-sized croquettes.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook croquettes in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes per batch.

I got this recipe from a former coworker who happened to be the best cook on this planet. Hope you enjoy the recipe as much as I do. Those croquettes taste wonderful on a mixed salad.
