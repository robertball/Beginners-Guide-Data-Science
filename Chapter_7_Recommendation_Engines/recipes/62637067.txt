Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 1/2 cups sugar
6 eggs
1/2 cup whipping cream
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla

Directions:
Let the butter and eggs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating 1 minute after each addition. Beat whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add the flour and cream alternately to the egg mixture; beat just until combined after each addition. Beat in vanilla.
Pour batter into a greased 10-inch tube pan.
Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 hours 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Remove cake from pan and cool thoroughly on wire rack.
(Whipped cream substitute: 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup butter. Use amount required for recipe. Do this only for baking since this doesn't whip up like regular whipping cream.).

Description: 
This is so moist and tasty! One of the best plain cakes I've ever had! I like to add spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and/or allspice when the mood hits. A little fresh lemon juice doesn't hurt either!
