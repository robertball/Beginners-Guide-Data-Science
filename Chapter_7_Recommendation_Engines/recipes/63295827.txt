Ingredients:
52 Keebler Club Crackers (about a 1/2 a package)
1 bag (8 ounces) toffee bits
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped toasted natural almonds
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup butter
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon coarse salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.  Place club crackers in a single layer on sheet, edges touching.  Sprinkle toffee bits and almonds over crackers.
In a small saucepan, bring sugar, butter and salt to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat and cook at a rapid simmer, swirling pan occasionally, until mixture is syrupy, 2 minutes.  Immediately pour over crackers.  Bake until sugar topping is bubbling, 12 minutes.  Remove from oven and immediately sprinkle chocolate chips and salt over crackers.  Let cool on a baking sheet on a wire rack.  Using a sharp knife cut into 2-inch squares
