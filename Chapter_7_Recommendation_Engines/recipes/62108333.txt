Ingredients:
3 large	Vidalia or other sweet onion, sliced thin
6 cups	Beef broth
4 tbsps	Sweet butter
Â¼ cup each Marsala cooking wine and either red or burgundy cooking wine
2 tbsps	Worcestershire sauce
1 cup each shredded mozzarella cheese and shredded Swiss cheese
12 thin slices dry French bread
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat.
Add onions, cover and cook until soft.  Raise heat to medium and brown onions.  Reduce heat again to low and add wines and Worcestershire sauce and cook until wine is mostly absorbed, stirring occasionally.
Add broth and salt & pepper and simmer another 10 minutes.
Pour soup evenly into 6 soup crocks that have been placed on a baking sheet.  Place 2 slices of French bread on top of each bowl and allow to stand about 5 minutes or until bread is soaked through.
Mix cheeses together and top each bowl evenly with cheese mix. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes.   Broil for 2-3 minutes or until cheese browns.  Serve immediately
