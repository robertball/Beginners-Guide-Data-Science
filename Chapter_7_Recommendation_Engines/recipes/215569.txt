Ingredients:
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup peeled and sliced watermelon rind
1 red bell pepper, sliced thin
1 cup vegetable broth, divided
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch

Directions:
Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat until the oil just begins to smoke; cook and stir the onion, garlic, and salt in the hot oil until the onions are translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir the watermelon rind, red bell pepper, and about half the vegetable broth into the onion mixture. Reduce heat to low. Place a cover over the skillet and simmer the mixture for 5 minutes.
Whisk the remaining vegetable broth, the teriyaki sauce, and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into the mixture in the skillet and cook until the mixture begins to thicken. Serve hot.

Description: 
The rind of a watermelon contains a lot of nutrients that go to waste if you just throw it away after eating the inner part of the watermelon. Why not put it to some use? Cooked watermelon rind has a texture similar to zucchini, and it adds a mildly sweet taste to this stir-fry.
