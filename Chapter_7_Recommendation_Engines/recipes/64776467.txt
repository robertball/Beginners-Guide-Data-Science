Ingredients:
1 cup vinegar
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
1 cup fresh cranberries
2 cardamom pods, crushed
4 allspice berries, cracked
1/4 inch piece cinnamon

Directions:
Heat the vinegar, water, and sugar in a medium saucepan. Add the cranberries, cardamom pods, allspice berries, and cinnamon bark, and bring to a boil. Stir, then cover taking care that the cranberries don’t burn you when they pop. Stir again and reduce the heat, simmering the mixture until the sugar has dissolved and the berries have released their juice, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and steep for 15 minutes. Strain into a container, seal, and refrigerate. Discard pulp.

Description: 
This cranberry drinking vinegar is a great way to spruce up your holiday drinks and cocktails. Add a bit of sparkling water, ginger beer, or tonic water for a non-alcoholic sipper. Or add a splash of gin or vodka with a few ounces of your favorite sparkling water for a tangy cocktail. It’s even delicious as a substitute for plain vinegar in your vinaigrette recipe.
