Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) ball Burrata cheese, at room temperature
1 peach, sliced
1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons raspberry balsamic vinegar
flaked sea salt
freshly ground black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Gently tear open the Burrata cheese to expose the soft, creamy core and place it in the middle of a plate. Arrange peach slices in and around the cheese. Sprinkle basil leaves over cheese and top with olive oil.
Bring raspberry balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until vinegar reduces to a thick syrup, about 5 minutes. Spoon balsamic syrup over peaches and cheese; season with sea salt and black pepper.
