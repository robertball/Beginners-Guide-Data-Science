Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup shortening
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine 1 1/2 cup sugar and shortening in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in pumpkin puree and eggs.
Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and cloves together in a bowl. Fold into shortening mixture until a sticky dough forms.
Place 1/4 cup sugar in a shallow bowl. Shape spoonfuls of dough into small balls. Roll in sugar and place 2 inches apart on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
