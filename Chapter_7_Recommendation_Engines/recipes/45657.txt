Ingredients:
1 cup white wine
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
7 ounces Gruyere cheese, cubed
7 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed
7 ounces Emmentaler cheese, cubed

Directions:
Bring the wine to a boil in a small saucepan.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Whisk in the flour, and cook  for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid sticking and burning.
Once the flour is cooked, stir the wine into the flour mixture slowly.  Use a whisk to smooth the mixture. Slowly add cubes of Gruyere, Cheddar, and Emmentaler cheese; stir until cheese is melted. Transfer cheese mixture to fondue pot. Keep warm over low flame.

Description: 
We tried a couple of recipes; this was voted the best!  The Gruyere gives a very sweet and nutty flavour to the fondue, the sharp Cheddar makes it tangy, and the Emmentaler blends it all.  Cooking the flour first helps the mixture not to be so pasty and powdery.
