Ingredients:
Bottom Layer:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Top Layer:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree (such as Libby'sÂ®)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.
Mix 3 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Stir in 1 cup white sugar, brown sugar, 1 cup melted butter, 2 eggs, and vanilla extract until batter is just combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly done, 5 minutes.
Beat 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup melted butter together in a bowl until creamy. Stir in pumpkin puree, 1 cup flour,  2 eggs, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt until batter is smooth. Pour batter over the partially-baked bottom layer.
Mix 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle over pumpkin layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
