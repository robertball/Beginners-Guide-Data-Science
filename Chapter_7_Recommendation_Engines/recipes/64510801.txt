Ingredients:
1/2 cup short grain rice
4 cups whole (homogenized) milk (can use lower fat varieties)
1/3 cup sugar (or less, if preferred)
1/4 tsp. salt
1/3 cup raisins (optional)
1 tsp. vanilla
Cinnamon (optional)

Directions:
In a large saucepan, mix rice, milk, sugar and salt.
Bring to boil, stirring often.
Reduce heat to very low, add raisins (if using), cover and simmer x 50 minutes or until rice is very tender and pudding has thickened (it will thicken more as it cools).
Stir occasionally.
Remove from heat and add vanilla.
If desired, sprinkle with cinnamon when serving.
