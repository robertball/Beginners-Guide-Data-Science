Description: 
This is a super easy and delicious cheesecake recipe I learned from my grandmother. The cake mixture is poured on the bottom of the pan, and the cheese mixture is poured on the top. In the oven, the cheese mixture ends up sinking to the bottom! I was always fascinated by this when I was little. YUMMM!!!
