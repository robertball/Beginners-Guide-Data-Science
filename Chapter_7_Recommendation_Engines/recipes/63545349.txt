Ingredients:
Basmati rice
1 cup coconut milk
1 cup beef broth
1 mango, cubed
1/4 cup honey
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1/8 tsp minced garlic
1/4 cup diced green onion
1/4 cup almonds, cut up

Directions:
1. Add 1 cup dry basmati rice to broth and coconut milk. Bring to boil, stir, and simmer 20'.
2. Mango chutney: Add all the ingredients together in a small saucepan and simmer, uncovered, for about a half hour, until the sauce reduces and thickens.
Serve rice as a side to Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks, topped with mango chutney. Top steaks with a little mango chutney.

Description: 
Coconut rice and mango chutney would usually be expected with white meat. I adapted this in a pinch to serve with savory garlic marinated steaks, and it came out so great that I will always make this side with the steaks from now on!
