Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
8 ounces Italian sausage, casings removed
1 (10.75 ounce) can tomato puree
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons dried parsley
9 lasagna noodles
3 cups cottage cheese
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
16 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook ground beef and sausage over medium heat until brown; drain. Stir in tomato puree, tomato paste, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic, and 1 1/2 tablespoons parsley. Reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
In a bowl, stir together cottage cheese, eggs, pepper, Parmesan, 1 1/2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt until blended.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, layer a third each of the noodles, sliced mozzarella, cottage cheese mixture, and meat sauce. Repeat layers twice.
Bake lasagna in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until hot and bubbly.  Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
