Ingredients:
1 cup sugar snap peas
1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons raspberry vinegar
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
4 cups sliced fresh strawberries

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to boil and place a steamer insert in the pot. Place peas in steamer, cover, and cook until bright green, about 30 seconds. Drain and run under cold water until peas are cool; set aside.
Whisk olive oil, raspberry vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a bowl until well blended. Allow vinegar dressing to rest for a few minutes.
Combine sugar snap peas and strawberry slices in a large bowl. Pour dressing over pea mixture, gently tossing to combine. Serve immediately or chill for up to 1 hour.

Description: 
Doing the eat-for-your-blood-type diet. This salad is a yummy treat I can eat!! Took fresh local strawberries and some friends' home-grown sugar snap peas and tried to recreate this salad I had read in a mystery book years ago. Goes well with a nice steak from the grill. Enjoy!
