Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
2/3 cup light whipping cream
1 egg, beaten
1 pint strawberries
2 tablespoons SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend
1/2 cup whipping cream
3 tablespoons SPLENDA速 Sugar Blend

Directions:
Place flour, salt, baking powder, and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend in the bowl of an electric mixture.
Cut butter into dime size pieces and add.
Mix on slow speed until the mixture has a crumbly texture.
Pour in the cream while continuing to mix on slow speed. Stop the mixer as soon as the dough comes roughly together and finish by hand. The dough will look a little lumpy.
Place dough on a piece of plastic wrap and push down to a rectangle 1 1/2 inches thick.
Refrigerate for 4-6 hours.
Cut the dough into 5 equal squares and each square into a triangle. Place triangles on a baking sheet.
Brush dough with egg wash.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes.
Stem, wash and drain the strawberries then put one quarter of them in the blender and liquefy.
Pass this puree through a sieve to remove seeds and pour over the remaining berries. Serve with whipped cream. ( See below.)
Refrigerate mixing bowl for 20 minutes.
Pour in cream and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend.
Whisk with a fine wire whisk till soft peaks form; use right away.
