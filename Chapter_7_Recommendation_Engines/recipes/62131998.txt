Title:
The Best Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 Ribeye Steak, sliced super thin (I freeze the steak for a about 30 min to an hour right before slicing so that it’s easier to thinly slice)
1 Green Pepper, sliced thin
1 Medium Onion, sliced thin
American Cheese Slices (or CheezWiz for official Philly)
Sandwich Buns (hoagies)
2 tsp Vegetable Oil

Directions:
Start frying the green peppers on medium-high heat in the veggie oil, once they begin to soften add in the onions and continue to fry until everything is tender. Push veggies to the sides of the pan (I like to use a wok - but any large pan will work) then add in sliced steak and fry until browned. Ribeye is a very tender steak so don’t worry about over doing it - it will stay tender.
While you are frying the meat, warm up the buns in a toaster oven or the oven. When meat is done, stir in the veggies. Pull out bread from oven, add cheese over bread and then spoon meat and veggie mixture over cheese.
