Description: 
his is a very easy recipe.  My son won a purple ribbon (which is higher than a blue ribbon) at the county fair when he was 10 years old.  This was also his first paid 'catering' job for a graduation party when he was 12 (he's married now, so that gives you a clue as to how long I've had this recipe). Great brownies with a mint flavored filling.
