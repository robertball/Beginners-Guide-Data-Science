Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/8 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
Place water and rice in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium size mixing bowl, mix together cooked rice, beaten egg, mozzarella cheese, and Tabasco sauce. Press mixture evenly into a lightly greased 12 inch pizza pan, covering bottom and sides.
Bake in preheated oven for 4 minutes, or until set. Remove crust from oven, and let cool slightly before layering with your favorite sauce and other goodies.
