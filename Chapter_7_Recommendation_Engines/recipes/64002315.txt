Ingredients:
roasting chicken
butter

Directions:
Remove giblets. Rinse chicken well and place on roasting rack in foil-lined roasting pan. Pat dry with paper towels. Tuck wings behind shoulders.
Cut lemon into halves or quarters. Peel and cut onion into quarters. Put lemon and onion in chicken cavity.
Soften 2-3 T butter in hands. Rub onto chicken skin, transferring as much to chicken as possible. Salt and pepper upper surface of chicken.
Roast in 350F oven for a couple of hours, depending on the size of the chicken. If you're lucky, you bought a chicken with one of those pop-up timers. Otherwise, look for juices from pierced thigh to run clear, not bloody.
Remove from oven and cool for 10 min before carving.
