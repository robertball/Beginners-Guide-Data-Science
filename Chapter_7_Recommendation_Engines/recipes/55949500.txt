Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tsp white sugar
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup shortening
1 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets.
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar and baking powder; stir well. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add 1 cups buttermilk and mix just to moisten.
Roll out dough to 1 inch thick and cut into biscuits. Place biscuits on prepared baking sheets; brush tops with melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until golden.
