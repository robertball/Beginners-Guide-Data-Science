For the Toppings:
2 dried figs, thinly sliced

Mix shredded coconut and 2 teaspoons maple syrup together in a bowl.
Spoon layers of 1 tablespoon each carob mixture, maple coconut flakes, maca applesauce, and coconut yogurt, in that order, into 4 digestif glasses or small wine glasses. Cover the parfaits and refrigerate until very cold, at least 4 hours.

Description: 
When it comes to presenting dessert to guests, there is nothing like a jaw-dropping, multi-layered parfait. And this low-fat version of the classic, with apple sauce, coconut yogurt, maca powder, and lots of other whole ingredients, is a winner! 

I am slightly obsessed with coconut yogurt and with making my own carob nutellaâ€¦ so towering these 2 ingredients in a delicious parfait enriched with a hint of Austrian apple strudel was a temptation I couldn't resist.
