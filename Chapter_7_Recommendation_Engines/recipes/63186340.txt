Ingredients:
1 cup fat-free plain Greek yogurt (like the kind by Fage or Chobani)
1/4 cup fat-free mayonnaise
Half a 1-oz. packet (about 3 tbsp.) dry veggie soup mix
One 10-oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/2 cup roasted red peppers packed in water, drained and chopped
1 tbsp. dried minced onions

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine yogurt, mayo, and soup mix. Stir well.
Add remaining ingredients and mix until uniform.
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, to allow soup mix to rehydrate and flavors to develop. (It's even better chilled overnight.) SO EASY!
