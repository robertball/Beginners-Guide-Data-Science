Ingredients:
8 eggs
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups flour
2 cups milk

Directions:
Using a food processor, mix the eggs, sugar, salt, flour, and 1 cup milk.
Mix ingredients well, and scrape the sides of the bowl.
Add the final cup of milk and mix well.
LET THE MIXTURE SET FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR!  Don't skip this step!
Heat a 9" or 10" cast iron griddle to medium high.
Using a pastry brush, coat the griddle with a little shortening (Crisco).
Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle, lifting the griddle and turning it so batter covers the surface of the griddle.
When the sizzling noise stops (about 20 seconds), slide a table knife about 1/3 of the way through the pancake, lift it, and turn to the other side.  When the sizzling noise stops, it's done (about 30 seconds altogether for each pancake).
Slide the knife under the middle, lift it, allowing it to fold into half.  Place on a plate, and prepare for the next pancake!

Description: 
These crepelike pancakes are my signature dish!  This makes a 10 circle which is folded in half.  In the middle of this we put a little dollop of sour cream, a little jam, and roll it up to form a log, finally crowning it with a little syrup.  Bet you can't eat just one!
