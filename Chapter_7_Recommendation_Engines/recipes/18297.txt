Ingredients:
2 cups biscuit mix
1 2/3 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) package sliced pimento cheese
1 tablespoon chopped pimento
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2 or 2 quart casserole dish.
In a small bowl, combine baking mix with 2/3 cup milk and knead until the dough pulls together. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and form into a rectangle 1/4 to 1/2 inches thick. Arrange 1/2 of the pimento cheese and the pimentos on the dough and roll up the dough lengthwise. Cut the roll into 6 equal portions.
In a large saucepan, cook onions and bell pepper in butter until soft.
Pour soup into the saucepan, along with 1 cup milk, tuna, and 1/2 of the pimento cheese. Cook the mixture over a medium heat until the cheese is melted. Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Arrange the 6 slices of dough, cut-side down, on top of the sauce in the casserole dish. Push the dough into the sauce.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes or until whirls are golden brown.
