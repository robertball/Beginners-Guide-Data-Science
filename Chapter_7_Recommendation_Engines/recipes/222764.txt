Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
2 zucchinis, cut into thick rounds
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour Italian-style salad dressing into a resealable plastic bag. Add the zucchini and coat with the dressing. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Squeeze excess air from the bag and seal. Marinate in the refrigerator 30 to 60 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove zucchini from bag; discard dressing.
Cook zucchini rounds on preheated grill until lightly browned and soft in the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side.
