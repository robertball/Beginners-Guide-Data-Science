Ingredients:
2 cups vegan graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup non-dairy margarine, melted
1 (8 ounce) package vegan "cream cheese"
1/4 cup nut, rice or soymilk
2 tablespoons organic confectioners' sugar
1 (21 ounce) can blueberry pie filling or frozen blueberries
1 cup non-dairy whipped cream (optional) *see recipe
3 tablespoons organic sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs and non-dairy margarine. Set aside 1/2 cup for topping, and press the rest of the crumbs into the bottom of a 7x11 inch baking pan. Set aside to chill in the refrigerator.
In a small bowl, beat the vegan &#34;cream cheese&#34;, sugar and soymilk until smooth. Spread evenly over the chilled crumb layer. Spread the pie filling over the  vegan &#34;cream  cheese&#34; layer, and chill while preparing the non-dairy whipped cream. In a chilled bowl, whip  cream, sugar and vanilla until stiff, spread over the top of the blueberry layer. Sprinkle the top with the remaining graham cracker crumb mixture and keep chilled until serving time.
Vegan whipped cream and cream cheese can also be purchased; will include my recipe for whipped cream; have to look up a cream cheese recipe.
