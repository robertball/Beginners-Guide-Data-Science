Description: 
Dad gave me this recipe when I was still in University years ago. It's so easy, I still remember it! Perfect for summer dinner parties - not a 'beautiful' presentation but, the taste and smell MORE than make up for that. Easily halved or doubled. Try it with a grainy or spicy mustard. Be sure to save the juices and 'gravy' to spread on sandwiches the next day.
