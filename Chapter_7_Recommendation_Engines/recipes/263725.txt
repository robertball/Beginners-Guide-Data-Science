Ingredients:
1 loaf Nature's OwnÂ® Perfectly Crafted White Bread
2/3 cup butter, melted
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
3/4 cup mini pepperoni
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Chopped fresh parsley (optional)
Marinara sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place the bread on a 12x24-inch piece of aluminum foil, taking care to keep the bread in a loaf shape. Fold the foil halfway up around the sides of the bread. With a sharp bread knife, cut the bread lengthwise in half, cutting halfway down through the bread slices.
In a small bowl, combine melted butter, garlic, and Italian seasoning. Brush 2/3 of the butter mixture between the slices of bread. Sprinkle 1 cup of the mozzarella, the pepperoni, and 2 tablespoons parsley between the slices. Drizzle the remaining butter mixture over the top of the bread loaf.
Place the foil-lined bread on a rimmed baking sheet. Gently cover bread with additional foil and bake for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Uncover and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes more or until cheese is golden and bread is just browned and crisp on the outside.
Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. If desired, sprinkle with additional parsley and serve with marinara sauce for dipping.
