Ingredients:
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
8 (4 ounce) fillets cod
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup flour
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons paprika
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons pepper
1 egg, beaten
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Rinse fish, pat dry, and season with salt and pepper.
Combine flour, garlic powder, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Stir egg into dry ingredients.
Gradually mix in beer until a thin batter is formed. You should be able to see the fish through the batter after it has been dipped.
Dip fish fillets into the batter, then drop one at a time into hot oil.
Fry fish, turning once, until both sides are golden brown.
Drain on paper towels, and serve warm.
