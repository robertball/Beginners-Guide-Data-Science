Ingredients:
6 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch cubes
2/3 cup raisins
2/3 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Topping:
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, transfer to a large bowl, and allow to cool.
Mash potatoes to a smooth consistency with a fork or potato masher. Mix in raisins, coconut, sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined. Transfer potato mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix together 1/2 cup melted butter, brown sugar, flour, and pecans in a bowl until moist and the mixture clumps together; sprinkle over potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
