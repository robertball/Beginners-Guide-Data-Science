Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs, boneless
salt & pepper
24 slices bacon, thick cut
3 TB olive oil
12 oz mild Italian sausage
1 C pistachios (or 1/2 C peeled)
1 lg egg
4 sprigs thyme

Directions:
MAKE STUFFING:
Coarsely chop pistachios.
Strip leaves from thyme and add to nuts.
Mix in sausage & egg until well blended. Set aside.
MAKE THE ROLLS:
Open chicken out flat. Season with salt & pepper.
Divide stuffing between them and roll up.
Lay out 4 slices of bacon, overlapping them slightly.
Put one chicken roll on top and wrap the bacon around to cover completely.
Repeat with rest of chicken.
Wrap each roll in foil. MUST be tight and completely (100%) sealed.
COOK:
Poach chicken packages 1-2 at a time in boiling water for about 20 minutes.
Let cool in the foil - refrigerate for 30 min.
STOPPING POINT - if you want, you can stop here, freeze rolls for another time. Thaw before continuing below.
Remove chicken packets from foil.
Heat olive oil in heavy skillet.
Saute chicken rolls until bacon is brown and crisp on all sides.
Transfer to warm platter and allow to rest in a warm place.
Cut the chicken into thick slices and arrange on warm plates.

Description: 
Chicken rolls stuffed with Italian sausage & pistachios.  These require more time consuming preparation than what I normally do for cooking dinner - but I found I can make a double batch on the weekend when I have the time then freeze to serve as needed. 

Great for company...even more impressive if you have the frozen ones on hand - you can have a great meal on the table in no time.
