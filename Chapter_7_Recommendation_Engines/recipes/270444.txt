Ingredients:
3 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped, divided
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 (10 inch) graham cracker pie crust
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
1 pound fresh strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup strawberry jam

Directions:
Place 2 ounces chocolate and 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Melt in the microwave on 30% power for 2 1/2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Spread over the bottom and up the sides of the pie crust. Place crust in the freezer.
Beat cream cheese using an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in sour cream, sugar, and vanilla bean paste. Remove crust from freezer and pour in filling.
Combine strawberries and jam in a bowl and spread on top of the cream cheese layer.
Combine remaining chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave until melted, about 1 minutes. Drizzle over the pie using a spoon. Refrigerate pie for about 30 minutes before serving.
