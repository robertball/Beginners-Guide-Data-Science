Ingredients:
1 c. White Long grain Rice (not instant, and do not rinse rice).
1 can 10.5 oz. French Onion Soup
4 T. Butter melted (unsalted if preferred)
1 4 oz. can mushroom pieces undrained
1/2 soup can of water
2 t. dry onion flakes (optional)
2 t. dry parsley (optional)
1/4 t. freshly ground pepper (optional)

Directions:
In a small covered casserole dish combine the rice, soup, butter, mushrooms with the juice, 1/2 soup can water and the optional spices if desired. Stir well. (I use the optional spices in my recipe but they are not necessary if you don't like them or you don't have them on hand.)
Bake covered in a 350* oven for 60 minutes, or at 400* for 45 minutes. Check & stir well to combine. If rice is too dry add a bit more water and bake a little longer.
Stir, serve & enjoy!

Description: 
Do you like French Onion soup? Now picture a Savory Rice Pilaf that's made with French Onion soup that turns out perfect & delicious every time! I've made this many times over the years, and it is so easy and full of flavor. You might expect it to be salty because of the French Onion soup. However because of the other ingredients it truly is not salty. Try it for an everday meal or for company, it works nicely for both!
