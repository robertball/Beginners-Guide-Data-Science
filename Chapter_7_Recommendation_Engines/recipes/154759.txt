Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter or margarine
12 eggs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups cottage cheese
4 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the butter in a 9x13 inch baking dish and put the dish in the oven while it preheats.
In the container of a blender, combine the eggs, flour and baking powder. Cover and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into a large bowl and fold in the cottage cheese and Monterey Jack cheese. Pour over the melted butter in the dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm in the center, about 30 minutes. A knife inserted into the center should come out clean.
