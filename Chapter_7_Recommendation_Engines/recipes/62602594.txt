Ingredients:
4 slices white bread, torn into large pieces
1/2 cup whole milk
3 garlic cloves
1 small onion, coarsely chopped
1 large egg
Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
1-1/4 pounds ground chuck (80 percent to 86 percent lean)
1-1/4 pounds ground pork (80 percent to 85 percent lean)

Directions:
Working in batches, pulse bread in food processor until medium-coarse crumbs form (you should have 3 cups bread crumbs). Transfer to a bowl. Stir in milk; let stand for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pur√©e garlic and onion until smooth. Pulse in egg, 2-1/2 teaspoons salt, and 3/4 teaspoon pepper to combine.
Mix garlic mixture into breadcrumb mixture. Add beef and pork, and mix until just barely combined; do not overmix. Divide mixture into 2 portions and continue with variations.
