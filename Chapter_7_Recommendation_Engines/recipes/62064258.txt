2 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 - 16 oz carton Cool Whip

4-6 Butterfinger candy bars, crushed

Tear the cake into bite size pieces. Cover bottom of dish with some of the cake.  Pour the cool whip mixture on top then sprinkle with some crushed candy bar.  Repeat layers, ending with crushed candy on top. Refrigerate for an hour or two before serving. Just to firm things up a bit. *you can do this in a 9 x 13 pan as well, in 2 layers I believe but the trifle looks so nice*
