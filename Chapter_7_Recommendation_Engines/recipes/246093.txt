Description: 
This is a simple detox tea. Lemon verbena is delicious! I came across it while I was picking up my summer herb plants last spring. I had never heard of it before but learned it is good for cooking and tea. Little did I know this little herb has some amazing detox and medicinal benefits. I love lemon but hate what the acid does to my teeth. With lemon verbena you get the flavor of lemon without the acid.
