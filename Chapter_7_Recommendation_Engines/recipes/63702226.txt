2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 bag of good quality chocolate chips (any kind, it is your preference)

Directions:
Butter an 8 by 8in baking pan and line it with parchment paper.
Take a heat proof bowl and combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, sugar, vanilla.  Then stir in the chocolate chips.
Put the bowl on a saucepan of simmering water and mix until smooth, but still thick.
