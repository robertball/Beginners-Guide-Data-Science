Ingredients:
4 slices bread
1 tablespoon mustard
6 slices ham
1 pear, peeled and thinly sliced
2 dashes ground black pepper
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon light margarine (such as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter - Light Â®)

Directions:
Spread 2 slices of bread with the mustard.  Layer each with 3 slices of ham, half of the pear slices, a dash of pepper, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.  Top with remaining bread.  Lightly spread margarine on the outer sides of each sandwich.
Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.  Grill the sandwiches until the cheese is melted and the bread is golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.  Cut each sandwich in half to serve.

Description: 
This is a twist on an old classic -- ham and cheese. Adding a fresh cut pear gives the sandwich a nice, light sweetness that you won't forget.
