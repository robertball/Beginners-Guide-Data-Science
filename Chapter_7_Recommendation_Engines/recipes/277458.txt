Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups vegetable broth
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch dried thyme

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and saute until soft, about 8 minutes. Add flour and stir until mushrooms are evenly coated. Slowly pour in vegetable broth, stirring continuously, until flour has completely dissolved and is mixed into the broth. Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme; stir to combine.
Bring gravy to a boil. Reduce heat to low, stir occasionally, and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
