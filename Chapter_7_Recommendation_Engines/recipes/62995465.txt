Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup fruit preserves, any flavor

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar, salt, vanilla and egg. Mix in flour a little bit at a time until a soft dough forms. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. If dough is too soft, refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes. Place balls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Use your finger or an instrument of similar size to make a well in the center of each cookie. Fill the hole with 1/2 teaspoon of preserves. (Place preserves in a ziploc back, cut the corner and squeeze into cookie well.)
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown on the bottom. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
