Ingredients:
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 2/3 cups milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder

1/4 cup melted butter
3 egg whites, stiffly beaten
2/3 cup blueberries
1 1/2 cups blueberries
3 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and milk. Stir in flour, baking powder and salt. Stir in butter, and set mixture aside for about 30 minutes.
Preheat a lightly greased waffle iron.
Fold egg whites and 2/3 cup blueberries into the mixture. Scoop portions of the mixture into the prepared waffle iron, and cook until golden brown.
To prepare the sauce, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix 1 1/2 cups blueberries, honey and 1/4 cup orange juice. Bring to a boil. Mix remaining orange juice and cornstarch in a small bowl, and stir into the blueberry mixture. Stir constantly until thickened. Serve warm over waffles.

Description: 
I am fortunate to have four blueberry bushes in my back yard, and they supply me with fresh blueberries all summer long. This is one of the recipes that I use to help use up the massive amount  of berries that I pick each summer.
