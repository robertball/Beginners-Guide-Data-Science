Ingredients:
Dark chocolate layer:
6 Tbs butter
1 & 1/2 cups sugar (white or organic/raw is fine)
1/3 cup EVAPORATED MILK (not sweet condensed)
6 oz dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup marshmallow fluff
1/2 tsp pure peppermint extract
White chocolate layer:
6 Tbs Butter
1 & 1/2 cups sugar (white or organic/raw is fine)
1/3 cup EVAPORATED MILK (not sweet condensed)
6 oz white chocolate chips
1/2 cup marshmallow fluff
1/2 tsp pure peppermint extract
Garnish/Topping:
1/2 cup crushed peppermint candies or canes
2 oz dark chocolate chips
1/2 tsp coconut oil (optional for drizzle)
Digital/candy thermometer (not mandatory but handy)

Directions:
First line your 8x8" square pan with liner of your choice, parchment paper works best but foil also works!
If using foil, I suggest coating with a pan spray or butter/coconut oil etc. parchment paper requires no additional barrier.
Also, I highly recommend doing two pieces, crisscrossing them -- making them long enough to stick up the side of the pan and only the width of the pan. Nice clean edges and pops out easily.
Next, in a medium size metal solid bottom pan melt butter, evaporated milk, and sugar together until it becomes an active rolling boil. Stirring constantly.
Then insert thermometer, stop stirring and let mixture reach 234 degrees; remove from heat. If no thermometer, try cooking an additional 2-4 minutes maximum.
Stir in chocolate first and whisk until mostly melted and smooth; then add peppermint extract and marshmallow fluff; whisk/stir until fully incorporated and smooth. Pour into prepared pan. Refrigerate and chill minimum of 40 minutes for layer to set.
This is when I usually crush my candies, a little electric chopper/food processor works great-so does a hammer.
Repeat above steps for next chocolate layer. After pouring second layer into pan, you can sprinkle the crushed candies on top.
Place back in refrigerator to chill, and make optional chocolate drizzle.
For drizzle:
In a double boiler (small pan with water and heat-safe bowl that rests on top, water just below bottom of bowl) or in the microwave:
Melt 2 oz chocolate chips and coconut oil (optional but makes a smoother product). Drizzle or drip as you like. Can use a pipe & bag set or make a parchment cone, or just pour slowly and carefully from bowl.

Description: 
A double-decker delicious and pretty fudge treat that's very easy and sure to please! Very versatile, if you want to do all white chocolate or dark, swap for semi-sweet or milk chocolate etc, just combine ingredient amounts and cook in one batch! Also, comes out of the pan perfectly using parchment paper! I can't stress enough how nice it is and easy to clean using parchment paper, which you can now often find at Dollar stores if you're on a budget!!
