Ingredients:
Drizzle of olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
*2 fresh jalapeños, seeded, stemmed, diced- or 2-3 tablespoons chopped pickled jalapeños
5 cloves garlic, chopped
4 andouille sausages (I used chicken andouille sausage)
2 1/2 cups chicken or vegan broth - and more, to thin, if needed
2 14-oz.cans Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes
2 15-oz. cans kidney beans, rinsed, drained
2 15-oz. can pinto or black beans, rinsed, drained
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
*1 teaspoon chipotle, cayenne, or hot chili powder, to taste
1 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning
1 teaspoon brown sugar or raw agave (I used Xylitol sugar substitute)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon gluten-free Worcestershire sauce or molasses

Directions:
In large soup pot, add a drizzle of olive oil and cook diced onions until translucent, then add jalapeno, and add garlic and give it about a minute to sauté. Add sausage,  cook for about 2-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the rest of the ingredients.  Bring to boil, then reduce to simmer.
Simmer covered on low for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
You can also make this in a crock pot, by throwing all in pot, and cook 4 hours on High, or 6-8 on low.  You may need to adjust times depending on how hot your slow cooker runs.

Description: 
Is it a soup or a chili?  Well, both really.  It’s very hearty with a soup consistency.  I made this soup on a cold evening, it was good, but very spicy!  

*If you like spicy, make it as is.  If you have children, you may want to reduce jalapeno to one, or none, and reduce chili spice (cayenne, chili powder, or chipotle)!
