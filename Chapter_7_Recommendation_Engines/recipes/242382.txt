Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1/2 cup kosher salt
3 tablespoons light brown sugar
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons black pepper
2 tablespoons chili powder
4 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 racks Smithfield® Extra Tender Pork Spareribs, membrane removed
Sauce:
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup white vinegar
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons hot sauce
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
About one hour before smoking, make the dry rub.  Combine salt, sugars, black pepper, chili powder, garlic powder and cayenne in small bowl; mix well.  Generously coat both sides of ribs with rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, make the sauce.  Whisk together all ingredients in bowl.
Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 250 degrees F.
Place the ribs, meaty side up, over a drip pan and cook for 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours until very tender, basting with barbecue sauce every hour.  Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat.
Serve ribs with remaining barbecue sauce.
