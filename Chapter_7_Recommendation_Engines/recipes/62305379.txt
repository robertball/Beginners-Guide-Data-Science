Ingredients:
1/2 c. warm water (115-120 degrees)
2 packets yeast
5 c. hot tap water
1/2 c. milk
1 1/2 t. salt
2/3 c. honey
2/3 c. oil
4 1/2 c. wheat flour
5-6 c. all purpose white flour

Directions:
In large bowl put 1/2 c. warm water (115-120 degrees) and yeast packets, let sit 5 minutes.  Add 5 c. hot tap water, milk, salt, honey and oil, mix lightly.  Add flour mixture and blend until ingredients are completely combined.  It should look like thick cake batter.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Heat oven to 325 degrees.  On heavily floured surface, pour out dough and knead, adding flour until smooth and not sticky.  Place in a large greased bowl, turn once so both sides are oiled.  Cover loosely with a towel or saran wrap, let rise to double. Meanwhile prepare bread pans, 4 medium loaf pans or 2 large.  Lightly grease pans.  When dough has doubled in size, punch down.  Remove half of the dough (if you only have 2 bread pans) at a time.  Put half the dough back in bowl, put the other half onto ligthly floured surface.  Cut dough evenly in half, knead a couple of times to form a log and place in prepared bread pan.   Repeat with other portion of dough. Let rise to above top of pan (double) and bake 25-30 minutes, until golden brown, not dark.  Cool loaves in pans 10 minutes, then remove and cool completely on cooling rack.  Take the other half of the remaining dough from the bowl and repeat the process.  Keep in plastic bread bags.  To ensure bread isn't too dark on bottom bake on a heavy, rimmed cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.

A healthy, moist bread that doesn't have a hard crust. This bread stays fresh, freezes well and disappears quickly around my house.
