Ingredients:
3-1/2 lbs peeled russett potatoes cut to 3/4" discs
1/4 cup butter (1 stick)
1/2 c. whole milk
1/2 t. white pepper
2 t. kosher salt

Directions:
In pressure cooker, heat enough water that will cover potatoes to boiling.  Once water reaches a boil, add potatoes and lock the lid.  Bring cooker up to 15psi pressure and cook for 30min.
Remove from heat, drain water.  Put butter and milk in cooker and put lid back on for 5 min (to heat butter and milk).  Remove lid, add remaining ingrediants, and mix well using a hand masher until lumps are mostly gone.

Description: 
After years of adjusting, learning from failures, and sorting through advice from others that turned out to be good or bad, I finally have a great recipe that people flip over.

The two biggest tips I've learned in making these, is to heat the milk and butter before mashing in, and to use a hand masher as opposed to an electric mixed.  Using these methods, I have NEVER had the potatoes come out pasty or soupy, always super fluffy with just enough body.
