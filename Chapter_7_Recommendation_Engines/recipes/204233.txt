1/2 small red onion, diced
3/4 cup grape tomatoes, cut in half

Place romaine, onion and tomatoes in a salad bowl.
Place bread in toaster or under broiler and toast until golden brown and crisp. Cut each bread slice into four pieces. Cut each piece into fourths.  (Each bread slice will yield 16 cubes.)
Combine mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic and seasoned salt. Blend together and toss with salad ingredients.  Top with bacon and crisp, toasted Wonder Bread cubes.

Submitter: 
Wonder® bread
Description: 
You can have your bacon and eat it too. With the calcium of an eight ounce glass of milk in just two slices of Wonder Classic White Bread, this BLT salad is not only good, it's good for you, too.
