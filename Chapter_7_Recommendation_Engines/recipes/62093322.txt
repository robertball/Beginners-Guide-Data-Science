Description: 
This light refreshing salad is invigorating and tempting in color - yellow, red, white, green, black - especially in the hot, listless summer. Just a dash of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil are called for to allow savoring the natural but unique flavors of different ingredients harmoniously combined. Perfect as a light meal by itself or to serve with Italian bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip and white wine.
