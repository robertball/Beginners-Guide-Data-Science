Ingredients:
12 Bacon strips, cooked to crisp, drained, and crumbled
1 Cup Swiss cheese, shredded (about 4 ounces)
1/3 Cup onion, diced
2 Cups milk
1 Cup Bisquick
4 Eggs
1/2 Teaspoon salt
1/8 Teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Lightly grease a 10-inch pie plate.
Sprinkle the crumbled bacon, shredded cheese, and diced onion (in that order) evenly over the bottom of the pie plate.
Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper.
Stir in the milk.
Add the Bisquick and beat until smooth.
Pour over the ingredients in the pie plate.
Bake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean.
Let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

Description: 
This dish is called “impossible” because it made its own crust as it baked. There was no need to create a separate bottom crust before adding the main ingredients, which were bacon, onion, eggs, milk, cheese, and Bisquick mix. Baking in a hot oven, this concoction magically became a glorious, thick quiche-like pie with a golden surface. Once out of the oven and cooled a bit, it sliced cleanly and released from the pan flawlessly.
