Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
1 big onion, diced (huge)
1 green pepper, diced
1/2 lb mushroom, sliced
2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ground caraway
salt
black pepper
10 skinless chicken thighs, fat traces removed
4 plum tomatoes, diced
2 cups chicken stock, approx
3/4-1 cup sour cream

Directions:
In a large pot, heat the oil and saut√© the onion until translucent.
Add the green pepper, cook for 5 minutes or so, and add the mushrooms.
Cook until the mushrooms are just softened.
Add the paprika, caraway, pepper and salt (if you are not using salty stock, such as bullion cubes.)
Stir and add the chicken thighs and mix.
Add the tomatoes and enough stock to mostly cover the chicken.
Cover and simmer slowly for approximately 45 minutes.
The chicken should be falling off the bone, very tender.
Remove the chicken to a deep serving plate that has been warmed.
Reduce the stock a bit if it looks like it will be too much sauce.
Mix some stock fully into the sour cream to thin it a bit, and then mix the sour cream into the rest of the stock.
Heat until hot, but Do Not Boil.
Pour the sauce over the chicken, and serve over buttered egg noodles.
