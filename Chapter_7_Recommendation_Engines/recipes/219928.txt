Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 pork chops
1 (29 ounce) can hominy, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Pan-fry pork chops until browned, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
Arrange pork chops in the prepared baking dish.
Spread the hominy over the pork chops.
Mix the cream of mushroom soup, milk, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth.
Pour the mushroom sauce over the hominy.
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the pork chops are tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
My mom used to make this. I don't know where she got the recipe. My husband and kids don't like hominy (corn's big cousin) but they love this. Mom tried to make it several times, but every time she opened the can of hominy, there were pork and beans inside, so she would say 'Well kids, it's beans again tonight!'
