Description: 
THIS recipe caught my mother's eye back in 1925. It appeared in the local newspaper published in Jamaica, New York. Dad bought a paper every day so he could read while commuting on the El train.    It quickly became my brothers' and my favorite dessert. -Louise Stuhr, Chatham, New Jersey
