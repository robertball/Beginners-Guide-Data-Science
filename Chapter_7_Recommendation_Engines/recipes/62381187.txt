Description: 
I made this as a variation of the Tomato Rasam recipe, it was a hit with my boyfriend who was born in Chennai. I wanted to post the variation for my own memory, and to get more Indian recipes on allrecipes.com. Original is good too, though this version is more to mine and his taste.Modified from: Tomato Rasam
