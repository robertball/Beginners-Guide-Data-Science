Ingredients:
1 pound dried split peas
8 cups water
1 meaty ham bone
1 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram leaves, crushed
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Place the peas and water into a large soup pot over medium heat; bring to a boil, boil for 2 minutes, and set aside off the heat to cool for 1 hour.
Place the ham bone into the pot with the peas, and stir in onion, marjoram, thyme, garlic powder, and salt; bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove the ham bone, and cut as much ham as possible from the bone; chop the ham, and return to the soup.  Stir in celery. Discard ham bone. Bring soup back to a simmer, and cook for 45 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste with salt.
