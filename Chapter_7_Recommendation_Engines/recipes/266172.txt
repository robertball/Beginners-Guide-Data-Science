Ingredients:
2 slices leftover meatloaf
4 thin slices Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon mayonnaise, or to taste
1 teaspoon ketchup, or to taste
1 teaspoon mustard, or to taste (optional)
2 slices bread, toasted

Directions:
Place meatloaf slices in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Lay 2 Cheddar cheese slices over each. Cook until meatloaf is heated through and browned on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip 1 piece of meatloaf over the other so cheese is in the middle.
Spread mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard over toast. Add cheesy meatloaf and sandwich the toast together.
