Description: 
Instead of slow cooking this all day it can quickly be put together in the time it takes to cook the noodles you serve this sauce with and it tastes like it has been slow cooked all day.  Replace the expensive package of Italian dressing mix with a tablespoon of garlic herb seasoning for the same result and a fraction of the price.Modified from: Slow Cooker Chicken Stroganoff
