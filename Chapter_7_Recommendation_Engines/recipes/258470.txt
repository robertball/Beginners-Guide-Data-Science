Description: 
The white balsamic vinegar and lemon zest bring a wonderfully light flavor and a little zip to this dipping sauce for bread. This also makes a great spread on crostini before adding toppings. You can cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the sauce sit for 1 hour; this allows the flavors to meld.
