Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
10 leaves kale, cut into small pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground sea salt
1 cup pecans
1 cup currants
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir quinoa into the boiling water, reduce heat to medium-low, place cover on the saucepan, and cook until water absorbs into the quinoa, about 12 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let rest covered for 5 minutes. Remove cover and allow quinoa to cool completely.
Put kale in a large mixing bowl.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, pepper, and salt together in a bowl until oil emulsifies into the mixture; drizzle over kale. Add cooled quinoa, pecans, currants, and feta cheese to the dressed kale and toss to incorporate.
