Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter or margarine
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
12 mini doughnuts
1 1/3 cups flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 egg

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In a 9-inch square or 9x13 inch rectangle pan (if you use the rectangle, as I did, it will just be a bit more shallow; if you use the square, you may need less mini doughnuts), melt butter in oven. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over melted butter. Arrange mini doughnuts over brown sugar in rows.
3. In medium bowl, beat remaining ingredients with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed 3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter gently over doughnuts, so as not to disturb their careful arrangement.
4. Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Immediately place heatproof serving plate upside down over pan; turn plate and pan over. Leave pan over cake a few minutes so brown sugar mixture can drizzle over cake; remove pan. Serve warm; this cake is best when served the same day. Store cake loosely covered.
