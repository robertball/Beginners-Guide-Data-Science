Ingredients:
6 cups water
3 cups white vinegar
2 cups hair conditioner
(Suave Everlasting Sunshine works well, but any kind will work)

Directions:
1. Slightly heat the water, vinegar.  Whisk in the hair conditioner.  Pour into a 1 gallon container; stir. Do not shake it; it will cause foaming.
2. Use the same amount you normally use in a rinse cycle or spritz it on a wash cloth and throw in dryer.
