Ingredients:
1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless top round steak, or to taste
salt to taste
100% natural hardwood lump charcoal
For the Sauce:
4 cloves garlic
1 Fresno chile pepper
2 teaspoons rosemary leaves
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Season both sides of beef generously with salt. Let sit at room temperature, flipping halfway through, for 30 minutes.
Burn a bed of charcoal until coals are glowing red and ashy white on the surface, rearranging coals as needed.
Place the beef right on top of the coals. Cook, flipping over halfway, about 4 minutes per side. Continue cooking until the internal temperature of the meat reaches 120 degrees F (49 degrees C) for medium-rare, 1 to 2 minutes more per side. Transfer beef to a plate. Let rest while making the sauce.
Place garlic, chile pepper, rosemary, and kosher salt in a mortar. Crush into a paste using a pestle. Stir in vinegar and oil.
Slice beef thinly and spoon the sauce on top.

Description: 
If you've ever wanted to channel your inner barbarian and cook a large hunk of meat right on the coals, no grill, then this the recipe for you. The flavor of this beef lands somewhere between grilled and smoked, and I've got a great garlicky, acidic pepper sauce to go with it. Try this recipe with a more expensive cut of meat plus any sauce of choice, from chimichurri to barbeque. You can't go wrong!
