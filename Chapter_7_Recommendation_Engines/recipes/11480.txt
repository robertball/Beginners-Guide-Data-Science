Pat evenly  into the bottom of baking pan and bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.
For the middle layer, cream together white sugar, butter, and  1 ounce of melted unsweetened chocolate.  Add the egg to this mixture and cream well.
In a medium bowl, stir together 2/3 cup of flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add dry ingredients to chocolate mixture alternately with a mixture of the milk and vanilla.  Mix after each addition. Fold in the walnuts and spread evenly over baked layer.
Bake  for 25 minutes more at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C ) then cool.
For frosting, melt together 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate over medium heat.  Remove from heat,  and stir in 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar.  Add vanilla last.  Stir until frosting is smooth and pourable.  Drizzle over the tops of the brownies for an elegant finish.
