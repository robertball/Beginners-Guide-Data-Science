Divide cheese in half. Cut half of cheese into 1/4-inch cubes; shred remaining cheese. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper. Stir beer into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in cheese.
Transfer to a greased 8-in. x 4-in. loaf pan or 8 in cast iron skillet.  Criss cut with serated knife. Drizzle with butter. Bake at 375Â° for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe is a favorite because it isn't greasy like other cheese breads I have tried. It will not last long!
