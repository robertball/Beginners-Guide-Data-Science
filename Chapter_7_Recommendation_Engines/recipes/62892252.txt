Description: 
I like crunchy, crispy cornbread so when the idea of trying the mix in the waffle iron popped into my head, I had to give it a try.  Imagine my surprise when it actually worked quite well!  [You might need to add extra milk to the batter.]  Great brunch idea and the waffles will stay crisp in the oven while the rest are baking.
