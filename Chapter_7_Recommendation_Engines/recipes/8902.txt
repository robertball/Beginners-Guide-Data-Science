Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups cider vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
2 pounds cut up chicken pieces

Directions:
Heat grill to medium heat.
In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.
Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)

Nice crispy chicken, with tangy taste. It is best if bone-in chicken pieces used.
