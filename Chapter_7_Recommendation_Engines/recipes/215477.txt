Ingredients:
20 slices bread
1 pound breakfast sausage
3/4 cup butter
1 cup chopped onion
2 cups chopped celery
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (15 ounce) can black olives, drained and chopped
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place the bread slices onto baking sheets in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, then turn the bread over, and continue baking until golden brown on the other side as well, about 15 minutes. Remove, and allow the bread to cool. Once cool, cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the sausage. Cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly no longer pink. Stir in the butter, onion, and celery; continue cooking until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a large mixing bowl, and stir in the mushrooms, olives, garlic, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir in half of the bread cubes until evenly blended, then stir in the beaten egg with the remaining bread cubes. Pack into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy and golden brown on top, about 30 minutes.
