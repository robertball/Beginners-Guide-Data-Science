Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 (1.25 ounce) package dry taco seasoning mix
1 small onion, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 pinch salt, to taste
12 crisp taco shells

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the two halves of the squash with the cut sides facing down into a baking dish.
Bake the squash in the preheated oven until tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
Strip the squash from the rind with a fork into short strands and set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the onion and jalapeno pepper in the hot oil until the onion is browned and soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the squash and taco seasoning; cook and stir the mixture for 5 minutes more. Season with salt. Stuff into taco shells to serve.
