Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package cherry cake mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup plain yogurt

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, oil, eggs, and sour cream or yogurt in large mixing bowl. With mixer at low speed, blend just to moisten, scraping sides of bowl often.  Then beat at medium speed for 4 minutes.
Stir in miniature chocolate chips and 1 cup pecans. Pour batter into 2 greased and floured (or substitute granulated sugar for flour)  9 x 5-inch loaf pans.
Combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup pecans and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle equally on the batter. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool in pans on wire rack for 15 minutes.  Remove from pans and finish cooling on wire racks.
