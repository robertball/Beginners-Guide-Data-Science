Ingredients:
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy®)
1 cup creamed corn
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/4 cup butter
1 large sweet onion (such as Vidalia®), thinly sliced
1 cup sour cream
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 teaspoon hot sauce, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan.
Blend corn muffin mix with creamed corn, milk, and egg. Pour into the prepared pan.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix onion with sour cream, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, hot sauce, and dill.
Pour onion mixture into the baking pan and spread carefully over the cornbread layer with a spatula. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe I got from my mom. Not sure where she got it but it's so good! It's a mix of cornbread, onions, sour cream, and cheese, with a little bit of dill and hot sauce if you feel like it.
