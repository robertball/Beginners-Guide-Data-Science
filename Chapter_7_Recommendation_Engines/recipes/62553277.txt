Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, (about 3 medium)
3/4 cup “lite” coconut milk
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
1.Prick sweet potatoes with a fork in several places. Microwave on High until tender all the way to the center, 10 to 15 minutes. (Alternatively, place in a baking dish and bake at 425 degrees F until tender all the way to the center, about 1 hour.)
2.When cool enough to handle, peel off and discard skin. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a medium microwaveable bowl and mash thoroughly with a potato masher. Add coconut milk, ginger and salt; stir well. Reheat in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes, or in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
This three-ingredient dish, known as piele in Hawaii, is fabulously simple. Coconut milkan occasional indulgence because of the saturated fatcontributes rich flavor.
