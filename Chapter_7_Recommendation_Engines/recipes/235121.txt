Ingredients:
3 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
2 avocados, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
8 corn tortillas

1 cup cooked white rice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 dash green pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Mix tomatoes, avocados, onion, 1/4 cup cilantro, and garlic together in a bowl. Drizzle lime juice over tomato mixture; toss to coat.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Arrange tortillas, 2 at a time, in hot oil; cook until crisp, about 1 minute per side. Remove tortillas using tongs and repeat with remaining tortillas.
Spoon 2 tablespoons black beans and 2 tablespoons cooked rice onto each crisp tortilla; top with tomato mixture. Garnish tacos using remaining 2 tablespoons cilantro and green pepper sauce.
