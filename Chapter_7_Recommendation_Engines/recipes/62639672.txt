3 Cups of Grated Mozzarella Cheese ( or cheese of choice)
8 medium sized potatoes (your favourite potato, does not have to be skinned) cut into medallions

Directions:
If you are using Club House Gravy packages and it says it makes One Cup that is the right one, cook as directed with 3 instead of 2 cups of water though. If you are using your own gravy recipe please make 3 cups.
Place medallion cut potatoes in a 16x16 casserole dish, in a small layer equally spread across the bottom, sprinkle club house no salt mix,and then layer with a cup of cheese then place another layer of potatoes and do this all the way to until you run out of potatoes and cheese, try to have a layer of cheese on top to get the cripsyness
Pour the 3 cups of gravy over the entire dish try to cover all the potatoes on the top.
