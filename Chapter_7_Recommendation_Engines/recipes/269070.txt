Ingredients:
1/4 cup dried rose petals
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 lemons, zested
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
2/3 cup rose water
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 vanilla beans, halved lengthwise and seeds scraped
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1/8 cup rose water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Crush rose petals in a small bowl.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon zest together in a bowl. Add rose petals and set aside.
Mix sugar and egg together in a separate bowl. Add rose water and lemon juice. Stir in vanilla bean seeds. Pour egg mixture over flour mixture; stir until combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes; invert onto a cooling rack.
