Ingredients:
Cake
1	 box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® white cake mix
1 1/4	 cups water
1	 tablespoon vegetable oil
4	 eggs
Key Lime Filling
1	 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated)
3/4	 cup whipping cream
1/2	 cup Key lime juice or regular lime juice
1	 teaspoon grated lime peel
4	 drops yellow food color
1	 drop green food color
Frosting
1	 container (12 oz) Betty Crocker® Whipped vanilla frosting
2	 teaspoons grated lime peel
Garnish, If Desired
Fresh strawberries
Key lime slices
Lemon leaves

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F for shiny metal or glass pan (or 325°F for dark or nonstick pan). Spray bottom only of 13x9-inch pan with baking spray with flour.
In large bowl, beat cake ingredients with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds. Beat on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour into pan.
Bake 26 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes. With handle of wooden spoon (1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter), poke holes almost to bottom of cake every 1/2 inch, wiping spoon handle occasionally to reduce sticking.
In medium bowl, stir together filling ingredients (mixture will thicken). Pour over cake; spread evenly over surface, working back and forth to fill holes. (Some filling should remain on top of cake.) Refrigerate 1 hour.
Spread frosting over cake; sprinkle with lime peel. Garnish with strawberries, lime slices and lemon leaves. Store loosely covered in refrigerator.
