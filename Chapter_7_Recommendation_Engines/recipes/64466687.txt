Ingredients:
1 tube Pillsbury sugar cookie dough
1 bag marshmallows
1 bag mini marshmallows
1 can whipped cream topping
1 jar blue sprinkles

Directions:
Abscond to your abnosome abode and assess your abundant alcohol supply.  (Actually an alternative alternative.)
Begin with a ballad to befuddle and beguile, then blunder to your beautiful fridged bounty.
Caress your canned cookie dough and continue your clandestine affair by cultivating copious cans of whipped cream.
Donâ€™t dally, or your dispatched dinomite delicacy will dissolve, (but do drink.)
Emancipate your eminent marshmallows, emphatically.
Faltering and flailing are faulty - preheat and forge ahead formidably.
Go get your ghastly gastronomy from great oven and gingerly graft gallant marshmallows to garish cookies.
Heave a heavy hemorrhage of whipped cream to hone the horrendous hybrid.
Initiate idealistic idiosyncrasy.
Jostling is jeer-worthy and will jeopardize the jubilant junk.
Keen eyes keep it knotty.
Legislate legitimate leniency, and leave behind lovely levity, longingly.
Magnificent midnight blue sprinkles mediate the melee and mesmerize the menagerie.
Now nimbly navigate the nebulous necessities to a nondescript nursery.
Open your oblivious omnivorous mouth, and orient your ornate outcome to enjoy.
