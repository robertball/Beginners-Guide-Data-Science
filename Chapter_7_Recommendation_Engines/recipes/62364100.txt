Ingredients:
1 graham piecrust
2 c thinly sliced strawberries
2 Tbsp strawberry jam
1 tsp sugar
1-8 oz package of fat free cream cheese
1 (6 oz) container of strawberry cheesecake yogurt(from Target)
2 Tbsp sugarI used Splenda
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp almond extract
1 c frozen (thawed) fat-free whipped topping

Directions:
Add sliced strawberries, 1 tsp sugar, strawberry jam, and 1 Tbsp water together in a small saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil and then lower to a simmer until thickened, about 10-12 min. Remove from burner—let cool completely.
In large bowl, beat cream cheese with electric mixer on high speed 30 to 60 seconds or until fluffy. Beat in sugar until blended. Add yogurt, vanilla and almond extract; beat on low speed 30 to 60 seconds until well blended and smooth. Fold in whipped topping just until blended. Spoon into crust; spread gently to edge.
Refrigerate at least 4 hours or until chilled.
Top pie with strawberry sauce. Store pie in refrigerator.
