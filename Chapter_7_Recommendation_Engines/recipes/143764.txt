Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup chopped dried mixed fruit
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir together brown sugar, water, and flour in a large bowl until smooth. Add the apples, pecans, and dried fruit; toss in the brown sugar mixture until well coated. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cut the puff pastry into ten 1-inch strips with a pizza cutter. Lay 5 of the strips over the apples lengthwise, and cut the remaining 5 strips in half. Place the 10 smaller strips over the apples widthwise to create the lattice. Stir together the white sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over the lattice.
Bake in preheated oven until the apple mixture is bubbling, and the lattice is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
