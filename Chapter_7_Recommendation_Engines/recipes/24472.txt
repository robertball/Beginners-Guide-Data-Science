Ingredients:
1 cup dried cranberries
2/3 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
2 1/4 pounds Pippin apples - peeled, cored and thinly sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.) Position oven rack in the bottom third of the oven.
In a medium bowl, toss together the dried cranberries, sugar, flour and allspice. Mix in the apples, brandy and vanilla. Place bottom crust into a 9 inch round pie pan so that it hangs 1 inch over the edges. Pour filling into the crust and cover with top crust. Seal and flute the edges. Cut slits in the top using a small knife.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, or until apples are tender and crust is golden.

Description: 
This is a wonderful twist on the traditional apple pie - great for fall!  It calls for Pippin apples, but I usually use a combination of several kinds.  Occasionally I add a bit of cinnamon, too!
