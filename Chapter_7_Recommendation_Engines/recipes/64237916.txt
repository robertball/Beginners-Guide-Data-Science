Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked spaghetti, broken into thirds
1 egg
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound Johnsonville® Mild Ground Italian Sausage
1 small onion, chopped
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1 jar (14 ounces) meatless spaghetti sauce
1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
1 to 2 cups (4 to 8 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°. Cook spaghetti according to package directions.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat egg, milk and salt. Drain spaghetti; add to egg mixture and toss to coat. Transfer to a greased 13x9-in. baking dish.
In a large skillet, cook beef, sausage, onion and green pepper over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce. Spoon over the spaghetti mixture.
Bake, uncovered, 20 minutes. Sprinkle with the cheese. Bake 10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand 10 minutes before cutting. Yield: 6-8 servings.
