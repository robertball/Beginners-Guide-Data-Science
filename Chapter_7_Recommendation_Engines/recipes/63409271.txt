Ingredients:
3 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 cup water
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves finely minced garlic
1 teaspoon mustard SEEDS (set aside)
1/2 tablespoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon cumin SEEDS
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 large potatoes, peeled, chopped in 1 inch cubes, and boiled
1 1/2 cup frozen peas
2 medium diced tomatoes
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds (cover with a splatter screen if possible) and as soon as they start popping reduce heat to to medium and add in the remaining spices (not garlic). Stir in the onions, and garlic. Cook until the onions are tender. Mix in the potatoes and "fry" them. Mash a few potatoes as this will add a thickness to the gravy.  Add the peas, water, tomatoes, sugar, and salt into the vegetable mixture. Continue cooking about 10 minutes or until tomatoes have cooked down (about 10 minutes). Garnish with cilantro.
