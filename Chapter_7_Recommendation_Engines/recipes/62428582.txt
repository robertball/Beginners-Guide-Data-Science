Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3 tbsp cornstarch
2 cups milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of salt
1 tbsp butter
1/2 cup peanut butter chips

Directions:
In a microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the sugar, cocoa and cornstarch. Whisk in milk a little at a time so the mixture does not have any dry lumps.
Place in the microwave, and cook for 3 minutes on high. Stir, then cook at 1 minute intervals, stirring between cooking times for 2 to 4 minutes, or until shiny and thick. Stir in vanilla and butter.  Stir in peanut butter chips, then spoon into individual dessert dishes.
Serve warm, if desired or chill.  To chill, cover each dish with plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding to prevent  skin from forming, and chill in the refrigerator.
