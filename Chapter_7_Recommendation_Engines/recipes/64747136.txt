Ingredients:
1 cup diced fresh rhubarb
1/2 cup diced fresh strawberries
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 eggs + 1 egg yolk
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place the rhubarb, strawberries and lemon juice in a saucepan. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until mixture begins to boil (about 5 minutes), then reduce the heat to low and cook an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Pass the mixture through a food mill, using the disc with the smallest holes. If you don't have a food mill, you can either puree the mixture with a food processor or immersion blender, or push it through a fine mesh strainer.
Fill the bottom of a double-boiler with about 1 inch of water and bring water to a simmer. Combine the eggs, egg yolk and sugar in the top of the double-boiler and whisk together. Place over the bottom of the double-boiler, and continue whisking until the sugar is dissolved.
Slowly whisk in the strawberry rhubarb puree, and continue whisking until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Add butter and whisk until smooth.
Pour into a sterile jar, cool to room temperature and then refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.
Note: If your curd got too hot, and your eggs started to curdle, you can pass the mixture through a fine mesh strainer again, before pouring into your storage container.
