Title:
Alexander's Skittles Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 3/4 Cups Flour
1 1/2 Cups White Granulated Sugar
1 tsp Baking Soda
1/2 Tsp Baking Powder
1 Cup Butter (salted)
1 Large Egg and 1 Egg Yolk
1-1/2 Tsp Vanilla Extract
Skittles Candy
vanilla ice cream

Directions:
Begin by creaming the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, and then beat in one egg plus one egg yolk.  Add the vanilla and mix well.  In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, and cornstarch, mix until well blended, and then slowly mix it into the butter and sugar mixture.
Next, scoop out about a tablespoon of cookie dough, and roll into a ball (about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie).
Lightly press it between your palms to flatten just a bit, and then place 1 – 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets.
Gently press 2 to 3 Skittles® candies on top. Then place the cookies into the oven, and bake at 350 degrees for about 10 – 12 minutes until very lightly browned on the sides. The centers may still look soft, but they will finish cooking as they cool.
Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
Now it’s time to make the ice cream cookie sandwiches!
Using a tablespoon, take a large scoop of ice cream and sandwich it between two cookies. Feel free to roll the sides in more Skittles, sprinkles, or anything else you’d like – or just leave them plain! And then it’s time for the best part – eating them!
