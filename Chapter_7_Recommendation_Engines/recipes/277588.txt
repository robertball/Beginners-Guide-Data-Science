Ingredients:
1 medium orange, zested and juiced, divided
1/3 cup water, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) bag fresh cranberries
1/2 cup white sugar
3 egg yolks
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Pour orange juice into a measuring cup and add enough water to make 3/4 cup liquid. Pour into a medium saucepan.
Add orange zest, cranberries, and sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst, 8 to 10 minutes.
Pour cranberry mixture into a food processor or blender; blend until smooth, 10 to 20 seconds. Reserve 1/3 cup and return remaining cranberry mixture to saucepan over low heat.
Whisk egg yolks together in a small bowl. Slowly add reserved cranberry mixture, whisking constantly. Slowly whisk egg-cranberry mixture back into the saucepan and continue whisking for 5 minutes, or until mixture is thickened and the curd coats the back of a metal spoon. Add butter and whisk until melted and fully incorporated.
Pour into a sterile jar and allow to cool. Curd keeps in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

Description: 
This cranberry-orange curd is not only easy to make, it makes the perfect accompaniment to baked goods and pastries over the holidays. If your prefer a smoother texture, press the cranberry mixture through a fine mesh sieve after blending in the food processor. This makes enough to fill a pint jar.
