Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked pearl barley
3 cups water
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup chopped yellow onion

2 tablespoons white wine
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, drained
2 cups fresh spinach
1 pinch red pepper flakes

Directions:
Bring the barley and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, or until tender.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Season with rosemary. Mix the mushrooms, yellow bell pepper, and wine into the pot, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked barley, beans, tomatoes, and spinach. Season with red pepper flakes. Continue cooking 10 minutes, or until spinach is wilted.
