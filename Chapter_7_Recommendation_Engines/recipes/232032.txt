Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
2 1/4 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 large tomato, thinly sliced
1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, place in oven to preheat.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and continue to cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and season with basil, lemon juice, oregano, and pepper. Allow mixture to cool slightly.
Unroll pizza dough on preheated pizza stone or a large baking sheet and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Spread spinach mixture over dough, leaving a small border at the edge of the pizza crust. Top with 1 cup mozzarella cheese.
Press tomato slices into seasoned bread crumbs until coated; arrange tomatoes over pizza. Spread remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and feta cheese over tomatoes.
Bake in preheated oven until pizza crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
A light and flavorful pizza featuring feta, tomatoes, and spinach. I like to use a homemade whole wheat crust, rolled thin.
