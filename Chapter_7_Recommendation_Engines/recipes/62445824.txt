Description: 
While in NYC, I saw the most beautiful fruit tortes, with this shiny clear glaze. That made the fruit just pop. So when they wouldn't tell me how they did it. I worked and worked to figure it out on my own. I came up with this recipe when I made a fruit sponge cake from here And now I do it everytime. With the slight suttleness of lemon, it makes a great eye catching appearance as well as for taste. Simple and very affective.
