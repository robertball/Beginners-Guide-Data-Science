Ingredients:
3/4 cup baking mix (such as Bisquick Â®), or as needed
1/3 cup water, or as needed
1 (8 ounce) package Cheddar cheese, shredded
5 teaspoons prepared pesto

Directions:
Heat a greased griddle until drops of water sprinkled on it evaporate noisily.
Stir baking mix, water, Cheddar cheese, and pesto together in a bowl to form a batter; adjust amount of baking mix and water according to your preference.
Pour 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles begin to form on top, 2 to 3 minutes; turn and cook second side to a golden brown color, another 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat until all batter is used.
