Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
3 cloves garlic, crushed
12 ounces chopped frozen spinach
1 tablespoon pale dry sherry
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup whole wheat couscous
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, sun-dried tomato, dill, and garlic; cook and stir until onions start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in spinach, increase heat to medium high, and cook until spinach begins to wilt, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour in sherry and cook until most liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add curry powder, cayenne pepper, chickpeas, and 1 cup of the vegetable broth; cook for about 5 minutes. Add remaining broth and bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat, stir in couscous, and cover until couscous absorbs all the liquid, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt.
