Ingredients:
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened plus 1 tablespoon more, melted
3 large eggs
1 1/4 cups milk
1 tablespoon minced mixed herbs
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 F.
Using the softened butter, generously coat six 6-once ramekins or large muffin cups.  Set aside.
Combine the eggs, milk, melted butter and herbs in a medium mixing bowl and whisk together to blend.
Combine the flour and salt in a separate bowl.  Pour the egg mixture over the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon, mix together until well blended.  Fill the prepared ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.  Lower the oven temperature to 350 F and continue to bake until the popovers are golden brown and beautifully puffed, 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and serve warm.
