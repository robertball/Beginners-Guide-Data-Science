Ingredients:
melted butter for pan
Cinnamon-Sugar Filling
3/4 cup dark brown sugar (packed, 5 1/4 ounces)
1/4 cup granulated sugar (1 3/4 ounces)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon table salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
Biscuit Dough
12 1/2 oz (apx 3 cups) all-purpose flour
2 T sugar
1 1/4 t baking powder
1/2 t baking soda
1/2 t table salt
3/4 to 1 1/4 cups buttermilk **depending on humidity
2 T butter, melted (plus 1-2 more to brush on top)
Icing
2 T cream cheese, softened
2 T buttermilk
1 cup confectioners' sugar (4 ounces)

Directions:
Oven rack to upper-middle position set to 425.
Brush melted butter in 9-inch nonstick cake pan.
Filling: Combine sugars, spices, and salt in small bowl. Add 1 T melted butter and stir with fork or fingers until mixture resembles wet sand; set aside.
Dough:
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.
Whisk 1 cup buttermilk and 2 tablespoons melted butter in measuring cup or small bowl.
Begin adding liquid to dry ingredients and stir with wooden spoon until liquid is absorbed (dough will look very shaggy), about 30 seconds.  Note:  you want a fairly dry dough - so start with about 1/2 to 2/3 cup liquid and add more if needed to hold dough together.
Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and knead until just smooth and no longer shaggy.
Pat or roll dough with hands into 12 by 9-inch rectangle.
Brush with 2T butter and sprinkle filling over dough leaving 1/2" border around edges.
Using bench scraper, roll dough from long side, into log.  Seam side down, cut into 8 pieces.
Arrange rolls into buttered cake pan. Brush with  melted butter.
Bake until edges are golden brown, 21 to 24 minutes.
Loosen buns from pan and without separating, slide buns out of pan onto cooling rack. Cool about 5 minutes before icing.
To make icing and finish buns: While buns are cooling, whisk cream cheese & buttermilk in large nonreactive bowl until thick and smooth (mixture will look like cottage cheese at first).
*Sift* confectioners' sugar over and whisk until smooth glaze forms, about 30 seconds. Spoon glaze evenly over buns; serve immediately
