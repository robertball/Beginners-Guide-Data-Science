Ingredients:
2 egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 vanilla bean
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place egg whites and cream of tartar into a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer at medium speed until soft peaks form. Increase speed to high and add sugar 1 tablespoon at a time while mixing until stiff peaks form. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into the bowl and add vanilla extract; beat just until blended.
Spoon batter into a pastry bag and pipe mounds onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 1/2 hours. Turn oven off; let cookies cool in the closed oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove cookies carefully from paper.
