Ingredients:
1 green bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 red bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 orange bell pepper, sliced into strips
12 ounces chicken breast
2 tsp Italian seasoning
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
24 ounce jar marinara sauce

Directions:
Layer bell peppers and chicken breasts in the crockpot with some on the bottom and some on top then add seasonings, salt and pepper and marinara sauce.
Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 hours.
Once it's cooked, break apart the chicken with a tongs. It will shred easily after cooking this long in the sauce.
Serve over rice or lettuce and top with parmesan as desired.
