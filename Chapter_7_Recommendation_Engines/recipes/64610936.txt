Ingredients:
Black Bottom Butterscotch Fudge
Black bottom
3 cups bittersweet chocolate chips
1 14 oz. can of sweetened condensed milk
Splash of vanilla extract
Butterscotch layer
1/2 cup butter
2 cups granulated sugar
2/3 cup milk
Â½ cup cream
3 cups butterscotch chips
1 7 oz. container of marshmallow cream
Finishing salt, such as malden or fleur de sel

Directions:
Line a 9 by 9 square pan with parchment paper, set aside.  In a medium sized heavy bottom sauce pan prepare the black bottom by melting the chocolate chips and condensed milk & vanilla over medium/low heat.  Pour the mixture into your parchment lined pan.  To prepare the butterscotch layer bring the butter, sugar & milk to a boil over medium heat.  Continue boiling for 5-7 minutes until the mixture has slightly thickened and has begun to turn golden.  Pour the cream into the pan, it will spatter and hiss, that's ok.  Bring back to a boil then remove from the heat.  Add the butterscotch and marshmallow cream, stir until smooth, pour over the black bottom and immediately sprinkle with salt.  Allow to cool completely on the counter then refrigerate for 2 hours.
