Ingredients:
1 lemon, juiced
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 pounds dried figs
1 lemon, sliced
12 chicken thighs
salt to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, brown sugar, vinegar and water; set aside.
Place figs and lemon slices in the bottom of an 11x16 inch baking/roasting dish. Arrange chicken thighs on top, then pour vinegar mixture over chicken. Finally, sprinkle with salt and dried parsley to taste.
Bake/roast at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 50 minutes, basting frequently (turn figs if they begin to brown).
With a slotted spoon, remove chicken, figs and lemon slices from baking dish and place on a warm platter. Skim fat from cooking juices, then pour over chicken as sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.
