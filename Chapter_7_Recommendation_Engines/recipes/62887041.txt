Ingredients:
3 lbs ground beef or chuck
1 lbs Italian sausage (hot or mild)
2 medium bell peppers, red or green, finely chopped
1 small sweet onion, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups Italian breadcrumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced or pressed garlic
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/3 teaspoon oregano
1/3 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley (do not substitute)
2 eggs, lightly whisked
1/3 teaspoon ground black pepper
1-16 oz can diced tomatoes (half in mix and half for top)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F.
In a large bowl, combine the *ground beef or chuck and pork, then once well mixed add all ingredients including half of the diced tomatoes, adding breadcrumbs to mixture last. If meat is low in fat, add up to 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix well.
Shape meat into a loaf, forming a dome shape. Pour other half of diced tomatoes over load with salt and pepper. If desired, cover with thinly sliced onions.
**Bake covered 1 ½ - 2 hours, or until meat reaches 160 degrees, uncover for about 10 minutes to allow meat to brown. Allow meat to rest for about 8-10 minutes, this will help when slicing.
Note: *To combine the ground beef or chuck and pork (as pork is normally fibrous and will lump), I let the meat sit out for about 30-minutes and then I mash them together with a potato masher. **I like to cook my meatloaf on a cookie cooling rack in the bottom of a casserole dish, so that the majority of the fat cooks off.
I am not sure on the serving sizes, I can tell you this feeds my family of five with left overs.
