Ingredients:
1 ball of dough-usually 1 lb frozen
8 oz sliced pepperoni
16 oz shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tbs olive oil

Directions:
Set oven to 420 degrees
Roll thawed dough into rectangular shape so it's about 1/2 inch in depth.
Place pepperoni slices on dough in rows leaving a 2 inch border. Place another row of pepperoni on top of first layer of pepperoni.  Next, heavily sprinkle pepperoni with shredded cheese so you can hardly see the pepperoni through the cheese.  Repeat another double layer of pepperoni and another layer of cheese.
Next fold left side of dough over, then right side of dough over to cover the fold completely.  Take top of dough and bottom of dough and fold over into body of dough.  Drizzle entire length of bread in olive oil.
Transfer to nonstick baking sheet and place in oven for 15-20 minutes or golden brown all over.
Cool before slicing.
