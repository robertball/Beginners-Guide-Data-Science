Ingredients:
aluminum foil
2 ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup all-purpose flour, or more if needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Place mashed bananas in a bowl. Add peanut butter and flour and mix until thoroughly combined. If dough feels too sticky to handle, mix in more flour; do not exceed 2 tablespoons.
Scoop a small amount of dough and place onto a lightly floured surface. Roll dough to an even thickness of your preference, rotating after each roll and adding flour as needed to avoid sticking. Dust cookie cutters lightly in flour. Cut dough into desired shapes and transfer to the prepared cookie sheet. Roll and cut remaining dough.
Bake in batches in the preheated oven until golden brown and firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
While the title says dog treats, these treats can also double as a cake decoration or just human treats. I always have to fight off my younger siblings while making them or else there would be no dough left!
