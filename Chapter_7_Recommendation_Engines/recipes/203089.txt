Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup shredded red cabbage
1 small carrot, shredded
1/2 yellow squash, thinly sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 small onion, sliced
1/2 cup red wine
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
2 fresh peaches - pitted, skinned, and sliced
4 cups mixed baby greens
1/4 cup raspberry vinaigrette

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the cabbage, carrot, squash, bell pepper, and onion in the oil until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the red wine, almonds, and walnuts into the vegetable mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer 5 minutes.
While the vegetable mixture simmers, heat a small skillet over medium heat; cook the peach slices in the skillet until completely warmed, about 5 minutes.
Place 2 cups of the baby greens on each of 2 plates. Top each portion of the greens with about half of the vegetable mixture and the warmed peaches. Drizzle each salad with about half of the raspberry vinaigrette. Serve promptly.
