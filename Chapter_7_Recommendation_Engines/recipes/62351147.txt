Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound sausage
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups beef broth
1 cup uncooked wild rice

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef, sausage, onion, green and red peppers,  salt, seasoned salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until the beef and sausage are crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.  Stir in the broth and rice. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
