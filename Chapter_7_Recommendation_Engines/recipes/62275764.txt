Ingredients:
1 egg
1 T brown sugar
1/2 T granulated sugar
2 T melted shortening (I use olive oil)
1 C milk
1/8 t vanilla (I've used a whole t by accident but it's ok)
4 t baking powder
enough all purpose flour for easy pouring, I usually use around 2 cups, added 1/2 cup at a time.

Directions:
Wisk ingredients in order, adding flour 1/2 cup at a time to desired batter thickness. Batter should look like cake batter (not too thin but not too thick). Heat griddle to a medium heat. Once, heated, coat griddle with non-stick spray (or use butter if you really want to go all the way. Pour onto griddle in approximately 2 oz increments, unless you like bigger pan cakes. when the batter starts to bubble around the edges begin to use your spatual to lift edges of pancake, keep doing this until pancake has bubbled all the way to the center, then flip. Pancakes take about 3 minutes to begin to bubble, depending on how hot you get your griddle. Do not over cook.

Description: 
This recipe comes from a hand written addition to my mother's Home and Garden cookbook (you know the one with the red and white checkers that used to be given as wedding presents back in the 50's). Her book is older than I am. Anyway this is simply the best pancake recipe I've ever tried. I have tried a few, but always come back to this one.
