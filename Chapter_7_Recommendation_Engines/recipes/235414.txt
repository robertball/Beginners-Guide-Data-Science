5 eaches russet potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced

Description: 
I used a mix of brown and lobster mushrooms, which worked very nicely, but this recipe will be spectacular with any mushroom. 

If you can find some wild mushrooms like morel, chanterelle, porcini, or lobster, use them. But if you can't, use regular supermarket mushrooms and you will still be rewarded with a very memorable potato side dish.
