Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package portobello mushrooms
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
3 tablespoons ketchup
3 tablespoons mustard
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Wash mushrooms and pat dry with a paper towel. Slice off stems and slice mushrooms in half so that you have 2 pieces, almost like a hamburger bun. Soak mushrooms in soy sauce for 2 hours.
While mushrooms soak, mix turkey, bread crumbs, ketchup, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Form turkey mixture into 2-inch patties.
Heat oil on a griddle over medium heat. Cook turkey patties on the hot griddle until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Cook mushrooms, cut-sides down, covered, until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
To serve, place turkey patties in between 2 pieces of mushroom.
