1/2 pound cooked shrimp
1/2 cup light cream
salt and pepper to taste

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, celery, and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Mix in flour, curry powder, paprika, and tomato paste. Gradually stir in chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir shrimp into the pot, reserving a shrimp to place on top of each serving. Mix in cream. Season with salt and pepper, and divide into servings. Pour an equal amount of brandy into each serving. Sprinkle with green onions, and top with reserved shrimp.
