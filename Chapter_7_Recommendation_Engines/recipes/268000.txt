Ingredients:
2 pounds ground chicken breast
2 large eggs
½ cup almond flour
½ large onion, minced
2 ribs celery, minced
¼ cup chia seeds
2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish, or more to taste
2 tablespoons tamari
2 small jalapeno peppers, minced
1 teaspoon Montreal-style chicken seasoning, or to taste
1 teaspoon garlic onion seasoning, or to taste
sea salt to taste
2 tablespoons sesame oil, or as needed

Directions:
Combine ground chicken, eggs, almond flour, onion, celery, chia seeds, relish, tamari, jalapeno peppers, chicken seasoning, garlic onion seasoning, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well, but do not overmix.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and coat with 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Drop large tablespoonfuls of the chicken mixture into the hot oil; flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Cook until well brown, about 4 minutes per side. Remove patties to a plate. Repeat with remaining sesame oil and chicken mixture.

Description: 
Grain free, dairy free, and low in carbs. I ran into some ground white chicken breast real cheap and intended to make meatballs, but at the last minute got lazy and made them into patties. Here's the recipe I came up with. They were fantastic, if I do say so myself. Serve with dipping sauce, if desired.
