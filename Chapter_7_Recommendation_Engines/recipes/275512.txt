Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
3 tablespoons cacao powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch pink Himalayan salt
1 cup pitted fresh dates
Filling:
1 (14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
1 cup cacao butter
3/4 cup cacao powder
1/2 cup agave nectar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch pink Himalayan salt
3 tablespoons peanut butter (optional)

Directions:
Combine coconut, cacao powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a blender for the crust; pulse briefly to mix. Add dates and process until dates are finely chopped and the mixture starts to clump. Gently press crust mixture into a 9-inch pie plates and place in the refrigerator to firm while you prepare the filling.
Combine coconut milk, cacao butter, cacao powder, agave, vanilla extract, and salt in a high-speed blender; blend on low speed until combined; mixture will still be white and chunky. Continue blending on high speed until mixture is slightly hot to the touch, about 3 minutes; mixture will be about 110 degrees F (45 degrees C).
Pour filling into the firm crust and return, uncovered, to the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Dollop small bits of peanut butter on top of the filling and drag a knife through to make peanut butter swirls. Refrigerate until set, 4 1/2 hours to overnight. Slice and serve.
