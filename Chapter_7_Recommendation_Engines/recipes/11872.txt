Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups nonfat evaporated milk
10 cloves garlic
1 pound dry fettuccine pasta
1/2 cup nonfat milk
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons lowfat cream cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine 1 1/2 cup evaporated milk and garlic cloves in a pan, heat and simmer until garlic is soft (about 15-20 minutes). Milk will reduce a little.
In a blender, puree milk and garlic mixture with cream cheese until smooth.
Return mixture to pan and add 1/2 cup nonfat milk and cornstarch. Heat to simmer. Sauce will thicken slightly. Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.  Toss sauce with cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper and serve with parsley sprinkled on top. Serve remaining parmesan cheese separately.
