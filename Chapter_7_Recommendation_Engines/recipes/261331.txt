Description: 
This simple twist on green bean casserole uses prepared Alfredo sauce for a base. The green beans and sauce combined with water chestnuts, roasted red peppers, ripe olives, and French-fried onions creates a dish with great flavor, color, and texture. Experiment with your microwave's timing to cook this in a casserole dish for a speedier version that works just as well.
