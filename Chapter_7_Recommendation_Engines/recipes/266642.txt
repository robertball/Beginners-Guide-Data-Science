Ingredients:
cooking spray
5 small tri-color baby potatoes, thinly sliced
1/4 stick butter
10 small eggs
1 small tomato, finely chopped
1 small yellow bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 cup fresh spinach
1/4 cup chopped ham
1/4 cup chopped white onion
1 slice mozzarella cheese, cut into 12 cubes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.
Place a thin layer of potato slices in the bottom of each muffin cup. Add a little butter on top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.
Mix eggs, tomato, bell pepper, spinach, ham, and onion together in a large bowl. Remove muffin tin from oven and ladle the egg mixture over the potatoes. Top each muffin cup with a mozzarella cube.
Continue baking until egg bites are set, about 20 minutes.
