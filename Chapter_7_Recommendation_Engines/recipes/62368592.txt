Ingredients:
2 cups seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 pounds ground beef
1 package Hidden Valley Ranch mix
8 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium heat. When hot, lightly oil the grate. In a medium bowl, stir together the jalapenos and cream cheese. Form into patty shape and refridgerate for a while until it is firm again.
Divide the ground beef into 16 portions and pat out each one to 1/4 inch thickness. Place the cheese mixture onto the center of 8 of the patties. Top with the remaining patties, pressing the edges together to seal.
Grill for about 10 minutes per side, or until well done, taking care not to press down on the burgers as they cook. This will make the cheese ooze out. Serve on buns with your favorite toppings.
