Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
8 eggs
2 cups milk
1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11 inch casserole dish.
Fry the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble.
layer the hashbrowns on the bottom of your pan, bake them first until they start to brown (I turn the oven way up to 450 and dot butter on top), and then add the rest of your ingredients (and bake at 350) lready mixed. Cover with aluminum foil and bake in preheated oven for 45 min minutes. Uncover and bake for another 30 minutes until eggs have set.
