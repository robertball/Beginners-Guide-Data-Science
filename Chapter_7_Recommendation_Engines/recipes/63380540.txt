Ingredients:
1/2 lb each - candied cherries, pineapple, citrus fruit, or 3 lbs of mixed candied fruit
1 box white raisins
1 cup chopped pecans
3 cups plain flour
3 beaten eggs
1 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup margarine
1 t. cloves
2 t. cinnamon
1 t. baking soda
1 t. pure vanilla (never use imitation vanilla)
1 T. buttermilk
1 t. salt
1/4 t. nutmeg
1 cup orange juice

Directions:
Cut up candied cherries...half or quarter. If you use the 3 lbs of candied mixed fruit...add 1/2 lbs of the red candied fruit..makes them prettier.
Soak all candied fruit & raisins in 1 cup of orange juice overnight
Next day - disolve baking soda in buttermilk.  Mix all the rest of the ingredients together (by hand is best) including the buttermilk and any orange juice that was not absorbed in the fruit.
Drop by teaspoon (don't make big) onto parchment lined cookie sheet.
Bake in a pre-heated oven at 325 for 17-19 minutes or until slightly browned around the edges.  Do not over cook.
Store in air-tight container or cookie tin.  Will last long time.  Great for gifts.  Just don't ever store your crisp cookies and soft ccookies together..will make your crisp cookies soft.
