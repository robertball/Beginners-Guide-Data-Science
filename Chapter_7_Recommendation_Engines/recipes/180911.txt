Ingredients:
3 pounds beef tripe, cut into 1/4 inch strips
vegetable oil for frying
1 egg
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
1 1/2 cups milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Place the tripe into a large pot, and cover with a lot of water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 1 1/2 hours. Drain, then rinse well with cold water. Drain in a colander, squeezing out the excess water.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat together the egg, barbeque sauce, and milk in a mixing bowl. Stir in the flour, and mix until no dry lumps remain. Season with garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasoning.
Dip the pieces of tripe into the egg batter, and allow the excess to drip off. Deep fry the tripe in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Allow the tripe to drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.

Description: 
Similar to deep fried calamari, crispy strips of tripe make an unusual, but delicious appetizer.
