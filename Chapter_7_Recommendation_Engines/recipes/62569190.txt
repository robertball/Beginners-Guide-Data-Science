Ingredients:
4 cups Granulated Sugar
6 oz Mini Marshmallows (about 2.5 cups)
1 - 12oz can Evaporated Milk
1/2 cup Butter
2 - 12oz pkgs Semisweet Chocolate Chips (4 cups)
1 tbsp Vanilla Extract
1 cup Chopped Nuts (pecan or walnut) optional

Directions:
Line 13x9x2" baking dish with foil, lightly buttered; set aside.
In large (4qt or larger) saucepan, combine sugar, marshmallows, evaporated milk & butter.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture comes to full boil.
Continue cooking, stirring constantly for 5 minutes or until candy thermometer reaches 236 degrees, at that time drop a small amount of the mixture in cold water (should form a soft ball that flattens when removed from water).  Quickly remove from heat, stirring so mixture doesn't scorch.
Immediately add chocolate chips, vanilla extract and nuts, stirring until chocolate chips are melted and ingredients are well mixed.  Immediately turn into prepared pan.
Allow to set at room temperature, lift by foil edges & cut into squares.
