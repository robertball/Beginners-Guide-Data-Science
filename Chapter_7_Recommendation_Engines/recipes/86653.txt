Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 1/2 cups dark muscovado sugar
1 (10 inch) prepared shortbread pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat the evaporated milk and sugar with a whisk or electric mixer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until fluffy and mocha colored. Pour into the shortbread crust.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. The Gypsy Tart will have a sticky surface, and will not set completely until left to cool. Serve chilled.
