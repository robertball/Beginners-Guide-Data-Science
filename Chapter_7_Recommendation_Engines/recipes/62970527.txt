Description: 
origins of this sauce recipe are usually traced back to Abruzzo, an Italian region which is an isolated vicinity around 50 miles east of Rome. This region was once distinguished by its poverty and underdevelopment. Aglio e Olio is a basic sauce which only needs minced or pressed garlic saut√©ed gently in Olive oil until it turns barely crisp. Traditionally, the garlic-oil combination is tossed with grated hard cheeses like Parmesan or Romano and is served covered with long pastas. My wife introduced this recipe from her mom to me in 1976.
