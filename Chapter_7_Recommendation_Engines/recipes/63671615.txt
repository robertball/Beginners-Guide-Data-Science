Ingredients:
One 1.5lb eggplant
1 bunch watercress, chopped
3c quinoa, prepared
30oz can white beans, mashed
12 leaves fresh basil
olive oil
smoked salt
garlic mill

Directions:
Slice the eggplant longways very thinly, about 1/8" wide.  This should yield 10-12 slices.
Place the eggplant slices on a grill topper.  Paint with olive oil.  Season with smoked salt and garlic.
Grill for about 5 minutes, or until browned but not burnt.
Meanwhile, combine the quinoa and white beans.  Also, microwave the watercress for 3 minutes.
Remove the eggplant slices from the grill, careful not to tear them.  Place a dollop of the quinoa mixture in the middle of each eggplant slice.  Roll the eggplant slices up by folding one side over the mixture, then the other side.
Top each rollatini with one leaf of basil and equal portions of the cooked watercress.
