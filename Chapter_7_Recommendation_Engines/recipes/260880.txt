Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup milk
6 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Melt butter in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat; stir in brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Let cool for 5 minutes.
Whisk milk into the saucepan until mixture is smooth.
Beat 3 cups confectioners' sugar and salt into the butter mixture with an electric mixer on low speed. Add remaining confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, beating until smooth.

Description: 
This frosting recipe was the one my Grandma used on top of her oatmeal cake, spice cake, and banana nut cake. I also like it on a yellow or white cake. You do have to use at once because this does stiffen as it cools.
