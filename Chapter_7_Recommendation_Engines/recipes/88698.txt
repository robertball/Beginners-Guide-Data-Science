Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup Parmesan cheese
2 cups spaghetti sauce, or your favorite recipe

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish.
In a large pot, combine the milk and chicken stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it is at a rolling boil, gradually whisk in the cornmeal, making sure there are no lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly until thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese.
Pour the polenta into the prepared baking dish, and spread spaghetti sauce over the top.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until sauce is bubbling.

Description: 
My entire family loves this recipe. A quick baked polenta topped with red sauce. Very easy to make and great the next day too (and the day after that!) Top with additional Parmesan cheese if you like.
