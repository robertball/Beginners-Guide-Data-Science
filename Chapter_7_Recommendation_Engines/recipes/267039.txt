Ingredients:
5 eggs, separated
7 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon brandy
2 (8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese
3/4 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Combine egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl; beat using an electric mixer until frothy and pale. Add brandy and mascarpone cheese. Continue beating until mixture becomes firm, about 5 minutes.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Beat cream in a separate chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gently fold egg whites and whipped cream into mascarpone mixture with a spatula or wooden spoon.

Description: 
Mascarpone cream is used in a lot of traditional Italian desserts, such as tiramisu, or it is served beside a slice of panettone at Christmas time. Try it in trifle or with a slice of sponge cake - it's divine!
