Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup finely minced shallot
1 clove garlic, finely minced, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 large zucchini, sliced into long ribbons using a vegetable peeler, discarding the seedy core
1/4 cup thinly sliced basil leaves
2 1/2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat until the butter melts; cook and stir the shallot until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until the garlic softens and releases its fragrance, about 3 more minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and zucchini ribbons, and cook, lightly stirring, until the chicken broth has come to a boil and the zucchini strips are cooked through but not mushy, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with finely sliced basil leaves and crumbled goat cheese.

Description: 
I came up with this summer side dish when we discovered a couple of very large zucchini hiding in the garden.  I sometimes add some cooked chicken to make a nice one-pan entree.  If you don't like goat cheese, try subbing feta or a good Parmesan.
