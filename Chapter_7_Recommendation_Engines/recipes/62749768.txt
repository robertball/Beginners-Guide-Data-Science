Description: 
This is an amazing healthy yet creamy comfort soup! I combine turkey italian sausage, tender potatoes, onions, kale, and a few other secret ingredients to serve up a savory ladle of heaven. People say my version beats out the Olive Garden's recipe by a mile. My 3 year old granddaughter says it's the best soup ever! You be the judge.
