Ingredients:
3/4 cup canola oil
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 small onion, sliced
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds skirt steak thinly sliced
against the grain

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Place beef into the mixture. Rub mixture into the meat. Cover bowl and allow beef to marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours before grilling as desired.  The meat can , also, be cooked in a very hot cast iron skillet.  Just don't over crowd the pan.  Don't over cook the meat, either.  It's best medium rare.

Description: 
I ,love the flavor of skirt steaks, but they can be a little tough.  This is  the perfect maranade to help tenderize them a bit.   Just remember to slice the meat against the grain,  no matter what cut of meat you choose.Modified from: Carne Asada Marinade
