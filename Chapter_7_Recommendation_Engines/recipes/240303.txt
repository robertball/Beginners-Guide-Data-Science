Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Beat sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in egg until smooth. Mix pumpkin and vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture; add cinnamon, salt, and baking powder. Stir flour into pumpkin-butter mixture just until dough is mixed. Refrigerate dough, 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll dough on a floured work surface and cut into shapes using cookie cutters. Arrange cookies on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
