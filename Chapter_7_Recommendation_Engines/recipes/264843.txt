Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (3 ounce) package berry blue gelatin
1/2 cup white sugar
3 3/4 cups boiling water, divided
1 (3 ounce) package strawberry gelatin
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
1/4 cup cold water
1/2 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Line two 4x8-inch loaf pans with foil; coat with cooking spray. Stir together berry blue gelatin and 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl with 1 1/2 cups boiling water until dissolved. Pour into the first prepared pan. Stir together strawberry gelatin and remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl with 1 1/2 cups boiling water until dissolved. Pour into second prepared pan. Chill both mixtures until set, at least 3 hours.
Sprinkle unflavored gelatin over 1/4 cup cold water in a bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Add remaining 3/4 cup boiling water and whisk until dissolved. Stir in sweetened condensed milk and let cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, line a 9x13-inch pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on long sides, and coat with cooking spray. Turn chilled gelatins out onto a cutting board and coarsely chop. Transfer to prepared pan, then pour in milk mixture. Chill until set, at least 3 hours.
Use foil to carefully lift gelatin mixture and transfer to a baking sheet, then fold down edges of foil. Insert 8 wooden sticks, spaced evenly, on each long side of the gelatin block. Freeze overnight.
Let frozen gelatin stand at room temperature 15 minutes. Cut into 16 ice pop-sized rectangles.
