Ingredients:
24 corn tortillas
vegetable oil for frying
Filling:
1/2 tsp sesame seeds
1/ tsp chili powder
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp cocoa powder
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup vegetable broth
2 cups beans, cooked
2 cups soy protein, reconstituted with vegetable broth
Toppings:
2 cups grated cheese, dairy or soy
2 cups tomatoes
2 cups  lettuce
1 cup salsa

Directions:
Lightly roast sesame seeds,paprika, and chili powder in a pan.
Add other seasonings.
Add vegetable broth.
Add beans and mash slightly.
Add soy protein and mix in well.
Set filling aside.
In another small frying pan, heat some oil for frying. When the oil is warm, put a tortilla in the pan. The tortilla will puff up if the oil is warm enough. Flip the tortilla over. As soon as it puffs up again, fold the tortilla in half in the frying pan. Cook just until the rim of the tortilla is crisp and the rest of the tortilla is soft. Flip the folded tortilla for the last time and cook until this side is also soft, flexible with a crispy rim. Remove from pan and let drain on a plate that has a few paper towels on it. Sprinkle the tortilla with salt on both sides.
Line the cooked tortillas on the plate as you go. Set the tortillas, filling and toppings out for everyone to assemble their own tacos. If you have hot sauce and sour cream,might as well put those out as well. This recipe calls for 4 tortillas per person, but believe it or not people might want to eat more.
