Ingredients:
3/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons mirin
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
16 peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp, tails still attached
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Stir together the mayonnaise, soy sauce, mirin, minced garlic, dried minced onion, onion powder, curry powder, turmeric, basil, cayenne pepper, and salt in a bowl. Fold in the bread crumbs until evenly moistened. Cover, and refrigerate at least an hour.
Cut each shrimp along the back and open the halves like a book. Place a hearty dollop of the mayonnaise mixture onto each shrimp, and spread over the top to completely cover. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over high heat until it begins to smoke. Place the shrimp in the pan, mayonnaise-side up, and add the water. Cover, and steam until the shrimp are no longer transparent, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.

I secured this sure-fire loads-o-goodness recipe while attempting to replicate something else entirely.
