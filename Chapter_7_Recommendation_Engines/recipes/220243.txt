Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 pint fresh shucked oysters
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 quart heavy whipping cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a pot over low heat.
Stir the oysters and onion into the melted butter, increase heat to medium-low, and cook and stir until the edges of the oysters begin to curl, 7 to 10 minutes.
Slowly stream the cream into the oyster mixture as you stir. Bring the mixture to a simmer, but do not boil; cook at a simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Season with salt and black pepper to serve.

Description: 
This creamy, delicious, and rich oyster stew may not be for traditionalists. I do add a little fresh chopped garlic to mine, but garlic and onion are taboo to oyster stew traditionalists.
