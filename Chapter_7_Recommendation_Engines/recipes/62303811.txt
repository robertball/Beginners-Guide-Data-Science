Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1 clove garlic, chopped or 1/8 tsp. garlic powder
1 small onion, chopped (to measure 3 Tbsp)
2 slices bread with crust
1/4 cup milk
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. chopped fresh or 1/4 tsp. dried sage leaves
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. dry ground mustard
1/8 tsp. pepper
1 egg
1/3 cup ketchup, chili sauce, or BBQ sauce

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Place beef in a large bowl. Break up into pieces with a fork. Add garlic and onion to beef.
Tear the bread into small pieces and add to beef mixture.
Add the milk, Worcestershire sauce, sage, salt, mustard, pepper, and egg to the beef mixture. Mix with fork or hands until ingredients are mixed well.
Place the beef mixture in a large baking pan with sides on it to catch the juices. Shape the mixture into an 8x4 inch loaf in the middle of the pan and spread the ketchup over top.
Bake uncovered 50-60 minutes or until beef center is no longer pink. Meat thermometer inserted in center of the loaf should read 160 degrees. Let the loaf stand 5 minutes, so it will be easier to remove from the pan. Cut loaf into slices.
