Ingredients:
3/4 cup reduced fat (2%) milk
1/4 cup Egg Beaters速 Original
1 tablespoon Fleischmann's速 Original-stick, melted
1/2 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (with rice flour)
1 tablespoon granulated sugar

Spread second crepe with 1 tablespoon hazelnut spread; place spread-side up on top of bananas. Top with another 1/4 of banana slices. Repeat layers with 2 more crepes, another 1/3 of the peanut butter and remaining hazelnut spread and bananas. Spread remaining 1/3 of the peanut butter on the last crepe and place peanut butter-side down on top.
