Ingredients:
1/2 c butter, softened
1 c sugar
2 eggs
2 c all purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c plain yogurt
1/2 c ricotta cheese
1 c blueberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 c sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a bundt pan well. Cream butter and sugar together.  Beat in eggs, one at a time.  Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt, then mix into butter and sugar mixture, alternating with yogurt and ricotta cheese.  Spread 1/2 of the batter into the bundt pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 the blueberries over the batter, then top with 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar.  Spread out the remaining batter, and top with the remaining blueberries and cinnamon sugar.  Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.
