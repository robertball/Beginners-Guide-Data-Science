Ingredients:
8 ounces bowtie pasta
2 ounces thin-sliced black forest ham
1 cup frozen peas & carrots
1 egg
1 tbsp. cream (optional)
1/2 cup parmesan cheese
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Boil pasta according to package directions.
While the pasta is cooking, chop the ham in small pieces and microwave the peas and carrots in a little water until heated through.
Beat the egg very well, add parmesan and stir to combine.
Drain the pasta, DO NOT RINSE, and immediately return pasta to the still-hot pan.  Quickly add ham, vegetables and egg sauce and stir to combine.  The egg should cook in the heat of the pasta.  Add cream for richness, if desired.  Add salt and pepper to taste, remembering that ham and parmesan are both salty.
Serve with grated parmesan sprinkled on top.
