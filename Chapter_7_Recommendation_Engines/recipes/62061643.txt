Ingredients:
Equipment
Well-seasoned heavy-gauge aluminum pan (about 12x17x1 ½ in.)
The Dough
1 tsp. active dry yeast
1 ¼ c. warm water
1 ½ tsp. fine salt
3 c. bread flour
¼ c. olive oil for bowl, pan & drizzling
The Sauce
1 can (15 oz.) Don Peppino pizza sauce
1 can (28 oz.) Plain crushed tomatoes (No basil, puree, or citric acid)
The Cheese
½ lbs. Low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella (sliced very thinly)
¼ c. Pecorino Romano (grated)

Directions:
1.	Proof yeast in water and then combine into flour & salt (Best done in a bowl-mixer with hook attachments or food-processor). Kneed dough until smooth and form into tight ball.  Lightly oil dough & place into lightly oiled bowl, cover loosely, and let dough proof for 30-minutes or until doubled in volume.
2.	Combine pizza sauce & crushed tomatoes. Mix well.
3.	Liberally oil pan and then press dough into bottom. Randomly perforate dough with fork. Layer dough first with mozzarella; then uniformly cover with 1 cup of tomato sauce, and finally a heavy coating of Pecorino Romano. Drizzle with olive.
4.	Let pizza proof for 1 hour in a warm location.
5.	Preheat oven to 450 F.
6.	Place pan on center rack & cook for 15-20 minutes or until edges are very dark brown but before top is burnt.
7.	Traditionally sliced into 12-even squares & enjoyed with a can of Pepsi (but I prefer Coke!).

Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza-garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of pizza was also found in neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, & slightly spicy.
