Ingredients:
1 pound baby red potatoes, halved
4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 whole sprig rosemary and 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves
3 cloves garlic
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 lemons, halved
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 tablespoons chicken stock
1 whole chicken (about 3 pounds) cut into 8 pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F
In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with cold water and 2 teaspoons salt, bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until just tender. Drain and set potatoes aside.
Combine rosemary leaves, garlic, remaining salt and red pepper flakes in a mortar and crush into a paste. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, chop garlic and leaves, combine with salt and pepper flakes and, using the side of your knife, and crush into paste. In a large bowl, combine the paste with the juice of 1 lemon (save the lemon after you juice it), chicken stock, olive oil and chicken pieces. Turn the chicken until it is coated.
Heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the chicken, skin side down. Cover and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken, add the potatoes, the juice of the second lemon, the rosemary sprig and all four squeezed lemon halves. Place in the oven and roast until the chicken is cooked, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Description: 
While this dish is fairly simply it is incredibly satisfying and, if you remove the skin, a 6-ounce serving of chicken and a serving of potatoes is only 235 calories with 3 grams of fat and 1 of fiber.
