Ingredients:
3 teaspoons Himalayan pink salt, divided
1 medium white yam, peeled and rinsed
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
1 teaspoon avocado oil
1/8 teaspoon rosemary
4 cups vegetable stock
2 cups coconut milk
1 tablespoon vegan butter
1 teaspoon celery flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup quinoa flour
1 tablespoon onion powder
5 ears corn, kernels cut from cob
1/8 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Add 1 teaspoon of salt to a large pot of water and bring to a boil. Add yam. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spread carrots onto a baking sheet and drizzle with avocado oil. Season with rosemary and a pinch of salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until carrots are tender when poked with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
Combine stock, coconut milk, and vegan butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in remaining salt, celery flakes, turmeric, and black pepper and slowly bring soup to a boil, about 5 minutes.
Combine quinoa flour and onion powder in a bowl. Slowly whisk about 1/4 cup hot soup into quinoa mixture to form a loose batter. Slowly whisk batter into the soup. Reduce heat to low; let soup simmer but not boil, about 5 minutes.
Add cooked yam and carrots to soup. Stir in corn kernels and paprika. Continue cooking over low heat until heated through, about 10 minutes more. Season with salt.
