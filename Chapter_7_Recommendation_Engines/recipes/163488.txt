Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 shallots, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup vodka
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/4 cup fish sauce
2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
3/4 cup whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
4 (6 ounce) red snapper fillets
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the shallot and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the vodka, and simmer for 1 minute. Add the lemon juice, lime juice, fish sauce, sun-dried tomatoes, fennel seeds, basil, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, and cream. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced by half, 10 to 15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the linguine, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper, then dredge in the flour. Shake off the excess, and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the snapper fillets on both sides in the hot oil until nicely browned, and no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes per side.
To serve, toss the drained linguine with half of the sauce, and divide onto 4 plates. Place a snapper fillet onto each plate, and ladle on the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon orange zest to garnish.
