Ingredients:
2 sticks butter, softened
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 cups white sugar
5 eggs, at room temperature
3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted twice
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan.
Beat butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add oil; beat until creamy. Pour in sugar and beat until thoroughly incorporated, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Add to the sugar mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix in lemon zest and juice. Add extracts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 90 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack. Remove from the pan when cool.

Description: 
This is my adaptation of my favorite classic pound cake recipe. This is not difficult to make, even though it's made from scratch, and it always gets rave reviews.
