Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 pounds ground beef
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 cups long grain white rice
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup pine nuts

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and mix in salt, allspice, cinnamon, and black pepper. Cook until beef is browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Add chicken broth and rice to the saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add pine nuts and cook until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix pine nuts into rice and meat mixture before serving.
