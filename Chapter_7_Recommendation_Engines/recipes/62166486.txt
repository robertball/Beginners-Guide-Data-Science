Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sugar or equivalent sugar substitute
2 beaten eggs or 4 egg whites
1 mashed banana
1 1/2 cups flour
3 tablespoons dry cocoa
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini
1 cup chocolate chips (optional leave out for a lighter version)

Directions:
In large bowl, beat oil and sugar together. Beat in beaten eggs and vanilla. Mix in mashed banana. Set aside
In another large bowl mix flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon together and mix well.
Add dry to wet and stir well
Add in zucchini and chocolate chips if desired.
Spoon into greased loaf pan and bake at 350 for one hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let loaf cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.
* I doubled it and made two loafs, one to freeze and it still turned out good.
*Also you could leave out the zucchini and change it to just a banana recipe if you use about 3 cups mushed banana, or try 2 cups banana and 1 cup plain yogurt or apple sauce. To replace the missing moisture from the zucchini. Or optionally you can leave out the banana and opt to replace it with 1 cup apple sauce or plain yogurt.
