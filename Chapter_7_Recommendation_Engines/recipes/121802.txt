Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons cold butter or margarine
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
TOPPING:
2 egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
2 cups unsweetened raspberries

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; cut in butter. Combine egg and milk; stir into flour mixture (dough will be sticky). Press into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-in. pie plate; set aside.
In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form. Fold in raspberries. Spoon over the crust. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until browned. Cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate leftovers.
