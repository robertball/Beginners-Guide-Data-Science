1 teaspoon cumin
4 green onions, sliced
1/2 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon olive oil

Description: 
This quick and easy salsa can be made in just a few minutes with a food processor. Green onions instead of white onions give it a nice, mellow flavor to balance the kick of the jalapenos. This recipe also works well with 2-3 habanero peppers instead of the jalapenos.  But be sure to remove the seeds and membrane from the habaneros first! Grab a bag of tortilla chips, dip, eat, and enjoy!
