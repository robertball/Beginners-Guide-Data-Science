Ingredients:
2 ounces uncooked bean threads (cellophane noodles)
3 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 large clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons thin strips fresh ginger root
4 2-inch pieces fresh lemongrass, minced
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1/2-inch strips
6 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 jalapeno pepper, cut into 8 thin slices
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Soak the bean threads in a large bowl of hot water until soft, about 15 minutes; drain and cut into bite-size lengths. Divide the noodles into 4 bowls.
Bring the chicken broth, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass to a boil in a large saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low and cook the mixture at a simmer until fragrant, about 15 minutes. Add the chicken and shrimp to the soup; simmer until the chicken pieces are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir the lime juice and fish sauce through the soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles; top with jalapeno pepper slices and cilantro to serve.
