Ingredients:
4 chicken breast
8 slices center-cut bacon
salt and black pepper to taste
1 onion, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes
Seasoning Mix:
2 tablespoons dried chives
2 tablespoons dried basil
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon adobo seasoning
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle the onion over the chicken. Cover each chicken piece with bacon, trying to cover as much of the chicken as possible. Push potatoes down into the spaces between the chicken pieces and around the edge of the dish.
Combine the chives, basil, garlic powder, adobo seasoning, and black pepper in a small bowl, and sprinkle the seasoning to taste over the chicken and potatoes.Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, until the bacon is crisp and brown and the potatoes are tender. Sprinkle with salt, if desired, and serve hot.
