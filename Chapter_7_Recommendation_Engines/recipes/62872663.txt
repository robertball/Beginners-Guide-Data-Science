Ingredients:
1 cup buckwheat groat, rinsed
2 cups water
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp butter
2 tbsp oil
1 medium onion, diced
1-1/4 lb chicken hearts, trimmed, sliced 1/3...1/4 inches thick
salt and pepper to taste
3 tbsp spring onions, diced (optional)

Directions:
In a 3 quart pot with a well-fitting lid or a Dutch oven combine the water and buckwheat. Cover; bring to a boil, cook on medium high heat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cook for additional 20 minutes or until the moisture is absorbed into the grain.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and cook until golden, for 5-7 minutes.
Remove 2/3 of the onion from the pan and set aside. Add the chicken hearts and saute for 5-10 minutes on medium high heat until cooked through and starting to brown. Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat.
When the buckwheat is cooked, add 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp butter and the fried onion to the pot, stir to combine.
Serve the hearts alongside the buckwheat, sprinkled with diced spring onions.
