Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pizza crust (Pillsbury) or 1 recipe for OBB breadstick dough
2 tsp. olive oil, divided
1 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning
3 1/2 Tbsp. canned Parmesan cheese, divided
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cups loosely packed spinach leaves
8 oz. shredded, cooked chicken breast (about 2 cups)
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
Favorite pasta sauces for dipping

Directions:
Preheat oven to the temperature indicated on the dough package or recipe.
Working on a floured surface, roll pizza dough into a 12 x 15-inch rectangle. Brush 1 1/2 tsp. olive oil over entire surface of crust. Evenly sprinkle Italian seasoning and 2 Tbsp. Parmesan on top.
Keep remaining toppings one inch away from all edges, evenly spread the spinach leaves, shredded chicken, and tomatoes over the dough.
Working from the long end of the rectangle, roll up from one end to the other (like a cinnamon roll). Pinch seam shut and then pinch each end shut and tuck under toward seam.
Place seam-side down on a baking sheet sprayed lightly with nonstick spray. Brush remaining 1/2 tsp. olive oil on top and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 Tbsp. Parmesan cheese. Gently cut 3 slits along the top of the Stromboli.
Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing into 1-inch slices. Serve with marinara and/or Alfredo sauce for dipping.
