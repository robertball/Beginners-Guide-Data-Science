Ingredients:
1 oz (30 g) 69 or 70% dark chocolate (3 squares of a standard 100 g bar)
1 Tbsp cocoa powder
1 Tbsp brown sugar
3/4 cup (175 ml) milk
Pinch of cayenne pepper (or spice of your desire: nutmeg, cinnamon, and/or ground cloves would work)

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk, chocolate (break into small pieces), cocoa, and brown sugar.
Once the chocolate starts to melt, gently whisk to combine ingredients.
Just bring the mixture to boil.
Add desired spices and whisk again until combined.
Pour and enjoy.

Description: 
Delicious, thick, real drinking chocolate. This is not your plebeian hot chocolate. This is the real stuff. Inspired by the ancient South American recipe, with a bit of European richness for extra (healthy) luxury.
