Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
3 cups turbinado sugar
1/2 cup steel-cut oats
1/2 cup slivered blanched almonds
1 1/2 cups Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon heavy cream
5 eggs at room temperature
1 cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Coat with 1 tablespoon butter.
Grind turbinado sugar to a fine consistency in a food processor. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with oats and almonds, grinding each into a fine meal.
Sift ground almonds, ground oats, cocoa powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Combine ground sugar and 1 cup melted butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Blend in vanilla extract and cream. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition. Add almond mixture; beat until blended. Fold chocolate chips into the batter.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, 35 to 40 minutes.
