Description: 
First made in August, 2003. Absolutely the best pizza dough I've ever made. I made calzones for the first time with this. I like to add sugar to the dough or maybe garlic or some other spice for added flavor. Even cheese is great! 

*I don't even use a bread machine for this recipe. I just follow regular bread making guidelines, and it still comes out great. :-)
