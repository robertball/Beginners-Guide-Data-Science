Ingredients:
1 Devils Food cake Mix: made according to directions
1 large box of instant chocolate pudding.
1/2 cup milk
1 cup Kahlua
1 cup Heath bar pieces or 6 Heath bars frozen then chopped (can use Skor or 5th Avenue bars if you can't find Heath bars)
1 large container Cool Whip

Directions:
Mix and bake cake mix according to directions.  Combine the pudding mix, milk and Kahlua.  In a large glass bowl, layer 1/2 of the cake, 1/2 of the pudding mix, 1/2 of the Cool Whip, and 1/2 of the  candy bar pieces.  Then repeat layers.  Best if done day before you serve it so the Kahlua soaks into the cake some.
