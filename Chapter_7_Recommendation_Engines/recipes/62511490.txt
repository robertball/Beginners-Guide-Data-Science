Ingredients:
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 egg whites, whipped
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 tsp cloves
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Spray baking sheet with cooking spray. In a large bowl combine pumpkin and egg whites. In a separate bowl combine sugar, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, oats, and raisins (batter will be very dry at first). Mix ingredients together just until moistened.
Drop cookies by tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheet, 2" apart. You can leave the cookies in the shape of a ball (the baked cookie will still be a ball) or flatten them out with the bottom of a glass before baking.
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.

Description: 
Great for the holidays or anytime you crave pumpkin.  Hard to believe how healthy they are!
Here is the original recipe, but I make mine with whole wheat flour and semi sweet chocolate chips.
