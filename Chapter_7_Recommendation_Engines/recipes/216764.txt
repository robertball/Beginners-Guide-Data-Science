Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 cup papaya - peeled, seeded and cubed
1 habanero pepper, seeded and chopped (wear gloves)
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 tablespoon melted butter
3 (4 ounce) fillets mahi mahi
3 tablespoons sliced almonds
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the red bell pepper, papaya, and habanero pepper. Continue cooking a few more minutes until the bell pepper begins to soften. Stir together the cornstarch, water, and 2 tablespoons of lime juice. Stir into the papaya sauce until thickened, stirring constantly. Keep the sauce warm over very low heat.
Stir 1 tablespoon of lime juice together with the melted butter, and brush on the mahi mahi fillets. Place onto a  broiler pan.
Cook under the preheated broiler for 4 minutes, then turn the fish over, and continue cooking for 4 minutes more. Sprinkle the almonds over the fish and return to the broiler until the almonds are crisp and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and serve with the papaya sauce.
