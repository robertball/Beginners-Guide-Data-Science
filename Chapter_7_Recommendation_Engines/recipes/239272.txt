Ingredients:
12 small beets
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup thinly sliced onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place beets in a shallow pan.
Roast beets in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove pan from oven and cool beets until easily handled, at least 15 minutes.
Peel beets and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
Beat balsamic vinegar, honey, and red wine vinegar together with a whisk in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
Mix beets and onion in a bowl. Drizzle dressing over beet mixture and toss to coat; refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
