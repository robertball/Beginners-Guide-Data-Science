Ingredients:
4 cups whole wheat ziti or penne pasta, cooked according to package directions
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup flour
3 cups fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk
1 cup fat-free chicken broth
1/2 cup dry white wine (or additional chicken broth)
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups sliced white button mushrooms
2 cups diced cooked turkey breast (1/2-inch dice)
1/3 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon pepper (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.   Spray a shallow two to three-quart baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and stir in flour.  Cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes.  Whisk in fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk, chicken broth, wine and pepper (optional); bring mixture to a boil.  Stir in mushrooms, reduce heat and cook, stirring frequently about 10 minutes or until mixture thickens and mushrooms are softened.
Stir Parmesan cheese, pasta, turkey and peas into the fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk mixture; spoon into prepared dish.  Top with Cheddar cheese and cover loosely with foil.  Bake about 45 minutes or until bubbling at edges and heated through.
