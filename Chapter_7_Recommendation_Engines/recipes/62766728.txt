Ingredients:
8 sheets fresh lasagna noodles
Filling
1 medium butternut squash, baked, peeled and mashed to  make 1 1/2 cups (375 mL)
2 tbsp (30 mL) Amaretti cookies, crushed
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups (375 mL) Tre Stelle® Grana Padano Parmesan Cheese, grated
salt and pepper to taste
Sauce
1/2 cup (125 mL) butter
6 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced
Additional Tre Stelle® Grana Padano Parmesan
grated for garnish, if desired

Directions:
Filling:
In a medium bowl combine squash, crushed cookies, egg and Grana Padano Parmesan, salt and pepper, stir until completely mixed; set aside or refrigerate until ready to use.
Lay one lasagna noodle sheet on a lightly floured surface. Drop 6 teaspoon sized spoonfuls of squash mixture in two rows along sheet. Using your finger, dampen the dough around the filling with water. Place a second sheet of lasagna noodle over filling sheet. Seal each mound pressing the air out with your fingertips as you go. Cut between the filling, making 6 ravioli and press the seal even further; set aside. Repeat with remaining 6 sheets.
In a large pot of boiling salted water add the ravioli and cook for approximately 7 minutes or until “˜al dente”™.
Sauce:
Meanwhile melt the butter in a small saucepan, add the sage and cook for approximately 2 minutes; remove from
heat and allow to “˜steep”™ while ravioli are cooking. Remove ravioli using a slotted spoon. Place on a serving platter
and drizzle with sage infused butter. Sprinkle with additional Grana Padano Parmesan and serve.
