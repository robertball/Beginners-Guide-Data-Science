Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package dry penne pasta
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
3 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves cut in small chuncks
3 tablespoons basil pesto
1 teaspoon dried basil
3 big cloves garlic, minced or grated
1 (8 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, chopped
1/2 cup diced fresh mozerella cheese
1/2 cup ricotta cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until no longer pink, and juices run clear. Set aside to cool, then slice into bite-size pieces. In a medium bowl, combine remaining olive oil, pesto, basil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, feta and ricotta. Mix until smooth.
In the large skillet, toss fettuccini with sauce and chicken. Cook on low heat 5 minutes, or until heated through.
