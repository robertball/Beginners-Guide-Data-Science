Description: 
A combination between a club sandwich and a regular old hamburger.

Some great side dishes to serve with burger club sandwiches are French fries and potato chips. If you want healthier side dishes, you can serve your burgers with few slices of vegetables or salads of your choice.

You can also add some relish, pickles, and mustard to these burgers.
