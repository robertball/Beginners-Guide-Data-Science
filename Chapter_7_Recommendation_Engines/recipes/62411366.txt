Ingredients:
5 pounds baby red potatoes, halved
6 cloves garlic, minced
3/4 cup butter substitute "for cooking and baking" melted and slightly cooled
1 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon coarse Kosher or sea salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped
8 ounces bleu cheese crumble
Thyme sprigs for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Spray a large roasting pan with cooking spray. (A pan with lower sides works best.)
Toss the potatoes, garlic, butter substitute, broth, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until the potatoes are evenly coated; pour into the prepared pan.
Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven until they begin to brown, about 40 minutes.
Remove pan from the oven and toss the potatoes with the thyme, rotating the outside potatoes into the center for even baking. If the potatoes seem too dry, add another 1/2 cup broth (or  the remaining broth if using a 14-oz can) to the pan.
Return the pan to the oven and roast until potatoes are completely done but not mushy, about 20-40 more minutes. (Check them after 20 minutes.)
When potatoes are rosted to your satisfaction, remove the pan from the oven and transfer them to a serving dish.  Top with the bleu cheese crumble and garnish with thyme sprigs to serve.
