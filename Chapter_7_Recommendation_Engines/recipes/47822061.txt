Ingredients:
2 Tbsp. soy sauce
1 tsp. cornstarch
1 tsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. sesame oil
1/4 tsp. pepper
_____________________
1 Tbsp. butter
2 tsp. freshly grated gingerroot
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh shitake or cremini mushrooms
1 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
-----------------------------
4 cups (1L) finely shredded suey choy (or Napa cabbage), white core removed
1/3 cup coarsely chopped salted peanuts
-----------------------------
6-8 sheets phyllo pastry, thawed according to directions
1/3 cup melted butter

Directions:
Stir soy, cornstarch, sugar, sesame oil and pepper together in bowl.  Set aside.
In large frying pan, stir fry ginger in butter for about 15 seconds.  Add mushrooms, carrot, onion and cilantro to frying pan and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Stir soy mixture and add to vegetables.  Mixture will thicken immediately.
Stir cabbage and peanuts into vegetable mixture and remove from heat. Set aside to cool.
Lay one sheet of phyllo pastry vertically on counter and brush with melted butter.  Fold top half down and press down so it sticks together.  Spoon vegetable mixture across short end of the phyllo, forming a 1 1/2 “ roll.  Carefully roll phyllo tightly around mixture folding in the sides as you go.   Seal with small amount of melted butter.  Place on a cookie sheet, sealed side down.  Brush top lightly with butter and score on diagonal (not too deep) about 1” apart.  Continue with remaining sheets and mixture.  At this point, you can wrap each roll in plastic wrap and freeze on a cookie sheet.  Keeps up to 2 weeks.  Bake at 375 for 15 minutes.  Cool slightly and cut at scored intervals.  Trim brown ends.
