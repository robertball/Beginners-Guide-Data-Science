Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 cups evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup slivered almonds, roasted
1/2 cup chopped peaches

Directions:
Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.
Combine evaporated milk and salt in a large pot over medium-high heat and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in oats, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook, stirring frequently, until oats are tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in maple syrup, cinnamon, almonds, and peaches. Allow oatmeal to thicken for 5 minutes.
Divide the oatmeal between the prepared muffin cups. Place muffin pan in the freezer until oatmeal is frozen solid, 8 hours to overnight. Pop out each frozen muffin disk and store in a freezer-safe, quart-sized bag.
To serve place 1 or 2 frozen oatmeal disks in a bowl. Microwave on high power for 1 1/2 to 3 minutes stirring halfway through, or until oatmeal is hot.

Description: 
This is a versatile recipe which can be modified to suit your preferences. Frozen oatmeal can be transported from freezer to bowl for a hearty morning breakfast! I prefer using evaporated milk for extra creaminess, but you can use regular milk or a mixture of water and milk.
