Ingredients:
6 cups hot water, divided
2 beef bouillon cubes
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 large onion, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 cups pearl barley

Directions:
Heat 2 cups water to boiling in a microwave-safe bowl, about 2 minutes. Stir beef bouillon cubes and onion soup mix into boiling water until dissolved.
Pour bouillon mixture and remaining 4 cups water into a slow cooker; set cooker on High. Stir beef, potatoes, onion, carrots, celery, and garlic into the slow cooker.
Cook, covered, until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Stir barley into beef mixture; continue cooking until barley is tender, about 30 minutes.
Turn slow cooker off, remove cover, and allow to cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
