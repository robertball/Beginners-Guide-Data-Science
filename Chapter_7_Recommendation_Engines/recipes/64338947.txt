Ingredients:
1 large bunches collard greens
1 clove garlic, finely minced
1 Tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds*

Directions:
Wash your collard greens, remove the stems and chop the leaves into bite sized pieces. Steam the greens  for about 10 minutes. Once done take them out and let them cool until they are cool enough to handle. I like to squeeze any excess moisture out.
*To toast the sesame seeds - place the seeds in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Make sure to stay with the pan because this should take less than 2 minutes. Shake the pan back and forth over the heat as the seeds start to brown. Once they are nice and brown add the collard greens, soy sauce and garlic to the pan and raise heat to high. Cook for 2-3 minutes just to cook the garlic.
