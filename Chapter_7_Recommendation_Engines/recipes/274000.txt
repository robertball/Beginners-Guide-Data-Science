Ingredients:
1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts (2 pie crusts)
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste
1 serving cooking spray

Directions:
Place 1 pie crust onto a lightly floured surface and roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Using a 2-1/4-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter cut the pie crust into 10 circles. Repeat with the second pie crust for a total of 20 pie crust circles.
Fill about 1/2 of each circle with apple pie filling. Place a second pie crust circle on top, making a mini pie. Do not overfill. Press down the edges of the mini pies, crimping with a fork to seal. Brush tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.
Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place a batch of the mini pies in the air fryer basket, leaving space around each for air circulation.
Bake until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the basket and bake remaining pies. Serve warm or at room temperature.
