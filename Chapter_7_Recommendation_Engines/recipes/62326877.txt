Ingredients:
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 TBSP margarine
1/2 cup boiling water
6 TBSP cornmeal
1 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/4 cup milk
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 egg yolk
1/2 tsp water
food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine rolled oats, margarine, and boiling water.  Let stand 10 minutes. Grease cookie sheets or use parchment paper.
Thoroughly stir in cornmeal, bouillon, milk, Cheddar cheese, and egg.
Mix in peanut butter until blended.
Mix in flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a stiff dough has formed. You may have to knead the last of the flour into the dough.
On a floured surface, knead in as much flour as necessary until the dough is no longer sticky. Roll or pat out dough to 1/2" thickness. Cut with cookie cutter and place 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Mix egg yolk and 1/2 tsp of water until well blended. Add a few drops of food coloring and mix well. (You may divide the mixture in half and make two colors if you like. Use a small paintbrush to paint designs onto the biscuits.
Bake 35 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Baking time may vary according to the size of the cutter used.
Cool before serving. Store in a loosely covered container.
