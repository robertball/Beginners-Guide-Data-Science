Ingredients:
1 pound ground Italian sausage
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 large white onion, diced
4 strips bacon, diced
2 teaspoons garlic puree
10 cups water
5 cubes chicken bouillon
1 pound russet potatoes, diced
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 bunch kale, chopped

Directions:
Combine sausage and red pepper flakes in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until sausage is brown and crumbled, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat; place in a bowl.
Cook onion, bacon, and garlic in the same skillet over medium-low heat until bacon is crisp and onions are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine water and chicken bouillon cubes in a large pot; bring to a boil. Stir in potatoes; cook and stir until soft, about 15 minutes. Pour in cream; simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add sausage, onion mixture, and kale; cook and stir until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
