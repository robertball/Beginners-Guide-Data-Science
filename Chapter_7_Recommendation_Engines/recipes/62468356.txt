Ingredients:
4 lbs Russet Potatoes
2 Bay Leaves
2 cups heavy
4 TBS Real Butter

1 TBS Chives

Directions:
Boil 4 pounds of potatoes in salted water with two bay leaves until tender. Heat heavy cream and butter. Drain potatoes and removed bay leaves. Add heated cream and butter mixture, white pepper and chives to potatoes and mash until smooth. I use an electric mixer to really make the potatoes creamy. Serve hot!
