Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups shredded carrots
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13x2-inch baking dish.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, ground cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat carrots, mandarin oranges, oil, eggs, vanilla extract, and orange zest into flour mixture with an electric mixer until batter is smooth, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
A less-dense and wonderfully moist carrot cake with canned mandarin oranges rather than pineapple. A friend shared the recipe with me and I made it to celebrate the birth of my son (a birthday cake). It tastes best if you let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.
