Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick fries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Melt butter with cinnamon, white and brown sugar, ginger, and salt in a large microwave-safe glass bowl on high, 1 to 2 minutes; remove from oven and stir until mixture is thoroughly combined.
Dredge sweet potato pieces in the butter-brown sugar mixture to coat. Arrange fries on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until fries are tender and coating has baked onto the fries, 30 to 35 minutes.
