1 tsp. vanilla
1/4 tsp. salt

1 egg
3/4 tsp. baking soda
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1-1/2 c. fresh whole wheat pastry flour

3/4 c. chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine oil, sugar, vanilla, salt, yogurt, and egg; mix well.  Stir in baking soda and baking powder.  Add flour and stir until well combined; stir in chocolate chips.  Fill paper-lined or greased muffin cups 3/4 full.  Bake for 18 minutes or until done.

Description: 
These are so light you would never believe that they're whole-grain!  They're almost more like dessert than breakfast. (And they do include sugar and chocolate chips, which I wouldn't normally eat for breakfast.)  If you don't have millet, you can use all wheat flour.
