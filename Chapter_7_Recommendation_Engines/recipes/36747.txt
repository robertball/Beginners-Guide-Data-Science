Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
1/4 cup honey
1 3/4 cups warm water (110 degrees F)
2 tablespoons plain low-fat yogurt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
2 cups whole wheat flour
1/3 cup coarsely chopped walnuts, toasted
2 teaspoons salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and honey in warm water in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt and oil. Lightly spoon flours into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Add 21/2 cups all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, walnuts, and salt to yeast mixture; stir until blended. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands (dough will feel tacky).
Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in size. Punch dough down; let rest 5 minutes. Roll into a 14 x 7-inch rectangle on a floured surface. Roll up rectangle tightly, starting with a short edge, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch seam and ends to seal. Place roll, seam side down, in a 9 x 5-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray. Cover and let rise 30 minutes or until doubled in size.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Uncover dough. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until loaf is browned on bottom and sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from pan; cool on a wire rack.
