Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups masa harina
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons lard or shortening
1 1/4 cups water

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together masa harina and salt. In a small pan over high heat, bring lard to a boil and stir until melted. Pour into the masa harina and blend well with a fork and pastry blender. Knead on lightly floured board until smooth, about 5 minutes.
Divide dough into 12 pieces and roll into a ball about 1-inch in diameter. Cover the tortilla ball with plastic so they don't dry out. One at a time, roll each ball out between 2 pieces of waxed paper with a rolling pin or between 2 pieces of seran wrap if you own a tortilla press (the press is the method I prefer and is much easier).
Heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Place the raw tortilla in the skillet. Cook on one side about 30 seconds, then flip and brown on second side, about 30 seconds.
Keep warm in cloth towel until others finished.

Description: 
My hispanic grandma (Mamasita) made homemade tortillas 3 times a day when I was growing up.  She never gave me exact measurements, so I had to learn by trial and error.  I have finally found the measurements that work for me.  Feel free to adjust to you tastes.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I did as a child and still do.
