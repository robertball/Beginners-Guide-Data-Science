Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small diced sweet onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach , thawed, drained and squeezed dry
1 (4 oz.) can green chilies
1 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
10 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 (19 ounce) can enchilada sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add bell pepper; cook for 2 minutes.  Add garlic and onion; cook for a few minutes until fragrant, but not brown. Stir in spinach, and cook for about 5 more minutes. Remove from the heat, and mix in ricotta cheese, sour cream, and 1 cup of Monterey Jack cheese.
Add just enough enchilada sauce to bottom of 9x13 inch baking dish to cover it.
In a skillet over medium heat, warm tortillas one at a time until flexible, about 15 seconds. Spoon about 1/4 cup of the spinach mixture onto the center of each tortilla. Roll up, and place seam side down in baking dish. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top, and sprinkle with the remaining cup of Monterey Jack.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until sauce is bubbling and cheese is lightly browned at the edges.
