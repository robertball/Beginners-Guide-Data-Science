Description: 
I call this a Stoop because it's thicker than soup, but not as thick as a traditional stew.  Preparing everything in advance makes putting it all together a breeze.  I love to bake a fresh pan of homemade cornbread to serve along with this dish.Modified from: Savory Vegetable Beef Stew
