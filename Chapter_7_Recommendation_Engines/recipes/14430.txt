Ingredients:
3 red potatoes
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups creamy salad dressing

Directions:
Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes; cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and cool.
Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool.
Peel the eggs and cut around the egg white; keep the yolk whole.
Dice the egg whites and potatoes. Combine in a mixing bowl and add the salad dressing.
Toss the potatoes and egg; crumble the egg yolk on top and serve chilled.
