Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
2 ripe pears, halved and cored
1 tablespoon olive oil
all-purpose flour for dusting
1 unbaked pizza crust
1 tablespoon cornmeal for dusting
6 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
5 thin slices prosciutto, cut into halves
1 (6 ounce) package fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Place the garlic in a small square of aluminum foil. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over the garlic. Wrap foil around garlic to seal.
Roast the garlic in the preheated oven until soft, about 20 minutes. Smash roasted cloves with a fork.
Place the pears in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil; toss to coat. Arrange pear slices on a baking sheet.
Bake in hot oven until soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Raise oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Preheat a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.
Lightly dust a flat surface with flour. Roll the prepared pizza crust dough out onto the prepared surface. Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Lay the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread the mashed garlic onto the dough; top with the Swiss cheese. Arrange the pears, prosciutto, and mozzarella cheese onto the pizza. Season with salt and pepper. Brush the edges of the crust with the 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
