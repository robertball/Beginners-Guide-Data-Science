Description: 
This is a copycat recipe. An appetizing cheese dip with seasoned beef, best served with warm chips.
NOTE:
Serve in a small skillet such as the restaurant does. If one is not available though, another good option is to serve it in a small (pre-heated) crock pot on low heat, to keep the cheese from cooling and thickening.
