2 cups crispy rice cereal
2 cups dry-roasted peanuts
2 cups candy-coated milk chocolate pieces

Directions:
In a large bowl, toss together the toasted oat cereal, rice cereal, peanuts and chocolate pieces; set aside. Grease a 10x15 inch jellyroll pan.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, stir together the corn syrup and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and  cook until sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and quickly stir into the peanut butter and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the bowl with the cereal mixture and mix well. Press into the prepared pan. Let stand until set. Cut into bars and serve.

This is a great recipe for kids! It's easy to make and you don't have to bake it.  This is always a hit at potlucks and family get-togethers. Very colorful! My mom made this growing up, and I have seen different variations in cook books.  Enjoy!
