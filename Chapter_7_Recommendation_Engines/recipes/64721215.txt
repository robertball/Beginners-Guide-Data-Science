Ingredients:
1 lemon, juiced and zested
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon Ras El Hanout
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 (6-8 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
1 medium sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1" chunks
1 medium zucchini, cut into 1" chunks
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 (14 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, drained
1 teaspoon Ras El Hanout
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup pomegranate seeds
2 tablespoons shelled pistachios, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup parsley, chopped

Directions:
In a resealable plastic storage bag, combine lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons Ras El Hanout and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Place chicken thighs into the bag, making sure marinade gets under skin. Seal and let marinate for at least 30 mins. Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 minutes before baking and let come to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 400F.
In a medium bowl, combine sweet potato, zucchini, chickpeas and artichoke hearts. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon Ras El Hanout and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle with olive oil and stir to combine evenly.
Remove chicken from marinade and place on a 13 x 18 rimmed sheet pan. Place vegetable mixture around chicken.  Bake for 30 minutes, flipping vegetables halfway through, or until chicken has reached internal temperature of 165 F.
Remove from oven and garnish with pomegranate seeds, pistachios and parsley before serving.
Cook's notes: To make cleanup easier, line sheet pan with foil.
Place pistachios into a small resealable storage bag and crush with a rolling pin or meat tenderizer.
The sweet potato used for this recipe was about 14 oz.
