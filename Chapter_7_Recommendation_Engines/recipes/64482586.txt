Ingredients:
Zucchini shredded into noodles
oven roasted tomatoes
loose pesto - basil, garlic, olive oil
Olives?
Parmesan or feta?

Directions:
To make the noodles you simply run a zucchini across a mandoline
You take handfuls of basil, which is also plentiful this time of year, and make a loose pesto. I call it a loose pesto because it’s a loose approximation of a pesto. There’s no cheese or pine nuts, just basil, olive oil, garlic, and salt.
The final ingredient is oven-dried tomatoes
Slice the tomatoes up and add them to the zucchini and pesto.
