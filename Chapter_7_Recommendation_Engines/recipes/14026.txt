Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 head fresh broccoli, minced
1 head cauliflower, finely chopped
1 bunch radishes, finely diced
4 large carrots, shredded
1 bunch green onions, chopped
8 ounces shredded Swiss cheese
1 (2.5 ounce) jar imitation bacon bits

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Unroll crescent rolls onto a baking sheet, and press together the seams to form a single sheet of dough.
Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool.
Mix cream cheese and mayonnaise together and spread the mixture onto the top of each crescent roll. Sprinkle dill weed or garlic salt over crescent rolls. Arrange the broccoli, cauliflower, radishes and carrots on top of the cheese and mayonnaise mixture.
Sprinkle the cheese over the veggies. Sprinkle the imitation bacon bits over the shredded cheese. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Before serving cut the crescent rolls into squares.

Description: 
Every so often I treat my co-workers to something I make at home.  They love this treat.  Not many calories and good too. You can use any kind of cheese you like. Sprinkle these with garlic salt if you think they need a little more oomph!
