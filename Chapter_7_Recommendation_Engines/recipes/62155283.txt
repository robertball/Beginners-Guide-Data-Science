Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups grated raw potatoes
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup leftover mashed potatoes
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper
1/2 cup cheddar cheese (or other type of cheese you prefer)
2 table spoons ranch salad dressing (or italian)

Directions:
1. Mix together grated potatos with 1 cup of flour in a large bowl.  Stir 1 cup of mashed potatos and the salt and pepper.
2. In a separate bowl lightly beat the egg, mix in the milk and salad dressing; mix into the potato mixture.
3. Heat a well oiled skillet over medium heat. Place potato mixture in the skillet forming small circular cakes(make sure they are thin enough so the grated potato cooks thoroughly).  Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
