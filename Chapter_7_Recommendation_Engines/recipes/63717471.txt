Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp sugar
1 package (1/4 ounce) quick-rise yeast
1-1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp dried minced onion
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/4 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1-1/2 cups warm water (120° to 130°)
1 egg, lightly beaten
Coarse salt
Salsa con queso dip

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, yeast, salt, minced onion and spices. Add water. Beat just until moistened. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 4-6 minutes. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Divide dough into 16 equal portions; roll each into a 15-in. rope. Cover and let rest 10 minutes longer.
Twist into pretzel shapes. Place on greased baking sheets; brush with egg. Bake at 350° for 15 minutes. Brush again with egg; sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake 10-13 minutes longer or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks. Serve pretzels warm with dip. Yield: 16 pretzels.
How-To: 1. Roll each of the 16 pieces of dough into a 15-inch rope and taper the ends. 2. Shape each rope into a circle with about 2-in. of each end overlapping. 3. Twist the ends where they overlap. 4. Flip the twisted ends over the circle; place ends over the edge and pinch under.
