Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp nutmeg
3/4 tsp cinnamon
1 cup mashed, cooked sweet potato
1/4 cup dark brown sugar (I reduced this down from 1/2 cup)
3 tbsp canola oil
2 tbsp dried cranberries (optional - I didn’t use it, but wonder if they might be good with apple?)
1/4 cup milk - use either whole milk, breast milk or formula (I used skim)
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350.
Mix the oats, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder and spices together in a bowl.
Add the mashed sweet potato, sugar, oil, dried fruit, milk and egg and mix together until the ingredients are all completely moistened - but don’t over-mix.
Spoon the mixture into greased muffin tins and bake until firm and golden (around 15 to 20 mins).
