Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, minced
8 oz raw bacon, diced
2 lbs ground beef
6 oz cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 cup bread crumbs
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tsp salt

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 450. Brush a 13x9 baking dish with 1 tbsp olive oil. Heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and bacon and saut√©, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer onions and bacon from the pan to a small plate. Let cool.
3. Combine bacon, onions, and the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl, and mix by hand until thoroughly incorporated.
4. Roll the mixture into 24 golf-ball-size meatballs, making sure to pack the meat firmly. Place the balls in the prepared baking dish, and roast until cooked through, 18-20 minutes.
5. Allow the meatballs to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
