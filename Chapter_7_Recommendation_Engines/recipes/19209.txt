Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese

2 eggs
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and  white sugar, until smooth. Beat in the cream cheese, then the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Divide the dough in half and press each half onto a prepared pizza pan.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden at the edges. Cool completely in pans on wire racks. Cut into wedges like a pizza and serve.
