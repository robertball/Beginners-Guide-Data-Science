Description: 
This is a delicious way to use quinoa. It's comfort food with a healthy twist with vegetables and low calorie cheeses.  I adapted it from a recipe foud in Eating Well. Although it's gluten free, it doesn't taste like it. You can check out other quinoa recipes on my blog, www.foodcrazyinbeaufort.blogspot.com
