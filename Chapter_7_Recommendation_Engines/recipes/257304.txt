Ingredients:
10 eggs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon ketchup

Directions:
Place eggs in a large pot and cover with cool water. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Transfer eggs to a bowl of cold water using tongs. Peel.
Cut eggs in half. Slice a small piece off bottoms so halves don't tip over. Place yolks in a mixing bowl. Add mayonnaise, mustard, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Mix until creamy, 1 or 2 minutes.
Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves. Garnish with a dot of ketchup on top. Refrigerate about 20 minutes before serving.
