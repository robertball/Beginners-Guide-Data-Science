Ingredients:
6 scallops
½ cup flour
5½ cups of chicken broth
4 Tbls. butter
1 cup onion, finely chopped
8 ounces white mushrooms, finely chopped
1½ cups arborio rice
½ cup white wine
1 cup of frozen peas, thawed
1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
¼ cup parsley, minced
1 tsp. lemon zest
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium sized saucepan, bring chicken broth to a simmer.
Pat scallops dry and season with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour and set aside.
In a large skillet over medium heat add butter. When melted, add onions and saute until softened, 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add in mushrooms, and saute until tender and the juices have evaporated, about 10­ minutes, stirring occasionally. Next, add in arborio rice, and cook stirring one minute. Add wine and stir until liquid is absorbed, 2 minutes.
Turn the skillet down to medium-low and add in 1 cup of the broth to the skillet. Stir gently until most of the liquid is absorbed. Keep adding stock a cup at a time and stirring until all of the broth is incorporated (this takes approximately 29-32 minutes). At this point taste the rice. It should be tender and creamy but still have a slight bite to it. Stir in peas, parsley, and freshly grated parmesan cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Heat another large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbls. olive oil. When oil is hot add scallops to the pan and sear for 2 minutes on each side.
Remove from skillet and serve over risotto.
