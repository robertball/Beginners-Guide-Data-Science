Ingredients:
2 oz organic cocoa, about 1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons
11 oz powdered sugar, about 2 3/4 cups
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 egg whites, at room temp
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 Â– 1 cup dried, unsweetened coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets with palm shortening or line with parchment paper.
Stir dry ingredients (except coconut) together in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.
On low speed and add egg whites one at a time. Add vanilla extract and turn mixer on high for about 2 minutes, until the batter has thickened.
Gently and briefly fold the coconut in. Don't mix it in completely.
Drop batter (about the side of a rounded measuring tablespoon) onto a prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 13-15 minutes. Cookie should be puffed and cracked. You can let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet or remove them and let cool on a wire rack.
