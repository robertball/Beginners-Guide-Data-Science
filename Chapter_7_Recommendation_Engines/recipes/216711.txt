Ingredients:
2 quarts corn oil for frying
1/4 cup milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup beer
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 pounds cheese curds, broken apart

Directions:
Heat corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk together milk, flour, beer, salt, and eggs to form a smooth, rather thin batter. Place cheese curds, about 6 or 8 at a time, into the batter, stir to coat, and remove with wire strainer. Shake the curds a time or two to remove excess batter. Deep fry the curds until golden brown, 1 or 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels; serve hot.
