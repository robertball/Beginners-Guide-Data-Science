Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1-2 full size carrots, or 1 bag baby carrots
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Line a 9x13 pan with foil.
Combine olive oil, salt, pepper and carrots in a bag - toss to coat (I used the baby carrot bag).
Bake at 425 for 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and sprinkle the balsamic vinegar over the carrots. Toss/shake the pan to coat.
Return the carrots to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes until the balsamic has penetrated the carrots and evaporated from the dish.
