Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 (15 ounce) cans pizza sauce, divided
2 large Vidalia or sweet onions, thinly sliced
4 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water.  Add 2 tablespoons oil, salt and enough flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.  Press dough onto the bottom and 1 in. up the sides of two greased 14-in. pizza pans.  Spread 3/4 cup pizza sauce over each.  Bake at 450 degrees F for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onions in remaining oil until tender.
Arrange tomato slices over pizzas.  Combine cheeses; sprinkle over tomatoes.  Top with onions.  Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.  Warm remaining pizza sauce; serve with pizza.

Description: 
For me, pizza is a staple of life. I worked at a pizza restaurant after college, and I've been trying ever since to re-create the wonderful pizza crust we served. This version, which my family loves, comes pretty close. -Herman Temple, Shawnee, Kansas
