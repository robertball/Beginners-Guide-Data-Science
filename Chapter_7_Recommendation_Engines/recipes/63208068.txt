Description: 
My mom has been making the stew for many years and it is by far the BEST stew I have ever tasted. It is hearty, filling and inexpensive not to mention extremely delicious and fairly easy to make, the hardest part and the most time consuming part for this stew is preparing the vegetables. I chop and dice all my vegetables by hand and so it can consume a little bit more time but very much worth the extra time it takes.
