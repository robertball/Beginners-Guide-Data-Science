Ingredients:
24 Shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
2 teaspoons Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb Seasoning
24 slices of Bacon
Log of Garlic & Herb Goat Cheese

Directions:
Combine Shrimp, Olive Oil, and Mrs. Dash in a bowl and stir to combine.  Let Shrimp sit for 10 minutes to allow the ingredients to meld together.
In a medium frying pan, heat Olive Oil over medium heat.  Add Shrimp (may want to do 12 at a time) and cook for 4 minutes, flipping the Shrimp over after the first 2 minutes.  Set Shrimp aside to cool.
Cook Bacon, either in a frying pan or in the microwave, until Bacon is mostly cooked, but still flexible.  In my microwave, that is about 2 minutes, doing 4 pieces at a time.
Make 1/2" balls of Garlic & Herb Goat Cheese and place one ball of cheese in the middle of each cooked Shrimp.  Wrap one strip of warm Bacon around each stuffed Shrimp and place a toothpick through the middle to secure the Bacon.
These can be served immediately or can be placed in the refrigerator and warmed up before serving.  To heat again, put in over at 350 degrees for 4 minutes.
