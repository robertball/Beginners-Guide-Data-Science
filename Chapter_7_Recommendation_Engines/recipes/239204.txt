Ingredients:
4 pork chops
3 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons seasoned salt
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 large tomato, cut into 1/4-inch slices

Directions:
Arrange pork chops in a baking dish.
Whisk basil, onion powder, and seasoned salt together in a bowl.
Drizzle half of the balsamic vinegar over pork chops and spread to evenly coat; top with half of the basil mixture. Flip pork chops and coat with remaining balsamic vinegar and basil mixture. Place 1 tomato slice on top of each pork chop and let stand for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove baking dish from oven and allow pork chops to sit in the dish for 10 minutes.
