Ingredients:
1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 cup toasted wheat germ
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup evaporated milk, heated
1 cup mashed sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons milk
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, wheat germ, baking powder, and salt. Mix in butter, evaporated milk, sweet potatoes, milk, and nutmeg, stirring by hand until dough is smooth.
On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough until it is about 1/2-inch thick. With a sharp knife, cut into 3-inch squares or diamonds. Place squares on greased baking sheet, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
Yummy sweet potato biscuits that rival Steamer's biscuits in Chincoteague, Virginia.  You'll taste no better than this! My family hates sweet potatoes, but they snatch these up every time I make them!  You could also substitute pumpkin for the sweet potato and cardamom for the nutmeg.
