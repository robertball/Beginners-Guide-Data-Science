Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) pork roast
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots
1/2 cup chopped pistachio nuts
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup apricot nectar
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup coarsely crushed cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
To cut pork roast into a large rectangle that can be filled and rolled, cut lengthwise about 1/2 inch from top of pork to within 1/2 inch of opposite edge; open flat. Repeat with other side of pork, cutting from the inside edge to the outer edge; open flat to form rectangle.
Sprinkle apricots, nuts, garlic, salt and pepper over pork to within 1 inch of edge. Tightly roll up pork, beginning with short side. Secure with toothpicks, or tie with string. Pierce pork all over with metal skewer. Brush apricot nectar over entire surface. Let stand 15 minutes. Brush again with remaining apricot nectar. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours but no longer than 24 hours.
Heat oven to 325 . Place pork, fat side up, on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so tip is in thickest part of pork. Roast uncovered 1 1/2 hours.
To make Crunchy Topping: Melt margarine in 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Stir in crushed cracker crumbs, pistachio nuts and garlic salt. Cook and stir 1 minute; cool.
Brush preserves over pork. Sprinkle with topping. Roast uncovered 30 to 60 minutes longer or until thermometer reads 160 . Cover and let stand 15 minutes before serving, for easier carving.

Description: 
Piercing the pork and allowing it to stand after brushing with apricot brandy helps to heighten the apricot flavor of the roast.
