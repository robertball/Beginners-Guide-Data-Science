Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup boiling water
16 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1/4 cup canola oil, divided

Directions:
Combine 2 cups flour and 1 cup boiling water in a bowl. Stir with chopsticks until cool enough to handle. Massage with your hands until the mixture becomes a dough. Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface and knead for 5 minutes. Return dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Return dough to a flour-dusted work surface. Shape into a rectangular loaf shape. Cut the dough into 4 equal-sized pieces; return 3 pieces to the refrigerator.
Roll 1 piece of dough out into a 10-inch circle using a rolling pin. Spread 4 teaspoons oil on the surface. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 the green onions. Roll circle up into a scroll shape. Roll the scroll sideways into a cinnamon-roll shape. Press down on the roll using the rolling pin to gently flatten it into a 7-inch pancake. Repeat with the remaining dough and oil.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over medium heat. Transfer the pancake to the hot wok; flip after 30 seconds. Flip again every 1 to 2 minutes until both side are golden, 3 to 5 minutes total. Cook the remaining 3 pancakes, adding 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet each time.
