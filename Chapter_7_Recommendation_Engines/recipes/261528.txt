Ingredients:
1 pound ground bison
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
3/4 cup portobello mushrooms
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 whole wheat hamburger buns, split and toasted

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine bison, cumin, oregano, thyme, and chipotle in a bowl. Add mushrooms, Cheddar cheese, and onion; mix until well distributed. Season with salt and pepper. Divide mixture evenly into 4 sections and shape into patties.
Place patties on grill and reduce heat slightly. Grill until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip over and grill until other side is browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve on toasted whole wheat buns.

Description: 
I like to add chopped mushrooms to lean meats, such as bison, when making burgers - it helps keep the patties moist and delicious. For even more flavor, I add some onions, Cheddar cheese, and a touch of smoky spice to make these burgers complete.
