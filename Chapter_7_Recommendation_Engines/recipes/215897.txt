Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup Italian-style salad dressing
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
2 cups cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
2 cups diced tomato
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 hard-boiled egg, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the macaroni at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water to cool the macaroni to the touch; drain again.
Stir the mayonnaise, Italian-style salad dressing, and mustard together in a large bowl. Add the cool macaroni, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, green onion, salt, pepper, tuna, and egg; stir to evenly combine. Chill at least 4 hours before serving.
