Ingredients:
2 quarts fresh blackberries
1 1/4 cups water, or more as needed
1 pound white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Bring blackberries and water to a boil in a large pot until blackberries are softened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and mash berries using a potato masher.
Line a sieve with cheese cloth; place over a large pot. Pour mashed berries through cheese cloth-line sieve; let sit until all liquid has drained through cheese cloth, about 30 minutes. Stir 1 pound sugar per 1/2 gallon of drained blackberry juice.
Bring blackberry juice and sugar to a boil in a pot; cook until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Skim off any residue accumulated on top.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack hot saft into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Store in refrigerator.
