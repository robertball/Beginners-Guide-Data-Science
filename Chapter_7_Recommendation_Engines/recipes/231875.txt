Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup mayonnaise
4 3/4-inch thick slices of crusty bread
2 cups arugula
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
cooking spray
4 eggs

Directions:
Mix garlic and mayonnaise together in a small bowl. Spread mayonnaise on 1 side of the bread slices. Mix arugula with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until coated; divide arugula in fourths, placing each portion atop mayonnaise side of a bread slice.
Spray a skillet with cooking spray, place over medium-high heat, and crack eggs into skillet, one at a time. Cook on one side only until whites are firm and yolks are slightly runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Season eggs with salt and black pepper. Gently place an egg on each open-face sandwich.
