Ingredients:
6 pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
bread crumbs, or to taste
grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
6 medium white potatoes, peeled and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place 3 chops in a casserole dish. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Cover with 2 sliced potatoes. Add salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup more bread crumbs and 2 tablespoons cheese. Top with the remaining 3 chops and another portion of the salt, pepper, bread crumbs, and cheese. Cover with remaining potatoes, salt, pepper, bread crumbs, and cheese.
Bake, covered, in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Turn on the broiler, uncover casserole, and broil until potatoes on top are browned, 2 to 3 minutes more.
