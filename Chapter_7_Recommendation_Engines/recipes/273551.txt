Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups milk
3 chai tea bags
1 (15.25 ounce) package French vanilla cake mix (such as Betty Crocker™ Super Moist™ Delights French Vanilla Cake Mix)
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1 (6 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with liners.
Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until steaming, about 2 minutes. Add chai tea bags and steep for 10 minutes.
Combine chai mixture, cake mix, eggs, oil, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in a large bowl and beat using an electric mixer on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 18 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and butter together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, mixing until fully incorporated. Pour in vanilla extract. Whip on high speed until fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pipe or spread frosting onto cooled cupcakes. Sprinkle tops evenly with cinnamon.
