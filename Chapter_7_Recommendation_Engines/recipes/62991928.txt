Ingredients:
3 1/2 Cups Wholemeal Flour
1 Teaspoons Baking powder
1 cup cooked and Shredded Turkey
1 Cup Dried Cranberries
1 egg
1 tablespoon of Olive Oil
1 Cup low sodium chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease cookie sheets (I use my Pampered Chef large stoneware bar pans.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, turkey and cranberries.  Make a well in the center of the ingredients and add the egg and olive oil.
Add first the 1/2 cup of broth and mix until combined (add the extra broth a bit at a time if required). The mixture should form a soft dough.
Kneed dough on a floured surface for a good minute. Roll the dough out until ¼ inch think. Cut with your favorite cookie cutter.
Bake in the hot oven for 25 minutes, once the initial 25 minutes is up. Turn off the oven but leave the biscuits in the warm but off over for a further 30 minutes to crisp.
