Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, diced
4 cups chicken broth
1 14-oz. can (small can) fire roasted diced tomatoes
1 15-oz. can (small can) black beans, or 1.5 cups cooked black beans, drained and rinsed
1 tsp smoked paprika
salt and pepper, to taste
2 small-medium sweet potatoes, diced (about 3-4 cups total)
2 cups cooked shredded chicken (such as rotisserie)
2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish

Directions:
Saute the onion in olive oil in a large pot over medium high heat until soft (2-3 minutes)
Add the chicken broth, tomatoes, beans, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Turn the heat to low and add the sweet potatoes. Simmer until sweet potatoes are cooked through, approximately 15 minutes (depending on how small you cut them).
Use a potato masher (or immersion blender) to mash the soup a few times to thicken it up a bit.
Turn the heat off and add the chicken and parsley. Stir and allow to sit for a minute or so to make sure the chicken gets warmed through.
Serve hot garnished with extra fresh parsley.
