Ingredients:
1 (10.5 ounce) package marshmallows
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups chocolate covered raisins
5 3/4 ounces toasted oat cereal

Directions:
Melt marshmallows, butter, and raisins together over medium heat, stirring until smooth.
Mix in cereal until coated. Scrape the mixture into a greased pan and let chill.  (We popped them into the freezer for a few minutes to hurry it up, because the kids just couldn't wait.)

Description: 
I work at a nature camp, as a counselor for the 4 and 5 year olds, or Nature Nuts. We whipped these bars up one rainy day using whatever we had in the fridge, and they turned out surprisingly well.  The chocolate-covered raisins really seem to add something.
