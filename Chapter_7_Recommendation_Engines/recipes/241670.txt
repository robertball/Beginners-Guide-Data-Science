Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 large eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.
Beat eggs and melted butter together; pour into the well in the flour mixture and mix with a fork until crumbly. Slowly add milk to the flour mixture, using hands to mix the dough into a ball.
Roll dough into a flat loaf and put onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browning along the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
