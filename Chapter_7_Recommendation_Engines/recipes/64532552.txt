Ingredients:
1 organic lemon
2 cooking pears
8 prunes
8 dried apricots
1/4 cup blanched, whole almonds
2 Tbsp honey or agave
1 vanilla bean, cut in half, lengthwise
1 large cinnamon stick
1/8 cup pine nuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 190Â°C.
Wash the lemon. Peel the lemon with a knife trying to keep the peel in one long string.
Squeeze half the lemon juice out of the lemon, removing the seeds and add the juice to a small sauce pan. To the lemon, add the honey, cinnamon stick, and vanilla bean. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 5 minutes or until it becomes fragrant and syrupy.
Cut the pears into quarters, coring and peeling them. Arrange the quarters in the tagine core side up. Add the prunes, apricots, almonds, and lemon peel around the pears and on top if necessary.
Pour the lemon juice mixture over the pear quarters and other ingredients allowing the cinnamon stick and the vanilla bean fall into the tagine. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, remove the tagine from the oven and take off the top, allowing the juices to fall back into the tagine. Turn over the pears and add the pine nuts. Replace the cover of the tagine and cook again for 10 more minutes.Turn off the oven.  Allow to sit in the hot oven about 10 minutes more, or until ready to serve. This cooling process helps create a sauce with a syrup consistency.
