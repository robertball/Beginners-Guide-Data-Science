Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts
1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/4 cups blueberries
1 egg
1 tablespoon white sugar, for sprinkling
16 sturdy cookie pop or lollipop sticks

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll out one of the pie crusts to 1/8-inch thick; cut 16 3-inch circles from the crust. Line 16 mini muffin cups in a 24-cup mini muffin pan with the crust circles. Refrigerate to chill, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, roll out the other crust to 1/8 inch thick, and cut out 16 2 1/2-inch circles; lay the 16 circles onto the prepared baking sheet, and refrigerate.
Mix together the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a bowl. Stir in the blueberries, and toss lightly to coat with the sugar mixture. Whisk the egg in a small separate bowl. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of blueberry mixture into each crust-lined muffin cup (don't overfill). Place a cookie pop stick horizontally into the filled pop so the end sticks out by several inches. With a pastry brush, dab a little beaten egg evenly around the edge of the filled crust; place a 2 1/2-inch top crust circle onto the filled crust, and pinch edges together to seal in the filling and close the crust around the stick. With a toothpick, poke 3 or 4 steam holes into the top crust. Brush top of each pie pop with beaten egg, and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before gently removing from muffin tin cups. To help pops release, run a small knife around the edges and under stick.

Description: 
These little pies are a huge hit at several Seattle bakeries, so I was inspired to make my own. Use a non-stick mini muffin pan to ensure the pies easily lift out of the cups after baking. Make your own crust, or use prepared refrigerated pie crust. Use fluted or straight-edged cookie cutters to cut out the pops. Vary the filling based your favorite pies. Cute and tasty wins the day!
