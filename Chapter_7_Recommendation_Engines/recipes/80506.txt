Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) package refrigerated fully-cooked boneless beef pot roast with gravy
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups frozen mixed red, yellow and green bell peppers with onions, defrosted
2 cups prepared chunky-style pasta sauce with garlic
1/2 cup red wine or beef broth
1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
1 cup quick-cooking polenta
3/4 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
Salt and pepper
1/4 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Remove pot roast from package; cut pot roast into smaller chunks.  Reserve gravy for other use.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Add pepper mixture; cook and stir 2 minutes.  Stir in pasta sauce and wine; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add beef; cover and simmer 10 minutes or until beef is heated through, stirring occasionally.  Stir in basil.
Meanwhile prepare polenta according to package directions.  Remove from heat and whisk in 3/4 cup cheese.  Season with salt and pepper, as desired.
Serve beef and sauce with polenta.  Sprinkle with 1/4 cup cheese.
