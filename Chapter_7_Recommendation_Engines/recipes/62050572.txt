Ingredients:
2 c sugar
2 Tb plus 2 1/4 tsp cinnamon
2 1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp allspice
1 tsp cloves
2 1/2 c water, divided
3/4 to 1 cup raisins
2 1/2 c all-purpose flour
2 1/2 c cake flour
1 Tb baking soda
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 2/3 c veg oil
3 Tb honey

Directions:
Mix together in large saucepan the sugar, spice and salt.  Stir in 2 cups water and the raisins.  Bring to a slow boil over low heat, stirring.  Remove from heat, cover and let stand overnight (in the morning, it will look slimey!).
The next morning, mix together flours, baking soda and powder.  Stir in the oil, remaining 1/2 cup water and honey.  Combine this mixture with the first mixture and mix well (do not worry about overmixing, as these are more cake-lke than a muffin).
Grease muffin tins and dust with flour (or spray).  Fill cups no more than 3/4 full.  Bake 375 degrees 20-25 minutes, or until done.  Remove from pans while hot; cook on rack.  Dip tops in a thin powder sugar glaze, cool and let dry.
