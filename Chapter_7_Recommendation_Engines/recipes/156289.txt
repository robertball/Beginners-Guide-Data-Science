Ingredients:
2 cups medium Cheddar cheese, grated
2 cups pepper Jack cheese, grated
1 (1 ounce) packet Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Salad Dressing & Seasoning Mix
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons store-bought minced roasted garlic
2 tomatoes, peeled, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice
2/3 cup heavy (whipping) cream
Foods to Dip:
Florets of broccoli or cauliflower
Baby carrots
Crusty-hard peasant bread cut into 1-inch cubes
Celery sticks
Unseasoned breadsticks
Tortilla chips
Pita chips

Directions:
In a medium bowl, toss together the cheeses and seasoning mix. Set aside.
In heavy, 4-quart saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the garlic and tomatoes and saute, stirring frequently, until the tomatoes just begin to soften, about 2 minutes.
Add the cheese mixture and stir until the cheese is completely melted. Add the cream and stir until smooth. Transfer to a fondue pot set over an alcohol or sterno flame to keep it warm. Alternatively, transfer to a mini electric slow cooker and keep warm. Serve immediately.
