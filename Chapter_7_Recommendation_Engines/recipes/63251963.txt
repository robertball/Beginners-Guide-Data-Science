Ingredients:
1 (13 oz)package whole wheat penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes
2 medium tomatoes (about 1/2 lb.) chopped
Salt and pepper, to taste
4 cups fresh spinach
1 pound thin sliced chicken breast
1 and 1/2 cup marinara sauce
1 (6-7 oz) container 0% plain Greek yogurt
1 bunch basil leaves, chopped
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook penne according to package directions, omitting salt and fat. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet with a lid, heat olive oil over medium-low heat. Add in garlic and red pepper flakes, cook for 2 minutes or until garlic begins to soften.
Add in tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes or more.
Cook chicken however you like and set aside.
Heat marinara sauce thoroughly over medium heat. In a separate bowl mix yogurt and 1/2 cup sauce until smooth. Whisk mixture into the remaining sauce and continue to heat over low heat.
Remove tomatoes from heat, add in spinach and cover skillet. Let spinach wilt for 2 minutes.
Remove lid and place skillet back over low heat. Add the sauce mixture, penne and basil. Stir until all pasta and veggies are coated. Heat until just warmed through.
Divide into pasta bowls and serve topped with sliced chicken and parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This healthy twist on Penne Rosa is just as delicious as the original. Substituting fat free Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream and whole wheat pasta makes this dish a much lower calorie and fat option. Add grilled chicken to up the protein!
