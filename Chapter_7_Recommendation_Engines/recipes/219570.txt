Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 cup Pace® Picante Sauce
1 cup frozen whole kernel corn
1 cup uncooked instant rice
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup water
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

Directions:
Cook the beef in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat.
Stir the soup, picante sauce, corn, rice, cheese and water in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the skillet from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes.
Spoon about 2/3 cup beef mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold up the sides of the tortillas around the filling, then fold up the ends to enclose the filling.
