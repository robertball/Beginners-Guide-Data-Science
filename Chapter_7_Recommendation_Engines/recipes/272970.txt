Ingredients:
1 quart strawberries
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored gelatin (such as JELL-O®)
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1 cup cold water
1 cup ice cubes, or as needed
1 (12 ounce) package pound cake, cut into 12 slices
1 1/3 cups blueberries, divided
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese (such as Philadelphia®), softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Slice 1 cup of strawberries and halve remaining 3 cups.
Pour gelatin into a heat-proof bowl and add boiling water. Stir until completely dissolved, at least 2 minutes. Pour cold water into a 2-cup measure and add enough ice cubes to bring level to 2 cups. Add cold water and ice to gelatin and stir until melted. Refrigerate until slightly thickened to the consistency of unbeaten egg whites, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, line a 13x9-inch baking dish with sliced pound cake.
Remove gelatin from the refrigerator and stir in sliced strawberries and 1 cup blueberries. Spoon mixture over cake slices in the baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.
Beat cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Stir in whipped topping and spread mixture over gelatin in the baking dish. Arrange sliced strawberries and remaining blueberries to create an American flag.
