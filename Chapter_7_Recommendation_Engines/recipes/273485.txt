Ingredients:
6 baking potatoes, scrubbed
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt to taste
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 tomato, diced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup beef gravy
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
6 strips cooked bacon, diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Prick potatoes several times with a fork and place in a microwaveable baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt. Microwave on high until fork-tender, about 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute beef with onion, tomato, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in gravy and let simmer for 5 minutes.
Transfer potatoes onto individual serving plates and smash each with a fork. Cover potatoes with the beef mixture, then top with Cheddar cheese, bacon, and chives.
