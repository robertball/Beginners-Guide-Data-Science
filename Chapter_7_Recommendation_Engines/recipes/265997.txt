Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package baby carrots, or to taste (optional)
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 (8 ounce) package fontina cheese, shredded
1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, broken into chunks
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1 clove garlic, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 bunches Swiss chard, stems removed
1/2 bunch baby arugula, or to taste
9 leaves fresh basil, divided
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Place carrots in a large pot with lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook carrots until fork-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and mix well. Add heavy cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until a thick roux forms, about 10 minutes.
Mix fontina cheese and goat cheese into the roux. Cook until cheeses are completely melted and sauce is thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Drain carrots and bring water back to a boil, pouring in more as needed. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Cook garlic with olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat until starting to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add Swiss chard, tearing them as they go into the pan. Cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Add baby arugula and cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Chop 1 basil leaf into the pan using herb shears. Cook until wilted, about 30 seconds more. Mix in some of the cheese sauce if desired.
Drain pasta and divide over serving plates. Add carrots, chard, and arugula. Top with Parmesan cheese and more cheese sauce. Garnish each plate with a basil leaf.
