Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce, divided
2 eggs
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray's®)
2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®)
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 pounds lean ground turkey
3 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Combine cooked quinoa, onion mixture, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, eggs, barbeque sauce, hot sauce, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Whisk together. Add ground turkey and mix well with hands. Form patties and place in the prepared baking dish.
Mix remaining 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar together in a bowl to make a paste. Spoon on top of the patties.
Bake patties in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 45 minutes.
