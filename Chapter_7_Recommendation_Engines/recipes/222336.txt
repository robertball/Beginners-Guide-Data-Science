Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 ounces fresh perch fillets
2 tablespoons butter
1 lemon, cut in half

Directions:
Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Gently press perch fillets into flour mixture to coat,  shaking off any excess flour.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat until butter is foaming and nut-brown in color. Working in batches, place filets in skillet and cook until light golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer cooked fillets to a plate, squeeze lemon juice over the top, and serve.

Description: 
I love perch. I love everything about them--the sweet, delicate flavor, the striking coloration, and the stubborn fight they put up for their size. The key here is getting the butter to a perfect nutty brown. Technically it's still butter, but something happens when it's toasted like this, and it really does become another ingredient altogether.
