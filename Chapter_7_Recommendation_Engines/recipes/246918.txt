Description: 
I found a recipe for sour milk waffles in an old cookbook, and I modified it to make sourdough waffles. If you do not have a sourdough starter, substitute sour milk or buttermilk. I also changed the bacon drippings to applesauce to make this healthier. These come out of the waffle iron looking amazing - crispy on the outside and tangy and tender on the inside, and they smell like baking bread while cooking. Eat with lots of syrup if you prefer a sweeter waffle, as there is very little sweetener in this recipe.
