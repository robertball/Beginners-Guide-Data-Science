Ingredients:
1 medium head cauliflower
1 tbsp cream cheese
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2 tsp. minced garlic
1/2 tsp. salt
1/8 tsp. fresh ground black pepper
3 tbsp. butter, melted
1 tsp. chives to garnish (optional)

Directions:
Clean and cut the cauliflower into small pieces.  Cook in boiling water for about 6 minutes.  Drain well.  Without letting the cauliflower cool, pat very dry between several layers of paper towels.  In a food processor or blender, puree the hot cauliflower with the cream cheese, parmesan, garlic, salt, pepper, and butter.  Garnish with chives if desired and serve hot.

Description: 
I'm really surprised by how good these came out.  I absolutely love potatoes and I have to say I didn't miss them at all when I substituted these.
