Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (14.75 ounce) can cream-style corn
½ cup shredded, cooked chicken meat
¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
salt to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch
½ cup water
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1  egg white

Directions:
In a medium stock pot combine broth, corn and chicken.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and add pepper and salt.  Bring back to a boil.
In a separate bowl mix the corn starch with water.  While the soup is boiling add this mixture, and stir constantly until well mixed.
Season with sesame oil by adding a few drops at a time.  Reduce heat, and slowly add egg white while swirling the soup with a fork in order to break egg pieces apart.
Add chopped scallion to garnish, and serve hot.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy way to make this soup that is usually served at Chinese restaurants.  For a tangy/hot flavor try this: about 3 to 4 hours before serving combine 1/4 cup vinegar and 3 finely chopped green chilies. Refrigerate until serving time and then sprinkle about a teaspoon of this on the soup.  Enjoy!! Garnish with fresh scallions.
