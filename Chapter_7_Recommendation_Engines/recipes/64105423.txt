Ingredients:
4 fresh, organic tomatoes (small, 3 medium)
1-2 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1/3 onion
1/2 peeled cucumber
1 slice french bread (optional for fewer carbs)
1/2 green or red pepper
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt (or less if desired)
1/3 cup water

Directions:
Use all fresh, organically grown vegetables for best flavor and health.  Place all ingredients in blender, and blend the heck out of it on high speed until liquified. Chill 30 minutes before serving. Blend in batches if your blender is too small. Serve in small bowls garnished with fresh, home made croutons (no store bought), chopped tomatoes, cucumber, or onion. Disfr√∫tate.
