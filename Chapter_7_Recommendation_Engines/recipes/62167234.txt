Perfect BBQ Baked Beans Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cans Bush's Original Baked Beans
1 lb. ground beef
2 tbsp. Grill Mates Mesquite seasoning (or seasoning of your choice)
1 small onion, minced
1/4 c. molasses
3/4 c. brown sugar
3/4 c. your favorite BBQ Sauce
2 tsp dry mustard
2 dashes of Cayenne Pepper (or to taste - optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degreed F.
In a deep skillet, combine ground beef, onion and preferred seasoning.  When meat is cooked through, drain using a baster or your favorite method.
If your skillet is large enough: drain some of the liquid from the beans and add to the meat.  Stir well.  If you are using a smaller skillet: transfer the meat to an oven safe dish and combine with the beans.
Add molasses, brown sugar, BBQ sauce, and dry mustard and mix well.  The brown sugar will make dark brown lumps in your beans, so stir until these lumps are gone.
(Optional) Add cayenne pepper to taste.  One dash gives it a little tanginess; about three or four dashes makes it spicy.
Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until heated through.

I saw a similar recipe online a while back and have been amending it to make it my own.  Everyone always loves these beans, and they are a sweet, filling and yummy addition to a plate of potato salad and the smokey BBQ we all love!
