Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
3 overripe bananas, thinly sliced
1/2 cup banana-flavored yogurt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan.
Combine 1 cup sugar and butter in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract. Mix in flour and allspice gradually until batter is blended. Fold in bananas and banana-flavored yogurt.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Mix 3 tablespoons sugar and cloves together in a small bowl; sprinkle over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This bread is different because I use banana-flavored yogurt and sliced bananas instead of mashed. The consistency is lighter, not dense - definitely different and delicious!
