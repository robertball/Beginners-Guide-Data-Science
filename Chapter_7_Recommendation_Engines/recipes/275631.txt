Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x11-inch pan with cooking spray.
Combine pumpkin puree, brown sugar, and eggs in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
Mix together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a separate bowl. Slowly add flour mixture to pumpkin mixture until combined. Stir in oats and raisins. Spread batter evenly in the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a fork inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely, then slice into 20 bars.
