Ingredients:
3 tablespoons of reduced-sodium soy sauce
• 2 scallions, chopped
• 2 cloves of garlic, minced
• 1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger
• 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, divided
• 1 pound of ground pork
• 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar
• 4 pineapple rings, 1/4 inch thick
• 4 cups of watercress (about 1 large bunch), tough stems removed
• 1 cup of shredded carrots

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high (or see Stovetop Variation).
2. Combine soy sauce, scallions, garlic, ginger and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a small bowl.
3. Place pork in a medium bowl. Add half of the sauce mixture to the pork and gently combine without overmixing. Form into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil and vinegar to the remaining sauce mixture and set aside.
4. Oil the grill rack (see Tip). Grill the burgers, turning once, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 155°F, 4 to 5 minutes per side. During the last 3 minutes of cooking, add the pineapple rings to the grill and cook, turning once, until dark grill marks appear.
5. Combine watercress and carrot in a large bowl. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the reserved sauce. Divide the salad among 4 plates. Top each portion with a pineapple ring and a burger. Drizzle any remaining sauce on top.

Description: 
Ditch the bun and serve this Asian-inspired pork burger with sweet grilled pineapple on top of a zesty watercress-and-carrot salad. We like the taste and texture of fresh pineapple for this recipe, but canned pineapple rings work well too. Serve with short-grain brown rice.
