Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
2 (28 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
3 1/2 cups water
5 potatoes, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1 (10 ounce) package frozen corn
1 tablespoon butter-flavored granules (such as Butter BudsÂ®)
1 teaspoon dill seasoning
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
grated Parmesan cheese to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and stir in the onion, garlic, and horseradish. Cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes, then mix in the ground beef. Cook and stir the ground beef until evenly browned, no longer pink, and crumbly. Drain excess fat, and transfer the cooked beef mixture into a large soup pot.
Mix in the tomatoes, water, potatoes, mixed vegetables, carrots, corn, butter-flavored granules, dill seasoning, hot pepper sauce, and cinnamon, and stir to thoroughly combine. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally. Before serving, season to taste with Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper.
