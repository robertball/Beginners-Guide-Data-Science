Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sauerkraut
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3/4 cup barbeque sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce
4 slices whole wheat bread
2 cups sliced roast beef
4 slices shredded pepperjack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Stir the sauerkraut, mustard, barbeque sauce, and hot pepper sauce in a microwave safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high until slightly bubbly and thickened, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, place the bread onto a baking sheet, and top with the roast beef and sauerkraut sauce. Place a slice of cheese over each sandwich.
Broil in the preheated oven until the edges of the bread are slightly blackened, and the cheese is bubbly, about 3 minutes.
