Ingredients:
2  tablespoons coconut oil
15  garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2  teaspoons whole black peppercorns, plus 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
½  teaspoon red-pepper flakes
4  pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken drumsticks and thighs
1  cup unsweetened coconut milk
½  cup coconut vinegar
½  cup soy sauce
8  fresh bay leaves
Cooked rice, for serving

Directions:
Step 1
In a large pot, heat the coconut oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the garlic, whole peppercorns, freshly ground pepper and red-pepper flakes, drop the temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is toasted and softened and mixture is fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Step 2
Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook over medium-high, undisturbed, until fat starts to render, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
Stir in the coconut milk, coconut vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves and 1 cup water, and let the mixture come to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken feels loosened and just about falling off the bone, stirring halfway through, about 1 hour.
Step 4
Increase the temperature to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened to a velvety gravy, about 15 minutes. Serve chicken and sauce over rice.
