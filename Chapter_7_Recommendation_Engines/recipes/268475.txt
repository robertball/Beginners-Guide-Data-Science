Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine butter and sugar in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg yolks and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. Beat in flour and baking powder. Use your hands to finish mixing if dough does not come together.
Add dough to a cookie press and press spritz-shaped cookies onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 9 to 11 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes. Carefully transfer to a wire rack and cook completely.
