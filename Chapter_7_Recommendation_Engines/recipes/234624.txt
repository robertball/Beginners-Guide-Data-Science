Ingredients:
2 cups beef broth, divided
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tri-bean blend
1 (7 ounce) can diced green chilies
1/2 cup frozen corn

Directions:
Whisk 1 cup beef broth and chili seasoning mix together in a bowl.
Melt coconut oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir quinoa in hot oil until fragrant and lightly toasted, 1 minute. Pour broth-seasoning mixture, remaining 1 cup beef broth, and tomatoes into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until quinoa has absorbed most of the liquid, 20 to 30 minutes.
Stir bean blend, green chilies, and corn into quinoa mixture; simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
