Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, chopped
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 1/2 pounds fresh collard greens, tough stems removed and leaves torn into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until browned and crisp, about 8 minutes, stirring often. Transfer bacon pieces into a bowl with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pan.
Stir water, vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper into the bacon drippings until the sugar has dissolved; bring the mixture to a boil. Place collards into the boiling mixture, and stir to mix well. Cover the Dutch oven, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the greens are tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Drizzle in a little more water or vinegar if greens become too dry.
Spoon greens into a serving dish, and sprinkle with the cooked bacon pieces.
