Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 quarts oil for frying
1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Bring to a boil and remove from heat.  Stir in flour until mixture forms a ball.
Heat oil for frying in deep-fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Pipe strips of dough into hot oil using the Pampered Chef accent decorator. And the largest flower tip.  Fry until golden; drain on paper towels.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon.  Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.

Description: 
These Mexican fritters are very common at fairs.  In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming.  People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros.  I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.Modified from: Churros
