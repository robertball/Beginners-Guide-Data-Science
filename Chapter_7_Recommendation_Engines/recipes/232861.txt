Ingredients:
1 pound haddock fillets
1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
2  oranges, zested and juiced
¾ cup panko bread crumbs
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons buttery spread (such as Smart Balance(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), melted
½ teaspoon dried parsley
¼ teaspoon ground thyme

Directions:
Arrange haddock fillets in a large baking dish. Season with salt-free seasoning blend. Pour orange juice over fish and cover with plastic wrap, reserve orange zest. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Stir panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, buttery spread, parsley, thyme, and reserved orange zest in a bowl until well mixed. Press crumb mixture over haddock.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish is easily flaked with a fork and topping is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow fish to rest 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This dish uses oranges with haddock which is a change from most dishes that use lemon with fish or seafood. It's a nice refreshing change. It pairs well with veggies, like asparagus, broccoli, or zucchini. For starch you could do mashed or roasted potatoes, risotto or couscous.
