Ingredients:
1/2 cup pinto beans
1/2 cup lentils
1 serving cooking spray
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, finely chopped
1 onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 egg
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried marjoram (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sunflower kernels, chopped

Directions:
Put pinto beans and lentils into two separate pots of water; bring both to a boil, turn off heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour.
Drain and rinse beans.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper in hot skillet until onion is soft and mushrooms are darkened, 25 to 30 minutes. Spread mushroom mixture onto a platter to cool.
Process pinto beans, egg, sage, rosemary, basil, marjoram, salt, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a food processor until smooth; transfer to a bowl. Mix lentils, cooled mushroom mixture, oats, Cheddar cheese, and sunflower kernels with the processed pinto bean mixture until somewhat evenly mixed. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Divide and shape mixture into 16 patties.
Cook patties in batches in hot skillet until browned and heated through, about 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
These won't make anyone think that they are real sausage, but they are real tasty! I like to freeze them and take them out one at time to make a quick, microwaved breakfast sandwich that I can eat in the car.
