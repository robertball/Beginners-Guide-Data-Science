Now, for the Great Frosting Debate. The first of these took place in my mother’s house , but in my grandmother’s kitchen. All cakes must have the right frosting it’s a must. You pick the one you want I will stay out of it as I did many years ago.  You pick so there is no debate.

Description: 
Sometimes you find it necessary to make a cake. Not because of any occasion but because you had too many carrots, and not enough broccoli. I owe this wonderful cake all to broccoli and My Grandmother who liked to say. “Child use what you have in life; in all aspects of your life.” I watched her make dinners out of what looked like little to nothing. She was a blessing to have in my life that has kept me going.
