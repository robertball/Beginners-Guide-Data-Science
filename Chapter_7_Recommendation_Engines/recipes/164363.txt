Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese*
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls or Pillsbury® Crescent Recipe Creations™ refrigerated flaky dough sheet*
1/3 cup Fisher® Chef's Naturals® Chopped Pecans
1 teaspoon CRISCO® 100% Extra Virgin or Pure Olive Oil
1/3 cup finely chopped red onion
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup SMUCKER'S® Apricot Preserves
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme leaves

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In small bowl, mix cream cheese and Gorgonzola cheese with fork until blended.
If using crescent rolls: Unroll dough; separate into 2 rectangles, each about 11 inches long. Place 1 rectangle on cutting board; press perforations together to seal. If using dough sheet: Unroll dough; cut lengthwise into 2 rectangles, each about 11 inches long. Place one rectangle on cutting board.
Spread half of the cheese mixture over dough to within 1/2 inch of long sides; sprinkle half of the pecans evenly over cheese. Starting at 1 long side, roll up; press seam to seal. Cut roll into 16 (about 3/4-inch) slices with serrated knife; place cut sides down on ungreased large cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough, cheese and pecans.
Bake 14 to 17 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in 8-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion; cook 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and lightly brown. Remove from heat. Stir in vinegar, preserves (breaking up large pieces of fruit if necessary) and thyme; set aside.
After removing rolls from oven, immediately press back of a teaspoon into center of each roll to make small indentation. Spoon slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon onion jam into each indentation. Remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.
