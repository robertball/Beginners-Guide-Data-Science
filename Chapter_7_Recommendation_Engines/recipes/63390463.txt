Ingredients:
10-12 oz Spiral or Virginia baked ham- trim off any fat first and cut into 1" chunks
1/4 red onion- peeled and in large chunks
2 stalks celery- cut in large chunks
6 sweet bread & butter pickles
2 Tb mayonnaise
1 Tb whole grain Dijon, Cajun, or brown mustard
1/2 tsp Cajun seasoning (optional)
8 slices of Rye or Whole grain bread slices or 4 buns
Lettuce leaves for 4 sandwiches

Directions:
In a food processor pulse onions, celery, and pickles until medium-fine. Add ham cubes at this time and pulse until pieces resemble ground beef in size (about 1/4" diameter).
Remove from the processor and add remaining ingredients. Allow to cool fully before assembling sandwiches
On each slice of bread, place about 3oz of the ham salad, a few slices of lettuce and top with remaining slice of bread.  Cut and serve immediately.
Freezing the ham salad has been an option for me in the past, because it makes such a lovely luncheon dish on the fly, but leave out the mayonnaise when you do.  Drain it well before mixing the mayonnaise in once you have defrosted it.

Description: 
A not-too-spicy deviled ham recipe that makes you wish you had more leftover spiral ham during the holidays! It can also be served as an appetizer or in finger sandwiches, and is always popular on football Sundays.
