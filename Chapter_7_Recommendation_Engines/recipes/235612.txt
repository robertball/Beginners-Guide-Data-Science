Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound sweet Italian pork sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 small green pepper, cut into 2-inch long strips
1 large onion, cut in half and sliced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (24 ounce) jar Prego® Spicy Sausage Sauce
4 hard rolls
2 teaspoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook for 5 minutes or until well browned, stirring occasionally.  Pour off any fat.
Add the green pepper, onion and salt and black pepper to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic and cook and stir for 30 seconds.
Stir in the sauce.  Reduce the heat to medium-low.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the sausage is cooked through.  Divide the sausage mixture among the rolls and sprinkle with the cheese.
