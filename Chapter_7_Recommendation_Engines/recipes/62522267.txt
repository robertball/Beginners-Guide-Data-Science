Ingredients:
2 lg sweet potatoes
2/3 c crushed pineapple (divided)
1/4 t nutmeg
1/4 t cinnamon
1 c smoke cured ham (diced)
3 T diced onion
3 T diced bell pepper (any color)
1/2 t chipotle seasoning (adjust to taste)
2 T canola oil

Directions:
Bake sweet potatoes in 375 degree oven 1 hour or until soft. (can use microwave)
While the potatoes cool enough to handle, saute the onions and peppers in the oil just until soft. Add the ham and chipotle seasoning along with half the crushed pineapple. Simmer on low heat until heated through.
Cut the potatoes in half lenghtwise and scoop out the insides, leaving a thin shell. Blend or mash the potatoes, then add the nutmeg and cinnamon along with
other half of the pineapple.
Return the mashed potatoes to the shells, leaving enough room for the spicey ham filling.
Easy to reheat in the microwave or covered with foil in the oven.

Hearty enough for an entree or a full bodied side dish. My own creation trying to blend sweet and savory. Hope you enjoy and let me know all your adaptations for the under-used sweet potato!
