Ingredients:
22 medjool dates, pitted
1/3 cup plus 1/3 cup finely chopped almonds
1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1/3 cup pumpkin puree
1/3 cup shaved dark chocolate or organic cocoa powder
1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
1 tsp. vanilla extract
pinch salt

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, minus 1/3 cup almonds, into a food processor and blend until desired consistency. If you want it creamier, add more pumpkin puree. If you want it drier, add more coconut.
Roll spoonfuls into balls between your palms and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Place remaining 1/3 cup chopped almonds onto a plate and roll formed balls until coated with almonds. Feel free to submit coconut or cocoa with almond at this step.
Place balls in fridge to chill. Best eaten within a week.
