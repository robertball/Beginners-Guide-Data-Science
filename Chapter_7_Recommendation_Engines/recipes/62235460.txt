Ingredients:
1.5 quarts of ice cream
1 box yellow cake mix
1 pint heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons sugar
fresh strawberries

Directions:
Bake cake according to package directions in a 9x13 pan. While cake cools to room temperature, set ice cream on the counter to soften.
Spoon the soft ice cream into a round cake pan to make one thick layer, then cut a piece of the cake and press it into place to make a second layer. Freeze for about 4 hours.
While cake is setting in freezer, make home-made whipped cream by whipping together the cream and sugar until it forms stiff peaks. Store in fridge, so it is easier to work with. When cake is set, use whipped cream to ice the cake and decorate with the strawberries. Freeze for additional 1-2 hours to set the icing.

Description: 
I always make this with Marble Slab's amaretto ice cream (with strawberries mixed in) on top of a butter recipe yellow cake, but feel free to experiment with different flavors of ice cream, different flavors of cake, and different decorations on top!
