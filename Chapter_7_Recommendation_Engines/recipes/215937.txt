Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups water
1 pound quinces - peeled, cored, and diced
1 orange, zested (optional)
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
3 cups fresh or frozen cranberries

Directions:
Stir the sugar, cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and salt together in a large saucepan. Stir in the water, then bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Add the quince, and reduce heat to low. Cook and stir until the quince have turned rose colored, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir in the orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, and cranberries. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the cranberries have burst and the chutney has thickened, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before serving.

Description: 
This is a much more lively alternative to plain cranberry sauce and is one of my very favorites. I buy the quinces (membrillos) at a local Mexican grocery store. It is so worth the extra effort!
