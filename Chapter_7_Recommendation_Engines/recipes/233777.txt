Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 cooked chicken breasts, shredded
1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce
1/4 cup ranch salad dressing
1/4 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 (16 ounce) package scoop-shaped tortilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese, chicken, buffalo wing sauce, ranch dressing, and sour cream together in a large bowl; transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Evenly sprinkle Colby-Monterey Jack cheese over dip.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips.

Description: 
This is a creamy, hearty dip that works well for a gathering. It's not light, and is a good option when you are serving close to meal time, but don't want to prepare a full meal. I serve this with multigrain tortilla scoops.
