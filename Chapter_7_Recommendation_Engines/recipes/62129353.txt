Ingredients:
1 large egg
vegetable oil
15 oz. carton ricotta cheese
15-20 oz. can unsweetened crushed pineapple, well drained
1 box white or yellow cake mix

Directions:
In a measuring cup place the egg and enough oil to make 1/2 cup.
Put the oil and egg in a large mixing bowl and beat lightly.
Add the ricotta cheese. Mix until smooth.
Add the drained, crushed pineapple. Mix well.
Add the cake mix and blend gently. Too much mixing will cause the muffins to be tough and is too much work!
Divide among 18 muffin cups.
Bake at 400ยบ (375ยบ if using a dark pan) for 20 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool, then cover tightly.
These muffins are good when first baked, but they are best when served the next day.

Description: 
These muffins take only minutes to put together, require little clean up and are easy enough for even inexperienced cooks to make! I have used white, yellow, and french vanilla cake mix with this. They all turn out well, but the white cake mix is my favorite.
