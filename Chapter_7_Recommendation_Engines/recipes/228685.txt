Ingredients:
4 sweet potatoes, cut into chunks
1 1/3 cups white sugar
3/4 cup milk
3 eggs, beaten
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Cover sweet potatoes with water in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl.
Mash potatoes with white sugar, milk, eggs, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Spread mixture in prepared baking dish.
Mix brown sugar, pecans, and flour in another bowl. Pour margarine over pecan mixture; toss until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over potato mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until pecan topping is hard, about 1 hour.

You can't have a holiday dinner without a sweet potato souffle! And this is a wonderful version. I got this from my mother-in-law, who got the recipe from a neighbor.
