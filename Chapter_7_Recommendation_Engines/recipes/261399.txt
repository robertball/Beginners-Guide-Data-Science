Ingredients:
2 acorn squash, halved and seeded
4 tablespoons cashews
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste
1 small tart apple - peeled, cored, and grated
1 cup cooked rice
4 tablespoons dried cranberries
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place acorn squash halves cut-side down in a baking dish. Add a few tablespoons water and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is soft and can easily be pierced by a fork, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile toast cashews in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, stirring often, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside until cool enough to handle. Chop cashews.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat and cook onion until soft, about 10 minutes. Pour in balsamic vinegar and mix well. Add apple and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
Combine onion-apple mixture, rice, cranberries, and cashews in a bowl. Season filling with thyme, salt, and pepper and mix well.
Remove squash from the oven and leave oven on. Distribute filling among the 4 squash halves. Sprinkle with panko and butter. Return to oven and bake until filling is hot and bread crumbs are slightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Initially I made this recipe when I had some leftover rice that I wanted to use up, but it turned out so well that my husband and I often have it as a vegetarian dinner.
