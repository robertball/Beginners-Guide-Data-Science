Ingredients:
2Tbsp Butter
2 Tbsp Flour
1 Cup of Liquid

Directions:
Melt butter in Pot.
Add Flour. Stir until flour is absorbed and mixture looks like play dough, about a minute.
Whisk liquid in and heat until smooth. (This goes better if you stir in a little liquid at a time, letting the flour absorb it.)
Stir about 3 minutes, until smooth and heated through. (The longer you cook the thicker it will get.)
Salt to taste.
Variations:
Variations: Cream of chicken – add half milk or water, and half chicken broth. You can add chicken bits if you like, and you can use coconut oil and almond milk if you are dairy free.
Cream of mushroom – cook up some chopped mushrooms in the butter, then sprinkle with the flour and proceed.
Cream of celery – soften finely chopped celery in the butter, then proceed.
