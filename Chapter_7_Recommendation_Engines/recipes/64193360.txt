Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/3 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 small onion, chopped
1 egg
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
1 tsp cracked black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup marinara sauce
3 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, pepper, garlic powder, and half of the mozzarella cheese.
(Can form into 1-inch balls and bake for 30 min at 350 degrees)Form the mixture into a log, and place it into an 8x8 inch baking dish.
Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the center is no longer pink. Let stand for 5 minutes, then slice into 1/2 inch slices. Place a few slices onto each hoagie roll, cover with marinara sauce, and sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over.
Wrap each sandwich with aluminum foil, and return to the oven for 15 minutes, until bread is lightly toasted and cheese is melted. Let stand 15 minutes before eating. Each sandwich serves 2.
