Ingredients:
1 c butter or margarine, softened
1 c sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
2 c flour
1 c chocolate chips
1 c chopped nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
If desired, line 10x15 jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
Cream together butter or margarine, sugar, and vanilla. While stirring, add flour slowly. Next add chocolate chips and chopped nuts. (I normally have to mix them in by hand, as the dough is relatively thick.)
Press dough into jelly roll pan.
Bake @ 350, 20-25 minutes.
Cool on rack lined with paper towels.
Break into pieces. Store in air-tight container.

Description: 
Also known as Cookie Brittle, I got this recipe from a fundraiser cook book that my mother-in-law gave me. The book disappeared, but luckily I had given out the popular recipe and so, was able to get it back. I call it my cookie crumbs because it is broken into pieces. Not real pretty, but oh so yummy! Enjoy!
