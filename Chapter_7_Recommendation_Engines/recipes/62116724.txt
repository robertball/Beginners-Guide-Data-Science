Flakey Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
2 Eggs
1 cup Butter-Flavored Shortening
1 and 1/3 cups White Granulated Sugar
2 and 1/2 cups Flour
2 teaspoons Cream of Tartar
1 teaspoon Baking Soda
12 ounces (one package) Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional to taste)

Directions:
Place the eggs in a large bowl and strir them them around so the eggs have a nearly uniform yellow consistency.
Add the shortening and the sugar to the bowl and stir until well-mixed so there are no serious lumps.
Stir in flour, cream of tartar, and baking soda (add salt here if desired).
Stir in chocolate chips.
Once the mixture seems very well stirred and dough-like, place one finger in the mixture to feel it, if the mixture seems to be too moist or (gooey) and sticks to the finger then you should chill the mixture in the freezer for one hour before proceeding to step 6. Your mixture will almost certainly need to be chilled if you use a substitute for shortening like butter or margerine.
Roll the dough into almond-sized balls and place on a greased baking sheet.
Cook at 375F for about 18-20 minutes.
