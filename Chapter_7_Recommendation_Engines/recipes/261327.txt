Ingredients:
5 cups cubed bread
1/4 cup raisins
2 1/4 cups eggnog
4 large eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons coconut-flavored rum

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix bread and raisins together in a bowl; transfer mixture to the loaf pan.
Beat eggnog, eggs, white sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour over the bread mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Melt brown sugar and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add cream and rum; simmer until sauce thickens and is reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 5 minutes. Serve warm over the bread pudding.

Description: 
This is inspired by the traditional Puerto Rican eggnog drink. My husband loves eggnog and bread pudding so I thought I would combine his favorites with a Puerto Rican flair.
