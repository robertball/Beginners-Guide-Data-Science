Ingredients:
8 ounces (2 sticks) softened butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon black pepper
Pinch dried oregano
1 1/2 dozen large, freshly shucked oysters on the half shell
1/4 cup grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses, mixed
2 teaspoons chopped flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
1.Heat a gas or charcoal grill. In a medium bowl, mix butter with garlic, pepper, and oregano.
2.Place oysters on the half shell right over the hottest part. Spoon enough of the seasoned butter over the oysters so that some of it will overflow into the fire and flame up a bit.
3.The oysters are ready when they puff up and get curly on the sides, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the grated Parmesan and Romano and the parsley on top. Serve on the shells immediately with hot French bread.

Description: 
Tommy Cvitanovich of Drago's Seafood Restaurant says, This is the perfect dish for those who want to enjoy oysters in their unadorned form, but can't or won't eat them raw. Once you start eating these charbroiled ones, you won't be able to stop. Don't attempt this without freshly shucked oysters and an outdoor grill.
