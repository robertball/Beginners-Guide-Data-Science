Ingredients:
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
2  mangos - peeled, seeded, and diced
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon white wine
Â¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Rub chicken breast halves with salt and pepper. Place on the prepared grill. Cook 10 to 15 minutes on each side, until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from heat, set aside, and keep warm.
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat, and saute garlic for about 1 minute. Mix in ginger and mangos, and cook 3 to 4 minutes, until mangos are tender. Pour in the cider vinegar and white wine. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in cilantro, and remove from heat. Spoon over the grilled chicken to serve.

Description: 
Everyone seems to love this easy but unusual blend of fresh mango and garlic, though it seems a strange combination. The salsa can be used on grilled fish as well!  Be sure your mangos are ripe for best flavor.
