Ingredients:
3 pounds seedless cucumber, sliced paper-thin
1 1/2 tablespoons sea salt
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon rice wine (optional)
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons honey plus extra sugar to taste
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 green onion, sliced
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
2 walnut halves, finely chopped (optional)
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons Korean red pepper powder
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place sliced cucumbers in a large bowl and sprinkle evenly with sea salt; allow liquid to drain from cucumbers, about 15 minutes. Spoon cucumbers onto sheets of paper towels; wrap paper towels around cucumbers and wring out as much liquid as possible.
Mix rice vinegar, rice wine, sesame oil, honey, lemon juice, green onion, sesame seeds, walnuts, garlic, Korean red pepper powder, and ground black pepper in a bowl; add cucumbers and toss. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
Add about scant 1/4 cup sugar.  Wring the salted cukes by hand like the Danish cucumbers.
