Ingredients:
1/4 cup minced shallots/or 3/4 cloves of garlic
3-4 T mint leaves
1 flounder 1-1/2 lb. - or that same weight in fillets
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 t ground ginger
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 T  heavy cream
4 T cold unsalted butter, cut into 8 slices
1 T thinly sliced chives / or parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In morter and pestle mix the ginger, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper garlic and mint. Season fish with paste. If using fillets: Season, roll like a cigar, secure with a toothpick, pushing it into the thin end and through the other side.
Sprinkle the shallots over the bottom of a 10-inch straight-sided sauté pan.  Pour in the 1/3 c wine and 1/3 cup water. Turn the heat to high and bring the liquid to a simmer. Add fish, and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover, and poach the fish until cooked through, 4-8 minutes for fillets, 10-12 minutes for whole fish. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fish to a warm plate. Tent with foil while finishing the sauce.
Increase the heat to high and boil the liquid in the pan until it’s reduced to about 3 Tbs. (It should just barely cover the bottom of the pan.) Add the cream, and reduce the heat to low and whisk in 2 slices of the cold butter, the remaining 1-1/2 Tbs. mint, and the chives. When the butter is almost melted, add another slice and whisk until mostly melted. Repeat with the remaining butter, 1 slice at a time. (Take care not to overheat the sauce or it will separate.) Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Remove the toothpicks from each piece of fish. Serve.
