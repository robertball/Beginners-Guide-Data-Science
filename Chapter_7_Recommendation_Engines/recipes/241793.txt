Ingredients:
1 bunch kale
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon sriracha hot sauce
2 teaspoons lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with baking parchment.
Wash kale. Remove and discard ribs. Dry leaves thoroughly, using a salad spinner if available. Make sure no moisture remains. Tear kale leaves into 2- to 3-inch pieces.
Blend olive oil, Sriracha hot sauce, lime juice, and salt together with a whisk in a large bowl; add kale and toss to coat.
Divide kale onto prepared baking sheets and arrange so there is no overlapping of pieces.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, flip any pieces getting too browned on the bottom, and continue baking until the kale is crisp, about 15 minute more. Let kale chips cool 3 to 4 minutes before serving.
