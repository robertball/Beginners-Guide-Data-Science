Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 carrot, sliced
2 stalks celery, sliced
6 cups chicken stock
1/3 cup uncooked white rice
1 1/3 cups fresh spinach, washed and chopped
1 1/3 cups butter lettuce - rinsed, and torn into small pieces
1 1/3 cups chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, carrot, and celery; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent and the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Pour in chicken stock and rice; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 35 minutes or until rice is soft.
Stir in spinach, lettuce, and parsley; cook just until wilted. Season with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Use an immersion blender (or blend in batches in a blender) until smooth. The soup may be thinned with more broth, if desired. Refrigerate overnight before serving. Garnish as desired.
