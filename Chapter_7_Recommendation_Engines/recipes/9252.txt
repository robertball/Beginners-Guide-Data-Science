Ingredients:
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
3/4 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt
1 (6 pound) boneless pork loin roast
1 large onion, sliced into thin rings
2 bay leaves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic, and salt until the sugar dissolves.
Place the loin of pork in a roasting pan, and scatter the onion rings and bay leaves over it. Pour lime-ginger mixture over the meat, and cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate for 12 hours or so, turning every once in a while.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Roast, uncovered, for about 3 1/2 hours; baste frequently with pan juices. For a well done roast, cook until the internal temperature of the roast is 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

This recipe takes some preparation, but is worth it.  It has a slight Caribbean taste to it.
