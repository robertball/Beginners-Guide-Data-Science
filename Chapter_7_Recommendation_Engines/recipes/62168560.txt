3 tablespoons Mayonnaise
1 cup shredded lettuce
1/2 cup alfalfa sprouts

Salt to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl mix avocado, lemon juice, onion, tomato and salt.
Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of mayonnaise on each sandwich wrap. Then spread half the avocado mixture on each wrap. Cover the wrap entirely leaving a about 1 inch all the way around.
Place 3 slices of deli turkey on each wrap. Top with sprouts and shredded lettuce. You may also like to add some additional slices of tomato.
Fold the bottom of the wrap in towards the center then roll all the way across left to right.
