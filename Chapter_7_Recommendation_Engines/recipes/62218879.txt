Ingredients:
2 cups organic pecans & almonds, chopped or whole
1 cup (or more) Coconut Cream Concentrate
1 tablespoon (or as needed) coconut oil
1 - 2 tablespoons organic whole sugar (or to taste)
1/4 teaspoon Himalayan salt
1/2 cup (or more) shredded coconut or coconut flakes

Directions:
Process sugar in a food processor until very fine.
Spread nuts in a cookie sheet and toast very lightly in a low heated oven. Place Coconut Cream Concentrate jar in hot water to soften (may take up to 1/2 hr.).
In a medium sized bowl, beat desired amount of Coconut Cream, your choice of sweetener (see below), coconut oil, and salt with a mixer until creamy. Make sure the sugar and salt are mixed in well.
Fold the toasted nuts into the mixture and mix well with a large spoon until all nuts are well coated. Spread mixture evenly on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.
Sprinkle the coconut shreds or flakes toasted lightly if desired over the Nut Crunchies and place cookie sheet in the refrigerator.
When cold, break apart the Nut Crunchies into bite-sized pieces and store in covered containers in the refrigerator.
