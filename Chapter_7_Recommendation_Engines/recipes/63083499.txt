Ingredients:
1 large onion
3 tomatoes, sun-dried and oil-packed
2 t Italian seasoning, dried
1 # beef, lean ground
1 egg
1/4 C bread crumbs, fine, dry
1/4 t salt
2 t olive oil
1 lg. fennel bulb
4 cans chicken broth
6 cloves garlic
1/2 t black ground pepper
3/4 C orzo
5 C spinach, fresh

Directions:
Finely chop one-third of onion; thinly slice remaining onion. In lg. bowl, combine chopped onion, dried tomatoes and 1 t. Italian seasoning. Add ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, and salt; mix well. Shape into 12 meatballs. (I made them much smaller) In Dutch oven, brown meatballs in hot oil. Carefully drain off fat. I baked them instead for 20 min. at 350 degrees in foil-lined baking pan sprayed w/cooking spray.
Meanwhile, cut off and discard upper stalks of fennel. If desired, save some of the feathery fennel leaves for a garnish. Remove any wilted outer layers; cut off a thin slice from fennel base. Cut fennel into thin wedges; add to Dutch oven w/sliced onion, broth, garlic, and remaining 1 t. Italian seasoning and blck pepper.
Bring to boiling, stir in orzo. Simmer, uncovered, x10-15 min or until orzo is tender.
Stir in spinach. If desired, garnish soup w/reserved fennel leaves.

Description: 
This was very good.  But how often do I have fennel, sun-dried tomatoes, orzo and fresh spinach on hand. Well worth it though.
