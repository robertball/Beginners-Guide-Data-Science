Description: 
This dish is typically what are the ingredients you get from a restaurant for Moo Gai Pan. You may want to substitute sliced mushrooms for canned straw mushrooms. Stir frying is a quick and tasty to prepare and as well is a balanced meal. As long as you have a pan or wok and the right kind of oil, you can experiment with any combination of vegetables.
