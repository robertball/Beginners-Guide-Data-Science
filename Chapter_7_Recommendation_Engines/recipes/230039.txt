Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 3/4 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 cups chopped apples
2 cups fresh cranberries
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch fluted-tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Whisk eggs, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.
Sift flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture. This is a very thick mixture so use a solid spoon to mix together. Fold in apples, cranberries, and pecans until evenly incorporated. Pour batter in the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
