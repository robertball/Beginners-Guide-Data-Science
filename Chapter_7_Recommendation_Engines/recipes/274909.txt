Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
2 (14 ounce) jars pizza sauce, divided
1/2 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup finely diced pepperoni
1/4 cup finely diced ham
1/4 cup finely diced onion
1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon
1 egg
1 (8 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, cut into small cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Mix beef, sausage, 1/2 cup pizza sauce, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, pepperoni, ham, onion, bacon, and egg together in a bowl using your hands.
Form meat mixture into meatballs around cubes of mozzarella cheese.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry meatballs in the hot oil until all sides are browned, being careful not to break them or let cheese out, 5 to 7 minutes, working in batches.
Spread a small amount of remaining pizza sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place meatballs into the dish in a single layer. Top with remaining pizza sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until pizza sauce is bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese. Return to the oven and bake until cheese has melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve while hot.

Description: 
I was looking for something a bit different to serve as an appetizer at a get-together with friends and came up with these pizza meatballs. Everyone loved them, and all the cooks (men and women) wanted the recipe. This is good for an appetizer or to make a complete meal served with garlic bread and a tossed salad.
