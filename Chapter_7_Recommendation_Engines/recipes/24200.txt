Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup margarine
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 egg yolks
1/3 cup milk
3 1/2 cups chopped rhubarb
3 egg whites
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, margarine and confectioners' sugar. Mix together until it forms a ball. Press into the bottom and sides of a 9 inch square pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cup sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, yolks and milk. Stir together, then add chopped rhubarb. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour into hot crust.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over rhubarb filling, covering completely.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.

An excellent dessert for after a hearty meal. I have also made the filling with raspberries, strawberries and blueberries, separately or mixed them together for a bumbleberry torte!
