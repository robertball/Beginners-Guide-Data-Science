Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons honey

1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine oil, lemon juice, garlic, honey, thyme, red pepper flakes, pepper and salt if desired. Reserve half of marinade for basting; cover. Cut chicken into 1-in. wide strips; weave on skewers. Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. glass baking dish. Pour remaining marinade over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Drain, discarding marinade. Place skewers on grill over medium-low coals. Grill, turning and basting with reserved marinade, for 12 minutes or until juices run clear.

We cook out all four seasons, so, I'm always in search of new marinades. We've been making these marvelous kabobs for years. They're a family favorite.
