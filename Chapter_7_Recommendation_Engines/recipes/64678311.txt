Ingredients:
two 6-ounce cans of Tuna (get the ones that are soaked in water, not oil)
2 isp. Dijon mustard
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tbsp. lemon juice
2 tbsp. chopped parsley
1 egg
3 tbsp. olive oil
a dash of Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper

Directions:
1.Drain most of the liquid from the canned tuna and mix with Dijon mustard, panko bread crumbs,lemon juice, chopped parsley and Tabasco sauce in a bowl. If the mixture seems a bit dry, add a tbsp. of olive oil or water and mix well.
2.Season the mixture with salt and pepper, then add the egg and combine.
3.Place a sheet of baking paper onto a plate, then spoon the tuna mixture into patties.
4.Refrigerate your patties for an hour or two (or overnight). This will help keep the shape of the patties.
5.Once your patties are ready, preheat the Air Fryer to 350Â°F.
6.Place the patties in the Air Fryer and cook for 10 minutes. If you want them to be extra crispy, leave the patties in for an extra 2-5 minutes.
7.Serve cooked patties with a drizzle of lemon juice and enjoy.
