Ingredients:
3 pounds medium shrimp - peeled, deveined and shells reserved
1/2 onion, chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
2 strips celery, chopped
4 cups water
1/3 cup bacon grease
2 onions, chopped
2 strips celery, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 large chopped green bell pepper
2 bay leaves
salt to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢), or to taste
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried basil
4 tomatoes, chopped
2 cups canned tomato sauce
1 cup chopped green onion

Directions:
In a medium stock pot, combine the reserved shrimp shells, 1/2 onion, 1 carrot, 2 strips celery, and 4 cups water. Simmer for 1 hour, uncovered; stirring occasionally. Strain the stock into a smaller saucepan, boil and reduce the stock to 2 cups. Remove from heat.
In a heavy skillet, melt grease over medium heat. Add the onions, celery, garlic and green bell pepper; saute until soft and beginning to caramelize around the edges.
Add the bay leaves, salt, black pepper, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and 2 cups reduced shrimp stock. Bring to a boil and add crushed rosemary, crushed thyme, crushed basil, tomatoes, and tomato sauce.
Cover and simmer over low/medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.
Add the cleaned and deveined shrimp. Stir, cover and turn off the heat. Let the shrimp sit for 15 to 20 minutes or until pink throughout. Sprinkle the green onions on top.
