1 medium green pepper, chopped
7 cloves minced garlic
2 14oz cans diced basil/garlic/oregeno tomatoes
4 TBSP tomato paste
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
4 TBSP fresh thyme (or dried as fresh takes forever)
4 TBSP grated parmesan

Directions:
Cook sausage over medium heat, breaking up into small pieces.
When almost cooked through add onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green pepper, cook for about 3 minutes. Add garlic.
Add tomatoes, paste, salt, pepper, sugar, thyme and parm. Use a potato masher to mush up the tomatoes a bit more. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low, cover & simmer 10 minutes.
Serve with pasta and bread!

Description: 
This is a big hit with  the menfolk! Add more garlic and pepper for more of a kick, or calm it down by using mild Italian sausage instead of hot.
