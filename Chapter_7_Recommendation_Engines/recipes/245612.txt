Ingredients:
6  green onions, white parts only, chopped
1 (2 inch) piece peeled fresh ginger
4 cloves peeled garlic
3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
8  skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
salt to taste
3 tablespoons hot curry powder
1 tablespoon red curry paste
1 ½ teaspoons garam masala
1 ½ teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 ½ teaspoons white sugar, divided
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce (optional)

Directions:
Place green onions, ginger, and garlic in a food processor; puree until smooth.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and cook, skin-side down, until browned, about 10 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.
Scrape ginger puree into the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add curry powder, red curry paste, garam masala, and Chinese five-spice powder; cook and stir until fragrant. Pour in coconut milk and stir to loosen up the bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add fish sauce and half the sugar. Taste; adjust salt and sugar, and stir in sriracha sauce.
Return chicken thighs to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors are combined, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This hits all the tastes: sweet, salty, spicy, and umami. Serve on rice with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro and lime wedges on the side. If you cook with boneless chicken, reduce cooking time to 12 minutes for browning and 10 minutes for simmering.
