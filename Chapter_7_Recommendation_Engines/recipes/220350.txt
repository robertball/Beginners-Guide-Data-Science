Ingredients:
hot water to cover
1 (12 ounce) package dried rice noodles
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup fish sauce
1/2 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/8 teaspoon tamarind paste
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 bunch green onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (8 ounce) container tofu, drained and cubed
1 cup bean sprouts
1/2 cup coarsely chopped dry roasted peanuts

Directions:
Soak rice noodles in a bowl with enough hot water to cover until slightly softened, about 15 minutes; drain.
Whisk vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, soy sauce, sugar, and tamarind paste in a bowl until sugar is dissolved.
Mix paprika and cayenne pepper in a small bowl.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir eggs in the hot oil until lightly cooked. Transfer eggs to a bowl.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir green onions and garlic together quickly, about 10 seconds.
Stir tofu and paprika mixture into green onion mixture; toss to combine.
Toss noodles with tofu mixture until mixed; pour vinegar mixture over noodles and toss to coat.
Fold eggs and bean sprouts into noodles; cook and stir until sauce is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Garnish with crushed peanuts.
