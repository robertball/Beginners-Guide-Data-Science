Ingredients:
1 tablespoon oil, or to taste
½ cup chopped hot green chile peppers
½ cup chopped white onion
½ cup chopped bell pepper
½ cup frozen corn
½ cup drained canned black beans
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 ¼ cups cooked shredded chicken breast
1 (28 ounce) can Hatch green chile enchilada sauce, divided
fresh cracked black pepper to taste
11 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into quarters, divided
2 tablespoons sour cream, divided
⅓ cup New Mexican hot green chile salsa
1 ½ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute green chile peppers, onion, bell pepper, corn, black beans, and garlic until onion and bell pepper are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Stir chicken, 1/2 cup enchilada sauce, and black pepper into vegetable mixture.
Spread 1/4 cup enchilada sauce in the bottom of an 11x17-inch casserole dish.
Lightly coat 1 side of 18 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side up, in the casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture over tortilla layer.
Stir green chile salsa into the remaining chicken mixture.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend over chicken mixture layer in the casserole dish; top with 10 tortilla quarters. Pour 1/4 cup enchilada sauce over tortilla layer and cover with chicken-salsa mixture; add 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend.
Lightly coat 14 tortilla quarters with sour cream and arrange, sour cream-side down, over the cheese layer. Spread 1 cup enchilada sauce over tortillas and top with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and cheese is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
If you're looking for a green chile chicken enchilada casserole with a kick, this might be the one for you. I found the base recipe scouring the web for something that would taste like my ex-mom-in-law's casserole, which was to-die-for, and I've tweaked it a few times to make it my own. Try throwing in some jalapenos for even more kick.
