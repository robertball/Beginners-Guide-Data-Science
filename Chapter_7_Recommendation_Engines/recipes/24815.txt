Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 potatoes
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
1/4 pound salami, cut into strips
1/2 pound Swiss cheese, cut into strips
1/2 cup sliced sweet gherkin pickles
1 cup French dressing
1 (10 ounce) package mixed salad greens, rinsed and dried
1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets, drained

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and cut into quarters.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and dice.
In a medium bowl, toss together the potatoes, peas, salami, cheese, gherkins and French dressing until evenly coated.
Line a large, shallow bowl with salad greens and top with the salad mixture.  Garnish with the hard boiled eggs and anchovies.

I'm not a Swiss national, but have visited Switzerland.   This is a salad that I enjoyed very much and was able to duplicate.
