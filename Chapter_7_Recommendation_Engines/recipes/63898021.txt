Ingredients:
1 large steak, enough for 2
salt
pepper
1/3 cup water
1/2 tsp Montreal steak spice
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup diced bell pepper
garlic butter
mayo
2 tbl oil
1 cup shredded mozzarella
2, 6 inch sub buns

Directions:
Generously season steak on both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a pan on medium heat, add 1 tbl oil. Add steak, fry for 8 minutes. Flip and fry for another 7-10 minutes or until medium-well. Remove from pan and set aside for at least 10 minutes.
Deglaze steak pan with 1/3 cup water, getting all of the little bits from the bottom of the pan. Reserve juices.
Rinse pan with water, put on medium heat. Add 1 tbl oil to pan and add the steak spice, mushrooms, fry for about 1 minute and add the onions and peppers. Fry until tender. Set aside.
Heat oven to broil. Cut 2 sub buns down the middle, but not in two. Lightly brush both sides of buns with garlic butter. Spread one side of buns with mayo. Set aside.
Slice steak extremely thin and toss with reserved pan juices. Divide steak and add to buns. Top with veggies and then the mozzarella.
Put subs on baking pan and broil for 2-7 minutes, until cheese is bubbly. Watch carefully, they burn quickly!
