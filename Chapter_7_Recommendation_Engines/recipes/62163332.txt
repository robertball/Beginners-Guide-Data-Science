Ingredients:
2 C flour
1/2 t salt
1 1/2 t baking powder
1/2 C sugar
1/2 C shortening
2 eggs
1/2 C milk
2/3 C sugar
4 C diced, fresh Rhubarb
Glaze:
3 T milk or cream
1 C powdered sugar (or enough for desired consistancy)
1/2 t vanilla

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients reserving 2/3 C sugar.  Cut in shortening.  Beat the eggs; add milk.  Combine with dry ingredients.  (Can make in a food processor.)
Grease a 9x13 pan and spread in 2/3 of the batter.  Arrange rhubarb over batter and sprinkle with remaining sugar.  Drop spoonfuls of remaining dough over the rhubarb. (There will not be enough dough to cover the rhubarb completely.)
Bake at 350 in a preheated oven for 35-40 minutes or until lightly brown.
Combine ingredients to make the glaze.  Mix until smooth.  Add more or less sugar/milk for desired consistancy.  Drizzle glaze over cooled cake.
