Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 1/4 cups mashed ripe bananas
2 tablespoons sour cream
1/3 cup melted butter
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 1/2 x 8 1/2-inch loaf pan with butter. Whisk the flour, oats, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; set aside.
Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until smooth. Beat in the bananas, sour cream, and melted butter. Add the sugar, cranberries, and lemon juice; beat until evenly blended. Fold into the oat mixture until no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
A fun twist on banana bread. The cranberries add a sweet and tart flavor that really kicks up the flavor of this bread. Super moist and super flavorful, it's a great addition to brunch! If you like more of a buttery taste, try brushing the top of the baked loaf with a pastry brush and a little bit of melted butter.
