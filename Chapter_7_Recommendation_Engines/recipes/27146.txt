Ingredients:
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened baking chocolate
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup milk
2 cups white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Butter a 9x9 inch dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine chocolate, butter and milk.  Bring to a boil and let boil 1 minute.  Stir in sugar and salt until dissolved.  Heat, stirring constantly, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.  Let cool 10 minutes.
Beat fudge with a spoon until it loses its gloss.  Pour quickly into the buttered dish.  Refrigerate 30 minutes, until firm.
