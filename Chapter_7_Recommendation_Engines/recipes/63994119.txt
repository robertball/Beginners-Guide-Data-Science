Ingredients:
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoons fennel seed
3 tablespoons sugar
3 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
4 teaspoons black pepper
6 lbs pork back ribs (2 large slabs)
3/4 cup bottled BBQ sauce
3 tablespoons mild honey
3 tablespoons cider vinegar

Directions:
Grind salt and fennel seed in a blender or coffee grinder. Combine with sugar, paprika, chili powder, onion and garlic powders, and pepper.
Cut each slab into 3 pieces (about 5 ribs each). Pat ribs dry and rub all over with spice mix. Chill, covered, overnight. Let ribs stand at room temperature 1 hour before grilling.
Preheat grill to 270-300Â°F for indirect grilling. Lightly oil grates and grill ribs, covered, 1 1/2 hours, turning once.
Heat BBQ sauce with honey and vinegar in a small saucepan and simmer 10 minutes. Brush on ribs, after 1 1/2 hours, basting and turning ribs once for another 30 mins until ribs are well-glazed and tender when pierced with a fork. Let stand 10 minutes before separating ribs.
