Ingredients:
4 Tyson® Fresh or Tyson® Individually Fresh Frozen® Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts
2 cups boil in bag rice

1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons white wine or vermouth
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 artichoke hearts (water-packed), quartered

Directions:
PREP: CLEAN: Wash hands. Rinse fresh chicken with cold water and pat dry, or remove protective ice glaze from frozen chicken by holding under cool running water for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut chicken into strips. CLEAN: Wash hands. Prepare rice according to package directions and set aside.
