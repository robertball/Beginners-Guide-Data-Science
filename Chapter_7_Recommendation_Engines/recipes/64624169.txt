Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs
1 16 ounce jar of your favorite salsa
1 cup black beans
Optional: 1 cup cooked, pureed squash or pumpkin (for added tasteless nutrition!)
1 cup of  frozen corn kernels (canned and drained works too)
4 ounces of Neufchatel cheese, cubed
2 cups cooked brown rice
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, shredded
Topping ideas: shredded lettuce, diced avocado, sour cream, diced onion, minced jalapenos, chopped black olives

Directions:
In a crock pot, add chicken and top with salsa, black beans, and squash/pumpkin. Stir until combined.
Cover and cook on high heat for about 3 hours or low heat for 5-6 hours or until chicken is tender and white throughout.
Remove chicken and shred it. Add back to slow cooker. Add corn and cubed cream cheese. Stir until cream cheese melts and blends into sauce and corn is warm.
Serve over brown rice with shredded cheese and your favorite toppers.
