Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs
3/4 cup  white sugar
3/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup melted butter
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 t cinnamon
1 T Vanilla
1 ripe banana, mashed
1 apple peeled and grated or finely chopped
Cinnamon/sugar mixture

Directions:
Grease muffin tin or line with muffin liners
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F
Sift together flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Create a "well" in the center.
In a small bowl, beat the eggs with a fork and add the milk, vanilla and butter.
Pour the wet ingredients into the flour "well" and mix quickly and lightly until mixture is moist throughout. Batter will be thick and lumpy.
Mash banana and grate  or chop apple. Add to batter until just incorporated, mixing as little as possible.
Spoon batter into paper lined muffin cups or greased tin.
Sprinkle top evenly with cinnamon/sugar mixture. Pat mixture down a little.
Bake for 18- 20 minutes until muffins are golden brown and top springs back to touch. Toothpick will come out clean.
