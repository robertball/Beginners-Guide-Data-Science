Ingredients:
1 10oz. or larger Bag of White Corn Tortilla Chips[only need as much as it takes to cover a large cookie sheet.]
8oz. shredded Monterey Jack Cheese
6-8oz. Seafood Chunks/Immitation Crabmeat, etc.
1/4 tsp. Paprika
1/4 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning

Directions:
Cover a LARGE cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  Arrange the largest tortilla chips in a single layer, covering the entire sheet, overlapping chips so that no foil shows thru.  Crumble seafood chunks between your fingers, sprinkling over chips.  Then sprinkle shredded cheese over that.  Distribute Old Bay and Paprika evenly over top and bake in a pre-heated 450 degree oven 5-10 mins, watching closely until cheese melts completely.  Don't let it get too brown!  Serve immediately.
