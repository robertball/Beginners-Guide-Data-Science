Ingredients:
3 cups flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
1 egg
1 T apple cider vinegar
5 T water

Directions:
Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.
Cut butter and shortening into dry ingredients.
Whisk together the egg, vinegar and water.
Gingerly sprinkle the egg & vinegar mixture into the flour & butter mixture, tossing gently.
It may not be necessary to add all of the egg & vinegar, so stop once the dough looks right (moist enough to gather into a ball, not so wet that it is goopy).
Roll out on a floured pastry cloth, using a floured rolling pin (works best if it has a sleeve).
Depending on what type of pie you are making you can either fill a bottom shell and top it with pastry dough or crumble, or bake it empty(use pastry weights or beans) -- make sure to prick it thoroughly with the tines of a fork.

Description: 
This recipe makes three crusts, so I usually put one shell in the freezer to use later.
