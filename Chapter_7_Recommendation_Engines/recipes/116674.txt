Ingredients:
6 1/2 cups thinly sliced potatoes
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place the potatoes, water, onion and bouillon in an ungreased microwave-safe 2-1/2-qt. dish. Cover and microwave on high for 12-14 minutes until potatoes are tender and bouillon is dissolved, stirring once.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt and garlic powder; stir in milk until smooth. Pour over potatoes. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes or until thickened, stirring twice. Stir in sour cream; sprinkle with cheese. Cook 3 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.
