Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cooking oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
8 baby corn ears, sliced
2/3 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
1 red chile pepper, sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat; cook the garlic in the hot oil until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion and baby corn and cook until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the mixture and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Pour the fish sauce, soy sauce, and oyster sauce into the mixture and stir until incorporated.
Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until the cornstarch is dissolved into the water; pour into the mushroom mixture. Cook and stir until thickened and glistening. Transfer to a serving dish; garnish with the chile pepper and cilantro to serve.
