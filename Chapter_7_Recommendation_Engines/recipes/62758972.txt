Ingredients:
2	pounds  extra-large shrimp (21-25 per pound, see note)
1/2	teaspoon  salt
1/2	teaspoon  cayenne pepper
2	tablespoons  vegetable oil
6	tablespoons  unsalted butter , cut into 6 pieces
2	teaspoons  all-purpose flour
1	teaspoon  tomato paste
1	teaspoon  minced fresh rosemary

1/2	teaspoon  dried oregano

3/4	cup  bottled clam juice
1/2	cup  beer

Directions:
1. SEAR SHRIMP Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and cayenne. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook half of shrimp, without moving, until spotty brown on one side, about 1 minute; transfer to large plate. Repeat with remaining oil and shrimp.
2. MAKE SAUCE Melt 1 tablespoon butter in empty skillet over medium heat. Add flour, tomato paste, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in clam juice, beer, and Worcestershire, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Return shrimp and any accumulated juices to skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until shrimp are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Off heat, stir in remaining butter until incorporated. Serve.
