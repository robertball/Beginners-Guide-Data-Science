2 tbsp Lemon Juice
1 tbsp Cornstarch
1 cup All Purpose Flour
1 tbsp Baking Powder

1/4 tsp Salt

2 Eggs
2/3 cup Milk
1 Lemon juiced and zest removed (about 3 tbsp juice)

Directions:
Blueberry Sauce:  Combine the blueberries and 3 tbsp sugar in a small saucepan.  Bring them to a boil and reduce the heat to allow them to simmer for 5 minutes.  Mix 2 tbsp of lemon juice and corn starch and add it to the blueberries.  Allow them to thicken slightly.  Remove them from the heat and cover them to keep them warm while you make the pancakes.
Lemon Ricotta Pancakes:  In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, eggs, milk, sugar,lemon zest, and 3 tbsp of lemon juice, salt, and nutmeg.  Add the flour and baking powder and whisk it together.
Butter a skillet set on medium high heat.  Pour three to four 1/4 cup portions of pancake batter into the hot pan.  When bubble just begin to form, flip the pancakes and cook for about 2 more minutes.  You want them to be golden brown.  Keep them warm in a 150 degree oven until you are ready to serve.
Top them with the blueberry sauce or maple syrup.
