Ingredients:
Table salt
1 pound elbow macaroni
1/2 small red onion, minced
1 rib celery, minced
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
Pinch cayenne pepper
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
Ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot.
Add 1 tablespoon salt and macaroni and cook until nearly tender, about 5 minutes.
Drain in colander and rinse with cold water until cool, then drain briefly so that macaroni remains moist. Transfer to large bowl.
Stir in onion, celery, parsley, lemon juice, mustard, garlic powder, and cayenne, and let sit until flavors are absorbed, about 2 minutes.
Add mayonnaise and let sit until salad texture is no longer watery, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
(The salad can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Check consistency and seasonings before serving.  )

Description: 
ATK:  leaving the pasta a little wet a) gives the pasta the moisture it wants without b) sucking the moisture from the mayo you'll be using.  **Letting the pasta sit with the spices allows them to be drawn into the pasta;  once the mayo is in, it seals the outside of the pasta preventing any flavor from entering.
