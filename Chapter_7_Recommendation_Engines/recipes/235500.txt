1 (32 ounce) jar Polish dill pickles, cut into thick bite-size pieces
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup cider vinegar

1 tablespoon pickling spice

Directions:
Place pickle pieces in original pickle jar.
Stir white sugar, cider vinegar, brown sugar, water, and pickling spice together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir to a syrup-like consistency, about 2 minutes.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make these pickles, and they were a family favorite. It's a shame they have to sit for 2 weeks before they're ready, because when she opened them, they were gone in a day!
