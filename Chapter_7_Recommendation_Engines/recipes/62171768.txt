Ingredients:
•5 cups rice crispy cereal
•4 cups mini marshmellows
•4 Tbls. butter
•2 1/2 tsp. milk + 1 tsp. mint extract
•6 oz. semi sweet chocolate chips
•6 oz. white chocolate chips
•2 regular sized peppermint candy canes- crushed
•36-40 mini muffin papers

Directions:
Make a basic Rice Crispy Treat by melting the butter over medium heat in a very large saucepan. Add the marshmellows and stir til melted, then add in milk with mint extract. Stir again. Then add in cereal and stir til well coated. Remove from heat and work quickly with damp hands, break off a small amount of the coated cereal and form into a small ball. Place the ball on a waxed paper covered cookie sheet. Continue doing this til all the balls are formed. You should have about 36 - 40 balls. Set aside.
Melt semi sweet chocolate in microwave according to directions on bag. Dip each ball in the chocolate and smear the chocolate all over the ball with your hands making sure to evenly but thinly coat the ball. Place back on waxed paper covered cookie sheet. Repeat this for half the balls. Sprinkle the crushed candy canes over top of the balls before they dry. Repeat this method with the white chocloate.
When all the peppermint balls are dry, place each one in the mini paper cups.
Serve and enjoy!

I came up with this when I was trying to think of a Christmas treat for the kids. We adults have rum balls...so I thought this would be perfect for the kids! The kids loved it and so did the adults!
