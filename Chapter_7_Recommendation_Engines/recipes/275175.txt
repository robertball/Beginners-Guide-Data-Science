Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 large nectarine, pitted and cut into 8 wedges
2 thick slices crusty bread
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon crushed sliced almonds
2 leaves fresh mint, minced
2 teaspoons honey, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate.
Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil onto a small plate. Place nectarine wedges on the plate and cover all sides with oil. Brush both sides of bread with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Place nectarines onto the hot grate and grill 1 to 2 minutes per side; remove to a plate. When nectarine wedges have cooled slightly, cut each wedge in 1/2 lengthwise so you now have 16 pieces.
Place bread slices onto the hot grate and cook until grill marks appear and bread is toasted, about 1 minute per side; remove to a plate.
Spread ricotta cheese onto each slice of toast. Arrange 8 nectarine slices onto each toast and top with almonds. Sprinkle with mint and drizzle with honey. Cut each toast in half and serve.

Description: 
This sweet and creamy ricotta toast makes the perfect brunch or mid-day snack. Grilling the fruit adds a lovely caramelized flavor, topped with the sweetness from the honey, crunch from the almonds and brightness from the hint of fresh mint.  Use a thick-cut crusty bread like sourdough so it can stand up to the toppings.
