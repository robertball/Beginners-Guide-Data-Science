Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
1-1/4 cups sugar
2 pounds apricots, including skin, pulled apart, divided
1 vanilla bean
1/2 large lemon, juiced

Directions:
Make a syrup: Stir the sugar and water together in a large, heavy bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring until clear, 1-2 minutes.
Add half the fruit: Add half of the pulled-apart skin to the syrup. Simmer until they disintegrate, stirring, for about 10 minutes.
Add the remaining fruit: Slice the vanilla bean the long way, and run a knife along the inside edge to remove the seeds. Stir the seeds into the jam and add the pod. Add the remaining apricots, along with the vanilla bean, and stir for another 5-7 minutes, until the apricots soften. Remove the vanilla pod.
The final touch: Add the lemon juice and cook for another 3 minutes. The jam will last for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator; mine never lasts that long.

Description: 
Nothing tastes better on a summer morning than home-made jam on a warm, freshly baked biscuit. And despite everything you may have heard, making jam is easy and extremely satisfying.

If you’ve never attempted to preserve your own jam, frightened off by all those bottles to sterilize and seal, you are not alone; it feels like very risky business. But there’s a better way. If you come home from the farmers’ market laden with beautiful fruit, you can make jam in small batches and simply store it in the refrigerator. Nothing to sterilize, nothing to seal.
