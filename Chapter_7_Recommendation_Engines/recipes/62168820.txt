Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 pound raw shrimp, finely chopped
1/3 cup water chestnuts, chopped
1 cup green onions, chopped finely
2 tsp soy sauce
1 egg
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
2 packages of large egg roll wrappers

Directions:
In a bowl, combine first 4 ingredients.  Add egg, say sauce and mix thoroughly.  Season with salt and pepper.  At one end of an egg roll wrapper, spoon 1 tablespoonful of the pork mixture and roll tightly.  Brush one end of wrapper with water to seal.  Deep fry until golden brown (slow cooking advisable). If you plan to cook them the next day, take them out of the freezer and refrigerate them overnight, OR if you’ll cook them the same day you took them out of the freezer, wait at least 20-30 minutes until they’re ready.
