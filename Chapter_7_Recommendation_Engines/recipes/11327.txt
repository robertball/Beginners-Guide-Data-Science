Ingredients:
1 pint vanilla ice cream
2 cups butter
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fruit preserves, any flavor

Directions:
Add flour to butter or margarine and crumble in pastry blender. Add ice cream  to crumbled mixture and, using dough hooks, work into dough. (If you don't have dough hooks, use your hands. Rubber gloves will help cut down  the cold temperature from the ice cream.) When dough is smooth, shape into ball and refrigerate  overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll dough to about 1/8-inch thickness on a floured surface. Using the rim of a glass dipped in flour, cut out  circles. Place on a cookie sheet and make a thumbprint in center of  each. Fill thumbprints with 1/2 teaspoon fruit filling.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar when cool. Eat and enjoy!
