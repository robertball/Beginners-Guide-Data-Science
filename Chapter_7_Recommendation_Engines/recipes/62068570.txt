Ingredients:
1/4 of a block of tofu
1 can artichoke hearts
1 clove of garlic
1 small onion
(you can add mushrooms if you like - I've done this too)
slice of cheese for each wrap
and flour tortillas (or whatever is your favorite)
the above is strictly vegetarian however if you want a little zest add bacon

Directions:
take your tofu - cube it into 1/4 or 1/2 inch cubes & fry it in butter & garlic & onion. When it starts to turn brown add your chopped artichoke. Make sure there's enough butter to keep it from drying out and the tofu from sticking to the pan. When the artichoke starts to get a little golden remove from the pan and fold it into tortilla's and wrap them up. It's delicious. If you want a little sauce use thousand island or ranch.
