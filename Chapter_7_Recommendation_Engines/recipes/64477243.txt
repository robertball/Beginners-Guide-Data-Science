Ingredients:
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts - pounded flat
The liquid from a 20 oz jar of dill pickles
2 large eggs
¼ cup milk
1 cup flour
2 Tbsp powdered sugar
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
½ tsp celery salt
½ tsp dried basil
6 sandwich buns
2 Tbsp softened butter
12 dill pickle slices
Peanut oil for deep frying

Directions:
Heat peanut oil to 350° F in a deep fryer or heavy skillet.
Cut each chicken breast in half and place in a bowl. Pour the liquid from the pickles over the chicken pieces and let sit for one hour.
Meanwhile, mix together flour, powdered sugar, and spices in a bowl.
Whisk together egg and milk.
Drain liquid from chicken and very quickly rinse off. Shake any excess liquid from chicken.
Dip each piece of chicken into flour mixture, then into egg/milk, then coat again with flour. Repeat process with each piece again, if desired.
Deep fry chicken, 3 pieces at a time, for 2-3 minutes per side. Chicken should be golden brown and an internal temperature of 160° F.
Let chicken rest on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet for 5 minutes.
While chicken is resting, lightly butter each sandwich bun and toast them in a skillet.
Add 2 pickle slices to the bottom of each bun, then a chicken piece, then top of bun.

Description: 
These are pretty darn close to those famous sandwiches found in the mall food court. I like to make them on Sundays. Serve with waffle fries.
