Ingredients:
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll both puff pastry sheets and roll each one out to a rectangle of the same size. Brush one puff pastry sheet with a little water and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese. Lay the second puff pastry sheet on top, brush with water, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese. Using a large star cutter cut out about twelve 2 1/2 to 3 1/2-inch stars.
Place stars on prepared baking sheet and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes (or 5 minutes in the freezer).
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed up and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
