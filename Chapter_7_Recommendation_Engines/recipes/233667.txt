Directions:
Toss strawberries and sugar together in a bowl; refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Beat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl with a whisk for about 2 minutes; fold whipped topping into the pudding mixture.
Slice angel food cake horizontally into 3 layers. Spread strawberry jam onto cut side of 1 layer putting it together with one of the remaining layers; cut into 2 inch pieces. Spread jam onto the remaining layer and also cut into 2-inch pieces; sandwich pieces together.
Layer about half the cake pieces into the bottom of a trifle bowl; top with a layer of about half the strawberries. Spread a layer of the pudding mixture atop the strawberries. Repeat layering. Top with blueberries.

Description: 
This is a delicious and easy dessert to make, short in ingredients and time. This is also a no-bake dessert, which makes it a summertime favorite! Looks beautiful in a trifle bowl. Great as a birthday or holiday 
dessert. Depending on how many people you are serving it usually does not last more than 1 day in my house! This can also be easily modified with other fresh fruits, but strawberry is our favorite! Pound cake cake work in place of angel food. Enjoy!
