Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 large egg, lightly beaten
3/4 buttermilk
1/4 cup creme fraiche or sour cream
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon red food coloring
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
For the Mascarpone Spread:
4 oz softened mascarpone
2 oz creme fraiche
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
In a large bowl whisk together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl whisk together the egg, buttermilk, and creme fraiche/sour cream,melted butter, red food coloring, and vanilla extract. Add them together and whisk just until combined. A little lumpy is fine. Heat a frying pan or griddle over medium high heat. When hot add butter or oil to grease, followed by a small scoop of the batter. Wait for the pancakes to bubble (2-3 minutes), flip and cook for a minute or two more. Meanwhile, mix all of the ingredients in the mascarpone spread together, and use to garnish the pancakes with some maple syrup. Enjoy!
