Ingredients:
1 cup honey
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup natural peanut butter
1 cup unsweetened flaked coconut
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine honey, coconut oil, and cocoa powder in a small pot and bring to a boil; cook at a boil for 2 minutes and remove from heat. Stir oats, peanut butter, coconut, and vanilla extract into the hot honey mixture until the peanut butter melts and the mixture is smooth.
Drop mixture by spoonful onto waxed paper. Set aside to cool until firm, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Choosing to avoid processed sugars doesn't have to mean suppressing cravings! This recipe totally satisfies my peanut butter cup cravings, but leaves me feeling full instead of slightly sick. Try maple syrup in place of honey for additional flavor. Enjoy!
