Ingredients:
3lbs/1.5 kgs large beef tomatoes or an asst of your favorite tomatoes-roughly chopped
1 large or two small red onions finely chopped
6-8 cloves of garlic roughly chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1 1/2 tsp oregano-preferably fresh
1/2 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp mustard powder
1 tbsp paprika
a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce
1//2-1 tsp basil
beef stock granules- a little more than a scoop or 1 1/2 blocks if you can't get granules
dried chillies-optional for spicy sauce
s/p
tomato paste-2 small cans or 1 tube
1 lb/.5 kg ground pork
1/2 cup freshly grated parmigiana cheese
Deep pan with lid-a soup pot is perfect

Directions:
Put the tomatoes, onion and garlic into the pot add a good glug of olive oil probably around 1/2 cup and pop the lid on. Simmer this on low for 4-5 hours stirring occasionally. Add one can or half a tube of tomato paste stir well and leave simmering. Cook the pork in a separate pan adding the beef stock and seasoning's to your taste (a good pinch of each will do it but be careful with the thyme if it's dried) then add the second can of tomato paste to the meat, stir and cook until mixed well. Add this to the tomato mixture and simmer for another 2 hours, in the last half hour of cooking add the parm cheese and make any adjustments to the taste you like. This sauce can be used for pizza topping, pizza bomba's, spaghetti, baked cannelloni, lasagne, anything you want.

Description: 
I can not find it in myself to buy a jar of sauce now that I make it fresh. It tastes so much better and is super easy to do too. This recipe will make enough for a family of four to have 2 main pasta meals....or you can just cut the recipe in half but I like to make a big pot because it's so yummy I have to have it twice. Oh and your house will smell amazing while this is cooking!
