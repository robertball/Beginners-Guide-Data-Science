Ingredients:
12 medium size firm ripe Roma Tomatoes (about 1-3/4 lbs.)
sea salt & freshly ground black pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/3 cup chopped parsley
1/4 chopped basil leaves (or 2 tablespoons dry)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 lb. Spaghetti
Grated Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise.  Set in shallow 9"x13" baking pan or dish, cut side up.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
Mix garlic, parsley,  basil, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Pat mixture over cut sides of tomatoes.  Drizzle with 2 tablespoons more oil.
Bake, uncovered, in 425 degree oven until browned on top  (approx. 55 to 70 minutes).  Pan juices may become very dark.
When tomatoes are almost done, begin cooking spaghetti according to package directions.
Meanwhile, take 5 of the roasted tomato halves, and coarsely chop. Place in a warm large serving bowl.  Strain cooked spaghetti and drain well. Add to tomato mixture, and toss gently. Season to taste.  Serve with cheese, as desired.
