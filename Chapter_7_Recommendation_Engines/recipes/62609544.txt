Ingredients:
10 ounces frozen chopped spinach (thawed, strained)
1 ounce olive oil
3 ounces onion (finely chopped)
1 teaspoon garlic
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon dried dill
16 ounces sour cream
½ Cup Mozzarella Cheese (shredded),
1/2 Cup grated parmesan cheese,
2 ounces heavy cream,
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt
black pepper
1/4 cup grated parmesan

Directions:
1. In a small sauté pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent. Stir the garlic, tarragon, and dill, into the onions and cook an additional 30 seconds. Remove from the heat.
2. Squeeze as much water as possible from the spinach. Place it in the pan with the sautéed onion and garlic mixture. Add all of the remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir until thoroughly until blended.
3. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the cheeses are completely melted and the dip is hot. Season the mixture with salt and pepper.
4. Transfer the dip to an oven-proof dish. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over the top. Place in an oven pre-heated to 400 degrees until the dip is hot and bubbly. The top should be nicely browned.
5. Serve immediately with your favorite crackers or flatbread!
