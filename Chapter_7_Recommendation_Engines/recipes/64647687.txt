Ingredients:
Any Type Of Candy { 5-8 Pounds }
Any Type Of Ice Cream { 2-3 Gallons }

Directions:
1. Choose a favorite ice cream candy topping. It can be unhealthy (Kit-Kat pieces, ground M&Ms, or ground Reese's Pieces, etc.) or healthy (bananas and strawberries). The possibilities of variations of things you can use as toppings are nearly endless.
2. Choose an ice cream flavor. Even though Friendly's only uses the two most popular flavors (vanilla and chocolate) for their Friend-Z's, you can make one with any ice cream on the market.
