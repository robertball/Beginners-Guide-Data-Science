Ingredients:
One butternut squash
1.5 lbs ground beef
2 cups cheese
Salt, pepper and herbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the skin off the squash. Cut into bite sized pieces and place into a casserole dish. Cook the beef on the stove. Salt and pepper both the beef and the squash. I used basil and chives but you can use whatever herbs you'd like. Put the herbs in both the beef and the squash. Once the beef is browned, drain out the grease and spread the beef over the squash. Place in oven for 20 minutes. Spread the cheese over the whole dish. I used fiesta blend but you can use whatever flavor you like. Place back in oven for another 10 minutes. Once done, serve and enjoy.

This is a dish one of my sister-in-laws created. My husband I altered it just a tad. It's so good and the kids will enjoy it.
