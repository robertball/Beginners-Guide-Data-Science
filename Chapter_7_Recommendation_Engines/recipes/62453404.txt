Ingredients:
2 cups pinto beans
8 cups water
3/4 cup vegetable oil
7 cloves garlic, minced
3 tsp seasalt
2 large bay leaves
1 tomato, finely chopped
Shredded mozzerella to garnish

Directions:
Pour your beans out and sort them, discarding any rocks or shriveled beans. Put the beans in a colander and rinse them under cold water.
Pour the beans in a large 4 quart pot. Add water and the bay leaves.
Put the stove burner on high and cover partially with a lid. As soon as the beans start to boil, lower the heat so your pot maintains a rapid boil. Cook for 2 hours and keep adding water as it cooks away. (You may want to keep a seperate pan just for water to heat up in so the water you add is hot and maintains a boil) Stir occasionally, keeping the water level at 2 inches above the beans.
The beans should be soft and darker brown in color. If not cook them another 20 to 30 minutes. When beans are soft add the oil, salt, tomato, and  garlic. Bring the beans to a boil again and lower the heat to a slow boil. Cook for an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Remove beans from heat. Remove bay leaves and mash beans with a potato masher. Serve topped with Mozzerella.
