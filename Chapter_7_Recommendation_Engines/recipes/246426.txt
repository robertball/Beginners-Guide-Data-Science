Ingredients:
Dough:
1 cup red lentils
2 teaspoons oil
1 onion, quartered
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 bunch fresh parsley
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup oil
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon chile powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
salt to taste
Sauce:
1 cup yogurt
4 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon tahini
salt to taste
Toppings:
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 tomato, cubed
1/4 cup sliced olives
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
2 teaspoons minced green onion

Directions:
Place red lentils in a bowl and cover with water. Let soak until softened, about 2 hours. Drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease with 2 teaspoons oil.
Place lentils in a food processor with onion, garlic, 1/2 bunch parsley, cilantro, and 1/4 cup green onions; pulse until finely ground.
Transfer lentil mixture to a large bowl. Add 1/3 cup oil, egg, baking powder, black pepper, chile powder, cumin, coriander, and salt; mix until well-blended. Spread dough to 1/4-inch thickness onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and firm, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
Combine yogurt, lemon juice, tahini, and salt in a small bowl; mix well until sauce is smooth.
Layer sauce, Cheddar cheese, tomato, olives, 1 tablespoon parsley, and 2 teaspoons green onion on top of baked dough.
Return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Falafel is one of the most popular foods in Egypt. It's made out of peeled beans and always served fried. It's also made in the Levant area (mainly Syria and Lebanon) using chickpeas. 
In my recipe, I used red lentils and replaced the traditional cooking method (frying) with baking. Using lentils instead of beans to create an innovative recipe has been quite satisfying.
