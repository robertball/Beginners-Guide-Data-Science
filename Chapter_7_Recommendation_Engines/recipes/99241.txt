Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can water-packed tuna, drained
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 egg white
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine the tuna, teriyaki sauce, bread crumbs, and egg whites in a bowl until well combined, and no large pieces of tuna remain. Season with black pepper, garlic, and hot sauce. Mix well, then form into two patties.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the patties until brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side.
