Ingredients:
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cooked and diced
2 C Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1 C Herdez salsa verde
1 C fresh cilantro, chopped
12 (7-inch) flour tortillas
10 oz. Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1 C whipping cream
1/2 C Chicken Broth
Montreal Chicken Seasoning, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°
In a medium bowl, mix chicken, salsa, 1 cup cheese, and cilantro. Set aside.
In a shallow dish, whisk half and half, chicken broth, and montreal seasoning.
Place tortillas in a plastic bag and heat in the microwave for 30-40 seconds or until soft.
Dip each tortilla in the half and half mixture to coat.
Place tortilla in a lightly greased 9x13 baking dish.
Fill the tortilla with 2-3 tablespoons of chicken mixture.
Roll tortilla around the mixture opening-side down.
Continue until all of the chicken mixture is gone.
Pour remaining half and half mixture over filled tortillas and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese is completely melted.
Squeeze fresh lime juice on top before enjoying for an even more unique flavor.
