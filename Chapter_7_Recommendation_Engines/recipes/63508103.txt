Ingredients:
1 lb dried red beans
1 lb smoked turkey sausage
2 quarts hot water
1 cup finely chopped onions
1/2 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf

Directions:
In a large pot, place the beans and enough water to cover by 2 inches. Soak the beans overnight. Drain thoroughly.
To the same pot over medium heat add all the remaining ingredients. Cover, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring often. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes longer, or until the beans are tender. Remove the bay leaf and serve with rice.

Description: 
If you want real cajun, you have to try Red Beans and Rice.  Often, this simple dish is loaded with fat and sodium.  Try this reworked recipe that everyone loves! (No one will ever know it's the healthy version!)
