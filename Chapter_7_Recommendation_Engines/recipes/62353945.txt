Ingredients:
1 cup Extra-virgin olive oil
1 package dry Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 small bags thin pretzels - 1 knot, 1 stick

Directions:
Mix first 4 ingredients in a large measuring cup or bowl.
Place pretzels in a bowl large enough to hold both bags.  Pour the oil and dressing mixture over the pretzels and toss gently, yet thoroughly.
Spread pretzels onto 2 cookie sheets, making sure to scrape all the oil mixture onto the pretzels.
Bake at 200F for 1 hour, stirring gently every 15 minutes.
Let cool.  Store in airtight containers.
