Ingredients:
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise
6 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat oil in a cast iron skillet until shimmering. Place Brussels sprouts carefully in the hot oil, cut-side down. Sprinkle in garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until Brussels sprouts begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until Brussels sprouts are very browned and tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Shake skillet every 5 minutes to ensure even cooking.
Season with salt and pepper, stir in balsamic vinegar, and serve immediately.
