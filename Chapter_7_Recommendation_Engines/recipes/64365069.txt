Ingredients:
1 medium red onion, chopped
2 red bell peppers, chopped
1 small butternut squash (1½ pounds or less), peeled and chopped
4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
ground sea salt
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chopped chipotle pepper in adobo, or more to taste
1 bay leaf
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
14-ounce can diced tomatoes, including the liquid
4 cups cooked black beans or 2 cans, rinsed and drained
14-ounce can (about 2 cups) vegetable broth
2 avocados, diced
Tortilla crisps for garnish

Directions:
1.In a 4 to 6 quart Dutch oven or stockpot, sautée the chopped vegetables (onion, bell pepper, butternut squash, garlic) in one to two tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. You’ll need to stir the ingredients every few minutes so they can cook evenly.
2.Once the onions start turning translucent, turn the heat down to medium-low. Add all of the spices and canned ingredients, and stir. Cover for about one hour, stirring occasionally. Taste test for spice level and add more chipotle if desired.
3.By the time your chili is done, the butternut squash should be nice and tender and the liquid should have reduced a bit, producing the hearty chili consistency that we all know and love.
4.Serve the chili in individual bowls, topped with crispy tortilla strips and plenty of diced avocado.
