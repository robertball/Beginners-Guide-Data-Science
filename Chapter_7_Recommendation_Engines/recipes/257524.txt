Ingredients:
2 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup spelt flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup brown sugar (optional)
2 tablespoons chia seeds
2 tablespoons ground flax seeds
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup applesauce
1/2 cup honey
1 banana
1 egg
1/4 cup chopped dates

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Combine oats, spelt flour, wheat germ, brown sugar, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.
Combine applesauce, honey, banana, egg, and dates in a blender; blend until very smooth. Pour over the oat mixture and mix well.
Scoop granola mixture into the pan. Press down firmly with wet hands to spread evenly in the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until very lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes. Cut into bars. Cool completely before lifting from the pan, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Easy granola bars that do not get sticky or fall apart when packed in a lunchbox. Lots of nutrition has been snuck into a bar that is as appealing to kids as to their health-conscious caregivers. I like to store most of them in the freezer and just pull out a few at a time to thaw.
