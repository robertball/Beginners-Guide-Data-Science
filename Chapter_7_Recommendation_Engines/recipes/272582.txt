Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup low-fat cream cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 cloves garlic, grated
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup chopped fresh mozzarella, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Combine chicken, egg, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, olive oil, bread crumbs, basil, red pepper, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley, and oregano in a freezer-safe bowl and mix well. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes to make the mixture firmer and easier to handle.
Use an ice cream scoop or cookie scoop to form the mixture into about 14 meatballs a little larger than a golf ball. Add a piece of mozzarella cheese to the center of each meatball, making sure cheese is covered by meat. Place meatballs on a nonstick baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted to make chicken meatballs for quite some time and was never able to find a good recipe. I came across one, but modified it based on my own preferences. I thought these came our absolutely delicious and served them with pasta and marinara sauce and homemade garlic bread!
