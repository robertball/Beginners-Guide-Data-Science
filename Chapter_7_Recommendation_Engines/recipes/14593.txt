Description: 
You can't go wrong with meat and potatoes, and this recipe combines them in one dish. The recipe was given to my husband by a friend at work who brought it for lunch often.  I usually double it for my family; my husband works in a giant tire factory, and has an appetite to match.  The smell makes it hard to wait for it to finish baking.
