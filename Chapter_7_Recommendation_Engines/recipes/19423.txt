Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package macaroni
1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, sliced
1 tablespoon butter
salt and pepper to taste
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.  Place a quarter of the macaroni in the bottom, followed by an even layer of one-quarter of the cheese slices.  Dot with butter and season with salt and pepper.  Repeat layering three times.  Pour evaporated milk evenly over the top of all.
Bake, uncovered, for one hour, or until top is golden brown.

Description: 
This is the classic baked Mac and Cheese of my childhood.  You can add sun-dried tomatoes if you wish, or sometimes I substitute minced garlic for the salt and pepper to give it added zing!  It can make Saturday Night more fun!
