Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 cups finely shredded zucchini
3 cups quick-cooking oats
2 cups chopped pecans
1 (10 ounce) package cinnamon chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy; add eggs and vanilla extract and continue beating until smooth.
Stir flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture and stir until well-blended. Add zucchini, oats, pecans, and cinnamon chips, respectively, mixing well after each addition. Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls 2-inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
