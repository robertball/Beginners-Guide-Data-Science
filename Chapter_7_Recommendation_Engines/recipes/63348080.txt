Ingredients:
•1 teaspoon baking soda
•2 teaspoons cream of tartar
•1 teaspoon corn starch (optional)

Directions:
Mix the baking soda and cream of tartar together until well combined. Use immediately.
To store baking powder: Add a teaspoon of corn starch to the mixture, and stir. This will absorb any moisture from the air, and prevent the baking powder from reacting before you need it. Store in an air-tight container.

My mom came to visit one summer and we decide to bake cookies. Since I had just moved into my new home; I could not find any baking powder. My mom saved the day when she said...we just have to make our own.!!
