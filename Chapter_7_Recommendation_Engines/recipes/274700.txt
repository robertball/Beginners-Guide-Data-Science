Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup unsalted butter, melted
4 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups dark chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter two 7x3-inch loaf pans.
Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and ginger together in a large bowl.
Mix pumpkin puree, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir into flour mixture; mix well to combine. Fold in chocolate chips. Divide batter between the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour and 20 minutes.
