Ingredients:
1 fluid ounce coconut-flavored rum
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
4 slices onion
6 (8 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Whisk together the rum, salt, pepper, cinnamon, powder, oregano, sage, vinegar, and lemon juice in a bowl; pour into a gallon-sized, resealable plastic bag. Add the onion and steaks to the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Allow to marinate in refrigerator 2 1/2 hours.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the steaks with the skillet covered to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium rare.
