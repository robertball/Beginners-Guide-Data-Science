Description: 
Ruth Beitelspacher of Aberdeen, South Dakota notes, 'I recently made this salad to serve at a turkey barbecue. It was just as big a hit as it was for our son's confirmation dinner some 40 years ago.' Her trim treatment of the timeless sweet-and-sour beans doesn't cut down on flavor one bit.
