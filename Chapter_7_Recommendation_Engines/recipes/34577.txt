Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
3 eggs
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, bite-size pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup tomatoes, diced
1 bunch raw broccoli, with stalk, chopped
1 cup frozen peas, thawed
1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool, peel, and slice.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
Whisk remaining oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until lightly emulsified; set aside. Place tomatoes, broccoli, peas, and corn together in a large mixing bowl; toss to combine. Add chicken, eggs and rice, and toss again. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Toss with dressing to coat just before serving.
