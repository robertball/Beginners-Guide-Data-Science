Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1 cup white sugar
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 (15.25 ounce) cans fruit cocktail, drained
1 (15 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 pint fresh strawberries, hulled and halved
3 apples, cored and diced
2 nectarines, pitted and diced

Directions:
In a large non-metallic serving bowl, stir together the crushed pineapple, sugar, and ricotta cheese until well blended. Stir in the fruit cocktail, pineapple tidbits, strawberries, apples and nectarines. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight. The longer you refrigerate before serving, the better it will taste.

Description: 
This is my doctored up version of a diet ambrosia salad my mom always made. I admit that this sounds strange, but it really is sweet and refreshing on a hot summer day! (It's not as low-cal as hers.)  It's also easy to adjust to your family's fruit preferences. Be sure to drain the fruit very well so the salad is not too soupy.
