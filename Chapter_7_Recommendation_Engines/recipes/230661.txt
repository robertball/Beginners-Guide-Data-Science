Ingredients:
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
2 cooked skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, diced
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
4 red bell peppers, halved and seeded
1/2 cup sour cream, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Mix cilantro, diced chicken, mayonnaise, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese in a bowl; fill pepper halves with chicken mixture. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese over peppers and arrange on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and filling is heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Top each pepper with 1 tablespoon sour cream before serving.

Description: 
This is my favorite version of stuffed peppers and super easy! Stuffing with chicken, cheese, and cilantro makes the peppers very flavorful and fun! I make this as a meal with a side of rice, but can also be made as cute appetizers.
