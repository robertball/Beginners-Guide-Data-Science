1/2 lb italian sausage, skins removed
1/2 lb ground beef
1 clove garlic, minced
1 T dried parsley flakes
1 T dried basil
1 t salt (optional)
1 1lb can tomatoes, chopped

Directions:
Brown both meats together slowly, spoon off excess fat. Add garlic, parsley, basil, salt, tomatoes and tomato paste. Simmer uncovered 30 minutes to blend flavors, stir occasionally.
Cook noodles in boiling salted water, until tender, drain, rinse in cold water. Meanwhile combine cottage cheese with eggs, seasonings and parmesan cheese.
Place 1/2 of the noodles in greased 13" x 9" x 2" baking dish. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles, add 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 of the meat sauce. Repeat layers.
Bake at 375Â° for 30 minutes. Garnish with triangles of mozzarella cheese. Let stand 10-15 minutes before cutting into squares, filling will set slightly.

Description: 
My mom's lasagna recipe, not sure where it originated. It's been served as long as I can remember, never any leftovers. I remember the first time I made this all by myself, for a bunch of college buddies in 1986!
