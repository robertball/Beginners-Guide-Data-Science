Ingredients:
9 eggs
3 cups half-and-half cream
1/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon or nutmeg
24 (3/4 inch thick) slices French bread
PRALINE SYRUP:
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup corn syrup
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup chopped pecans, toasted
2 tablespoons butter or margarine

Directions:
In a large bowl, lightly beat eggs. Stir in the cream, sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. Arrange bread in a single layer in two greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pans. Pour egg mixture over bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Remove from the refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, for syrup, combine brown sugar, corn syrup and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Stir in pecans and butter; simmer 2 minutes longer. Serve with French toast.

Description: 
There's quite a crowd when our family gathers for Christmas, and I'm always asked to fix this French toast. The praline syrup is a nice change of pace from traditional maple.
