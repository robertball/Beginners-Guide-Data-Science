Ingredients:
4 portobello mushroom caps
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon minced garlic
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup shredded part skim mozzarella or 2% pepperjack cheese

Directions:
Place the mushroom caps, smooth side up, in a shallow dish. In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, basil, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour over the mushrooms. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes or so, turning twice.
Preheat grill for medium-high heat.
Spray grate with non-stick spray. Place mushrooms on the grill, reserving marinade for basting. Grill for 5 to 8 minutes on each side, or until tender. Brush with marinade frequently. Top with cheese during the last 2 minutes of grilling.

Description: 
This seemed like a great recipe-just too much fat. I reduced the amount of oil to 1 tablespoon and switched out the cheese for a lower fat version. Add Dijon mustard instead of aioli sauce. Top with your favorite toppings. Don't forget to lightly toast a whole grain bun on the grill too!Modified from: Portobello Mushroom Burgers
