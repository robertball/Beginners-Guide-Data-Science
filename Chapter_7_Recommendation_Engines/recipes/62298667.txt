Ingredients:
1/2 Pkg of 3" Corn Tortillas (I like the brand El Popocatepetl (27oz) )
1 Cup Corn oil
2 Cups Chile de Arbol Hotsauce-see my recipe) ( you can add less if you dont want it as spicy or use a different kind)
1-3/4 Cups water
1 T. Salt (you may add more if you like)
1-1/2 Cups Mozzarella cheese
1 Small white onion sliced
Cojita Cheese to sprinkle on top

Directions:
Heat oil in skillet
Cut tortillas into strip, add them to hot oil. Cook until golden brown. Remove and place them on a papertowel to drain excess oil. Repeat until add are done.
Take any remaining oil in pan and drain except about 1 tablespoon.
Place all fried tortilla chips back into skillet. Begin by pouring 1 Cup water over the tortilla strips. Add onion, hotsauce and salt. Mix well with tongs. Cook about 3-5 minutes. The stips should start to feel tender. Add the last remaining water. Stir again and cook about 3 minutes.
Add the mozzarella cheese and mix well. Remove from heat. Top with cojita cheese.
Dish onto plates and serve
