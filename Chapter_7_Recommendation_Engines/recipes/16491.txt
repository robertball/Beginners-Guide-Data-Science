1 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder

1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray muffin cups with non-stick cooking spray, or use cupcake liners.
In a medium-size bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon. Stir in milk, egg, and oil. Continue stirring until the mixture is well blended. Fold in the berries. Spoon the mixture into the muffin cups, 2/3 full.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until light golden brown.

Description: 
Thick and healthy muffins are made with fresh berries of any kind and rolled oats. Good source of calcium and carbs. I  like to use either blueberries or raspberries in this recipe.
