Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
½ cup diced onion
½ cup chopped jalapeno peppers
½ cup diced celery
1 pinch salt
½ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 ½ cups water
½ pound sweet corn kernels
2 ounces fresh crabmeat
1 cup water
½ pound sweet corn kernels
2 cloves peeled garlic
6 ounces fresh crabmeat
¼ cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon Spanish paprika (preferably sweet)
1 bunch thinly sliced green onion for garnish
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat; stir in onion, jalepeno peppers, celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook until onions are soft and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir seafood seasoning and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; cook for 30 seconds.
Sprinkle flour over onion mixture; cook and stir until mixture is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Pour 2 1/2 cups water, 1/2 pound corn kernels, and 2 ounces crabmeat into the onion mixture; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer.
Place 1 cup water, 1/2 pound corn kernels, and garlic into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth.
Pour corn puree into the Dutch oven and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer until chowder is thicker and the color deepens, about 45 minutes.
Stir 6 ounces of crabmeat, paprika, and heavy cream into chowder. Season with salt and pepper to taste; garnish with green onions and a pinch of cayenne pepper.

Description: 
Ideally you would make this in the middle of summer with ears of fresh, sweet-as-sugar corn. You can also make a perfectly fine version of this chowder using a premium-quality, extra-sweet, frozen corn.
