Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour (155 grams)
1 cup all-purpose flour (155 grams)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (200 grams)
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine flours, yeast and salt.
2. Add the water and oil.  Stir to combine until a ragged dough forms.  Dump the dough onto a well floured surface and flour your hands (I used AP flour for all of this).
3. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.
4. Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place in a well floured coverable container and place into the fridge for a slow rise for a minimum of 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
5. Remove container after the rise is complete and allow to warm for 30-45 minutes prior to use.
6. Preheat oven to 425F and stretch the dough to the size and thickness desired.
7. 'Blind' bake the crusts in the oven for 8-10 minutes.
8. Once the crusts are done baking - turn the oven up to 450F.  Lightly brush the crust with olive oil and top with your sauce, toppings, cheese, etc.
9. Bake again for 6-8 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
10.  ENJOY!

Description: 
This is a pizza dough that I have made several times for my family.  It is easily scalable up (or down, but who'd do that) which has been a hit every time!  This is my 'base' recipe so it can be modified to whatever function you plan to do with it and to anyone's taste.
