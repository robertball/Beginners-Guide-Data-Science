Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons butter, softened
3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree
1/2 cup water
1 1/2 teaspoons brandy

Directions:
Combine flour, yeast, sugar, pumpkin pie spice, salt, butter, pumpkin puree, water, and brandy in the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.
Select the Sweet or Basic/White cycle using the Light crust setting and start the machine. (To make the bread without a bread machine, see Editor's Note.)
When the bread is done baking, remove it from the pan and allow to cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
A wonderful hearty pumpkin bread made in the machine. I make it every Thanksgiving. It's not like your usual pumpkin breads (sweet breads) made for dessert, it's more a serve-with-the-meal kind of bread.
