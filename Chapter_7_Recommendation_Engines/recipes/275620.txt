Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 1/2 cups white sugar
4 large cucumbers, divided
1 (750 milliliter) bottle silver tequila (such as Jose CuervoÂ®), chilled
16 fluid ounces key lime juice (such as Nellie and Joe's), chilled
1 lime wedge
margarita salt
crushed ice

Directions:
Combine water and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; stir until sugar has dissolved, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a container. Place simple syrup in the freezer to quickly chill, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel 3 cucumbers and place into a juicer; process to yield about 2 cups juice. Run through a strainer to remove excess pulp. Combine cucumber juice, tequila, lime juice, and chilled simple syrup in a large pitcher. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Slice remaining cucumber for garnish. Moisten rims of glasses using lime wedge. Pour salt into a small plate and dip each glass to coat rims. Place about 3/4 cup ice into a cocktail shaker. Stir cucumber mixture, pour some into the shaker, and shake for 10 seconds. Pour into prepared glasses. Repeat with remaining mixture. Garnish glasses with cucumber slices.
