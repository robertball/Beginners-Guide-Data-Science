Ingredients:
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Combine the lemon juice, ginger, pepper, and garlic in a small bowl. Place the chicken breasts in a deep bowl. Pour the ginger mixture over the breasts, turning once to coat both sides. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat the skillet on medium-high until hot. Add the chicken. Cook, turning once, until tender, about 8 minutes.
