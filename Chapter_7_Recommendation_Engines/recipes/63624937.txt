Ingredients:
4 pounds fresh salmon, skin removed
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons coriander
2 teaspoons chili powder (smoked chipotle preferred)
1tablespoon coarse sea salt
1/4 cup olive oil (or, if you can get it, lemon infused avocado oil)
1 lemon
1 cup Herdez Pasilla Chile Cooking Sauce
1 cup Avocado Crema (see recipe)
2 cups Summer Salsa (see recipe)
Large package corn tortillas (6 per person)
2 cups shredded angel hair cabbage
1 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Lay salmon in a large glass baking dish in a single layer.  Sprinkle with spices and gently massage into meat; flip and repeat, drizzling with Herdez .  Grate lemon zest over fish, then gently squeeze juice over the top.  Sprinkle with sea salt and drizzle with olive oil.
Roast salmon in 425 degree oven for approximately 8 minutes each side, or just until fish begins to flake.  (A thicker piece may take a bit longer; a thinner piece should be watched carefully to avoid drying!)
To serve: For each taco, top two warmed corn tortillas with flaked salmon, fresh summer salsa, avocado crema, raw angel hair cabbage, and crumbled feta.
