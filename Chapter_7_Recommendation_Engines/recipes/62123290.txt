Ingredients:
1 c. rice (whichever kind you like)
1 c. dry brown lentils
1/2 c. Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) Granules
1 medium onion, chopped
1 1/5 TBSP Chicken, Beef, or Vegetable Bullion Granules
1 Tsp Curry powder
1 Tsp Cumin
2 TBSP dried parsley flakes
5 1/2 c. Water
1/2 TBSP olive oil
black pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse the lentils and pick over for any foreign objects.
Add the lentils and 3 Cups of water to a small pot or saucepan and turn the heat on high until the water boils.
After the water boils, turn the heat down to low and simmer the lentils uncovered for 10 minutes.
While the lentils simmer, saute the onion in a saucepan using olive oil.
Next throw all ingredients (rice, TVP, bullion, curry powder, cumin, parsley, saute'd onion and 2 1/2 c. water) in with the lentils and stir it all up.  Turn heat back to high and bring to a boil.  As soon as the water boils, take the pot off the heat, cover, and set a timer for 20 minutes.  Don't lift off the lid for at least 20 minutes or the rice won't cook properly.  No peeking!
Finally lift the lid, give a good stir and serve.
