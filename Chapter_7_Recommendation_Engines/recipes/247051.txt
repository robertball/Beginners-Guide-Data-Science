Ingredients:
3 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
3 1/4 tablespoons superfine sugar
2 large eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 dash salt
1/2 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons sour cream
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest
1/2 cup lemon curd, divided
8 plain meringue cookies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Combine butter and sugar together in a large bowl; beat until creamy. Add eggs; beat until smooth.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat gradually into the butter mixture. Mix lemon juice, sour cream, and lemon zest into the batter.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups, filling each almost full.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 30 minutes.
Top each cupcake with a heaping teaspoon of lemon curd and 1 meringue cookie.

Description: 
I love the lemon and meringue combination, but the store-bought lemon meringue cupcakes always seemed to be too subtle in flavor. This is a recipe for those who want an extra lemony taste and prefer baking from scratch. You can refrigerate them before serving if you like.
