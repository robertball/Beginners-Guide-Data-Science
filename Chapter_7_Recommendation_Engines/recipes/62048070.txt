Ingredients:
3 medium green peppers, seeded and coarsely chopped
2 2-inch jalapeno peppers, seeded and coarsely chopped
1-1/2 cups distilled white vinegar
6-1/2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 ounce Certo

Directions:
Combine peppers in food processor and puree.  Add 1 cup vinegar and blend thoroughly.  Transfer to a large deep saucepan and add remaining vinegar, sugar and cayenne pepper, blending well.  Bring to a full rolling boil, stirring frequently.  Stir in Certo and continue boining 1 minute longer, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat and skim off foam.  Pour into hot sterilized jars to within a half inch of top.  Cover with sterilized canning lids after wiping the lip of the jar with a damp towel.  Turn jars over for about 10-15 minutes.  If the jars do not 'click' put into a hot water bath for at least 15 minutes.
