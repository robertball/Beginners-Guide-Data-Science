Ingredients:
1 small chopped onion
2-3 cloves of garlic
1/8 c Olive oil
16 oz can diced tomatoes
32 oz can tomato sauce
12 oz can tomato paste
2-3 bay leaves
Salt, Pepper
1-2 tsp Oregano
1-2 tsp Parsley
1 tsp white sugar
1/8-1/4 c Dry red wine
*Italian sausage or ground chuck optional

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in olive oil.  Add rest of ingredients.  Simmer for 2-3 hrs.  I sometimes let mine sit longer; sometimes up to 24 hr for full flavor.  Don't forget to remove Bay leaves before adding to Lasagna, or serving with Spaghetti.  I  sometimes add 1 lb of cooked ground chuck or cooked Italian sausage to it.
