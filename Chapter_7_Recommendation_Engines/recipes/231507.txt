Ingredients:
2 cups old-fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup raisins
2 tablespoons baking powder
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup canned pumpkin
1 cup almond milk
1/2 cup agave nectar
4 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup canola oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line them with paper liners.
Combine oats, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, raisins, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and baking soda in a bowl.
Mix zucchini, pumpkin, almond milk, agave nectar, eggs, and canola oil in a separate bowl; stir into dry ingredients until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Muffins are a favorite at my house. They're fast and easy to make too! The basis for this recipe came from the 'Eat Clean Diet'. Changes were made because of things I had on hand at the time. The zucchini was a great way to add veggies and fiber. Make a batch or 2 and freeze them for mornings you're in a hurry or just need a snack! Sometimes I'll warm one up in the microwave and drizzle a little agave nectar over it! Yum!
