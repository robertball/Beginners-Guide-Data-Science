Ingredients:
1oz Irish Cream
1oz Kahlau
1oz Grand Marnier

Directions:
Pour 1oz chilled Kahlua into a small glass. With a steady hand, pour in 1oz chilled Irish Cream to make a second layer, then gently pour in 1oz chilled Grand Marnier. Creme de cacoa can be used in place of Kahlua and Gran Gala triple orange liqueur can be used in place of Grand Marnier (a little less expensive not quite as good). Drink all at one time. Happy Flying!
