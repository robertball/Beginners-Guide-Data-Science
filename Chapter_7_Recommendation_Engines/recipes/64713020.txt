Ingredients:
500g fresh, ripe raspberries, washed
1/2 tbsp agar agar powder
2 tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
1.	Mix together the lemon juice and agar agar powder. Set aside to thicken.
2.	Heat the raspberries over medium heat. As they break up, use a masher to turn the fruit into a smooth consistency.  Do not liquify. Turn off the heat.
3.	Add in the thickened lemon/agar agar paste. Mix well. Allow to cool to room temperature. Store in refrigerator in an airtight container. Allow to set for 2 hours before consuming.

Description: 
I developed this recipe for a friend who has diabetes. She complained that most diabetic jams had sweeteners added leaving a strange aftertaste. Fresh fruit, when in season, is naturally sweet. To make jam, you donâ€™t need to add sugar. A little agar agar and lemon will help the cooked fruit thicken to make a spreadable fruit for your toast, sandwich, or cheeses. It will last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. This recipe will work with all forest fruits.
