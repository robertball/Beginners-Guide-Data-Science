Ingredients:
2 full bags Oversized Marshmallows
1 cup cinnamon red hots
3/4 cup water
1/8  cup sugar
1 Tbsp butter, softened

Directions:
Open 1 package marshmallows and try a few.
Spread marshmallows out on a sheet of wax paper. Set aside. You can have a few more of those delicious poofy things. They didn't all fit anyway.
Combine red hots and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir constantly.  Focus and stir. Stop eating marshmallows.
When almost melted mix in butter and sugar. Stir to combine.  Don't eat the marshmallow you dropped on the floor when you were trying to show off by juggling fluffy sustenance.
Remove from heat and drizzle over marshmallows.  You don't have any. Open the second bag and try not eat them, you glutton. Drizzle red hot reduction over these marshmallows.
Enjoy!
