1/2 pound lean ground beef
1 (26 ounce) jar pasta sauce

8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, divided

1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 2 1/2 quart baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain.  Stir in pasta sauce; remove from heat.
In a bowl, combine ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan and beaten egg.  Stir until well combined.
In the prepared dish layer half the pasta, half the sauce and half the cheese mixture.  Repeat.  Top with remaining mozzarella.
