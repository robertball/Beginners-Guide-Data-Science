Ingredients:
3/4 cup NAKANO® Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic
1 teaspoon dried tarragon, crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 navel oranges
1 cup fresh raspberries
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon salad oil
12 cups mixed baby greens
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon NAKANO® Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic
toasted pecans (optional)

Directions:
Combine 1/2 cup Nakano(R) Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic, tarragon and salt; stir well.
Place chicken in a shallow non-metallic container. Add vinegar mixture; marinate about 45 minutes. Drain chicken and discard marinade.
Grill or saute chicken until cooked as desired. When slightly cooled, slice each breast; cover and set aside.
Rinse oranges and pat dry. Use a citrus grater to grate the peel of 1 orange; do not grate white pith under the skin; set orange zest aside. Peel both oranges and slice.
Rinse raspberries and shake off excess water.
In blender container, combine raspberries, 1/4 cup Nakano(R) Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic, honey, salad oil, and orange zest. Cover and blend until smooth.
Place greens in a large bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and toss well to coat. Sprinkle with a little salt while tossing. Drizzle greens with remaining 1 tablespoon Nakano(R) Seasoned Rice Vinegar - Original or Roasted Garlic; toss well.
To serve, divide greens among 4 large salad plates. Place one sliced chicken breast on each plate. Arrange orange slices on each plate. Pour a generous ribbon of fresh raspberry dressing over chicken. Sprinkle salads with toasted pecans, if desired.
