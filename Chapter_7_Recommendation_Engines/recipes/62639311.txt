Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cranberry juice, divided
24 dried apricots
2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with
2 teaspoons water
3/4 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
12 slices thin bacon, halved crosswise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ.
In a saucepan, boil the apricots in 1 cup of cranberry juice until plumped up; remove with tongs or strainer and drain on paper towels; leave juice in pan.
Add the remaining 1/2 cup of cranberry juice to the saucepan and boil over high heat until reduced to 1 cup.
Whisk in cornstarch, brown sugar, mustard and nutmeg.
Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil 1 minute until thickened.
Cool to room temperature.
Reserve 1/2 cup of the glaze.
Meanwhile, microwave bacon in two batches until partly cooked but not crisp, about 3 minutes; drain on paper towels and let cool until it can be handled.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; set wire rack over foil and spray with cooking spray.
Wrap bacon halves around apricots and secure with wooden pick.
Brush with glaze and place on wire rack.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until bacon is browned, turning once.
Brush with reserved glaze; serve warm.
