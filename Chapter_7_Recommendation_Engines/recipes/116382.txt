Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) Italian sausage link
2 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil, divided
2 chicken thighs
1/2 cup sweet red pepper or green pepper chunks
1 small onion, quartered
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup frozen cut green beans

Directions:
In a skillet, cook sausage link over medium heat until no longer pink; cut into 1/2-in. pieces and set aside. Place potatoes in a 8-in. square baking dish; drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a skillet, brown the chicken in remaining oil. Add the chicken, reserved sausage, sweet pepper, onion, water, salt, oregano and pepper to the potatoes. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Add beans. Bake 10-15 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.
