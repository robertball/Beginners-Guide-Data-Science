Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound broiler-fryer chicken, cut up
1 cup water
4 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 medium onions, sliced
1 (15 ounce) can lima beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
dash cayenne pepper
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, slowly bring the chicken and water to a boil. Cover and simmer for 45 to 60 minutes or until chicken is tender, skimming the surface as foam rises.
Remove chicken and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard skin and bones. Cube chicken and return to broth.
Add the potatoes, onions, beans and seasonings. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Stir in remaining ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened.
