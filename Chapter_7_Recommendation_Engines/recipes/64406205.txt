Description: 
This is one of my favorite quick dinners.  While some people prefer to take their aggression out on the chicken and roll it with their favorite flavor enhancers inside, that's too much work.  After looking at those type of recipes I decided to simplify it.  

This is intended for a fast dinner, great to make before an event.  Prep it, get ready while it cooks, eat and then run.  

I cook this on Tuesday nights, as that's my busy evening.  I usually serve this with a side salad or green beans (I love green beans) which are easy to get ready in the last couple minutes while this is finishing
