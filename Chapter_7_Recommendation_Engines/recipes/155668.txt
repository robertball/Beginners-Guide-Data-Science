Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cooking oil
1 cup BUSH'S® Great Northern Beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup canned pumpkin
1/3 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and pepper to taste
Sauce:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender; set aside. Mash the beans in a large bowl.  Stir in the pumpkin, oats, sage, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix in the cooked onion and garlic.  Chill for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Shape the bean mixture into four patties. Place on a greased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown, turning once. Or cook in a nonstick skillet for 4 to 6 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
For sauce, combine mayonnaise and ginger. Spread sauce on the buns and fill each one with a bean burger patty.
