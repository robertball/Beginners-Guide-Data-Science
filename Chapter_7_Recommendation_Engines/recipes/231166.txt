Ingredients:
3 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced fresh chives
1 tablespoon steak sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dry mustard
3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
12 hamburger rolls, split
12 slices cooked bacon
4 ounces blue cheese

Directions:
Mix ground beef, chives, steak sauce, salt, pepper, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Form beef mixture into 12 patties.
Cook the patties until they are firm, hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Put burgers on split rolls; top with bacon and blue cheese to serve.
