1 Pound Fettuccine
1/4 Pound Pancetta, diced small
2 Pints Heavy Cream

1 Cup Parmesan Cheese, freshly grated
Freshly Ground Pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook the fettuccine in a large pot full of boiling water for about 8 minutes or until al dente. Cool under cold running water and drain.
In a large saute pan, cook the pancetta until lightly browned over medium heat. Remove pancetta from pan and set aside. Pour off any excess fat and discard.
Add one pint of cream to the saute pan and reduce by half over medium heat.
Add the fettuccine to the cream. Stir it till it boils. Add the remaining 1 pint of cream, garlic, pancetta, tomatoes and fresh basil, stirring to prevent scorching. The sauce should be reduced and thick.
Plate and serve with the fresh ground parmesan and maybe a little sprinkle of fresh basil.

Description: 
This looks complicated, but it is so simple.  I came up with this recipe when I needed to use up a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes and basil  from my patio garden. It is rich and creamy and a perfect fettuccine for a warm summer night. I served this with a crisp white wine......perfecto!
