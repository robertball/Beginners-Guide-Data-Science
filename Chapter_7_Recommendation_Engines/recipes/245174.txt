Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
red food coloring (optional)
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup milk
Frosting:
1 (6 ounce) package white chocolate chips
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow fluff
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat white sugar and 1 cup butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix peppermint extract, almond extract, and food coloring into creamed butter mixture.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl. Mix flour mixture, alternating with 3/4 cup milk, into creamed butter mixture, ending with flour mixture, until batter is just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
Melt white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. Allow melted white chocolate to cool to room temperature.
Mix marshmallow fluff and 1/2 cup butter together in a bowl until smooth. Stir melted white chocolate into marshmallow mixture. Add confectioners sugar, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, to marshmallow mixture until fully incorporated; add enough milk to reach desired consistency. Transfer frosting to a piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped and pipe frosting onto each cupcake.
