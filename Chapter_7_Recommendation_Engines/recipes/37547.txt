1 (8 ounce) package PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
3/4 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/4 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 (13 ounce) package miniature peanut butter cups (optional)

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, sugar, butter and vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended.  Add flour and baking soda; mix well.
Shape dough into 1/2-inch and 1-inch diameter balls.  Using 1 small and 1 large ball for each snowman, place balls, slightly overlapping, on ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten to 1/4-inch thickness with bottom of glass dipped in additional flour.  Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake at 325 degrees F for 19 to 21 minutes or until light golden brown.  Cool on wire rack.  Sprinkle each snowman with sifted powdered sugar.  Decorate with icing as desired.  Cut peanut butter cups in half for hats.
