Ingredients:
4-5 potatoes
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced
4-5 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small can sliced mushrooms, drained
1 cup grated Jack cheese
1/2 cup salsa

Directions:
The night before, wash potatoes well and pierce with a fork.  Bake at 400* for 60 minutes.  Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature.  Refrigerate overnight.
Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes.  Heat oil in a large non-stick frying pan.  Cook potatoes until browned and cripy.  Add garlic, green onions, bellpepper, mushrooms and parsley.  Stir well and heat through.
Transfer into a baking dish and top evenly with grated cheese.  Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly.  Serve with salsa on the side and enjoy!

Description: 
My husband and I celebrated our 19th wedding anniversary in Lake Tahoe and we sampled the most delicious Veggie Potatoes at a little restaurant we discovered.  I've tried to recreate the recipe the best I could and my husband thinks mine turn out even better than the ones we had in Tahoe.  I made these with breakfast, camping, and everyone loved them so much we bought the ingredients at the store that day and made them again the second morning we were camping.  These are great with breakfast or brunch, and just as good as a side dish with dinner.  Easy and delicious, what more could you ask f
