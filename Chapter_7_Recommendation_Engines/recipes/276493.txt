Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound boneless pork shoulder
8 fluid ounces root beer
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Pat pork shoulder dry and place in a slow cooker. Pour root beer over pork.
Mix together brown sugar, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and oregano in a small bowl until thoroughly combined. Sprinkle on top of pork and rub lightly until entire surface of pork is coated.
Cook on Low for 5 hours. Switch to High and cook until meat is tender and can easily be pulled apart with a fork, about 3 hours more. Carefully remove pork and shred with 2 forks. Drizzle some liquid from the slow cooker over pork to moisten.

Description: 
Easy slow cooker pork shoulder is excellent for making delicious pulled pork sandwiches or serving as an entree. Serve over rice or with Hawaiian sweet bread for a yummy little sandwich. I like to top the pulled pork with sliced roasted red peppers, blue cheese, and chimichurri sauce to make a delicious sandwich with Argentinean flavor.
