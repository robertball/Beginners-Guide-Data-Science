Ingredients:
1 broiler/fryer chicken (3 to 4 pounds), cut up
3 cups water
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1 celery rib, sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
NOODLES:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup egg substitute
2 tablespoons fat-free milk
1 tablespoon snipped chives
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Place the first nine ingredients in a Dutch oven; slowly bring to a boil. Reduce heat; skim foam. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until chicken is tender. Refrigerate broth and chicken for several hours or overnight.
For noodles, combine flour and salt in a small bowl. Combine egg substitute and milk; stir into flour mixture. Mix until well blended. Shape into a ball; knead on a lightly floured surface for 4-5 minutes. Roll out into a paper-thin rectangle. Dust top of dough with flour. Roll up jelly-roll style. Using a sharp knife, cut into 1/4-in. slices. Unroll noodles; allow to dry for at least 1 hour.
Skim fat from the broth. Strain broth and return to pan, discarding vegetables. Discard chicken skin. Bone and cube chicken; discard bones and set chicken aside. Bring broth to a boil. Add noodles slowly; cook for 2-5 minutes or until tender. Add chicken; heat though. Garnish with chives and parsley if desired.

Description: 
'When my mother-in-law created this recipe 50 years ago, money was tight,' relates Carla Roberts of Norcross, Georgia. 'I add more meat than she did, but the homemade noodles are still the star of the show in this comforting down-home dish.'
