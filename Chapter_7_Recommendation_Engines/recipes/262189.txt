Ingredients:
2 cups grated daikon radish
5 cups vegan dashi stock
1 (12 ounce) package silken tofu, cut into bite-size pieces
Â½ cup chopped mitsuba (white chervil)
2 teaspoons salt (optional)

Directions:
Place daikon in a colander and press down lightly to drain excess water.
Bring dashi to a boil in a large Japanese nabe or pot over medium heat. Add daikon; return to a boil. Add tofu, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Add mitsuba and salt.

Description: 
The Japanese have a very simple and health-conscious tofu recipe called yuki nabe ('snow pot') which can be loosely translated as tofu pot-au-feu.
 By just adapting the dashi soup stock to a vegan seaweed dashi, vegans and vegetarian can enjoy it! 

You can find my vegan Japanese dashi stock recipe on this site. Ask the guests to serve themselves with a ladle into individual bowls. Eat with a Chinese soup spoon ('renge' in Japanese).
