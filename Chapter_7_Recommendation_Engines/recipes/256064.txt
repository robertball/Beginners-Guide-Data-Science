Description: 
I had planned to make green chile Colorado this morning, but found that I was lacking most of the ingredients required. After playing 'I could substitute this' and 'I could use that instead', I realized that I had created a brand new recipe. Serve with warm tortillas, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.
