Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, thinly sliced
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Directions:
Mix sweet potatoes and milk together in a bowl. Mix flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a separate bowl. Remove a few sweet potato slices at a time, allowing excess milk to drip offl; dip the slices into the flour mixture. Place the coated sweet potatoes on a plate. Repeat with remaining sweet potatoes.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Combine 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl.
Fry the coated sweet potatoes, working in 2 to 3 batches, until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain chips on a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.

Description: 
I made this up after I could only find baked sweet potato chips on Allrecipes. (Those are great, too, but I was already frying fish and wanted some nice crunchy chips.) These are crisp, delicious, and easy. Don't sweat the measurements. I just eyeballed it, and you can too. Mix the seasoning to your own taste.
