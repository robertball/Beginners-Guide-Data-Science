Ingredients:
1 & 1/3 Cup Whole wheat flour
1/2 Cup Flaxseed Meal
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce or 1/3 melted butter
2 Tbsp. Canola oil
1 egg
1 Cup Buttermilk
12 Tbsp. of favorite jam

Directions:
Preheat an over to 350 degrees
Mix all your dry ingredients then all wet except for the jam. You can use cupcake papers which I recommend, I put about 1/2 the filling in and then put 1 Tbsp. of jam then fill the rest with the filling. Repeat and it makes right at 12 muffins
