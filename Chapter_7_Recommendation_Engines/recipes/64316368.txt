Ingredients:
Noodles:
2 large eggs
1 tsp salt
¼ cup milk
1½ - 2 cups flour
Soup:
2 Tbsp EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil)
½ large onion, chopped
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup diced celery
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken (I use rotisserie chicken)
8 cups chicken broth
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp pepper
1½ tsp thyme

Directions:
Prepare noodles by whisking eggs, salt & milk together. Add just enough flour until it forms a stiff dough. Roll dough very thin into a rectangle. Slice ?-1/4" thick strips with a pizza cutter (slice as thin as you can because they puff up significantly.) Let rest while preparing soup.
In a large stock pot, heat oil. Add onion, carrots, celery, & garlic. Saute 10 minutes. Add chicken, broth, & seasonings. Bring to a boil.
Once soup had reached a boil, add noodles a few at a time into the boiling liquid. Once all noodles have been added to the pot, simmer for 10 minutes to cook the noodles. Remove from heat & serve.
