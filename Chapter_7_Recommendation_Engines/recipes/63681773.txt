Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into thick fries
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon seasoning salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spray with cooking spray.
Place sliced potatoes in a colander; sprinkle sugar over potatoes.
Set aside until liquid is released from potatoes, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain liquid and dry potatoes well.
Mix potato slices, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a resealable bag until evenly coated. Spread coated potato slices in a single layer, leaving space around each potato, on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake at 425Â° for 20 minutes; flip fries and continue baking until crisp and browned, about 20 more minutes.
