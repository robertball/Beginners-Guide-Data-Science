medium lemon
3/4
cup fresh blueberries
1/4
cup Smucker's® Blueberry Preserves
2
teaspoons cold butter, cut into small pieces
2
cans Pillsbury® refrigerated cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing
1
egg
1/4
cup pecans or cinnamon pecans, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. Spray nonstick 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom with Crisco® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Line cookie sheet with parchment paper; place tart pan on cookie sheet.

In medium bowl, grate 1 teaspoon zest from the lemon. In small bowl, squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from the lemon; set aside.

Mix 2 tablespoons of the blueberries with the lemon zest, mashing berries slightly with fork. Stir in preserves, remaining blueberries and butter; set aside.

Separate rolls from both cans; reserve icing. On parchment paper, press rolls, cinnamon side down, into 3- to 4-inch rounds. Spoon about 1 tablespoon blueberry mixture in center of each round. Fold dough over filling, pressing edges to seal. Place filled rolls in pan, seam side up in spoke fashion with 2 in the center.
