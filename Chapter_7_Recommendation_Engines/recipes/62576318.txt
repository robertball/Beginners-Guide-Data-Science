Ingredients:
1 stick unsalted butter.,room temperature
3 oz. cream cheese
1 cup plus  2 tbsps. all purpose flour
2 dozen Hershey's Kisses, unwrapped
1 large egg
2 teaspoons instant coffee powder or espresso powder  (I used a Starbucks VIA instant)
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Grease tassie pans with cooking spray like Pam.
Mix butter, cream cheese and flour. Chill the mixture for one hour in fridge.
When it's done chilling, shape dough into 1 inch balls and place in tassie cups. Press each one into the shape of the cup. Put a Hershey Kiss in the cup.
Mix egg, coffee powder, cocoa powder and sugar until blended. Pour this mix over the Hershey Kiss in each cup.
Bake for 22 to 25 min. Mine were done after 21 min, so watch closely! Cool in pan for about five minutes or so then cool completely on wire rack.
Makes 2 dozen.

A delicious cookie recipe like no other! I usually make these around Christmas for my daughter to give as gifts to her teachers at school, but it's great for any time of the year when you need a little sweet treat!
