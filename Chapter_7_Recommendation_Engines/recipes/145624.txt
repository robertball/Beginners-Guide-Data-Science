Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups hazelnuts
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spread hazelnuts on the sheet in an even layer. Bake until skins have split and nuts are fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes; rub with a damp towel and blow the skins away. If they cooled off when you removed the skins, go ahead and warm them in the oven again. This will help them to release more oil.
Combine the nuts and chocolate chips in the bowl of a food processor. Add the honey and process into a smooth paste, adding more oil if needed. Spoon into a container and store at room temperature.
