Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups long-grain rice
3 cups water
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
1 tablespoon tomato bouillon with chicken flavoring (such as KnorrÂ®), or more to taste

Directions:
Place a pot over medium-heat heat; add oil and heat until oil shimmers slightly. Pour rice into the hot oil, stirring constantly, until rice is golden to dark brown, about 5 minutes.
Mix water, tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and bouillon into rice. Bring to a boil. Turn off heat and cover pot tightly with a lid. Leave pot covered on hot burner until rice has absorbed all the liquid, about 20 minutes. Adjust seasonings as needed.

Description: 
This recipe has been told to me by my girlfriends MIL from Mexico. I had to measure the ingredients. Never before have they been measured, always a 'handful of this and equal parts of this' until it looked right. I hope you enjoy it. It has become a family favorite in our home. I am always asked to make it!
