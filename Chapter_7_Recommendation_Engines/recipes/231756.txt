Ingredients:
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
4 pounds beef brisket
2 large onions, sliced into rings
2 bay leaves
3 1/2 cups Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Mix salt, black pepper, paprika, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl; rub spice mixture over brisket.
Arrange onion rings in the bottom of a roasting pan; lay brisket, fat-side up, atop onions. Scatter bay leaves around brisket. Pour beer over brisket. Cover roasting pan with an oven-proof lid or aluminum foil.
Cook in the preheated oven for 8 hours. An instant-read thermometer should read an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from oven and let rest for 1 hour before slicing.
