Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/3 cup diced celery
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pound cream cheese, at room temperature
2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained
2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
4 ounces grated white Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 ounce grated white Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cook bacon in a dry saucepan over medium heat until bacon is crispy and fat begins to foam, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove a few tablespoons of bacon to reserve for the top. Add green onions, celery, and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir until vegetables just start to soften, about 2 minutes. Drain bacon grease if desired. Turn off heat and let mixture cool.
Place cream cheese in a large bowl. Add the bacon-veggie mixture, clams, parsley, and 4 ounces Cheddar cheese. Season with Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and Old Bay(R) seasoning. Mix until nicely combined. Transfer into a small baking dish; smooth out the top. Scatter the reserved bacon and remaining Cheddar over the dip. Sprinkle cayenne pepper on top to get a richer, browned top.
Bake in the preheated oven until dip is heated through and top is browned, about 20 minutes. Heat under the broiler to further brown the top, about 1 minute more.

Description: 
After joking about making this dip in a previous video, I found it turned out amazingly well. Farewell, French onion dip -  a new soup-inspired dip is in town. Garnish with more parsley and serve alongside puffed potato chips since potatoes are an important part of clam chowder!
