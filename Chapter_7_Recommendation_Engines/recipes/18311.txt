Ingredients:
½ cup chopped walnuts
1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 2 inch pieces
2 ½ tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1  lemon, juiced and zested

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange nuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast in the preheated oven until lightly browned, approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
Place green beans in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Steam for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender, but still bright green.
Place cooked beans in a large bowl, and toss with butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer beans to a serving dish, and sprinkle with toasted walnuts. Serve immediately.
