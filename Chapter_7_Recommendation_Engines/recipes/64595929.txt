Ingredients:
1-1/2 pounds ground beef (or turkey)
1 can (10-3/4 ounces) condensed tomato soup, undiluted
3/4 cup water
1 envelope taco seasoning
1 can (12 ounces) refrigerated buttermilk biscuits
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese
2 cups torn leaf lettuce
2 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 cup salsa
1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream
1 can (2-1/4 ounces) sliced ripe olives, drained
Green onions

Directions:
Cook meat in a large skillet over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Stir in the soup, water and taco seasoning; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut each biscuit into eight pieces. Remove beef mixture from heat and gently stir in biscuit pieces. Transfer to an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish.
Bake, uncovered, at 375Â° for 20-25 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Sprinkle with cheese; bake 8-10 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Serve with toppings.
