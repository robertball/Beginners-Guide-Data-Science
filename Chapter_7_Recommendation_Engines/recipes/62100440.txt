Ingredients:
40 Saltine Crackers (one sleeve)
1 C Brown Sugar (packed)
1 C Butter (NOT margarine)
12 oz Chocolate Chips
1 C finely chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Cover bottom and sides of a cookie sheet with foil. Cover sheet with a single layer of saltines - do not overlap!  Set aside.
Melt butter in saucepan, add sugar and melt.  Bring to a full rolling boil.  Boil 3 minutes, stirring often.
Remove from heat and pour immediately & gently over the crackers.  Bake for 5 min.  Check often to make sure sugar doesn't burn (some ovens heat hotter than others!)
Remove from oven and sprinkle chips over toffee/crackers.  Let sit a few minutes then spread chocolate evenly over pan and up the sides.  Sprinkle with nuts
Refridgerate at least 2 hours.  Remove foil and break into irregular pieces (do not cut).  Store in fridge.
