Ingredients:
1 pound thick sliced bacon
1/2 cup brown sugar or pure maple syrup
1/4 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange bacon on baking sheet in a single layer with the edges touching or slightly overlapping.
Generously sprinkle brown sugar (or pour maple syrup) evenly over bacon slices. You can also put the bacon and brown sugar in a zip lock bag, seal and shake to coat. Then sprinkle pecans on top (optional).
Bake in preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove bacon from the baking sheet and serve.
