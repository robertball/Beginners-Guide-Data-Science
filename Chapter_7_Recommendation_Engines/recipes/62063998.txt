Description: 
Living in the Caribbean is a wonderful way of life!  I am always trying to come up with new recipes that combine my new culture and my roots.  Although I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, southern barbecue was a big part of my youth and coming up with unique BBq sauces was family fun.  Spice this recipe up or down according to your personal taste.
