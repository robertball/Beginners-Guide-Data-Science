Roast for 40-50min.
When the potato is golden brown and the wings are dark brown beautifully roasted,- your dish is ready.

Description: 
I bet you love chicken wings and roasted potato. The recipe is inspired by necessity to cook something fast and easy. Roasted potato is a recipe of my Italian friend and wings’ recipe is borrowed from one diner.

It’s literally more efforts to eat than to cook. (Just remember if you want them even more delicious marinade the wings overnight)
