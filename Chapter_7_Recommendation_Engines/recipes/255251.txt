Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
8 pineapple rings
8 pecan halves
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup pineapple juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in brown sugar; heat until bubbly. Remove from heat. Arrange pineapple rings and pecans on top.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; repeat sifting twice more.
Beat white sugar and eggs together in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Alternate folding flour mixture and pineapple juice into the egg mixture in 3 batches, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Pour over pineapple slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the skillet for 5 minutes. Invert carefully onto a serving platter.

Description: 
My gramma used to bake cakes and pies during the Depression and my grampa would sell them door-to-door and on the street corners to support them during that awful time. This is one of my favorites.
