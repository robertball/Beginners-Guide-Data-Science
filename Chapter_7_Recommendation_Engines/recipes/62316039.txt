Ingredients:
3 large boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cubed
1 (10 ounce) package frozen whole kernel corn, thawed (I added some frozen carrot chips, too)
1 onion, chopped
3 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 (10 ounce) cans tomatoes and green chilies (rotel)
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 tablespoon chili powder
3-5 cloves minced garlic
6 corn tortillas

Directions:
In large slow cooker, combine chicken cubes, corn, onion, broth, tomato paste, tomatoes and green chilies, cumin, chili powder, and garlic
Cover and cook on LOW for 5 to 7 hours or on HIGH for 3 hours to 3 hours 30 minutes.
While soup is cooking, cut tortillas into 1/4-inch strips and place on baking sheet.
Bake at 375 degrees for 5-7 minutes or until crisp.
Serve baked tortilla strips with soup.
Also great with monterey jack cheese, green onions, avacado, sour cream, and/or cilantro.
