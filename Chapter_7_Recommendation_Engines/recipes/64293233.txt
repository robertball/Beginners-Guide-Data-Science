Ingredients:
4 slices bacon diced
5 cans whole baby clams
1 bottle clam juice
1 cup minced onion
1 cup diced celery
2 cups cubed potatoes
1 cup diced carrots
2 Bay leaves
1/2 tsp thyme
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups half-and-half cream
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Add bacon to large skillet and cook over medium heat until lightly crisp. Add onion and cook 1 more minute.  Add carrots, celery, potatoes.
Drain juice from clams over the onions, celery, potatoes and carrots. Add bay leaves, thyme.  Add jar clam juice to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender.
Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until thick and smooth.
Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Simmer until desired consistency, but do not boil.
Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, remove bay leaves and season with salt and pepper.
