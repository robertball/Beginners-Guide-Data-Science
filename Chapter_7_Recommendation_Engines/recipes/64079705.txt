Ingredients:
2 pounds potatoes(6 medium)
3 tablespoons butter(i use Earth Balance Soy Free Spread)

salt and pepper
2/12 cups milk( i use unsweetened Almond Milk)
3/4 cup finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Heat oven to 350, wash potatoes, slice potatoes into thin slices to measure about 4 cups. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in saucepan over low heat, blend in flour ans salt and pepper. Cook over low heat stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbly.Remove from heat and stir in the milk. Heat to boiling stirring constantly, boil and stir 1 minute.
In a greased 2 quart casserole arrange potatoes in 2 layers topping each with half the onion and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat until all the potatoes are in and put the last of the sauce over the potatoes.Dot with 1 tablespoon of butter. Cover and bake for 30 minutes, uncover and bake 60-70 minutes longer or until potatoes are tender. Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving. I also sprinkle a little paprika on them for color.
