Ingredients:
8 hot dogs
1 (8oz) can refrigerated crescent dinner rolls (I use Pillsbury)
Wooden skewer

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Push the wooden skewer lengthwise through each dog.
Starting at one end hold a knife at a slight angle (approximately 45 degrees), cutting down to the skewer and roll hot dog away from you while holding the knife blade against the skewer. Remove skewer and continue with the remaining hot dogs.
Microwave the hot dogs for approximately 1 minute to help separate the spirals and allow to cool.
Separate dough into triangles and slice into 1/4 inch strips. Carefully place one end of dough strip inside the cuts on one end of the hot dog and wrap continuously to the other end (if you run out of the strips of dough before the end of the hot dog just add another strip until you reach the end). Refrigerate remaining dough.
Place hot dogs on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes or until dough is golden brown.
