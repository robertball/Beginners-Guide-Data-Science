Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked sushi (sticky) or medium-grain rice
4 cups water
2/3 cup peanut butter
1 cup hot water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves
1 (8 ounce) package baked tofu, cut into bite-size pieces (opt)

Directions:
1. Combine the rice and 4 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
2. In a separate saucepan, whisk together the peanut butter, 1 cup hot water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, and adding more hot water 1/4 cup at a time to maintain a pourable consistency.
3. Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil in a large pot. Place the spinach and tofu into a steamer basket and set over the boiling water. Cover and steam until spinach has wilted and tofu is heated through, about 7 minutes.
4. To serve, place spinach and tofu over white rice and smother in peanut sauce.
