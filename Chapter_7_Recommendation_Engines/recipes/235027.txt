Ingredients:
12 cherry tomatoes
12 mini fresh mozzarella balls
4 black olives

Directions:
With a sharp paring knife, cut an oval 'rugby ball' shape into each cherry tomato and scoop out the flesh. The cherry tomato should resemble an eye socket.
Place a mozzarella ball (eyeball) in each of the cherry tomatoes (eye socket).
Slice the olives so that each yields 4 'o'-shaped pieces; place 1 slice onto each mozzarella eyeball to form the 'pupil.' If the black olives do not sit very well, you may wish to use a paring knife to make a shallow round cut in the mozzarella to push the olive slice in, holding the 'pupil' in place.

Description: 
Great for kids and grown-ups alike as a main dish, I made this last Halloween inspired by something I found on the web and I've had a lot of requests for it. You can make the eyeballs earlier in the day and keep in fridge. Pull eyeballs out when you are ready to cook your pasta so that they are at room temperature for serving. Place eyeballs on top of your favorite spaghetti and red sauce. Can also be served as finger-food appetizers at your Halloween party.
