Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup mixed dried fruit with no added sugar
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup freshly ground peanut butter
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey
1 large egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix rolled oats, dried fruit, whole wheat flour, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.
Whisk peanut butter, oil, honey, egg, and vanilla extract thoroughly in a separate bowl. Pour over oat mixture and mix very well until all the moisture is incorporated. Press evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before removing from the pan and cutting into bars.

Description: 
These are granola bars made with whole-grain flour, oats, and freshly ground peanut butter as the key ingredients. They're low in fat, but the fat is good fat, and they're low in sugar, which is natural sugar from pure honey.
