Ingredients:
Cookies:
2 boxes Devils food cake mix
4 eggs
2/3 c. oil
Filling:
8 ounce cream cheese, softened
1/2 c. butter, softened
3 cups powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine the cake mixes, eggs and oil in a large bowl.  The batter will be stiff.  Using a cookie scoop for uniformity, make 1 inch balls.  Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Place cookie balls on the cookie sheet 1 inch apart.  Flatten the cookie ball with your hand.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 min.  Cool completely on a wire rack.
In a separate bowl, combine remaining ingredients to make the filling.  To assemble; take the bottom of a cookie and "frost" it with the cream cheese mixture.  Then take another cookie and place it bottom side in to form a sandwich.
Store in the refrigerator.
