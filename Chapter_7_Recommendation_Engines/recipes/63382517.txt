Ingredients:
16 oz can Redbull™ Energy Drink
2 cups cold vodka
4 .25 ounce envelopes unflavored gelatin

Directions:
Lightly grease an 8" x 8" square pan with non-stick cooking spray.
Add Redbull™ to a heavy sauce pan and heat to boiling over med-high heat.
Add unflavored gelatin to pan and stir constantly at a gentle simmer until completely dissolved.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly. This is important - if you add your vodka to the hot mixture your alcohol will burn off.
Add in cold vodka to the gelatin mixture and stir gently. Pour into prepared pan and refrigerate for 6 hours.
After gelatin has set cut into 2" squares using a knife run under hot water.
