Description: 
As long as you have the right kind of chourico, you cannot mess up this filling, slightly spicy soup. It's perfect for an autumn or winter meal, and can easily be adapted for vegans by using soyrizo (see note) instead of chourico. You can also use other vegetables, such as butternut squash or kale. I like to use organic spinach and vegetable broth when they are available.
