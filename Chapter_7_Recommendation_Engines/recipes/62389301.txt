Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
2/3 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 tomato, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
2 pounds medium shrimp - de-veined, not peeled (fun and messy)
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon garam masala

Directions:
Heat the oil in a wok or large saucepan over nearly high heat. Add the onions; cook and stir until browned, then season with the ginger garlic paste, coriander and salt. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
Season with turmeric, then mix in the tomato, chile powder, shrimp and water. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, until shrimp are opaque. Taste and adjust salt and chile powder if necessary. Season with garam masala, stir and remove from the heat. Serve with flat bread or rice.

Description: 
This is a home-style South Indian shrimp curry recipe from my husband's family. It is simple and quick to make. It contains no coconut so is not sweet, just mostly juicy and as hot as you like it. Serve with basmati rice or an Indian flatbread.Modified from: Authentic and Easy Shrimp Curry
