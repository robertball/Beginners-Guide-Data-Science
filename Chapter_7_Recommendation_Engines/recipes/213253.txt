Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
1 (10 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
2 cups whole kernel corn, drained
1/2 head Savoy cabbage, sliced
3 cups peeled, seeded and cubed butternut squash
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup water
1 pound extra lean ground beef
1/2 (1 ounce) package low-sodium taco seasoning
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt (optional)

Directions:
Place carrots in a large, heavy pot, then layer mushrooms, corn, Savoy cabbage, butternut squash, tomatoes, and water on top. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
While the soup is coming to a boil, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and taco seasoning. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add beef to the soup, and reduce heat to medium. Continue simmering until the carrots are tender, about 1 hour.
