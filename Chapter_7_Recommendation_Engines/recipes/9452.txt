Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar crunchy peanut butter
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 cups crisp rice cereal
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Using your hands, combine the peanut butter, cereal, and 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar in a medium bowl until well mixed. Roll into log shapes about the size of your little finger.
Combine the remaining confectioners' sugar and water in a saucepan; bring to boil. Remove from heat and let stand a few minutes.
Dip each log into glaze . Place on racks until glaze becomes firm. Store in airtight container with waxed paper between layers.

Description: 
I haven't met anyone yet, particularly men, who don't love these. Fairly simple and no bake. However, they do not freeze well, the crisp rice cereal will become soggy. After dipping the logs in glaze, consider rolling them in chopped walnuts or grated coconut.
