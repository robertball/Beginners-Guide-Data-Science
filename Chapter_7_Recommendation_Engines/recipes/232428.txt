Ingredients:
2 habanero peppers
2/3 cup milk, divided (or as needed)
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground paprika
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roast peppers in preheated oven until nearly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove and discard seeds and stems from peppers. Transfer peppers to a food processor. Blend peppers and 2 tablespoons milk in the food processor until smooth.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat until bubbly. Stir flour into the melted butter; cook until the mixture starts to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the pepper mixture to the flour mixture. Begin whisking milk into the mixture; cook, whisking regularly, until it begins to thicken, thinning with additional milk as needed. Season with salt and paprika. Sprinkle cilantro over the sauce to serve.

Description: 
A spicy cream sauce for Mexican meals. Cream can be substituted for milk, and margarine for butter. I normally serve this drizzled over shredded chicken in tortillas.
