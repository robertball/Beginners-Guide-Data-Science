Ingredients:
3-4 white sweet potatoes, cleaned and cut into 1/2 pieces
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp sea salt
1/2 Tbsp black pepper
1/2 Tbsp nutmeg
3 Tbsp honey

Directions:
While you are preheating your oven to 375 degrees, cut up your white sweet potato and place the
pieces into a small bowl. Toss with olive oil, nutmeg, salt and pepper so that every piece has been covered. Roast for about 35 minutes or until the pieces become slightly browned. Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven and place the still hot potatoes into a baking dish and turn down your oven to 325 degrees. Drizzle about half of the honey over the potatoes and place back in the oven, after about 5 minutes do the same thing and let cook for 5 more minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
