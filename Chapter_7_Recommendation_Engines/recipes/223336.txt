Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 tablespoon seasoned salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground annatto seed
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can red beans, drained and rinsed
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning (such as McCormickÂ® Mild Chili Seasoning Mix)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ground annatto seed
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste

Directions:
Break the ground beef into small pieces into a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir green bell pepper, onion, seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes through the ground beef; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, about 10 minutes.
Pour diced tomatoes, pinto beans, black beans, and red beans into the pot; season with chili seasoning, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoon ground annatto seed, 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and garlic.

Description: 
This is my family recipe. It's great for kids, potlucks, and it's really flexible. Hope you all enjoy! I would add 1/2 to 1 cup of water to the chili after all the other ingredients to make it a little more like soup. If your kids absolutely do not like spicy things, you could add sour cream and cheese to it. Serve with corn chips or corn bread.
