3 cloves garlic, sliced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
In a small bowl, soak chiles in water and vinegar for 30 minutes. After soaking, puree in a blender or food processor until very smooth, about 5 minutes; set aside.
Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove meat from pan, and set aside. In a large pot, Heat 3 to 4 tablespoons of the meat drippings over medium heat. Saute onions, celery, carrots and garlic until onions are soft and translucent. Season with salt and black pepper. Stir in tomato paste, and allow to caramelize. Pour in broth to deglaze the pot, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom.
Stir in cooked beef and Italian Sausage, tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce and hot pepper sauce. Season with chili powder, cumin and parsley. Bring to a boil, then stir in blended chile mixture and honey. Carefully mix in beans without breaking them. Cover, and simmer for 3 hours. Stir and scrape the bottom every hour or so.

Description: 
A true fusion of 'Tex' and 'Mex' style chili. Each bite slowly delivers a sweet flavor followed by dry heat afterwards.  It takes a while to prepare, but well worth it.Modified from: Fusion Chili
