Ingredients:
2 large heads garlic
2 T olive oil
8 oz cream cheese
1 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated, plus an additional 1/4 cup for topping
6 oz mozzarella or gouda cheese, grated
1 cup beer (such as an IPA or Pale Ale)
1 t Sriracha
1/2 t salt
1/2 t pepper
1 T corn starch
1/4 cup scallions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. Cut off tops of garlic heads to expose all the cloves. Place each head on a sheet of tin foil. Drizzle 1 T olive oil over each head of garlic and wrap foil around it to enclose the garlic and the oil. Place foil packets directly on oven rack and roast for 30 minutes. Let cool.
Meanwhile, make sure the cream cheese is soft enough to be mixable, and add the grated cheeses to it in a mixing bowl. Then add beer, Sriracha, salt, pepper, and corn starch. Once garlic is cool, squeeze out all the cloves and mix to combine with the cheese.
Add into a baking dish (such as a glass 8x8) and top with the remaining 1/4 cup of parmesan.
Bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes until top is browned and bubbly.
Top with the green onions and serve with beer bread.
