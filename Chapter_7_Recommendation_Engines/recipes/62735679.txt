Ingredients:
2 lbs Beef Stew Meat
1/2 Cup White Flour (or enough to coat meat)
1/4 Cup Butter
1/4 Cup Olive Oil
1 Tsp Seasoned Salt
1 Onion Chopped
8 Cups Beef Broth
3 Cups Chopped Celery
6 Cups Sliced Carrots
6 Cups Cubed Potatoes
1 tsp Dried Parsley
1 tsp Dried Basil
1/2 tsp Paprika
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
2 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar

Directions:
Place stew meat and flour in a sealed plastic bag and shake to coat.
Heat butter and olive oil in a large pot over high heat until bubbly.  Add stew meat and seasoned salt, sear stirring constantly to seal all edges.  Add onions, continue searing until brown.
Slowly stir in beef broth, scrape sides and bottom to mix in all brown bits.  Heat to boiling, add remaining ingredients, returning to bubbly after each addition.
Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3-4 hours.

Description: 
This is the best beef stew I've ever tasted.  My husband ate 4 bowls the first time I made it and my 9 month old ate two bowls mashed up!  I like to brown my beef for stew, and I hate to dirty both a pot and the slow cooker, so I prefer to cook the stew exclusively on the stove.
