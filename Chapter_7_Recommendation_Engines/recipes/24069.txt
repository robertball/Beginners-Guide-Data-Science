Ingredients:
6 tart apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 cup quick-cooking oats
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, divided
1/4 cup butter, cut into pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place apples in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a bowl, mix melted butter, flour, sugar, oats, and 1 tablespoon cinnamon to form a crumbly mixture. Sprinkle over apples. Dot with remaining 1/4 cup butter, and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon.
Bake 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned and apples are tender.
