Ingredients:
8 russet potatoes, cut into large cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons chopped parsley leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Half-fill a large deep saucepan with cold water, add a pinch of salt and the potato pieces. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to medium and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until a knife can be inserted easily into the potatoes but there's just a little resistance in the center. You want to just par-boil the potatoes; if you overcook them at this stage, they will become too mushy.
Drain the potatoes in a colander, then return them to the saucepan. Cover with the lid and give the pan a really good shake to fluff up the potatoes; these soft, loose edges will become really crispy during roasting.
Add olive oil, garlic, thyme, oregano, basil and Parmesan; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently toss to combine.
Place potatoes in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Add olive oil, garlic, thyme, oregano, basil and Parmesan; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently toss to combine.
Place into oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Stir in butter until melted, about 1 minute.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley,
