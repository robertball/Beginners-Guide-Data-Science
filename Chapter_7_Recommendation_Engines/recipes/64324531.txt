Ingredients:
cooking spray to coat skillet
1/4 cup(s) tomato(es), plum chopped
1/4 cup(s) scallion(s) (green onions) chopped
3 whole basil, fresh leaves, chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil spread, butter-flavored
1 cup(s) egg substitute

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Coat a broiler-proof 10" skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat until hot. Add the tomatoes, scallions, and basil, and vegetable oil spread and cook until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat to low. Pour the egg substitute evenly into the skillet over the vegetable mixture. Cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the frittata is cooked on the bottom and almost set on the top.
Transfer the skillet to the broiler and broil until the top is set, about 2 minutes. Slide the frittata onto a serving platter and cut into wedges to serve.
