Ingredients:
2 cups shredded smoked Gouda or Cheddar cheese
4 teaspoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons margarine or butter
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 medium cooking apple, cored and chopped
1/2 cup cooked wild rice
1 1/4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup brown ale or amber beer
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
2/3 cup half-and-half or light cream
fresh thyme sprigs (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl toss cheese with flour; set aside. In a 2-quart saucepan melt margarine or butter. Add onion. Cook and stir over medium-high heat for 4 minutes or until tender. Add 3/4 cup of the apple, the cooked rice, chicken broth, beer, and pepper.
Bring mixture to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Slowly stir in cheese mixture until melted. Stir in half-and-half or light cream. Cook over medium-low heat until just heated through. To serve, ladle into warmed bowls; top with remaining chopped apple. Garnish with fresh thyme sprigs, if desired.
