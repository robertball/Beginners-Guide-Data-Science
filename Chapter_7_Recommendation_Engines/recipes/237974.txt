Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (900 ml) carton chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
3/4 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs or breasts
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 cup orzo
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup 10% cream
1 cup frozen corn
salt and pepper
1/4 cup coarsely chopped dill

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook 2 minutes, just until onion is tender. Add broth, lemon juice, chicken and thyme to saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered until chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle shred meat into bite-size pieces.
Return broth in saucepan to the boil. Add orzo, cook 6 to 8 minutes until tender. Whisk flour into cream. Add chicken, corn and cream to broth. Stirring frequently, bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 minute. Add salt and pepper to taste. Stir in dill.
