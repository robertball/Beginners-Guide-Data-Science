Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa, well-rinsed (you may mix red quinoa with regular quinoa for pretty color variation)
1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
1 cup water
Juice of 1/2 an orange
Juice of 1/2 a lemon
2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons honey
2 - 3 pinches of sea salt
1 Tablespoon curry powder
2 thin slices of red onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup sliced almonds
Salt, to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring the water and vegetable broth to boil over medium high heat.  Stir in the quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
While the quinoa is cooking prepare the dressing.  Combine the orange and lemon juices with the olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey, sea salt, and curry powder.  Whisk well, or shake well in a tightly sealed jar.
When the quinoa is finished cooking, remove from heat and fluff with a spoon.  While the quinoa is still warm, pour the dressing on top.  Add the red onion and the raisins.  Stir to combine.
Remove the quinoa mixture to a serving dish.  Cover and chill for several hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Scatter the almonds on a baking sheet, and toast for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Watch carefully, so that they don't burn!  Set the almonds aside to cool.
Just before serving, stir in 1/4 cup of the sliced, toasted almonds.  Scatter the remaining 1/4 cup on top.
