1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk

Blend sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream cheese, and lime juice in a blender until sauce is creamy. Pour sauce into a bowl.
Dip enough Maria cookies to cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish in the creamy lime sauce. Spread a layer of fruit cocktail over the cookies. Dip and layer a second layer of Maria cookies over the fruit cocktail. Continue dipping and layering cookies and fruit cocktail until the last layer of cookies is about 1 inch from the top of pan.
