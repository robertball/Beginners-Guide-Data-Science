Ingredients:
2 cups chopped kale
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1/2 cup frozen fava beans, thawed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
1 small jalapeno pepper, minced
1/4 cup minced cilantro
1/4 teaspoon curry powder
1 small lime, halved
1/4 teaspoon coarse salt

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add kale, cover, and steam until tender, about 3 minutes. Rinse kale under cold water and drain.
Mix chickpeas and fava beans together in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and jalapeno pepper until softened, about 5 minutes. Add chickpeas mixture, kale, cilantro, and curry powder to onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Squeeze 1 lime half over chickpeas mixture. Spoon mixture onto 4 serving plates. Cut remaining lime half into 4 wedges and squeeze over each serving; season with salt.
