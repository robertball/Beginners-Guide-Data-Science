Ingredients:
4 Cups sliced or chopped cucumbers
2 Cups sliced tomatoes (I like cherry tomatoes but any tomato will do)
1 thinly sliced vidalia onion
1 Cup Good Vinegar (I use red wine vinegar)
1/4 Cup olive oil
2 Tbsp sugar (or honey)
1 tsp Dijon Mustard
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp fresh ground pepper

Directions:
In a large bowl, add cucmber, tomatoes, and onion. Gently mix.
In a separate bowl, whisk vinegar, oil, sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper.
Pour dressing onto vegetables and toss well. Make sure everything is evenly coated.
Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.
Optional: May add some fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, or mint to salad.
Chill for at least one hour, then serve. Can be made a day or two ahead.

Description: 
This is my basic cucumber salad recipe. It is very versatile and can be adapted easily to your personal tastes. Try white wine vinegar or a different onion for example to see how you like it best. Or just serve it up as is for a classic, fresh summer dish!
