Ingredients:
½ cup of sugar
1 TBL baking powder
¼ tsp salt
1/2 cup of cold butter, cubed
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 6 oz container vanilla yogurt
2 Tbl light cream
1 cup confectioner’s sugar
¼ tsp vanilla
1 tsp water

Directions:
Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a food processor.  Pulse once to blend.  Add the cold cubed butter and pulse until mixture is combined.  It should look like sand.  Add the egg, 1 tsp. vanilla, cream and yogurt and mix just until combined.  The mixture will be sticky.  Flour your hands, and pat into a circle on a greased baking sheet, parchment, or Silpat  ¾ inches high.  Score into 8 wedges and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned.
Completely cut through the wedges when they are removed from the oven and cool on a wire rack.  Combine confectioner’s sugar, vanilla and water until smooth.  Drizzle over the scones.
