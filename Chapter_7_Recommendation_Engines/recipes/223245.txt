Ingredients:
1 cup tomato puree
½ cup smooth peanut butter
½ cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons honey
½ teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon curry powder
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast cutlets, pounded flat
1 pinch salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
¼ cup water, or as needed (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped unsalted peanuts

Directions:
Thoroughly mix tomato puree, peanut butter, orange juice, soy sauce, and honey in a bowl. Stir ginger and curry powder into the tomato mixture.
Season chicken cutlets with salt and black pepper.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Pour the tomato mixture over the chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, and place a cover on the skillet; cook at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce thickens, about 30 minutes. Add water as needed to thin sauce if it gets too thick.
Sprinkle parsley and peanuts over the chicken to serve.
