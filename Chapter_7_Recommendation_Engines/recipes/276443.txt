Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch collard greens - rinsed, trimmed, and chopped
1/2 cup vegetable broth
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add collards and toss to lightly coat with oil. Pour in broth and soy sauce. Cover, reduce heat, and steam until tender, turning every few minutes, 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from heat, drizzle with sesame oil, and serve.
