Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, or as needed
1 large zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1/8 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon onion salt, or to taste
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup shredded Mexican 4-cheese blend

Directions:
Heat enough olive oil to coat the bottom of a large skillet over medium heat; arrange zucchini slices in the hot oil. Sprinkle zucchini slices with red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and onion salt. Fry until zucchini slices are slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Sprinkle each slice with Romano cheese and spoonful of tomato sauce; cook until cheese just begins to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Top tomato sauce layer with Mexican cheese blend; cover skillet and cook until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Zucchini grow so fast. If you missed picking it small, use it for this recipe. My sister-in-law, Joan, makes this without the hot pepper seeds. If you like zucchini, you will like this recipe. My brother does not like zucchini and he likes this recipe. Thanks to Joan who created it. Serve it as a side dish or main dish with a salad.
