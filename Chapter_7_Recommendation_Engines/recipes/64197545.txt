Directions:

As beef is browning, crush garlic into pot and stir into mixture. Open the bean tins while the meat is browning and drain off the liquor.
Add the beans and the tomatoes with all of their juice to the pot once the meat is completely cooked. stir in the chili powder, cumin, and cayenne if desired (adds heat).
Reduce to low heat and simmer, stirring occasionally. The flavour and heat will develop as the chili simmers. The chili will also thicken as it cooks.

Description: 
One of the first meal-in-a-pot dishes I learned to make and still a staple of my kitchen. Add whatever you have or whatever you like, and be sure to freeze what you don't eat because it reheats beautifully.
