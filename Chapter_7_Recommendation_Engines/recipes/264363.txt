Ingredients:
1 cup water, or as needed
1 bulb garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
salt

Directions:
Place the steamer basket in the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Add water up to the bottom of the steamer basket.
Cut 1/4 inch off the top of the garlic bulb and place into the steamer basket. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Close and lock the lid. Select Poultry function according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove garlic and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Squeeze garlic pulp into a glass jar and refrigerate.

Description: 
The color won't be the same as when roasted in the oven but the flavor is wonderful! Use the garlic to make garlic bread, aioli... the possibilities are endless. Enjoy!
