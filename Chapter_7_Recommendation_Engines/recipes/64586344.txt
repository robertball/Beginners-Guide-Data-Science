Ingredients:
1/3 cup whole-wheat panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
3 Tbsp uncooked amaranth
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 oz Parmesan cheese, finely grated (about 1/4 cup)
12 oz zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
1 Tbsp olive oil
Cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine first six ingredients in a shallow dish. Combine zucchini and oil in a large bowl; toss well to coat.
Dredge zucchini in panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Place coated slices on ovenproof wire rack coated with cooking spray; place rack on baking sheet or jelly-roll pan. Bake at 425 degees for 26 minutes or until browned and crisp.
Serve chips immediately.
