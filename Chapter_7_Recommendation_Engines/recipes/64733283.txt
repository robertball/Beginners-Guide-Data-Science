Ingredients:
1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 12 slices
1/2 cup orange juice
1 Tbsp honey
1 Tbsp honey mustard
1 Tbsp soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced

2 teaspoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
4 medium peaches, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup peach preserves

Directions:
Flatten each tenderloin slice to 1/4-in. thickness. Mix orange juice, honey, honey mustard, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt and cinnamon and put into plastic bag.  Add tenderloin slices and marinade 6-8 hours or overnight.
Sprinkle tenderloin slices with salt and pepper, in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, cook pork and onions in oil until tender, about 3 minutes each side. Remove and keep warm.
Add peaches and lemon juice, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Cook and stir until peaches are tender, 3-4 minutes. Stir in the pork and preserves; heat through.
