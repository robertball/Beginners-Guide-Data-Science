Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed and finely chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 carrot, cut into small cubes
1/2 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup red wine
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup vegetable broth

1 teaspoon ground paprika, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried basil, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano, or more to taste
1 teaspoon mixed dried herbs, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in red bell pepper and carrot; cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes.
Pour wine into the pot; simmer until slightly reduced, about 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and vegetable broth. Bring sauce to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in lentils, paprika, basil, oregano, dried herbs, and nutmeg; cook until lentils are heated through, about 5 minutes.
