Ingredients:
1 piece(s) paper, parchment to line baking sheet
1/2 cup(s) cheese, cheddar, sharp, reduced-fat, shredded (4 ounces)
2 teaspoon mustard, coarse-grain
1 ounce(s) ham, smoked, lean cut into 8 pieces
2 piece(s) pepper(s), red sweet, roasted
(from a jar)
1/8 cup(s) onion(s), red thinly sliced

Directions:
Heat the oven to 375Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Using 2 tablespoons for each, sprinkle the cheese into 4 mounds on the baking sheet. Spread each mound out into a 3-inch round. Bake for 3 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and spread slightly. Remove from the oven and let stand on the baking sheet until the cheese sets, about 2 minutes.
Using a thin-bladed metal spatula, lift the rounds off the baking sheet. Brush the smooth side of each round with mustard. Top each of 4 rounds with 1 piece of ham, a red pepper, another piece of ham, and one-fourth of the onion. Top with the remaining cheese rounds, mustard side down, and serve warm.
