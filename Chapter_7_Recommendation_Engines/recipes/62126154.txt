Ingredients:
2 Eggs, beaten
1 can Cream Corn
1 cup Self-rising Flour
1 cup Self-rising Corn Meal
1 medium Onion, diced
1/2 pound Crab Meat
1/2 teaspoon Garlic Salt
1/2 teaspoon Black Pepper
Oil for frying

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in bowl and let set for 10 minutes.  Heat oil to 365 degrees.  Drop tablespoon size balls into oil and fry for approximately 4-5 minutes until golden brown.  Cook 6-8 at a time to keep the oil temperature consistent. Drain on paper towel and serve.
I guess you could make it with artificial crab but I don't like it and have never tried using anything but the real stuff.

Description: 
Quick and easy appetizer!  Similar to a southern hush puppies but made delicious real crab meat!  This is really good served with a hot cheese dip or with tarter and cocktail sauce.  My husband will stand by waiting for them to finish cooking to eat them right away.
