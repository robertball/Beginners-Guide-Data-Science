Description: 
So very rich, perfect, and healthy. Made with any organic nut butter of choice. Great with almond butter, peanut butter, you name it! We think better than the old fashioned PB cookie even. I find the dark chocolate chips at our local Co-Op health food stores. They even have some made with stevia if you like to be even lower in the sugars. This is a fast easy recipe sure to please! Keeps well in fridge or freezer best. I like mine micro-waved a few seconds for that fresh warm cookie with melted chocolate goodness.
