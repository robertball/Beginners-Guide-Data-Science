Ingredients:
2 pounds lean pork cut in 1/2 inch cubes
2 pounds round steak cut in 1/2 inch cubes
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 cloves garlic, cut lengthwise
1 onion, sliced in rounds
1/2 cup flour
2 eggs, beaten
About 1/2 cup bread or cracker crumbs

Directions:
Mix together cubed pork, beef, salt, pepper, garlic and onion.  Mix well and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.  Place about 6 cubes on bamboo skewers, alternating pork and beef cubes.  Leave about 1-1/2 inches at the end so the skewer is easier to hold.  Discard garlic and onion.  Roll skewered meat in flour, dip in egg and then roll in bread crumbs.  Fry until no longer pink inside.  When finished frying, place skewers in greased roaster.  Add 2 tablespoons of water.  Cook for 2 hours at 250F.  Check occasionally.  Serve with plum sauce, if desired.

Description: 
This is a recipe my dad made way back in the 1970's and I recently came across it again - the meat comes out very tender and tasty.
