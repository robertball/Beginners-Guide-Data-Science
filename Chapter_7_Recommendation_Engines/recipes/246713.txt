Ingredients:
oil for frying
1 3/4 pounds okra, trimmed and halved lengthwise
3 tomatoes, quartered
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon dried mango powder (amchoor)
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon garam masala
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
3/4 cup water

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Deep-fry okra, 5 at a time, in hot oil until softened and dark green, about 5 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
Place tomatoes and ginger in a food processor; grind into a paste.
Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cumin; fry until golden, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato-ginger paste, salt, chile pepper, turmeric, mango powder, coriander, and garam masala. Cook until oil separates and sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Add yogurt; cook until oil separates again, about 2 minutes.
Pour in water and bring sauce to a boil. Add fried okra. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until flavors combine, 5 to 6 minutes.
