2 Tablespoons olive oil
4 Tablespoons Butter

3 parsnips,  peeled and thinly sliced
2 small turnips, washed, unpeeled and diced into small pieces
3 medium to large potatoes, washed with peels and cubed
1 15 ounce can mushrooms including their broth
1 15 ounce green beans with their broth
42 ounces FriChick, saving its broth and cubing the frichick pieces, (vegetarian chicken substitute by Worthington Foods)
3 bay leaves
1-2 quarts water
1/4 C ground turkey tail mushrooms (optional)
1 C Cabbage
16 ounces wide egg noodles
1 C frozen green peas
1/2 C chicken mckays seasoning
2 Tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 C fresh spinach
1 Tablespoon dried cilantro
2 Tablespoons parsley
2 Tablespoons caraway seeds

Add the onions sautéing until translucent
Add the leeks and sauté several minutes longer
Add the garlic and sauté a few more minutes
Add the Chicken McKays seasoning, bay leaves and carway seeds incorporating with the fat
Add the celery, carrots, parsnips, turnips and potatoes
Pour the canned mushrooms, green beans and their broth into the pot
Pouring the broth from the FriChick into the soup pot dice the pieces of FriChick adding them also to the pot
Add 1 quart water saving the rest for if needed to add later
Cook for 25 minutes covered at a low boil
Add the cabbage, noodles and ground turkey tail mushrooms
Bring almost to a boil but not quite (this allows the nutrients from the turkey tail mushroom to reach maximum potential with out killing them)
Cook for 8 more minuets and then add the green peas, spinach, cilantro, and parsley
Add frozen peas and wait 2 minutes before serving allowing peas to heat up but not over cook
Adjust black pepper and salt to taste and serve

Description: 
Nothing like Vegetarian Chicken Soup when your feeling under the weather.
It’s the ultimate comfort food!
The Turkey Tail Mushrooms add wonderful flavor and awesome immune boosting benefits just take care not to bring soup to a boil after adding them to get the most nutrition from them.
Enjoy with a wonderful fresh loaf of bread.
