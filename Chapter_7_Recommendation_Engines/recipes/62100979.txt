Ingredients:
1 kg sugar
1 large tin of condensed milk
100 g of unsalted butter
100 ml milk
100 ml water
2 drops vanilla essence (if required)

Directions:
You will need a large bowl (microwave safe), large heavy based pot (not non-stick), wooden spoon (for all the stirring), and a greased baking tray.
In a large microwave safe bowl, melt sugar, milk, water and butter in the microwave (high power) for approximately 10 mins (until the sugar has completly dissolved).
Check and stir every few minutes. Do not allow the mixture to overflow. Transfer mixture to a heavy-based pot (not non-stick).
Bring back to a boil over medium heat, stirring all the time for approximately another 10 minutes. Be careful not to allow the mixture to overflow.
Take off heat if required. Add tin of condensed milk (lower the heat a little), stirring again until the mixture goes from light to dark brown, approximately 10 minutes again. Add vanilla essence if required.
To test if the mixture is ready, drop a little into a cup of cold water; if it forms a little hard ball it is ready. If not, keep stirring and checking aforementioned until it does.
When mixture is ready, remove from heat and beat for 5 minutes, until all the bubbles are gone. Pour mixture into a greased baking tray and wait to set and cool.
Mark into squares when setting. You should see the mixture 'crystallizing'.
Eat when completely cold and set.
Be very careful making this recipe - do not allow the mixture to boil over the bowl or pot and watch out for splashes.
