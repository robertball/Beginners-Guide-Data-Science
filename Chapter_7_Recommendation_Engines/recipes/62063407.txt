Ingredients:
1 to 1.5 lbs boneless, center cut pork chops or boneless, extra lean pork ribs
1 jar of any brand "traditional" spaghetti sauce (I use traditional Prego--don't use "flavored with" type sauces)
12 oz Vermicelli noodles, cooked al dente
12 oz Velveeta cheese
1/2 cup milk (more or less depending on how thin you want sauce to be)

Directions:
1. In slow cooker, place pork ribs or chops and pour spaghetti sauce over.  Cook on medium for 6 hours or until pork is tender.
2. Cook vermicelli noodles al dente and drain.
3. Combine Velveeta cheese with milk. On a low heat setting in the microwave, cook until cheese melts and milk is incorporated. (It will need to be stirred).
4. Pour cheese sauce over noodles.
5. Serve spaghetti sauce and pork over cheese noodles.
