Ingredients:
1/3 cup white onion, chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
3 cups cooked white rice, cold
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground corriander
4 tsp taco sauce
1/3 cup frozen corn
salt, to taste
2 tsp cilantro, rough chop (optional)

Directions:
Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour the remaining 1 tbsp oil in with the cold rice and mix up with your fingers to separate the rice and coat with oil.
Add rice to the pan and turn heat up to medium-high.  Saute rice until it starts to make popping sounds, approximately 5 minutes.
Add the taco sauce and corn and stir, letting it cook until heated through, approximately 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
Stir in the cilantro and cook until just wilted.
Serve on the side of a Mexican meal, or as a filling for burritos or tacos.

Description: 
This is a Tex-Mex style rice that's a snap to cook up! I created this recipe because I was making some burritos and wanted to use up some cooked rice I had in the fridge. It was so good in the burritos, I used twice as much rice as meat!
