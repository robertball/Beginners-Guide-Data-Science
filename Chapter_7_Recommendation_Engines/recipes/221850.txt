Ingredients:
2 bitter gourds, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch rings
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 pinches asafoetida powder
1/2 teaspoon gram flour (besan)
1/2 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon jaggery

Directions:
Place bitter gourd rings in a microwave-safe bowl. Toss with 1 teaspoon oil and salt to coat. Microwave, stirring halfway through, until tender, about 4 minutes.
Heat the remaining oil in a saucepan over low heat. Add the gourds and asafoetida powder. Cook and stir until slightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add besan, ground red chile, and coriander; cook and stir until flavors meld, about 3 minutes. Add jaggery; mix well.

Description: 
I'm always looking for innovative ways to serve bitter gourd. I was just experimenting with my Indian spices one day and made this yummy dish. It is a great side for a number of South Indian rice dishes like rasam or sambar rice.
