Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Spread corn into the bottom of a baking dish; add chicken breasts. Cover chicken with butter, garlic, black pepper, and salt. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is an easy way to make a one-dish meal with little effort. It is also very tasty and my kids love it. You can also use mixed vegetables instead of corn.
