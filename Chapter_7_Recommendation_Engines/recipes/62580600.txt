Ingredients:
1 package creme filled cookies
8 oz  cream cheese
36oz vanilla flavored candy coating
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
1.Line cookie sheet with wax paper. Place cookies in a large food processor pulsing until they are fine crumbs.
2. mix crumbs and cream cheese in a large bowl together, mixing until its at a dough-like consistency
3. chop 8 oz of candy coating and mix into dough mixture.
4. Form dough into 1 inch balls  and place on covered cookie sheet and freeze for 30 minutes or until firm.
5. In a microwavable bowl melt the candy coating for 1minute 15 seconds.  stir, and continue microwaving  in 15 second intervals until smooth.  Using 2 forks coat and roll balls in the mixture and place  back on the cookie sheet (Doing half at a time makes it easier so candy quick doesn't harden and balls  don't thaw)
6.Place the chocolate chips and oil in a resealable bag and microwave for 35-50 seconds. squeeze chips every 15 seconds until smooth.   Drizzle chocolate over truffles and refrigerate until chocolate is set. Dust with coco powder if desired.
