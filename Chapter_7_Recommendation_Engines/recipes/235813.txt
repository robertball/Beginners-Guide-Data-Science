Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust pastry
2 cups eggnog
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 eggs
2 egg whites
1 tablespoon vanilla extract, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg, or to taste
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and cut excess crust from edges; fill with rice or pie weights.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Beat eggnog, sugar, cornstarch, eggs, egg whites, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until smooth; pour into crust.
Bake until pie is set in the middle, 50 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
After trying a few recipes for eggnog pie, I couldn't find one that was eggnoggy enough. After playing around and making a lot of pretty good pies that weren't what I was looking for, I got the results I liked. I don't know a lot of technical terms.

 This pie has about the same texture as pumpkin pie and actually tastes like eggnog.
