Ingredients:
6 large egg yolks
3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon honey
1 cup heavy whipping cream
8 ounces fresh raspberries plus a few extra to serve and/or puree
2 1/2 tablespoons pistachios, shelled and chopped

Directions:
In a medium bowl using an electric beater combine egg yolks and honey. Mix for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes double in mixture and pale and creamy.
In a medium mixing bowl add the heavy whipping cream and using the electric mixer combine until the cream is firm. About 3-4 minutes.
Gently fold the cream into the egg mixture and combine.
Line a loaf tin with parchment paper (large enough to hang over the tin pan) and pour in mixture. Cover with hanging parchment paper or clear wrap.
Place in the freezer for 1 1/2 hour.
Remove from the freezer and stir through the raspberries and pistachios. Cover with parchment paper or clear wrap and return to the freezer until completely frozen.
Let soften in the fridge for 15 minutes prior to serving. Turn out of the tin, cut into slices and serve with a extra raspberries or puree some of the raspberries with a teaspoon of honey and drizzle over Semifreddo.

Description: 
I love this dessert because it is super easy to prepare! I serve this in the summer at our lake house and everyone gets so excited. I remember the first time I made it out friends the Zachary’s were over for dinner and their eyes opened so wide when I walked out with this dessert. All I can say is that the semifreddo platter and everyone’s plates were empty. Give this recipe a try if you want to impress your friends. (it’s paleo and gluten free)
