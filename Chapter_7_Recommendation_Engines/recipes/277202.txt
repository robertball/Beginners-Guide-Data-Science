Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup powdered sugar, divided, or as needed
2 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Cream shortening in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add 1/2 cup powdered sugar gradually; cream thoroughly. Add flour, pecans, and vanilla extract and blend.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls and place on the prepared baking sheet, baking in batches if needed.
Bake in the preheated oven on one of the top racks until lightly golden, about 15 minutes, watching to be sure the bottoms do not burn.
Remove from the oven and roll in some of the remaining powdered sugar while still hot. Let cool, 10 to 20 minutes. Roll again in powdered sugar.
