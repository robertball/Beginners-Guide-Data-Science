Ingredients:
20 jalapeno peppers
3/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 (8 ounce) container cream cheese with chive and onion
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup beer or milk
cooking oil or shortening for deep-fat frying
Dairy sour cream (optional)
Snipped chives (optional)

Directions:
Make a T-shape cut in the side of each pepper; remove seeds.
For filling, combine shredded cheese, cream cheese, and cumin until blended. Pack about 2 teaspoons of the filling into each pepper.
For batter, in a bowl combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt. Add beer or milk. Beat until smooth.
In a heavy saucepan or deep-fat fryer heat 2 inches cooking oil or melted shortening to 375 degrees F. Dip stuffed peppers into batter. Fry several peppers at a time in hot fat, about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain; keep warm in a 300 degree F oven while frying remaining peppers. Serve with sour cream sprinkled with chives, if desired.
