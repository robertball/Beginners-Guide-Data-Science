Ingredients:
1 cup ripe avocado, halved and pitted
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons hot sauce (such as ValentinaÂ®), or to taste
2 pinches kosher salt

Directions:
Slice the meat of each avocado half 3 or 4 times in one direction, turn avocado and slice 3 or 4 more slices perpendicular to the first slices creating 8 to 12 small cubes still attached to the peel.
Drizzle lemon juice over each avocado and top with kosher salt. Drizzle hot sauce over each. Eat with a fork or spoon.

Description: 
This fresh, fast, and easy snack is heart-healthy and delicious. I have tried lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, Meyer lemon, key limes and Satsuma juices and I like good 'ol fashioned lemon the best, but please experiment to your own tastes!
