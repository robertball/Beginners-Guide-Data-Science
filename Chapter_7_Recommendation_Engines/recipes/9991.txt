Ingredients:
2 (18.25 ounce) packages devil's food cake mix
1 1/2 cups shortening
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Combine all ingredients and mix well.  Batter will be thick.
Roll dough into balls the size of nickels.  Place on greased cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.
When cookies are cool, frost the bottoms of half of the cookies with Faux-reo filling(see footnote) and stick bottom-to-bottom with another unfrosted cookie.
