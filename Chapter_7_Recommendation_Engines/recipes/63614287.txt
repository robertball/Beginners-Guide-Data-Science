Ingredients:
Cinnamon rolls in two hours. or less!
* 2 cups warm water
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 4 teaspoons dry yeast
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup oil
* 6 to 8 cups flour
* soft butter
*cinnamon
* sugar
Glaze
*2 cups powder sugar
*1 tablespoon vanilla
* 1 tablespoon water

Directions:
**Rolls
Dissolve the yeast in warm water. Let sit a minute or two, there should be a few bubbles on top. Add the sugar and salt. Mix.
Add oil, 2 eggs, 2 cups of flour beat till smooth
Stir in 3 more cups flour. Begin kneading the dough. Add 1 cup of flour. If dough seems to sticky, knead in more flour 1/4 to 1/2 cup at a time.
Let dough rest for 15-20 minutes. Good time to clean utensils and counter.
Roll dough into rectangle that is at least 24 to 30 inches long by 16 inches wide. I like to roll it almost as big as my table and have lots of swirls. Don't fret over a few small breaks, they'll roll up and away.
Spread with soft butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. or ANY other spices, herbs, nuts, raisins. I found apple or pumpkin pie spice is amazing
Starting at the wide end, roll in to log.
Cut rolls into equal sizes pieces at least 1 inch. I use my index finger at middle bend as a general guide for larger rolls.
place onto greased pan(s)
Put in a warm place for 45 minute to rise.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or rolls are golden brown.
**Glaze
mix powder sugar, vanilla. if too dry add water.
I've been using this recipe for so long now
