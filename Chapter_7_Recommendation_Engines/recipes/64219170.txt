Ingredients:
4 ounces bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
8 ounces smoked sausage, sliced
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cubed
1 onion, diced
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed
2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
cayenne pepper to taste

Directions:
Add bacon to a large, cold oven-ready skillet. Place over medium heat and cook for 10-12 minutes, until almost crisp. Transfer to a bowl, reserving the grease in the pan.
Stir in sausage slices; cook 3-4 minutes. Add chicken thigh pieces; cook and stir for 5 minutes, until browned. Remove meat to the plate with bacon. Discard all the oil, but don't wipe out the pan.
Add chopped onion and turn the heat to medium-low; cook and stir for 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent. Add 1 cup of chicken stock.
Mash about 1/4 of the beans in a small bowl, stir all the beans into the pan.
Stir in cayenne, rosemary and thyme. Add reserved meat back to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of stock or more if needed to cover. Return to simmer.

Description: 
We've taken some short cuts to make a quick version of the French classic, cassoulet. Chicken thighs replace the classic, and time-consuming, duck confit; canned beans replace dried; and bacon serves as a convenient substitute for other, more involved smoked pork options.Modified from: Chef John's Quick Cassoulet
