Ingredients:
Cheese:
1/2 cup water, divided
1/2 teaspoon calcium chloride
1/2 teaspoon liquid rennet
1 gallon whole milk
1/4 teaspoon feta MT1 cheese culture
Brine:
8 cups water
5 tablespoons coarse sea salt
1 teaspoon calcium chloride
1/4 teaspoon white vinegar

Directions:
Combine 1/4 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon calcium chloride in a small bowl; mix well.
Combine 1/4 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon rennet in another small bowl; mix  well.
Pour milk into a double boiler set over medium-low heat. Heat milk until it registers 86 degrees F (30 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer. Sprinkle cheese culture on the surface. Allow to dissolve without stirring for a few minutes, then stir well. Cover and keep at 86 degrees F (30 degrees C) for 1 hour.
Pour calcium chloride mixture into the milk; stir for 1 minute. Add rennet mixture; stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand at room temperature until milk sets into curd, about 1 hour. Press edge of the curd gently with a palette knife or the back of a spoon to check for firmness.
Cut curd all the way to the bottom of the pot into 1-inch squares. Stir gently with a rubber spatula. Let rest, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir curds, maintaining temperature at 86 degrees F (30 degrees C), until they sink to the bottom of the pot, about 20 minutes. Scoop out liquid (whey) with a ladle and discard or reserve for another use.
Line 2 basket-style molds with damp cheesecloth. Ladle curds into the molds with a slotted spoon and cover with ends of cheesecloth. Place one mold on top of the other, pressing lightly. Let drain, switching the molds and stirring curds a few times, until cheese is firm, at least 4 hours.
Mix 8 cups water, sea salt, 1 teaspoon calcium chloride, and white vinegar together in a large container to make brine. Submerge cheese in brine and let soak, at least 8 hours and up to 3 weeks.

Description: 
If you love making homemade cheese, try your hand at feta. The results are well worth the effort. Use goat or cow milk, or even a mixture of both. To serve, remove from brine and allow the cheese to air-dry before serving.
