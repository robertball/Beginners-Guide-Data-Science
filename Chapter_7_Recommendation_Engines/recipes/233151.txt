Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, diced
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into large chunks
2 white potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 apple, peeled and chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
1/2 gallon apple cider
3/4 cup half-and-half cream
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup sour cream, or as needed
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add butternut squash, potatoes, apple, carrot, and celery to onion; pour in chicken broth and enough apple cider to cover vegetables. Bring mixture to a boil and cover pot. Reduce heat and simmer, adding more apple cider as needed, until vegetables are tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
Blend vegetable mixture with an immersion blender until smooth; stir in cream, cinnamon, and cloves. Simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon soup into serving bowls; top each with about 1 tablespoon sour cream and a pinch of nutmeg.

I asked 2 chefs and researched other recipes to come up with the 'perfect' soup. I love the sweet taste of squash and veggies combined with fall cider. Hope you enjoy it too!
