Ingredients:
1 (14.3-ounce) package chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreos)
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, cubed and softened
16 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
1 Pulse cookies in a food processor until they form fine crumbs. Set aside 1/2 cup crumbs in a small bowl. Line a
baking sheet with wax paper. Add cream cheese to remaining crumbs in processor and pulse until well combined.
With dampened hands, shape cream cheese mixture into walnut-size balls.
2 Melt chocolate and shortening in a glass bowl in the microwave or in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely
simmering water, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat.
3 Dip balls in chocolate mixture and turn with a fork to coat. Lift out with 2 forks, letting excess chocolate drip off.
Transfer to prepared baking sheet, and sprinkle reserved crumbs over tops while chocolate is still warm. Chill until
firm, about 1 hour.
4 Transfer to individual paper cups or mini muffin liners inside an airtight container, and store in refrigerator up to
2 weeks.

Description: 
“Cream cheese and chocolate are a perfect combo for melt-in-your-mouth truffles. Adding a little shortening to the

chocolate as it melts makes the chocolate more fluid and easier to use for coating. It also makes the chocolate a 

little shinier once it has set.”
