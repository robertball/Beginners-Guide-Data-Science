Description: 
I fell in love with this seasonal soup last summer while it was at that famous fancy sandwich shop, and I was determined to recreate it. It's an easy soup to make and it's been a huge favorite in our house ever since. I make it almost weekly. Don't tell that fancy sandwich shop, but I think this is actually better than theirs! Garnish with fresh lemon slices.
