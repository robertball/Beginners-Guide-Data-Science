Ingredients:
1 pound thick-cut bacon strips, diced
2 pounds potatoes, diced
1 onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 pound frozen razor clams, thawed with liquid reserved
1 bay leaf
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel, reserving drippings in the pot.
Cook and stir potatoes, onion, and garlic in the hot bacon drippings until onions are translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into the potato mixture; cook together for about 1 minute. Add evaporated milk, heavy cream, liquid from clams, and bay leaf to the potato mixture; stir.
Bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the potatoes are soft, about 15 minutes. Add clams to the soup; cook until the clams are hot, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle bacon atop the soup. Season with salt and pepper to serve.

Description: 
Thick New England clam chowder using razor clams. My family likes to harvest razor clams on the Washington coast. We clean and freeze our clams. You might be able to use canned clams. My husband like thick clam chowder. If you do not want it as thick omit flour, and/or use milk instead of cream. Serve with bread and salad.
