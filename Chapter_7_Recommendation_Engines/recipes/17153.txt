Ingredients:
salt to taste
1 (2.5 ounce) jar liquid shellfish boil
3 pounds kielbasa sausage, cut into 1 inch pieces
5 pounds new red potatoes
4 lemons, halved
1 tablespoon diced green chile pepper, or to taste
12 ears fresh corn
10 pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined
12 blue crabs, cleaned

Directions:
Use a very large pot (we use a 40 quart pot), fill it half full with water; bring water to a full boil. Add salt, shellfish boil, sausage, and potatoes. Let cook until the potatoes are approximately 1/2 completed cooking.
Stir in lemons, hot peppers, and corn. Continue boiling until all of the vegetables are tender. Turn off the heat.
Mix in shrimp and crab. Cover pot and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. When shrimp are pink and the crabmeat opaque and flaky, remove all of the vegetables and shellfish from the pot, and drain well. Serve immediately.

Description: 
An old recipe that's especially good for family get-togethers. It's good, it's fun, and clean-up is easy. It's best done outside around a picnic table. When shrimp and crabs are done, cover picnic table with four to five layers of newspaper. Remove everything from pot, drain, and spread in center of table. Gather everyone around and enjoy the feast. When everyone has had their fill, gather up the leftovers (if there is any), put all the scraps in the center of the table, roll up the newspaper around them, and put them in the trash. Go wash the one pot and the cleanup is done. Have fun and enjoy.
