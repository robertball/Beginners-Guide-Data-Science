Ingredients:
12 oz package extra firm tofu
2 Tablespoons tomato paste
4 drops liquid stevia (or 1-2 tablespoons sugar / maple syrup)
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 Tablespoon liquid smoke
1 cup water

Directions:
Drain and press your tofu for about an hour to firm it up.
Once the tofu is ready, slice it as thin as you can.
Mix all of the marinade ingredients together in a plastic bag. Add in the tofu, squeeze out any air and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight (it will be good for several days marinating.) OR if you just don't want to wait you can instead simmer the tofu in the marinade for 15-20 minutes over medium low heat. Then proceed with the rest of the recipe.
When you're ready to cook it, preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat baking mat. Lay the tofu slices out in a single layer and put in the oven. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Take the out and flip them. Bake for an additional 8-10 minutes on the other side. Make sure you keep a close eye on them in the last few minutes because if they are VERY thin they may burn.
