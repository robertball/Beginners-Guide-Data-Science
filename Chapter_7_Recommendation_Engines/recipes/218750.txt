Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup tomato pasta sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® Refrigerated Crescent Dinner Rolls
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. In large skillet, cook ground beef and onion over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until beef is thoroughly cooked, stirring frequently. Drain. Stir in pasta sauce; cook until thoroughly heated.
Meanwhile, in medium bowl, combine mozzarella cheese and sour cream; mix well.
Pour hot beef mixture into ungreased 9 1/2 or 10-inch glass deep-dish pie pan or 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass baking dish. Spoon cheese mixture over beef mixture.
Unroll dough over cheese mixture. (If using pie pan, separate dough into 8 triangles; arrange points toward center over cheese mixture, crimping outside edges if necessary.) In small bowl, mix Parmesan cheese and butter. Spread evenly over dough.
Bake at 375 degrees F. for 18 to 25 minutes or until deep golden brown.
