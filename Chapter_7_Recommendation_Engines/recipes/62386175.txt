Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 large portobello mushrooms, cut up
6 sun-dried tomatoes, cut into strips
2 cups firmly packed chopped fresh spinach (or frozen and thawed spinach well drained)
1 1/3 cups uncooked regular long-grain white rice
3 1/2 cups Chicken Broth  (Regular, Natural Goodness™ or Certified Organic)
1/4 cup grated Romano cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves

Directions:
*  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they're tender. Add the tomatoes and spinach and cook until the spinach is wilted.
* Heat the remaining oil in a 2-quart saucepan. Add the rice and cook and stir for 2 minutes.  Add 1/2 cup broth and cook and stir until it's absorbed. Add the remaining broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until it's absorbed before adding more.
* Stir the mushroom mixture, cheese and basil in the saucepan and cook until the mixture is hot.

Description: 
Plain risotto is good, but my version, flavored with sautéed mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and spinach is truly delectable.
