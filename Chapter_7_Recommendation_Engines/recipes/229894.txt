Ingredients:
5 1/2 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon allspice

Directions:
Stir apples, white sugar, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, and allspice together in a slow cooker.
Cook on High for 1 hour. Change heat to Low and continue cooking until apples are easily mashed with a fork, 9 to 11 hours.

Description: 
The honey and brown sugar really gives the apple butter a little more depth then others I have tried. If you like a smoother apple butter, blend the apples once they are soft with a electric mixer. I like to use more then 1 variety of apples like Granny Smith and then something a little softer like fuji.
