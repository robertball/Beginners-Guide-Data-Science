Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin
1 3/8 cups boiling water
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon coconut extract
2 egg whites

Directions:
Lightly grease a 1-quart mold.
In a large bowl, dissolve gelatin in boiling water.  Stir in evaporated milk, sugar and coconut extract.  Allow to cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, whip egg whites until fluffy.  When gelatin mixture has cooled to room temperature, place gelatin bowl in an ice bath.  When mixture begins to set, fold egg whites into it.  Spread in prepared mold and refrigerate until set.

Description: 
Here is the recipe for the lusciously light, snow-white, squares of coconut pudding that is served at Chinese dim sum. Simple to make and delicious!  Because of the risk of salmonella in raw egg whites, I would substitute the appropriate amount of pasteurized egg whites, or egg whites reconstituted from a powder.
