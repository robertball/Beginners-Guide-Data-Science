Ingredients:
8 oz semisweet chocolate chips or chunks
8 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup plus 2 TBL confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 8 1/2" springform pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment or wax paper. Set aside.
Melt the chocolate in the microwave, a double broiler or a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water.
Meanwhile, separate the egg yolks from the whites and transfer the yolks to a bowl. Beat the yolks until thick and pale. Gradually beat in the chocolate until blended. Fold in the vanilla.
In a separate bowl, beat the whites with 1/4 cup of the sugar until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4 of the whites into the chocolate mixture and then fold in the remaining whites. Pour the mixture into the prepared pand and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until almost set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Cool in the pan to room temperature before cooling complete (still in the pan) in the refrigerator. Remove from pan; dust with remaining 2 TBL of sugar before serving.
