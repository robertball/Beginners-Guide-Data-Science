Description: 
This lovely soup is a French spring soup made with good quality (nice tasting for fresh eating) carrots and fennel or finocchio.... if you don't grow it in your garden you can find bulbs in most foodstores.... especially those in Italian communities or with gourmet veggies.... The final texture is creamy and the flavor is bright with carrots and the herbal taste of fennel.... the color quite orange.... It is light and refreshing a gourmet treat or something most kids would love! A different tasty soup.....
