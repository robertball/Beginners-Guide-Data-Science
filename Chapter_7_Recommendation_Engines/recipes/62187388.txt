Description: 
I made this recipe for my mother's birthday over 20 years ago.  Everyone loved the brussels sprouts!  Then I lost the recipe.  Recently, as I was going through my mother's recipe cards I found the copy I made for her.  I had forgotten what an attractive dish this is.  It is as good as I remember and best of all it still gets rave reviews!
