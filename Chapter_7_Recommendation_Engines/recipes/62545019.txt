Ingredients:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups oatmeal
1/4 cup flax seed
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup dried fruit

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread the almonds onto a baking sheet; toast until the nuts are golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes.  Remove nuts from baking sheet, and reserve.
Melt butter in a small saucepan placed over medium heat.  Stir in brown sugar; cook, stirring, until sugar has dissolved and mixture is bubbly.  Remove from heat. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients.  Press mixture into an 8 x 8 inch baking pan, or larger pan for thinner bars.  Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and set, about 20 minutes.
Remove from oven, and allow to cool completely before cutting. Can be individually packaged and frozen, for lunchbox convenience.
