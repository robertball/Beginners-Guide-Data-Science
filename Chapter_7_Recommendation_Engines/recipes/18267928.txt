1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup shredded swiss cheese
1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese
1/2 pound elbow macaroni cooked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a boil over medium heat and cook until it starts to thicken, about 5 minutes.
Add half the swiss and cheddar each and stir to melt.
Add macaroni and all of the spices.  Cook for a few minutes and keep stirring.
Put the mixture into a small baking dish.  Cover with remaining cheeses and bake for 10 minutes or until the cheese on top is melted.
