Ingredients:
1/4 cup canola oil
1 lemon, zested and juiced
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon honey
2 cloves garlic, pressed
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Mix canola oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, Italian herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Place chicken breasts into the bag, seal, and squeeze bag with your fingers several times to coat chicken with marinade. Place a second resealable bag over the first and seal to prevent leaks. Refrigerate chicken for 2 to 4 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken breasts from bag; discard used marinade. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until the center is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 7 to 8 minutes per side.
