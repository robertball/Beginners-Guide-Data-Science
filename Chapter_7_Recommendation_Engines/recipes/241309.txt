Description: 
This 'flourless' chocolate cake was all the rage in the 1980s. As I vaguely remember, the decade celebrated decadent overindulgence and this dessert is that and more. By modern standards, this cake is ridiculously rich. In fact, some of you may find it too intense, but most true chocolate fiends will be in heaven. Serve with ice-cold fresh raspberry sauce.
