Directions:
Reheat oven to 350.
Rub olive oil over the dough.
Place dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper and roll out to 8 in wide by 12 inches long.
On one side- Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, make seven cuts on a slight angle down toward the middle of the dough. Repeat on the other side.  Make sure to leave about 4 inches in the middle for the filling.
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, mozzarella cheese, garlic salt and oregano.
Spread filling in the middle of the dough.
Starting at the bottom, take the right strip and gently pull up toward the middle; then take the left and pinch the folded in right strip. Repeat.
Brush the braid with the beaten egg and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and course salt.
Transfer braid on the parchment paper to a baking sheet.
Bake for 25-35 minutes until golden brown. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
