Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 pounds red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
12 eggs, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chiles, drained
12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute the onion in butter until tender. Add the potatoes; cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender. In a bowl, combine the eggs, garlic salt, salt and pepper; pour over potatoes. Cook and stir over medium heat until the eggs are completely set. Stir in chilies. Fill each tortilla with about 3/4 cup of the egg mixture and 2 heaping tablespoons of the cheese; roll up tightly. Serve immediately.

Description: 
In the Southwest, a breakfast burrito wraps up potatoes, eggs and cheese with a unique 'Feliz Navidad' ('Merry Christmas') flair! There are many variations, but this is our favorite and it always wins compliments from guests.
