Description: 
The recipe provides a tastey and easy way to enjoy healthy salmon.  It cooks quickly due to the broiling method and is inspired by my love of Asian foods.  If you have to time to prepare ahead, marinade the salmon for several hours or even over-night for a truly flavorful fish.  You can even reserve some of the marinade and use a sauce.
