Ingredients:
12 eggs
3/4 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 green onions, chopped
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 strips cooked bacon, crumbled
6 grape tomatoes, halved
6 lettuce leaves
12 slices bread

Directions:
Place eggs in a large pot and cover with an inch of water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and remove from heat. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs and chop.
Combine eggs with mayonnaise, Cheddar cheese, green onions, mustard, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir gently until evenly mixed. Fold in bacon and tomatoes.
Layer egg salad and lettuce between 2 slices of bread to make each sandwich.
