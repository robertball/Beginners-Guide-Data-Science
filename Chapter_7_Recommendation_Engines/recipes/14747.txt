Ingredients:
4 pork chops
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup dry sherry
1/4 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Season pork chops with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge seasoned chops in flour. Heat oil in a large skillet and brown seasoned chops in oil (covering skillet with lid if desired). Pour off fat.
In a medium bowl combine the sour cream, sherry, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, paprika and bay leaf. Mix together and pour mixture over chops in skillet. Cover and let simmer gently over low heat for about 1 hour, or until chops are tender and cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
