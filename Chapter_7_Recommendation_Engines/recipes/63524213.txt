Ingredients:
2 quarts water
1 quart Heinz white vinegar low acid
3/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt
2 small baskets of small red/green hot peppers
4 balls of garlic

Directions:
1. Combine ingredients and bring to boil.  Boil for 15 minutes before using for canning.  Liquid should be boiling when added to top off jar before applying lid.
2. Peppers should be relatively small and firm and should be a mixture of red and green.  Remove stems and crown and either half or quarter the pepper according to size.
3. After sterlizing jars, rings and lids place 2 to 4 cloves of garlic at the bottom of the jars and begin filling with the cut peppers.  Be sure to press the peppers firmly into jar with plastic or wooden tamper.
4. When jar is filled tightly to the neck, pour in boiling brine.  Clean off rim of jar and seal.  Place jar in water bath until lids pop.
