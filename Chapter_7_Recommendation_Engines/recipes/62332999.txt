Ingredients:
1 lb. fresh spinach, washed
4 Tbsp sesame seeds
2 Tbsp sake
2 Tbsp sugar
1 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce
Preparation:

Directions:
Boil lots of water in a large pot. Boil spinach in the boiling water for about one minute. Drain and soak the spinach in water until cool. Drain and squeeze the spinach to remove the excess liquid. Cut spinach into about 2-inch lengths and set aside. Put sesame seeds in a suribachi (Japanese mortar) and grind them with a surikogi pestle. Or, place sesame seeds in a blender or food processor and grind until smooth. Add sugar and mix well. Further, add soy sauce and sake and mix until combined. Dress boiled spinach with the sesame sauce.
