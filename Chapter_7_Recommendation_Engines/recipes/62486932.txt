Ingredients:
2 cups long-grain rice
3 cups water

Directions:
Rinse the rice in a colander or large sieve until the water runs clean - about 3 times.
Place the rice in a heavy pot and add the water.
Turn heat to high and stir intermittantly until little craters form on top of the rice.
Cover and reduce heat; let steam for about 30 minutes.
Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes.
Fluff with a fork or chopsticks before serving.
