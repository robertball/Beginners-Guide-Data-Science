Ingredients:
Curry:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 large avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 cup water, or as needed
3 tablespoons seasoning sauce (such as Golden MountainÂ®)
2 tablespoons green curry paste, or more to taste
1/2 lime, juiced
Stir Fry:
2 cups green beans
8 ounces tempeh, cubed
1 carrot, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1/2 large avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 zucchini, cubed
1 cup basil leaves

Directions:
Blend coconut milk, 1/2 avocado, 1/2 cup water, seasoning sauce, curry paste, and lime juice in a blender until smooth, adding more water if curry is too thick. Pour curry into a large saucepan and bring to a boil.
Stir green beans, tempeh, and carrot into curry; reduce heat to medium. Cover saucepan and cook until beans and carrots are soft, about 15 minutes. Remove cover and add remaining 1/2 avocado, zucchini, and basil; cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
The first thing I do when I visit my favorite Thai restaurant is ponder the specials board. On my one of my recent visits, they had avocado curry. I had never thought of mixing a decadent coconut curry with a delicious avocado. After all, delicious fat plus more delicious fat is always a win. So I ordered it, made mental notes along the way and whipped up a batch the very next day. One tweaking batch later, and I've arrived at this. Serve over rice or noodles.
