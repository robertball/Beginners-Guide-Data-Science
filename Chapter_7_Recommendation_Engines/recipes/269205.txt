Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into chunks
3 large eggs
1/3 cup fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup fresh lime juice
1/3 cup fresh orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon lime zest
1 tablespoon orange zest
2 pinches salt

Directions:
Place sugar, butter, eggs, juices, zests, and salt in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until curd starts to bubble and thicken, and can coat the back of a wooden spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a bowl. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the surface to prevent a skin from forming.
Refrigerate curd until set, 2 to 3 hours.

Description: 
This citrus curd is a great filling for all types of cakes. I love this one in a wedding cake that I make that uses poppy seeds, lemon, lime and orange zest in the batter. If you use a cream cheese frosting, it's just about perfect. You can also serve it with fresh British scones.
