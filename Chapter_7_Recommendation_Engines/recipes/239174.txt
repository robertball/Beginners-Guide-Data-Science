Ingredients:
1/2 cup walnuts
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground cinnamon
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup mashed cooked sweet potato
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup minced onion
1 Fresno chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 small crimini mushroom, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Process walnuts in a food processor until you have a coarse powder; add oats, flax seeds, cumin, paprika, salt, and ground cinnamon and process again until the oats are ground into a coarse powder. Put black beans and sweet potato into the processor bowl; process until smooth and transfer to a mixing bowl.
Stir egg, onion, Fresno chile, crimini mushroom, garlic, and soy sauce into the black bean mixture until smoothly integrated; shape into 6 patties.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry patties in oil until a deep-brown crust forms, about 5 minutes per side.
