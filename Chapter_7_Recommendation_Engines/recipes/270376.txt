Ingredients:
¼ cup olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
1 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast, finely chopped
½ cup finely chopped red cabbage
¼ cup red onion, chopped
¼ cup finely chopped carrot
¼ cup light mayonnaise
3 tablespoons curry powder
1 tablespoon red curry paste (such as Thai Kitchen(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon red chile powder (optional)
½ (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers (such as Nasoya(<sup>&reg;</sup>))

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cabbage, onion, and carrot; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened.
Mix remaining soy sauce, mayonnaise, curry powder, curry paste, garlic, and chile powder together in a bowl. Fold into the chicken mixture.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly brush a rimmed baking sheet with some olive oil.
Place about 1/4 cup of the chicken mixture diagonally across an egg roll wrapper. Fold the bottom half over the chicken mixture; fold in sides and roll up like a burrito. Repeat until all the chicken mixture and wraps have been used.
Place egg rolls seam-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops and sides of the rolls with remaining olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
