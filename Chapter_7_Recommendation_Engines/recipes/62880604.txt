Ingredients:
5 Anaheim chilies
3 eggs
3 tbsp flour
3 tbsp sour cream
1 3 oz can of sliced black olives
2 cups of low fat Mexican blend cheese

1 1/2 cups ground meat
1 can green enchilada sauce
Optional Toppers, take your pick:
Sour cream
Diced green onion
Salsa

Directions:
Rinse chilies and place on a baking sheet covered in foil. Move oven rack to very top of oven and broil chilies for about 5 minutes on each side or until skin is blackened.
Remove from oven and place in a Ziploc bag. Close bag and let sit for 10-15 minutes. Remove chilies. Skin and remove veins and seeds. Cut into strips.
Preheat oven to 350?. Combine eggs, flour, sour cream, olives, salt and pepper to taste then mix thoroughly. Coat a baking dish with cooking spray.
Add a layer of the chilies.  Then egg mixture, then cheese, then black beans, then ground meat; repeat layers until gone.
Top with enchilada sauce and a more cheese. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes. Serve with optional toppings and lots of napkins!
