Ingredients:
2 ounces dry soy vermicelli
4 eggs, beaten
1 onion, finely chopped
2 ounces mushrooms, drained and chopped
3/4 (4 ounce) can small shrimp, drained and chopped
1 pound lean ground pork
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 carrot, shredded
2 ounces crabmeat
3 ounces bean sprouts
2 pinches ground black pepper
1 tablespoon soy sauce
3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 clove garlic, chopped
20 rice wrappers (6.5 inch diameter)
1 quart oil for deep frying

Directions:
Soak the vermicelli 30 minutes in warm water; drain.
In a large bowl, mix the vermicelli, eggs, onion, mushrooms, shrimp, pork, vegetable oil, carrot, crabmeat, bean sprouts, pepper, soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic.
One by one, moisten the rice wrappers with a damp tea towel and fill with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vermicelli mixture. Roll the wrappers, and allow them to set for 30 minutes.
In a large saucepan, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry the spring rolls one or two at a time until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
