Description: 
This recipe is handed down to me by my Italian mother. I grew up with this dessert. It's quick and easy. The chestnut puree may be hard to find. It's actually called 'Torta di Castagne' or Chestnut Cake. It just looks like a salami log. Great for a holiday meal. Great topped with whip cream.
