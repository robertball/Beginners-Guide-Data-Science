Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shredded coconut
1 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup milk, or more as needed
1/4 cup simple syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Whisk coconut and sugar together in a bowl. Sift in flour and whisk to combine. Make a well in the middle of the mixture and set aside.
Whisk eggs together in a small bowl and pour into the well in the flour mixture. Add enough milk to reach a slightly thickened, but runny, texture. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool for 20 minutes. Pour simple syrup over cake before serving.
