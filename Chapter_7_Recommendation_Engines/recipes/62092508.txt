Ingredients:
1 box of cook and serve vanilla flavored pudding
1 teaspoon vanilla flavoring
2 cups milk
2 ripe bananas
1 box of vanilla wafers
1 container of whipped topping

Directions:
Layer a 2 quart clear casserole dish (or any container you desire)with half of the wafers.
Cut the bananas into thin slices and top the layer of wafers.
Add the remaining layer of wafers and set aside.
In a medium saucepan, stir pudding into two cups of milk and add vanilla flavoring.
While stirring the pudding, cook on low heat until it comes to a boil.
Pour pudding mixture over the wafers and bananas.
Top the dish with the whipped topping.
Cover and set aside in the fridge for at least an hour.  Then serve.
(If pudding is too thick or thin, alter the amount of milk you use.)
