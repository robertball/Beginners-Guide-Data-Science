Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs pork shoulder
3 1/2 lbs lean meat (venison, pork, beef)
1 x Lem Snack Stick Pkg (cures and seasons 5 lbs)

Directions:
Grind all meat into hamburger.
Mix all meat together with the seasoning packet and cure.
Stuff into 19 mm collagen casings. You must remove the blade and hamburger screen from the grinder. Use the larger stuffing screen and the smaller stuffing tube to fit 19 mm casings.
When stuffing, alternate twisting away from you then toward you every 8".  After you twist a sausage, bend/tuck the formed sausage underneath the next sausage being stuffed, preventing it from untwisting.
Hang the sausages from a dowel in the smoker or place on racks ensuring the sausages do not touch.
Turn on the smoker and bake for approximately 60 minutes.
Apply smoke for approximately two hours.
Place the sausages in a baking pan and place a meat thermometer inside one of the sausages ensuring the thermometer does not touch any metal.
Bake sausages in an oven at 180° until the internal temperature of the sausage reaches 165°.
Place the sausages in an ice bath for 60 seconds then removed to dry.
Cut the ends and cut each sausage to preferred size. Place in half pound bags, release all air from the bags, wrap in freezer paper, and freeze.
