Ingredients:
4-6 large sweet potatoes
cream or milk
melted butter
cinnamon
orange slices
*marshmallows

Directions:
Cover the sweet potatoes with water in a large pot.  Cook until tender (don't peel them first) This is about an hour.  Cool potatoes until you can handle them, then peel and take off any bad spots.  Put into a large bowl and mash the potatoes.  Add a little cream or milk (I honestly don't know how much I use...maybe 1/2 cup?  Anyhow, you don't want the potatoes to be soupy, so put in a little at a time to avoid overdoing it.  Add about 2 tablespoons of melted butter; sprinkle with cinnamon and mix all this up real well.
Preheat the oven to 300 or so.
Butter a baking dish (not a big one) on bottom and sides, then put orange slices into bottom of baking dish.  Then pour potato mixture into baking dish and cover with marshmellows, if desired.  Actually, I usually bake the potatoes in the oven (covered with aluminum foil) to heat them up.  This takes about 30 minutes (?).  Then I take off the foil and put the marshmellows on, then put the dish back into the oven til the marshmallows* get a little brown on top.
*marshmallows optional
