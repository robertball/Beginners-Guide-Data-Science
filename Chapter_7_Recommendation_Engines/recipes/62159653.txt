Ingredients:
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup ranch dressing (lite works well)
1/2 cup milk (can use low fat or skim)
1   cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 cup parmesan cheese (fine ground)
1/4 tsp dried basil crushed
1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp seasoning salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp celery salt
non-stick cooking spray (butter flavored is good)
8 Tilapia filets thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Mix milk and ranch dressing in 1 cup measuring cup, pour mixture into shallow bowl or deep plate set aside. Measure all purpose flour into shallow bowl or deep plate, set aside. I use the deep Dixie paper plates for easy clean up.
Measure parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and all spices into a medium mixing bowl. Mix well with wisk or fork. Spray surface of mixture with cooking spray until damp, mix again. Repeat this 3 times total. Pour mixture into large paper or gallon plastic bag.
Dredge tilapia filets in plain flour on both sides, then through milk/ranch mixture. Place in bag and shake once, do this for all filets. When all filets are in bag, fold and hold top closed, shake well to coat the filets completely.
Cover large baking pan (17x11x1) with heavy duty foil, spray foil with a light coat of cooking spray. Place filets on foil, lightly spray tops of the filets with cooking spray. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes at 425 degrees.
