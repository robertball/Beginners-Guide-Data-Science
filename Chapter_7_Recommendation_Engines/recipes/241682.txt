Ingredients:
4 ounces penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup diced green bell pepper
1 teaspoon minced garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup diced cooked chicken
1/4 cup cooked garbanzo beans
2 eggs, or more to taste
1/4 cup fresh spinach, or to taste
2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1 ounce crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to cool.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, green bell pepper, and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add chicken and garbanzo beans to onion mixture; cook and stir until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix spinach and eggs into chicken mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set and cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Place pasta in a serving bowl and top with egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and feta cheese over egg mixture.

Description: 
A meal designed by necessity before the morning shift at my pizzeria. Cook time is extremely quick and the product is strangely satisfying. This dish would be complemented with a tall glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice and a hot mug of black coffee. Serves about one hungry human.
