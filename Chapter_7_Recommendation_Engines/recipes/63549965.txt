Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken
2 quarts chicken broth
¼ cups Crisco
¼ teaspoons Salt
1 cup Cold Water
2 cups Plain Or All Purpose Flour
2 cups Whole Or 2% Milk
Pepper, to taste
Tony Chachere’s Seasoning, to taste

Directions:
Debone the chicken and set aside.
Bring the chicken broth to a boil. Keep on low heat while you make the dumplins.
Mix the Crisco, salt, water, and flour well. Don’t overwork it, but just combine everything well. Roll out the dough onto a floured surface. Keep rolling the dough and adding flour to keep it nice and dry on top and bottom. Roll it really thin, about ?th of an inch.
Use a table knife to cut the dough in long strips, about 1½ inches or so. Now, cut those strips across and make rectangles. Pile the strips on a plate. If the dough is well floured, the dough will not stick to each other. When they are all cut and floured, start the broth boiling hard again. When it comes to a nice boil, start dropping individual dumplings in, but be sure not to drop them all in the middle on top of each other. Don’t stir them.
Cook it at a nice boil for about 4 minutes. Add the chicken. Next, add the two cups of milk and stir gently with a wooden spoon. Bring it back to a boil and it will thicken up. Simmer for about 15 minutes. Add pepper and Tony’s to taste.
