Ingredients:
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
and 1 tablespoon freshly grated and finely chopped lemon zest
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cubed.
1 egg yolk
Glaze
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Rub the butter into the flour mixture, or cut in with a pastry cutter until combined into what looks like coarse crumbs. Add one egg yolk and stir with a fork until blended. Take the dough into your hands and knead lightly until it comes together and forms a ball. If they dough looks too dry add some ice water, If it feels too sticky add some flour a little at a time.  Now, halve the dough and roll each half into a log about 1-inch in diameter. Wrap each log in cling wrap and tuck in the freezer for 30-minutes. When you are ready to bake them, remove a log from the freezer, unwrap, and slice into 1/4-inch rounds using a serrated knife. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment and stick into a 350F for 12 minutes
For glaze, in a small bowl add powdered sugar and lemon juice, whisk until syrupy. Drizzle over cookies once they have cooled.
