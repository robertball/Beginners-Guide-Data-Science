Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a bowl, mix the honey, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and balsamic vinegar.
Place the pork tenderloins in a roasting pan, and roast 15 minutes in the preheated oven.
Remove pork from oven, and baste with the honey sauce. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and continue roasting pork 45 minutes, basting occasionally with the honey sauce, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
