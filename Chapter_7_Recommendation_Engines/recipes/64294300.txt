Ingredients:
1 cup black Venere rice
2 Tbsp minced onion
1 Tbsp minced carrot
1 Tbsp minced celery
2 Tbsp olive oil

1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar Glaze

Directions:
Soak rice in cool water for 30 minutes.
Drain rice, discarding the water.
Bring a pot of water to boil and boil the rice for 20 minutes.
Drain the rice and set aside.
Heat olive oil in a skillet.
Saut√© the vegetables until the onions is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add the drained rice and cook until the rice and vegetables have mixed well and heated thoroughly.
Spoon the rice into 4 individual square or rectangle ramekins (to look like palaces) pressing down firmly so the rice will pack together.
Flip the ramekins upside down onto a plate to allow the rice to maintain its form.
Garnish with fresh, chopped parsley and a drizzle of balsamic glaze to imitate a pathway and garden.

Description: 
Black Venere or 'The Forbidden' rice is a wholegrain rice which has a rich black colour, nutty flavour, woody aroma and many health benefits. It was once the rice of Emperors because of its colour and named after the Goddess of Love. It can be substituted in any rice dish but needs to be soaked and then cooked longer than most other rices. It has a smooth texture and feels likes soft pearls in your mouth.
