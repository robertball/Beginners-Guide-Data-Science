Ingredients:
Ten Turkey Cutlets
Two Ripe Pears, peeled and chopped
One Bunch Arugula
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
1/3 Cup Chopped Walnuts
1/3 lb Cheddar Cheese, cut into strips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Place chopped walnuts on cookie sheet (with aluminum foil) and place them in the oven for five minutes.
In the meantime, sauté arugula in olive oil until wilted then set aside in a small bowl.
Rinse, peel, and slice the pairs into small pieces, and set them aside as well.
Place turkey cutlets in a baking pan and place the pan in the oven for around twelve minutes or until the cutlets are golden-brown. Put walnuts and arugula on top of the cutlets.
Slice cheddar cheese into strips and place a strip on top of each turkey cutlet. Top with a piece of pear, then roll up the edges of the cutlet and secure using toothpicks.
Bake in oven for fifteen minutes (until cheese is melted), and serve immediately!
