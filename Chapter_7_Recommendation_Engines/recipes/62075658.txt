Ingredients:
1.5 to 2 lbs ground beef or turkey
1 large onion, roughly chopped
2 green bell peppers, one roughly chopped, one sliced in rings
2 bags of Uncle Bens boil in bag wild and white rice mix
2 4oz cans sliced black olives
1.5 lbs shredded mozzarella
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tsp cayenne (or to taste)
1 tsp paprika (or to taste)
1 6oz can tomato paste
2 tbsp ketchup
1 12oz can tomato juice
1 large chopped tomato or canned diced tomatos, drained.

Directions:
saute chopped onions and chopped bell peppers till onions are translucent.  Add beef and brown.  Drain fat.
Add tomato paste, ketchup, tomato juice, tomatos, olives and all spices. Mix well. Simmer AT LEAST 15 minutes.  I do it for 45 minutes to mix flavor and thicken sauce to my personal preference.
Microwave rice according to package directions, mix in with meat.
Layer starting with the meat and rice mixture in a 9x13 casserole, then cheese, then meat, ending with cheese on top.
Garnish top with slices of bell pepper.
Pop in 350 degree preheated oven until cheese is melted.  I serve with a simple veggie side like broiled zucchini or salad and french bread or rolls to sop up the sauce.  You can turn up the heat by adding chopped jalapenos or canned chiles to the onions and bells when sauteeing.
