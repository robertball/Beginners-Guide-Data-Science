Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen broccoli, thawed
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place broccoli in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, about 4 to 6 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in salt, flour, and milk.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick and bubbly. Stir in cream cheese until melted.  Remove from heat, and stir in broccoli.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup of crushed crackers over the bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Slowly pour the broccoli mixture into the dish, and top with remaining crushed crackers.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
