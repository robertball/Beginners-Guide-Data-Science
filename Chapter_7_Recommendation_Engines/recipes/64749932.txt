Ingredients:
1/4 cup avocado oil (or oil of choice)
1/4 cup BBQ sauce
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 pound of chicken of choice (I use boneless, skinless breasts)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except chicken and stir until well mixed.
Place chicken breasts into a bowl or ziplock bag and pour 2/3 of marinade mixture over chicken making sure to coat all pieces.
Reserve the leftover marinade to brush chicken while grilling.
Allow chicken to marinade for 6 to 24 hours for best results.
