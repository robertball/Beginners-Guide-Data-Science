Ingredients:
6 bone in pork chops
1 can of pork gravy
8 ounces sour cream
2-3 T caraway seeds (no substitutes)
extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350
in a pan, heat olive oil and brown pork on both sides. You will not cook them, just put a pretty color on them.
After chops are browned put them in a baking dish.  I use a lasagna pan.
Deglaze the pan by putting the gravy and sour cream in the pan.  stir until combined.
Add the caraway seeds and bring sauce to a light bubble.
Pour over chops. Cover dish with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
I like to make buttered egg noodles to serve with this.  Then I spoon the sauce over the noodles.
