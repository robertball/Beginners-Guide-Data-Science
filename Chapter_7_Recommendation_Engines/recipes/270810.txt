Ingredients:
1 cup olive oil
4 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 cups shredded carrots
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup raisins
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch cake pans.
Mix olive oil, eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together. Combine flour, salt, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and nutmeg in a separate bowl.
Stir flour mixture into oil mixture until well blended. Fold in carrots, walnuts, and raisins. Portion batter evenly between the cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back with lightly touched, 25 to 35 minutes. Adjust temperature if cakes are browning too quickly. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and butter together just until smooth. Add confectioners' sugar; beat until smooth. Spread frosting over the cooled cakes.
