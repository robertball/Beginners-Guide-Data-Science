Ingredients:
8 large eggs
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese at room temperature
2 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®), or as needed
1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste

Directions:
Place eggs into a saucepan, cover with cold water, and place over high heat. When water is boiling, cover saucepan with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 18 minutes. Remove from heat and cool eggs under cold running water until eggs can be handled. Peel eggs.
Cut eggs in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a mixing bowl. Beat yolks, cream cheese, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, hot sauce, salt, and black pepper until mixture is creamy and smooth. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves. Sprinkle each deviled egg half lightly with Cajun seasoning. Chill before serving.
