Description: 
Lomo al trapo, I learned, is a Columbian method for cooking beef tenderloin where the meat is encased in salt, wrapped in a damp kitchen towel, and then set on top of hot coals.Â Figuring this might not work in the average kitchen, I came up with a method that didn't require the towel or hot coals.
