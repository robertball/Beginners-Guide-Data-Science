Ingredients:
12 fresh Manila clams
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup sliced Calabrese Sausage
1 head garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 cup chicken stock
2 teaspoons unsalted butter, broken into small bits
4 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt
Croutons
Chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a 12 inch heavy duty or cast iron saute pan over medium heat and add the sausage.  Saute slowly until the sausage begins to brown and caramelize slightly on the surface.  Add the garlic to the sausage mixture, stir and  cook for a few minutes allowing the garlic to soften without browning.
Turn the heat up slightly , and immediately add the clams and white wine to the garlic and sausage allowing the wine to simmer and deglaze the pan.  Add chicken broth, and continue cooking over medium high heat, bringing the mixture to a steady simmer until all of the clam shells have opened. Turn the heat to low and discard any clams that do not open.  Add the bits of butter to the pan and stir well into the mixture.  Taste and correct seasoning with freshly ground pepper, and sparingly with salt, if desired.  Top with croutons and finely chopped parsley and serve immediately in the hot skillet.
