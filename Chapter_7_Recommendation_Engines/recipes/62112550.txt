Ingredients:
1 1/4 all purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cooked mashed sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2/3 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter melted
Cinnamon optional

Directions:
Sift flour, baking powder and salt into bowl, add brown sugar and stir to mix. In a separate bowl, combine sweet potatoes with mlk and melted butter. Mix until well blended. Stir the dry ingredients into the potato mixture to make dough. Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead lightly, just to mix. Roll or pat out dough to 1/2 inch thickness and cut with 1 1/2 inch cookie cutter (or floured drinking glass top). Put on lightly greased cookie sheet bake at 425 until puffed and lightly golden, about 15 to 20 minutes.
