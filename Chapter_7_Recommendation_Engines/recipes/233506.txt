Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 large apple, cored and sliced
1/2 cup white sugar, divided
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 eggs
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple slices, about 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon in butter until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.
Beat eggs, milk, flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until batter is smooth; pour batter evenly over apples.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges of the pancake to loosen. Invert skillet over a large plate to serve.

Description: 
This is as close as I have found to the apple pancake at the Original Pancake House. A fluffy, sweet pancake. Excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream
