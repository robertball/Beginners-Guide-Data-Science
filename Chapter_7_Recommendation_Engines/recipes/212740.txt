Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package matzo sheets
1 quart tomato sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package sliced Swiss cheese
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray.
Break matzo sheets in half and run under warm water to soften. Pour tomato sauce into bowl, and season with salt and pepper. Coat the bottom of the prepared pan with some of the tomato sauce, then begin layering with the softened matzo sheet, Swiss cheese, mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce. Continue layering until the cheeses are used up, finishing with a layer of matzo. Top with the remaining tomato sauce, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and oregano.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe uses matzah sheets instead of lasagna noodles.  Delicious, and it's easy to take the leftovers for lunch the next day (unlike dry matzah for sandwiches!) As an option, add cooked spinach, mushrooms, onions, or peppers.
