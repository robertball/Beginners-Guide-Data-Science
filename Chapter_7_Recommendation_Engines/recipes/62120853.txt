Description: 
After trying several recipies from this site, I finally combined several ingredients to make this a bit easier to make. This soup taste just like the kind you get at a fancy resturant. You wont be disapointed! WARNING..this isn't low cal or fat free! Which is why it taste so good, however, I am sure alot of it can be subed for lower fat.
