Ingredients:
1/4 cup peanut oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels

Directions:
Heat the peanut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, stir in the sugar, salt and popcorn. Cover, and shake the pot constantly to keep the sugar from burning. Once the popping has slowed to once every 2 to 3 seconds, remove the pot from the heat and continue to shake for a few minutes until the popping has stopped. Pour into a large bowl, and allow to cool, stirring occasionally to break up large clumps.
