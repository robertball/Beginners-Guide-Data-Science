Ingredients:
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup light corn syrup
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup canned evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 pints vanilla ice cream
1/2 cup canned salted Spanish peanuts

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, heat the chocolate, corn syrup, coffee granules and cinnamon over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Stir in the evaporated milk and bring just to a boil.  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. (The sauce can be covered and refrigerated for up to one week. Reheat gently before serving.)
Let the sauce cool slightly before ladling over the ice cream. Sprinkle the peanuts over tops.
