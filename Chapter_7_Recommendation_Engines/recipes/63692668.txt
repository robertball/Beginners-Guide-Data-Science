Ingredients:
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped (2/3 cupish)
1-2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped (optional, otherwise its just mango chutney)
2 clove garlic, minced
6 Tbsp cider vinegar
1/2 cup lemon juice (2 lemonsish)
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
2 Tbsp brown sugar (plus more, if desired or optional)
Pinch of ground ginger
Pinch of ground curry powder
2 mango, peeled and chopped into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 cup dried currants
1/2 cup golden raisins
2 cups water

Directions:
Heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions and saute until translucent and just beginning to brown around the edges. Add habanero (if using) and garlic. Cook for an additional minute.
Whisk together vinegar, lemon, Worcestershire, brown sugar (if using), ginger, and curry powder. Add to the onions.
Add mango, currants, raisins and water to the saute pan and bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook covered for 20 minutes, until the mangos have softened.
Using a spoon, smash the mangos a bit. Cook uncovered until almost all of the liquid has reduced. Taste for seasoning - add salt or additional brown sugar, if desired. Let cool and transfer to a jar or airtight container. Store in the fridge or freeze.
