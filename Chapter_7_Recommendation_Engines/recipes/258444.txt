Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
1/2 (16 ounce) jar tomatillo salsa
1 cup chicken stock
8 cups tortilla chips
2 1/2 cups shredded aged Cheddar cheese (such as Beecher's Flagship)
2 cups citrus-braised pulled pork

Directions:
Set a cast iron Dutch oven over hot coals. Heat butter until melted. Add onion; cook, stirring often, until soft and deeply browned in parts, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour salsa and chicken stock into the Dutch oven; bring to a boil. Layer in 1/2 of the chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork. Repeat with the remaining chips, Cheddar cheese, and pulled pork (see Cook's Note for recipe link). Cover and cook until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
No one expects a dish this delicious while camping. By preparing the pork at home, cooking over the fire is kept to a minimum. Store leftovers in the cooler, and then reheat and serve with a fried egg for a breakfast that will fuel your adventures all day.
