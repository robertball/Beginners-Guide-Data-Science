Ingredients:
1 Cup creamy peanut butter
1 Cup butter (2 sticks)
1-2 tsp. vanilla extract
2 1/2 Cups powdered sugar
1 1/2 Cups graham cracker crumbs
12 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 Cup finely diced peanuts
nonstick cooking spray

Directions:
Lightly spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray.
In a large microwaveable bowl or small heavy saucepan on very low, melt the peanut butter and butter. Stir to combine.
Add the vanilla, powdered sugar and graham cracker crumbs and mix well.
Press the mixture into the pan and spread until smooth.
Melt the chocolate chips in a medium microwaveable bowl at half power or in a heavy saucepan over low heat.
Pour the chocolate over the peanut butter mixture, smoothing to spread evenly.
Sprinkle the peanuts over the top.
Refrigerate for 30-45 minutes. Remove from the fridge and score into 1.5" squares, lightly running the knife through the chocolate and just the top of the bars. This will help a lot when they are totally cold and you cut them.
Place back in the refrigerator. Once the bars are completely set, about 1 hour later, cut the bars all the way through.
