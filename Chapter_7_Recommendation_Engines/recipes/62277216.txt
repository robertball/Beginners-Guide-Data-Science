Ingredients:
1 9 in. deep pie crust, thawed
4 eggs, beaten
1 Cup, milk
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 Cup vidalia onion, chopped
7 slices of bacon
1/2 Cup cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cook bacon in a pan, removing three strips after about 30 seconds in pan so that they are still pliable. Cook remaining 4 pieces until crispy. Line the three softer pieces of bacon on the bottom of the pie crust pan. Crumble the remaining bacon and set aside.
Chop the onion and place in the same pan as bacon grease. Cook for about 5 minutes, until onion becomes soft and semi-translucent.
In a bowl, beat the eggs. Whisk in the milk, spices and crumbled bacon. Mix in the cheese.
Add the liquid mixture to the pie crust. Bake, uncovered for about 35 minutes, until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean.

Description: 
This is my take on Quiche Lorraine. The vidalia onion gives it a subtle sweetness and compliments the bacon. To cut down on the fat, you can use soy bacon is place of the regular stuff- You can barely tell the difference once it's cooked.
