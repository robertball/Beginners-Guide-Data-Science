Ingredients:
Roux:
1/2 stick butter
1/2 cup of flour
1 cup veggie broth
Cooking spray
1 bell pepper cut into strips
1 sweet onion cut into strips
1 can cream of celery
2 cans cream of mushroom
1/2 14.5 can of tomato sauce
Cajun seasoning to taste

Directions:
The roux needs to be a dark. The color of mud but without burning. (If you have black flecks it's gone too far)
Cook bell pepper and onion until onion is translucent.
Warm the broth and add the roux to it.
Add veggies, and soups and bring to a boil.
Add shrimp or crawfish cook until these are either warmed or cooked.
Add broth to your desired consistency. I don't serve over rice so I keep it fairly thick.
