Ingredients:
3 (1 1/2 pound) Cornish game hens
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3/4 cup plum jam
1 (1.25 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
2 kiwifruit, peeled and sliced, for garnish

Directions:
Place the game hens in a slow cooker. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
Mix the plum jam and onion soup mix together in a bowl until well blended. Remove 1/4 cup of the jam mixture and refrigerate until needed. Brush the remaining jam mixture over the hens.
Set the slow cooker on Low for 7 hours. Brush the reserved glaze over the hens. Cook on Low 1 hour more. Place hens on serving plates and garnish with kiwifruit slices.

These plum jam-glazed Cornish game hens are fall-off-the-bone yumminess! I use homemade sand plum jelly for the glaze.
