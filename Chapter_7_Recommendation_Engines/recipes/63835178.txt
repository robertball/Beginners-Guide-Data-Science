Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham
1/4 cup dark corn syrup
2 cups honey
2/3 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325Â°.
Place ham in foil lined pan.
In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.
Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze.
During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.
