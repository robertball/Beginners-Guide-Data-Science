Ingredients:
2 quarts of beets (Cooked and cut up)
2 cups sugar
2 cups vinegar
3 cups water

Directions:
Cook the beets with the skins on till tender with a fork (about 15 min).  Leave some of the stem on.  They will bleed too much color out if you cut the stem too short.
Cook syrup and pour over beets.  Bring to a boil and pack into jars and seal.
Process in hot water bath for 10 minutes.
