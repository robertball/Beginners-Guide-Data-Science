Ingredients:
6 eggs
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
8 ounces cooked pasta

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together thoroughly in a bowl.
Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add cooked pasta; toss to coat in olive oil. Add beaten eggs, stir, and cook until eggs begin firming up on the sides of the skillet, about 3 minutes.
Broil in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 2 to 3 minutes.
