Ingredients:
3 pounds fresh bratwurst sausages
5 large apples - peeled, cored and sliced
6 onions, sliced
1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar
1 cup water

Directions:
Place the brats into the bottom of a large electric covered roaster (such as a Nesco(R)). Layer the apples, then the onions, then the brown sugar over the brats. Pour the water over the ingredients.
Cover the roaster and cook the brats at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 3 hours. Brats will look dark and candied when ready.

Description: 
In Wisconsin, brats are considered a staple at summer picnics.  These are a twist on the traditional grilled brats. I have found once people try them, they soon become a favorite.
