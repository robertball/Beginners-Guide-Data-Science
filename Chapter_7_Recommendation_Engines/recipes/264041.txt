Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pint fresh blueberries
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon water
4 tablespoons butter, cut into 4 pieces
2 cups lemon cake mix

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 4 ramekins with cooking spray.
Place blueberries into a bowl. Add sugar, water, and cornstarch. Stir gently until well mixed, 30 seconds to 1 minutes.
Divide the blueberries evenly among the ramekins, filling them about 3/4 to the top.
Heat butter in a large, microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute.
Stir lemon cake mix into the butter to combine; mixture will still be a little dry and lumpy. Scoop about 1/2 cup of the mixture into each ramekin. Spray tops lightly with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.
