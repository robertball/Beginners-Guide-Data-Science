Ingredients:
1/2 cup unsalted raw sunflower seeds
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup oil
1/2 cup water

Directions:
In a blender, grind the sunflower seeds until fine.
In a bowl, mix the grinder sunflower seeds, flour, sesame seeds, poppy seeds and salt. Make you you add the salt. I skipped it the first time thinking its not necessary and the crackers were REALLY bland.
In a separate bowl, whisk together oil and water. Pour over the flour mixture and stir to form a dough. (if dough is too dry to form into a dough, add a little bit more water)
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth.
Cover with a bowl and let stand for 10 minutes.
Divide dough in half. Roll each piece to about 2mm thick.
Transfer to parchment-lined baking sheet and back for 12-15mins, rotating the pans half way through.

Description: 
When you grind up the sunflower seeds, it's ok if there are little chucks of seeds (1/4 size). It'll add to the texture of the cracker.

You can substitute the whole wheat flour with whole grain flour which will make your crackers even healthier.

When rolling out the cracker, it's easier if you roll it on the parchment paper so you don't have to transfer it later.

If you do decided to roll the dough on the counter, here is a really good tip. When you're ready to transfer the dough to the cookie sheet, roll the dough into a log (like a fruit-rollup), transfer the log onto the cookie she
