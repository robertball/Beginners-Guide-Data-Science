Ingredients:
1 recipe All-Butter Pie Dough, chilled
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 cups fresh mixed berries
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 fluid ounce elderflower liqueur (optional)
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed
1 egg
1 tablespoon cool water
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Sparkling sugar

Directions:
Roll dough out to an 11-inch round on a lightly floured work surface. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with foil and parchment paper. Chill, covered, while making filling.
Whisk white sugar and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Gently fold in berries, sprinkle with lemon juice, and stir until thoroughly coated. Sprinkle with liqueur.
Scatter bread crumbs across center of dough, leaving a 2-inch border. Spoon berry filling onto center of dough. Scatter butter cubes on top. Working your way quickly around galette, fold outer 2 to 3 inches of dough up and slightly over filling, pleating as needed to hold in filling.
Beat egg with cool water and kosher salt. Brush crust with egg wash and sprinkle generously with sparkling sugar. Chill galette for 30 to 45 minutes.
Set a baking stone, baking steel, or inverted baking sheet on the center rack of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Slide baking sheet with galette onto hot stone; bake until filling is bubbling and crust is a deep golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool for 1 hour or more before serving.
