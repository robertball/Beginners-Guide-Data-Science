Title:
Soft Corn Tortillas (Taco Shells) Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco Sauce
1 cup milk
3/4 cup cornstarch
1/3 cup cornmeal
1/3 tsp. salt
2 eggs
2 tablespoons melted butter
Vegetable oil to coat frying pan

Directions:
Whisk all ingredients like pancake batter. The cornstarch will make it tough to stir at first, but just work with it & continue to whisk just before you pour each new shell so the cornstarch doesn't settle and thicken.
Lightly coat an omelet or other small frying pan with oil. You may find you can skip this step with a non-stick pan or a well-seasoned skillet.  Heat the pan on medium heat.
Pour batter into the pan - just enough to make a thin layer (think CD-thickness). Flip when shell is browned on the bottom and mostly dry on the top.  Continue cooking for another minute or so until the other side is also lightly browned.  Continue making shells one at a time. Keep warm shells covered until all are ready and serve with your choice of taco fillings.
