Ingredients:
I medium bag dried pinto beans
I bunch Cilantro
2 large red tomatos
1 large onion
1 Chorizo sausage (I prefer pork)
2 packages Hotdogs
I package Bacon
I package Bolonga

Directions:
Cook the pinto beans about 4 hours or until done,in a big stock pot.
Chop the cilantro, tomatoes and onions add them to the beans. Add the Chorizo straight out of the package ( dont cook before hand)
Let cook for about an hour, the bean broth will be a pretty brownish red color and all the chorizo will have desolved completely. You know it's ready for the rest when you can no longer see the tomatos or the cilantro.
Chop the Hotdogs and bolonga and the bacon up into tiny pieces and add to the pot.
Let it all cook together for about an hour more until the bacon is completley cooked.
Serve in bowls with lots of the broth!

Description: 
This is a Mexican side dish that has been in my family for years.I've tweaked it a little and made it my own. Its simple and very filling. I always make this when we have friends over and I never have anything left when they leave. You can make it depending on the size of your family.
