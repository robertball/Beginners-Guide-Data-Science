Ingredients:
1/2 ounce dried wood ear mushrooms
2 cups boiling water
8 leaves napa cabbage
4 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup rice vinegar
3 teaspoons Asian hot chile oil
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 1/2 cups thick-sliced white mushrooms
1 heaping arrowroot or cornstarch
1 cup water
1 pound extra-firm tofu, pressed and cut into matchsticks
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1 cup scallions

Directions:
Place the wood ear mushrooms in a bowl and pour boiling water over them so that they are submerged by a few inches.  Cover with a plate and let sit for 20 minutes.
Pour the vegetable broth, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hot chile oil, sesame oil and white pepper into a soup pot.  Cover and bring to a boil.  Once the broth is boiling, add the cabbage and the fresh mushrooms.  Cook until the cabbage is completely wilted, about 5 minutes.
The wood ears should be ready at this point, so remove them from the bowl, cut into bite-size pieces, and add them to the soup as well.
Mix the arrowroot with the water until dissolved.  Add to the soup and stir until just slightly thickened, a minute or two.  The soup isn't going to be very thick, just more cloudy than anything else.  But the starch gives the soup a little body.
Add the shredded carrots and tofu, and cook just until heated through, about 5 more minutes.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with scallions to serve.
