Ingredients:
12 large eggs
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 1/3 cups cubed (1-inch) day-old bread, crusts removed
3 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 onion, cut into ½-inch-thick strips
1 each red and yellow bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into ¼-inch slices
½ cup ripe cherry tomatoes, cut in half
1 Tbsp unsalted butter
1/3 cup fresh ricotta

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, beat eggs, heavy cream, and salt and pepper to taste. Add bread cubes; let soak until softened, about 15 minutes.
2. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium. Add onion; cook until wilted, about 4 minutes. Add peppers; cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomatoes. Add butter and remaining oil to skillet; heat until foaming. Pour egg and bread mixture into pan; cook over medium without stirring.
3. Meanwhile, add ricotta by tablespoonfuls, forming little pockets on top. Continue cooking until bottom is lightly browned, about
5 minutes. There should be a few bubbles around edges.
4. Once bottom crust has formed, transfer skillet to preheated oven; cook until center is firm to touch, about 15–20 minutes.
To serve hot, let frittata stand at room temperature 15 minutes;
to serve warm or at room temperature, let stand a little longer.
