Ingredients:
1 chicken, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds, quartered, or chicken parts
Salt and pepper
1 tablespoon Spanish smoked paprika
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 clove garlic, finely minced

Directions:
Heat oven to 400°. Line a roasting pan or jelly roll pan with foil.
Wash chicken parts and pat dry. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on the baking pan; sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Combine remaining ingredients; rub the paste over the chicken pieces.
Roast, uncovered, for about 50 to 60 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 165° when inserted into the thickest part of a thigh. Juices will run clear when the chicken is pierced with a fork. Remove the chicken to a serving platter; cover loosely with foil and let stand for 8 to 10 minutes before serving.
