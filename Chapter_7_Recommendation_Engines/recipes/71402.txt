Ingredients:
2/3 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (5 pound) leg of lamb, butterflied

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the lemon juice, brown sugar, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Place the lamb in a shallow container. Pour the lemon juice mixture over the lamb. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Drain marinade, and bring to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to low, and simmer, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Over indirect heat, grill the lamb 40 to 50 minutes, turning to cook all sides, to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Cool, slice, and cover with the thickened marinade mixture to serve.

Description: 
I call this Dale's Lamb because my late mother-in-law, Dale, gave me this recipe. Everyone who's ever tried this likes it, even my mom, who didn't care much for lamb. Hope you like it, too.
