Ingredients:
4  chicken leg quarters, cut into thighs and drumsticks
salt to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2  red onions, thinly sliced
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
½ tablespoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 pound rhubarb, peeled and chopped
4 tablespoons honey, or more to taste
3 tablespoons lime juice, or to taste
1 tablespoon saffron
2 ½ cups chicken broth, or as needed

Directions:
Season chicken pieces with salt.
Heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Add onions to the skillet; cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with turmeric, black pepper, and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and cook until lightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add rhubarb, honey, lime juice, and saffron; mix well. Return chicken to the skillet.
Pour in chicken broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until chicken is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Season with salt.

This is one of my favorite savory dishes with rhubarb - the sauce is fruity yet peppery.
