Ingredients:
6 ounces imitation crabmeat, flaked
1/3 cup diced red bell pepper
1/3 cup diced celery
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®)
1 tablespoon dried minced onion
3/4 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 (4 ounce) sole fillets
1/4 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the imitation crabmeat, bell pepper, celery, and mozzarella cheese into a mixing bowl. Gently stir in the creamy salad dressing, dried onion, parsley, and cayenne pepper. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Place a sole fillet onto your work surface, and place 1/4 of the crab mixture onto one end. Roll the sole over the filling, and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining fillets, and place into a close-fitting baking dish, side by side. Cover with aluminum foil
Bake in the top third of the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil, and sprinkle evenly with breadcrumbs. Return to the oven, and continue baking until the fish is flaky, and the filling is hot, 10 to 15 minutes more.
