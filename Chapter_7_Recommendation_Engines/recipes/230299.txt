2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)

3 pounds beef tips, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles

Directions:
Mix cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms, butter, and onion in a slow cooker; add beef tips.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Serve beef tips and sauce over cooked egg noodles.

Description: 
Was in a hurry one day and threw this all together in the slow cooker. When I got home I was so surprised because it tastes like beef stroganoff made the hard way. So much simpler. I love this on a big piece of butter bread like an open-faced stroganoff sandwich.
