Description: 
I made this cake to recreate one of the cakes that my husband and I had at our wedding.  It is amazing! It was a lot of work, but the result was a cake that looked like I bought it at a professional bakery.  It was created by Sarah Patterson Scott, the senior executive chef at Robert Mondavi Winery.
