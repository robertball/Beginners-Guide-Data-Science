Ingredients:
½ stick butter, softened
½ clove minced garlic
¼ teaspoon dried thyme
¼ teaspoon dried basil
⅛ teaspoon coarse salt
freshly ground black pepper
⅓ pound thick-cut bacon
1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
2 teaspoons minced garlic

Directions:
Combine softened butter, garlic, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Place butter on a piece of wax paper and roll up rightly to form a butter log. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Lay one bacon strip flat on a piece of wax paper. Place chicken thigh on top of the bacon and sprinkle with garlic. Open up the chicken thigh. Place 1-2 tsp of the cold finishing butter in the middle of the chicken thigh. Tuck one end of bacon into the middle of the chicken thigh. Fold over the chicken thigh and roll the bacon around the chicken thigh. Repeat with remaining thighs and bacon.
Preheat an air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place chicken thighs in the basket of the air fryer and cook until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
