Ingredients:
1 cup dry red wine
1/3 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup canola oil

Directions:
To make the marinade, whisk together the red wine, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, honey, garlic, cumin, coriander, onion powder, pepper, and canola oil in a bowl until smooth.
To use the marinade, pour over 4 steaks in a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out the air, and massage the bag to coat the meat with the marinade. Refrigerate at least 8 hours before cooking to desired degree of doneness.

Description: 
Granddaddy's favorite steak marinade. Can be used with all cuts of beef. I usually reserve 1/2 cup of the marinade, then simmer it down to a syrup, and use it as a sauce for the steaks.
