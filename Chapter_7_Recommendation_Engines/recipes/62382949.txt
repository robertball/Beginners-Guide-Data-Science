Avocado Fudge Recipe

Ingredients:
- Butter, unsalted, 1/2 cup, melted
- Avocado, ripe, 1, peeled and destoned as late as possible to prevent discolouration
- Vanilla Essence, 1 teaspoon
- Cocoa powder, unsweetened, 1 cup
- Powdered sugar, 3 cups (less if this is really sweet)
- Chocolate chips, minimum 70%-cocoa-solids, 1/2 cup, melted
- Optionally, 1 liqueur glass of good quality cream liqueur (Bailey's for example)
- Optionally, 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (or pistachios, or a mixture) - for decoration.

Directions:
Pur√©e the avocado and melted butter in a food processor or blender, or in the saucepan with a hand-whizzer until very very smooth. We don't want any lumps of avocado, so strain if necessary!
In a medium saucepan over very low heat pour in the blended avocado and add the rest of the ingredients, except the walnuts, adding the powdered sugar a bit at a time. Stir constantly to get an even, thick mixture.
Once everything is fully incorporated, remove from the heat and pour into a greased baking tray, smoothing with a spatula.
Decorate with the nuts (if you like) and waft some more powder sugar over the surface.
Then refrigerate for at least an hour to stiffen up before cutting into portions.

Description: 
Avocados mate so well with cocoa - they are after all natives of the same part of the world. This recipe was sent by a friend in SoCal.
