Ingredients:
1 can of Cut Green Beans. (I used Italian Green Beans)
2 tablespoons of Olive Oil
1.5 tablespoons of Minced Garlic
0.5 tablespoons of Garlic Powder
1 teaspoon of Onion Powder
1 heaping teaspoon of Dried Parsley Flakes
1 teaspoon of Chicken Bullion Granules
Pepper to taste

Directions:
1) Open the can of Green Beans and drain. Then rinse very thoroughly to get rid of all traces of canning liquid.
2) Heat Oil in pan on medium heat and add Beans and Garlic.
3) Saute for 30 seconds then add spices, Parsley, and Granules.
4) Stir until there's no more liquid on the bottom of the pan but be sure not to let garlic burn.
5) Serve immediately.

Description: 
I finally figured out what to do with those pesky green beans!! You know, the canned ones that you buy when your tight on money and never figure out how to use them? I whipped this up as a side one night when i had no other veggies and was scraping the back of the pantry.
