Ingredients:
2 1/4 tsp dry active yeast
1/2 cup hot water
1/2 cup warm milk
2 tbsp brown sugar
2 1/4 cups flour
1 tsp salt
4 cups water
1/4 cup baking soda
6 tbsp butter, melted
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 tsp garlic powder
fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Proof yeast with water and sugar until foamy, about 10 minutes.
Mix in flour, milk, and salt and knead with a dough hook for 8 minutes, or by hand for 10.
Let rise, covered, in a non-metallic bowl until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Cut the dough into fourths, and roll each forth into a long "rope" about 1 inch thick.  Cut into bite sized pieces and set aside.
Bring water and baking soda to a boil in a large dutch oven.  Boil the pieces of dough for one minute, turning after 30 seconds.  Place pieces on a parchment lined baking sheet and slice a cross pattern in the top with a knife.
Bake pretzel bites until brown, 12-15 minutes.
Combine butter, cheese, garlic powder, and pepper.  Toss pretzel bites with butter mixture.  Serve hot.
