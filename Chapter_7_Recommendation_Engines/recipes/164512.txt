Description: 
Tangy, zesty, garlicky lemon and olive oil flavors blend in this dressing that compliments salads which include some type of grilled meat and baked or fried pita chips in the place of croutons. This dressing is best with salads containing grilled chicken, shrimp or fish.  It is very tangy but absolutely yummy.
