Ingredients:
1 cup unbleached flour
1 cup instant whole-grain hot cereal (such as Coach's OatsÂ®)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup non-fat vanilla-flavored Greek-style yogurt
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with cooking spray or use paper liners.
Mix flour, oats, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir sugar, applesauce, yogurt, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into applesauce mixture until just combined. Fold blueberries into batter. Fill prepared muffin cups 2/3 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
