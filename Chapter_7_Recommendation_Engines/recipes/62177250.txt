Bake 375 10-12 minutes (depends on your oven, if you bake to long they will be very hard!!!) my kids want them soft.

Description: 
From Mike's Aunt Pat: My mom always took them out of the oven when cracked on top and looked not quite done and let them sit on cookie sheet a few minutes. Of course dunk them in milk if to hard. Sawyer put a slice of bread in the container to make them soft.

Let me know how they come out. This is the only recipe the kids ask for.
