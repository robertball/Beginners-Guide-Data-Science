Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups cranberries
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups flour, baking soda, 1 cup of white sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir in the milk, egg, and butter until well blended. Toss the cranberries in the remaining 1/4 cup of flour to coat, then fold them into the batter.
Pour the batter into a greased round casserole dish with a lid, place the lid on, and then cover again with aluminum foil. Place the dish into a large roaster or stock pot, and fill with 3 to 4 inches of water. Place the lid on the outer pot, and cover with aluminum foil. Turn the heat to medium-high, and steam for 2 hours. Add more water if necessary after the first hour.
For the sauce, mix together 1/2 cup of white sugar, brown sugar, butter, and heavy cream in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir occasionally until the mixture comes to a full boil. Boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Refrigerate until chilled, then beat with an electric mixer until smooth.
Serve slices of the steamed pudding with the brown sugar sauce, and a dollop of whipped cream.
