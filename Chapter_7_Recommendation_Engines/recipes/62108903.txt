Ingredients:
2 c water
2 c whole milk
1 T fennel seed
1 1/2 tsp whole hulled cardamom, to taste
4 to 6 whole cloves
4 T Indian mamri (granulated, CTC) loose tea, or 4 to 6 cheap unflavored black tea bags
Sugar to taste

Directions:
Use whole spices ONLY.
Boil the water.  Add the whole spices and leave at a slow boil for 3 minutes.
Add the milk and bring back to a slow boil.
Add the tea or tea bags and boil on low for no more than 2 to 3 minutes.  It can get bitter if you leave it on the heat longer than that.
Remove from the stove, strain, and serve.
Sugar to taste.
It's important to use a CHEAP granulated tea - for years I tried to make this using the best Darjeeling and Asaam teas that I could find and it never came out right.  The cheap granulated tea (basically what we put in tea bags) is the key - it takes a strong flavored tea to stand up to the flavor imparted by the spices.
