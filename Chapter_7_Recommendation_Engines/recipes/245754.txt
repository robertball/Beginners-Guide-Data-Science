Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup hot sauce
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch-flavored seasoning mix
6 cups crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex®)
4 cups crispy wheat cereal squares (such as Wheat Chex®)
1 3/4 cups dry-roasted peanuts
1 1/2 cups fish-shaped pretzel crackers (such as Pepperidge Farm® Goldish®)
1 1/2 cups Parmesan-flavored fish-shaped crackers (such as Pepperidge Farm® Goldish®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, 25 to 30 seconds. Add hot sauce and microwave until heated through, 20 to 30 seconds more. Stir in ranch seasoning.
Combine rice cereal squares, wheat cereal squares, peanuts, pretzel crackers, and Parmesan-flavored crackers in a large bowl. Pour in butter mixture; mix thoroughly to coat. Spread in 2 ungreased 9x13-inch baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and stir well. Return to the oven; bake until dried, about 15 minutes more. Spread on paper towels to cool.
