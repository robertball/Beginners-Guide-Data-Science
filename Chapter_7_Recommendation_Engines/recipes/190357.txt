Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup shredded coconut
1 tablespoon butter, softened
5 egg yolks
1 egg white

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix the sugar, coconut, and butter in a bowl. Stir in the egg yolks and the egg white; beat until well combined. Pour the mixture into a 9 inch pie plate. Place the pie plate in a large roasting pan. Pour enough boiling water into the bottom of the roasting pan to reach about half-way up the side of the pie plate.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool completely before turning out onto a serving dish. Refrigerate until serving.
