Ingredients:
4 Salmon fillets
2 tbsp butter
Salt and pepper
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup dry white wine

1 tsp lemon zest
1 tbsp chopped chives
3 tbs cream
Salt and white pepper
1 tbs butter
Parsley and lemon slices for garnish

Directions:
To make the sauce melt butter in a pan and gently cook the onion until soft. Add wine, lemon juice, lemon zest and chives.  Simmer for 2 minutes. Slowly add cream and continue to simmer until sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Keep sauce warm while salmon is cooking.
Season the salmon fillets with salt and pepper, dot with butter and grill until cooked through. Serve with the buttery sauce and garnish with lemon slices and parsley.
(Note: If the sauce starts to separate, beat vigorously until smooth or add a little more cream)
