Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup white sugar
1 cup mango puree
1 tablespoon orange zest
3 tablespoons canola oil
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup chopped cranberries
3/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, beat together eggs and sugar until smooth. Thoroughly blend in mango puree, orange zest, and canola oil.
In a separate medium bowl, sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Blend into the mango mixture. Fold in cranberries and walnuts. Transfer to a medium loaf pan.
Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack.
