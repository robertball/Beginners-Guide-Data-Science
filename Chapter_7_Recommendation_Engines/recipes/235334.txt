Ingredients:
16 slices soft white bread, crusts removed
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 small onion, diced
1 small green bell pepper, diced
1 (10.75 ounce) can reduced-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup
3/4 cup skim milk
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon rubbed sage, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 1/2 cups cubed cooked turkey
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll bread slices flat on a work surface using a rolling pin. Brush 1 side of each flattened bread slice with melted butter. Fit bread slices into muffin cups, butter-side up.
Bake in the preheated oven until cups are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool completely.
Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and gradually stir cream of mushroom soup and milk into onion mixture until smooth; add Italian seasoning, sage, salt, and pepper. Stir turkey into soup mixture; cook and stir until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Place 2 or 3 bread cups on each place. Ladle soup mixture into each cup; top with parsley.
