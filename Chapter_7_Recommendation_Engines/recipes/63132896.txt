Ingredients:
3 c. flour
1 1/2 t. salt
1 T. sugar
1 1/2 t. baking powder
1 stick butter
3/4 c. buttermilk (I have made these with buttermilk as well as the 'homemade' buttermilk version of 3/4 c. milk + 2 T. lemon juice and they work out amazing either way)
1 egg
1/4 c. water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Combine flour, salt, sugar, baking powder and butter until crumbly.
Mix in buttermilk, egg and just enough water to make a workable dough. Mix the dough until it is just barely combined (don't over mix).
Roll the dough onto a floured cutting board about 1 inch thick. Cut with a 2 inch biscuit cutter, or a 2 inch round cup.
Place on a greased baking sheet (touching each other) and bake 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
