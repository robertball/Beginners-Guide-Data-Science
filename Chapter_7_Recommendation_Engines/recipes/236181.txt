Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
3  chicken breasts, cut into cubes, or more to taste
¼ cup rice vinegar
3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
2 teaspoons spicy mustard
½ teaspoon chile oil
½ cup Sriracha sauce, or more to taste
½ cup butter, or to taste
2 bunches green onions (scallions), chopped

Directions:
Coat the bottom of a skillet with vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Saute chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, mustard, chile oil, and Sriracha sauce, adding in exact order and waiting 1 minute between each addition for ingredient to layer.
Melt butter, stirring occasionally, into the chicken mixture creating a sauce, 2 to 3 minutes; lower heat to medium-low. Add green onions and cook until slightly wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
I have adapted this recipe from a buffalo wing recipe. I was looking for something to cook with chicken, scallions, and Sriracha sauce with an Asian flavor. After about a year of tinkering, this is what I came up with. 

It can be tweaked to accommodate personal taste on spiciness. Level of heat is akin to hot wings, maybe a step hotter. Everything in this recipe can be changed to suit personal tastes. Serve with steamed rice and any other side dishes you wish.
This is how I like to make it for my desired level of spicy. 

I would love any feedback and information on adaptations that have worked. Thanks!
