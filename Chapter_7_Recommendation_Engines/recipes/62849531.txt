Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter milk or 1c. filmj√∂lk (thick sour milk)
1/2 c. regular 2 % milk
1 1/2 cups pitted, chopped plums (floured if desired)
TOPPING:
1/4 packed brown sugar
1 c. tablespoons chopped pecans
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar, oil, egg and lemon peel; mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; add to sugar mixture alternately with buttermilk/milk. Stir in plums. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans.
Combine the brown sugar and pecans for the topping. Sprinkle cinnamon on the top of the batter then sprinkle the pecan/brown sugar mix on top. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. Keep in mind that some of the fruit will sink to the bottom of the loaf.
