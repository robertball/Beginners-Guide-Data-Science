Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) boneless beef sirloin steaks, room temperature
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 teaspoons cracked black pepper
2 teaspoons celery seed
1 1/2 cups extra spicy Bloody Mary mix
1 tablespoon orange juice concentrate
2 fluid ounces vodka
16 pitted green olives
3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
2 teaspoons chopped garlic

Directions:
Preheat a grill to medium heat.
Brush steaks on both sides with olive oil, then sprinkle with a mix of cracked pepper and celery seed.  Cook steaks to desired doneness on the preheated grill.  When done, allow steaks to rest on a plate while continuing with the recipe.
Bring the Bloody Mary mix, orange juice concentrate, and vodka to a boil over high heat; then reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes.  While sauce is cooking, puree the olives, butter, and garlic in a small food processor until almost smooth.
To serve, pour a pool of the sauce in the center of each plate. Slice each steak into 4 or 5 slices, and fan out over the sauce.  Add a dollop of olive butter, and spoon a little more sauce overtop.

Description: 
We love spicy foods and never tire of this quick supper. Keep the grill hot and it's almost foolproof! This dish comes together in the time it takes to toss a salad, pour the wine and ring the dinner bell.  Roughly torn pieces of rustic country style bread heated on the grill make a nice accompaniment.
