Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery, with leaves
1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and chopped
3/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Romano cheese
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, celery, and apple until the onion is translucent and the apple is softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Let the mixture cool.
In a bowl, mix the cooked apple mixture with the bread crumbs, Romano cheese, eggs, milk, and poultry seasoning until well combined, and lightly stir in the ground turkey. Do not over mix or the meatloaf will be tough.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan, and bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is cooked through to the center, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
I love fall because it means I can make this fall-ish comfort food with all of the flavors of Thanksgiving without all of the hassle of a Thanksgiving dinner! Serve with cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes.
