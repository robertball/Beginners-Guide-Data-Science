https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
• 2 15.5oz cans of Great Northern beans, rinsed and drained
• 8oz can of chopped mild green chilies (ALDI didn’t have these so I subbed a
10oz can of diced tomatoes and green chilies)
• 1 and 2/3 cups of frozen corn (1/2 of a 1lb bag)
• 4 teaspoons chicken bullion granules*
• 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
• 1 small yellow onion, chopped (about one cup)
• 2 garlic cloves, minced
• 2 teaspoons ground cumin
• 1 teaspoon ground oregano (I used dried oregano leaves)
• 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
• 1/4 teaspoon pepper
• 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
• 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
• 4 cups water* (not needed until day of cooking)

Directions:
MATERIALS
• 1 gallon-sized plastic freezer bag
PREP
1. Label your freezer bag.
2. To your freezer bag, add all ingredients except water. (Add the chicken to the
bag last, so it’s the first ingredient poured into your crockpot.)
3. Remove as much air from the freezer bag as possible, seal, and lay flat in your
freezer.
COOK
1. The night before cooking, move frozen bag to your refrigerator to thaw.
2. The morning of cooking, pour contents of freezer bag into your crockpot and
add 4 cups of water.
3. Cook on “low” setting for 6 hours or until chicken is cooked through.
4. Shred chicken and serve.
*Note: If desired, you can replace chicken bullion and water with four cups of store-bought or
homemade chicken broth. Add it the day of cooking.
