Ingredients:
2 pounds dried pinto beans, sorted and rinsed
2 large jalapeno peppers, stemmed
4 large cloves garlic
2 smoked ham hocks, or more to taste
1 large onion, cut into large chunks
2 tablespoons salt
1 1/2 tablespoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 pound thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 (7 ounce) cans chopped green chile peppers

Directions:
Place pinto beans in a 7-quart slow cooker and add enough water to cover. Allow to soak for 3 to 4 hours.
Combine jalapeno peppers and garlic in a food processor; puree into a paste.
Drain beans and return to the slow cooker. Stir in jalapeno-garlic paste. Nestle ham hocks among the beans. Sprinkle onion chunks, salt, cayenne, pepper, and paprika over the beans. Place bacon and green chiles on top.
Cover and cook on Low for 10 hours. Remove ham hocks. Cool slightly; shred the meat.
Return meat and fat to the slow cooker. Stir for a few minutes to incorporate fat into the beans and give liquid a creamy consistency. Turn off or keep warm until ready to serve.

Description: 
This makes a lot of beans--a 7-quart slow cooker's worth! This is not fast cooking, but low and slow. And it's not a low-calorie/low-fat meal. My mother started this recipe and was a staple in our home growing up. My brother has perfected it and shared it with us. Serve with anything you desire. In our home, it's tortillas and eggs! These freeze well and reheat/refry beautifully.
