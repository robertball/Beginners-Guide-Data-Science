Ingredients:
2 tablespoons LAND O LAKES® Butter
2 apples - peeled, cored and diced
1/4 cup white sugar, divided
1 pinch salt
Browned Butter:
1/2 cup LAND O LAKES® Butter
Dip:
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Chips:
1 (15 ounce) package pie dough for a double-crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Saute apples until medium-firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup white sugar and pinch of salt. Cook until apples begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove apples from the skillet and allow to cool. Wipe out skillet with a paper towel.
Place 1/2 cup of butter in skillet over medium heat. Constantly swirl the butter in the pan, watching carefully so butter does not burn. The butter is "browned" when it is a tan color and smells nutty. This can take 3 to 10 minutes. When butter is ready, promptly pour it into a bowl to prevent it from burning.
Add 1/2 cup white sugar to the apples and stir until sugar is well incorporated.
In a mixing bowl, combine browned butter, powdered sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon until well combined. Add apple mixture and stir until well-blended.
Unroll the pie crust on a silicone mat. Using a small cookie cutter, press out the pie crust "chips." Lift the pie crust up, leaving the "chips" on the mat. Place the mat on a baking sheet. The remaining dough may be rolled out to 1/4" thick and the process repeated to use up all the dough and make more "chips" using separate silicone mats (or parchment).
Bake in preheated oven, bake 6-7 minutes, watching carefully to ensure the chips to not burn. Allow the chips to cool. Place on serving plate.
Spoon the dip into a serving bowl; serve with chips for dipping.
