Ingredients:
Cookies:
-------
1 1/2 c powdered sugar
1 c butter
1 egg
1 t vanilla
1/2 t almond extract
2 1/2 c flour
1 t baking soda
1 t cream of tartar
-------
Frosting:
-------
4 c powdered sugar
1/4 c solid white shortening (Crisco)
pinch of salt
1/2 - 1 t almond extract
Few T milk
Food coloring, if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven for 30 min. Sift powdered sugar into mixing bowl, add butter, egg, vanilla and almond extract. Cream together on low speed.
Into the bowl, sift flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar; mix on low speed until just combined. Chill for 30 min - 1 hour.
Take a portion of the dough and roll out on floured surface to cut with cookie cutters. Bake at 350 for 8-10 min or until edges just begin to look brown.  Frost after cookies are completely cool.
For the frosting, sift powdered sugar into mixing bowl. Add shortening, salt, almond extract, and 2-3 T milk. Beat together on low speed, adding additional milk until frosting reaches desired consistency. Can be made thick or thinner, and will form a firm coating on the cookies when dry (cookies can be stacked), without the frosting becoming hard.
Divide into bowls and add a few drops of food coloring to make multiple colors, if desired.
