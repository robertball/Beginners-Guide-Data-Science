Ingredients:
2 cups plain whole milk yogurt
1 cup whipping cream
1 1/8 cups raw sugar (9 oz)
1 cup pumpkin pur√©e
3 Tb brandy
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice*
1/8 tsp sea salt
*or 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp each nutmeg and cloves

Directions:
In medium bowl, whisk together ingredients in the order given.  The sugar should be dissolved.  Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator overnight.
Pour batter into your ice cream maker and churn according to your machine's instructions.  When done, transfer to container with tight-fitting lid and place in freezer 1-2 hours before serving, until of desired consistency.  It stays pretty creamy when frozen due to the alcohol content, but creamier slightly thawed.  Enjoy!
Note:  Churned this for 20 minutes in my KitchenAid Ice Cream Bowl Attachment.

Description: 
My own recipe for delicious pumpkin frozen yogurt using my favorite formula of 2 cups yogurt, 1 cup whipping cream.  Just creamy enough to suit our taste, less calories than ice cream, and great pumpkin fall-time flavor.  I churned it using my KitchenAid Ice Cream Bowl Attachment.  Hope you enjoy it.
