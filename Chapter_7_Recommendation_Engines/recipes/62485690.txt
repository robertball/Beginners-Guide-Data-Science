Ingredients:
8 lb. whole chicken, organic
10 c. water
2 carrots, sliced
2 celery stalks, sliced
1 onion, medium diced
2 tbsp. bouillon (Better than Bouillon, Chicken)
1 tbsp. dried thyme leaves
1 tbsp. dried oregano
1 tbsp. dried sage
1 tsp. dill
8 oz. uncooked large "bow tie" noodles

Directions:
In a covered soup pot, boil the chicken over medium heat for about two hours, or until the legs are ready to fall off the bird.
Lift the bird from the water (now broth) and set aside to cool.
While the bird cools, add bouillon to the water/stock, then simmer the vegetables in the stock for 45 minutes or so, until they're cooked.
Once the chicken is cool, remove the meat from the skin and bones and tear or cut into bite-size pieces. Them return all the chicken to soup pot, while it's still simmering.
Toss in the uncooked noodles and cover until the noodles are cooked through. Stir and serve. (If the soup is thick before you add the noodles, add a little more water and bring it back to a low boil before you add the noodles.)

Description: 
My mother-in-law and her sisters each prided themselves on their chicken soup, despite the fact that they used different recipes. This one is a combination of their work, into what my husbands says is a soup that tastes as good as grandma made it. Well, that's good enough for me.

Note: it's crucial that the chicken be organic, otherwise the meat can dry too much in the cooking process.
