Ingredients:
Ends and peels of carrots
Ends and leaves of Celery
Ends and peels of Onions
Ends of Garlic bulbs
1-2 T. of Salt, more to taste
3-5 Whole Dried Red Chile Peppers (Optional)
1 qt. freezer bag

Directions:
Prep:
As you chop vegetables (such as the ones listed above), save the ends.
Wash ends, and pat dry.
Transfer to 1qt. freezer bag until bag is full of mixed veggie ends.  Then, get another bag.  Store in freezer, add as you go.  Once a bag is full, start a new one.  A 1 qt. bag of ends typically makes up to 8 qts. of veggie stock.
Veggie Stock:
Take out a full 1 qt. bag of frozen veggie ends, place in 5-8 qt. pot, add water to 1" from the top.  Add garlic cloves as desired and 3-5 WHOLE Dried Red Chile peppers, depending on heat preference, if desired.  Add 1-2 T. salt.  Don't over salt.  More can be added later, but you can't remove it.
Bring to boil, reduce to simmer for 1 hour.  (Longer is fine as well.) Turn off heat for another hour, or until cool enough to proceed to step 3.
Strain liquid through a mesh colander, cheesecloth, or other preferred method.  Discard all ends, peppers, and any other solid pieces so you have a rich broth.  It's okay if it's still not salted enough.
Use immediately, or store in fridge for up to 7 days.  May be frozen for up to 6 months as well.
