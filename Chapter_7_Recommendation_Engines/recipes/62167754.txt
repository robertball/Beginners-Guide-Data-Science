Ingredients:
Pho ingredients:
1 package of dry rice noodles (pho size, about 1/4 inch thick)
1/2 ginger root, peeled
2 dried star anise
1 whole chicken
2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. MSG (optional)
Sauce (optional for Kho/dry style):
4 cloves of garlic
chicken skin, removed and minced after chicken is cooked
1/2 c soy sauce
2 tsp sugar
1 1/2 c chicken broth
1 tsp corn starch, diluted in 3 tbs of water

Directions:
Soak noodles in cold water for 30 mins.
For the broth, place chicken and ginger in large pot, sprinkle with salt and cover with water.  Cook on Medium heat for 40 mins or until juices run clear.  Remove chicken and let rest for 15-20 mins and shred, reserving the skin for the sauce.  Boil noodles and place in bowls, serve with chicken and garnish with your choice (bean sprouts, thai basil, chili,etc.) Ladle broth over noodles and enjoy!
To make sauce:
Brown the minced chicken skin over medium heat until crisp and brown.  Lower heat to low. Drain most of the fat, reserving only a small amount.  Add garlic and saute until softened. Add in soy sauce, broth and sugar.  Bring to a boil and add corn starch mixture.  Boil for 1 minute and lower to a simmer.  Serve over cooked noodles and chicken for a Nha Trang region specialty! (Serve broth on the side).

Description: 
Coming from a Vietnamese family, we have to find ways to cook traditional food on the fly and this is a recipe that my mom came up with years ago.  (You can also make this kho which is dry in Vietnamese- essentially putting the soup on the side and serving the noodles with the sauce recipe following.
