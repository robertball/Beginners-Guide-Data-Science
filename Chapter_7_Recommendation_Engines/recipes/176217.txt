Description: 
This is a chili I have been making for years. I have made it with all kinds of ground meats (beef, turkey, deer, elk) but I prefer ground moose. The longer you let it simmer the better as the flavors will blend. Top with shredded cheddar cheese. Serve with fresh baked cornbread and sweet honey butter. Men LOVE this meal!
