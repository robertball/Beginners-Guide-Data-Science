Ingredients:
1 pound linguine pasta
4 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
6 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained with juices reserved
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for passing at the table
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large skillet, heat oil and butter over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until it starts to sizzle and turn golden. Add tomatoes and clam juice and boil until reduced to about 1 cup of liquid, about 10 minutes. Stir in clams and parsley; heat through. Add sauce and cheese to pasta; toss well. Serve with extra Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper.
