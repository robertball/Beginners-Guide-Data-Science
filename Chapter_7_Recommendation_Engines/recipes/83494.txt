1 clove garlic, crushed

Directions:

Description: 
It's an assortment of wonderfully interesting flavors that work well together. Surprisingly. I saw a similar recipe on line somewhere (not here) and I took the base and left out the exotic things (I can't identify or get) and then expounded on it. It's origin is Vietnamese. It has a very healthy and light flavor.
