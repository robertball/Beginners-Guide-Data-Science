Ingredients:
Crust:
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/3 cups very warm water (120 degrees to 130 degrees F)*
1/3 cup Mazola® Vegetable Plus! Oil
Suggested Toppings:
Green, red and yellow bell peppers
Mushrooms
Black olives
Pepperoni slices
Curly leaf parsley or other fresh herbs
1 pound shredded white and yellow cheeses such as mozzarella and cheddar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Combine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute.
Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. Dough should form a ball and will be slightly sticky. Knead** on a floured surface, adding additional flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Divide dough into 8 portions; cover. (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rise at this point for 10 minutes.)
Pat each portion of dough with floured hands into an 8-inch circle on a greased baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough. Add a second crust to the same baking sheet.
Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, dough will be just set and only lightly browned on the bottom. Remove crusts to a wire rack to cool. Continue with remaining pizza dough. (Works best to use several baking sheets.) May use crusts immediately or place in freezer bags and freeze for up to 1 month.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Spread each crust with pizza sauce. Top with desired toppings to make Halloween designs! Repeat with remaining pizzas. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until cheese is melted and lightly browned and bottom of crust is browned.
