Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons ketchup
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon chopped fresh fenugreek leaves
1 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir onion and ketchup until onion is thinly and evenly coated. Mix in the lemon juice. Season with sugar, cilantro, fenugreek and chili powder, and mix thoroughly. Cover, and chill for 24 hours. This allows the lemon juice to neutralize the onion flavor slightly.
