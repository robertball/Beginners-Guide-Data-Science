Ingredients:
Fresh Mint Leaves-about 15
Fresh Lemon Verbena Leaves -about 10

Directions:
I love Lemon but I hate what the acid does to my teeth–with Lemon Verbena you get the flavor of Lemon without the Acid! I cut a little stem that had about 10 leaves on it and and a couple stems of Mint (15 leaves roughly)–Steeped it in 8oz. of boiling water and added a little honey. I keep the leaves on the stem so that I can quickly pull them out right before enjoying–no straining necessary!
