Ingredients:
2. c. unbleached white flour
1/2 tsp salt
12 tbsp cold butter cut in pieces
2 eggs
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 1/4 lbs mixed Muenster and Havarti cheeses
1 egg yolk, beaten

Directions:
Put the flour and salt in a medium bowl and cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  Beat 1 egg and stir in the yogurt,
then add to the flour mixture.  Form into a ball and chill for 1 hour.
Grate the cheeses coarsely, beat the other egg, and stir it into the cheese.  Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a large baking sheet.  On a floured board roll the dough to a rectangle about 12X17 in.  Trim the
edges.  Spread the cheese mixture on half the dough and then fold the other half over to enclose it, sealing and crimping the edges.
Transfer the bread to the baking sheet and brush with beaten egg yolk.
Bake for 50 minutes, or until browned.  The bread is best served slightly warm, cut into small pieces.
