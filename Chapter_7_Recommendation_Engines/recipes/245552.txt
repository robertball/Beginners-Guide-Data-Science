Description: 
I needed an after-workout protein shake that was also a breakfast meal replacement that would keep me full until lunch. Everything I tried only lasted an hour or two before I got hungry again. Experimenting for something nutritious, delicious, and extremely filling, I finally created this. This smoothie is chock full of calories, carbs, fiber, protein, you name it.
