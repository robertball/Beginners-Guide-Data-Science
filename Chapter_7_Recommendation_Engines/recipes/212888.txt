Description: 
A friend gave me this easy candy recipe, and now I make it every Christmas. The mixtures of different chocolates make for a great milk chocolate flavor. The best part is it's made in the slow cooker. Just put in your ingredients and let your cooker do the hard work.  These little candies make a great gift-giving idea.
