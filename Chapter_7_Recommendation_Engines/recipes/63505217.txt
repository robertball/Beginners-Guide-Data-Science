Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
4 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 medium beets, peeled and halved
1 medium potato, peeled and halved crosswise (optional)
sugar (optional)
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon lemon juice
8 teaspoons reduced-fat sour cream
optional:  I added some cole slaw mix, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp allspice.

Directions:
Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion; saut√© 3 minutes or until tender. Add broth and next 6 ingredients (through bay leaf). Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes or until beets and potato are tender. Discard bay leaf.
Place one-third broth mixture in blender or food processor; process until smooth. Place pureed mixture in a large bowl. Repeat procedure twice with remaining broth mixture. Return pureed mixture to pan. Warm soup over low heat for 5 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice.
Combine 1/2 cup soup and the sour cream, stirring with a whisk. Divide soup evenly among each of 8 bowls. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon sour cream mixture; swirl sour cream mixture using the tip of a knife.
