Ingredients:
MARINADE
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon orange zest
1 teaspoon Sriracha (or to taste)
1/4 teaspoon ground or grated ginger
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
THE REST
1 1/2 lbs boneless chicken breasts cut into 1" chunks
1 cup and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided
2 large eggs, beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Make the marinade: whisk together chicken broth, orange juice, honey, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, sriracha, ginger, and white pepper in a bowl.
In a large zipper-lock bag or lage bowl, combine the chicken and 2/3 cup of the marinade. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.
Heat the remaining mardinade in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the marinade to a boil. Stir together 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water, then stir that into the marinade. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened (about 1-2 minutes. Keep warm.
One at a time, dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, then dredge in the remaining 1 cup cornstarch, pressing in to coat.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan. In batches, add the chicken and fry until golden brown and cooked through (about 1-2 minutes). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, then discard the excess oil. Serve the chicken immediately, tossed with the marinade and garnished with sesame seeds.
Enjoy!
