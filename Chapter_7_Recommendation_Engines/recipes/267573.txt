Ingredients:
For Cookies:
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
1/2 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
For Frosting:
1 (4 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cubed
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup Stevia In The Raw® Bakers Bag
3/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a medium skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, without stirring, until butter crackles, then foams and browns, about 5 minutes. It should smell nutty, and when butter is swirled brown bits should be visible. Pour butter into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Let cool completely.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, pumpkin spice, and salt. Set aside.
Add brown sugar and stevia to cooled butter and beat until smooth. Beat in vanilla. Beat in eggs one at a time. Beat in pumpkin until smooth. Stir in flour mixture until just combined.
Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto prepared baking sheets, leaving 1 inch between cookies. Bake until lightly browned and barely firm on top, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a rack and cool completely.
While cookies cool, prepare frosting. In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, stevia, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Pulse until very smooth.
Spread frosting over cooled cookies. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.
