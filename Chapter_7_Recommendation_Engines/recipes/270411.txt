Ingredients:
2 cups fish cakes, cut into uniform shapes for threading onto skewers
8 bamboo skewers, or as needed
4 cups anchovy stock
1 cup daikon radish cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 scallions, sliced
1 Korean red chile pepper, thinly sliced
1 small bunch Swiss chard leaves, sliced

Directions:
Thread fish cakes onto bamboo skewers.
Combine fish cake skewers, anchovy stock, radish, garlic, and soy sauce in a small pot and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors come together, about 10 minutes.
Garnish soup with scallions, chile pepper, and chard leaves, which will wilt into the soup. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Fish cake soup. This light, savory soup is briny, spicy, and salty in a way that pairs wonderfully with an ice-cold bottle of soju. The unique spongy texture and deeply satisfying flavor of the fish cakes is a winning combination.
