Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 pounds fresh mushrooms, quartered
1 1/2 pounds fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 cups chicken broth
3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/8 inch thick slices
2 cups Parmesan cheese
2 cups heavy cream
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups half-and-half cream

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over high heat.  Saute mushrooms in butter until liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.  Stir in garlic, thyme, and rosemary, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth, and simmer until liquid evaporates. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Preheat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Butter a 13x9x2 inch baking dish.
Arrange 1/3 of the potatoes in prepared dish, overlapping slightly.  Spread half of the mushroom mixture evenly over the potatoes, and then sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese over mushrooms.  Repeat layering, and then arrange remaining potatoes on top.
In a large bowl, mix together the half and half, heavy cream, 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.  Pour mixture over potatoes.  Cover loosely with foil.
Place baking dish on middle rack in oven.  Bake until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Uncover. Sprinkle remaining cheese over potatoes.  Bake until cheese melts, about 15 minutes longer.

Description: 
Fall mushrooms give this dish a hearty flavor.  Substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and this makes a perfect meal for that vegetarian girlfriend your son is bringing to the holiday dinner.  The rest of the family will love it too.
