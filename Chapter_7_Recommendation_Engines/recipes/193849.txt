Ingredients:
1/2 cup red wine
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup liquid smoke flavoring
1 tablespoon molasses
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (3 pound) beef brisket
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth

Directions:
Whisk together the red wine, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, molasses, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the brisket, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate overnight in the refrigerator.
Remove the brisket from the marinade and shake off excess. Reserve the remaining marinade. Heat a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the brisket until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.
Pour the reserved marinade into the skillet along with the beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the brisket can be pulled apart with a fork, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
