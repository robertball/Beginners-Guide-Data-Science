Ingredients:
3 lbs Ground chuck
2 14oz cans LaRosa's spaghetti sauce
1 14oz can Tomato sauce
2-3 Tbs Buena Vida chili powder (used to be called Frank's)
2 cans Chili beans with sauce
1 tsp Sugar
1 tsp Pepper
1 Tbs White vinegar

Directions:
Cook and drain beef
Add all ingredients to crock pot and mix together.
Cook on low 6-8 hours

Side note: Buena Vida chili powder may be hard to find. Sub as needed. Also, I like to leave some of the grease in the meat.

Description: 
This is a very simple recipe to prepare and cooks while you are away for the day. Cincinnati style is poured over spaghetti noodles and topped with ALOT of shredded cheese. But it's good no matter how you like it.  I am sure there are a million mods you could make. Looking forward to the comments.
