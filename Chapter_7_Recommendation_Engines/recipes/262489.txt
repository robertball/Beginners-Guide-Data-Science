Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic
1 (2 inch) piece ginger, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 butternut squash, peeled and chopped
1 yam, peeled and chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 quart water, or as needed
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, coriander, paprika, and chile flakes. Add butternut squash, yam, carrots, and celery. Add enough water to just cover.
Increase heat and bring soup to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until all vegetables are fork-tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
Fill a blender halfway with soup. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour back into the saucepan. Repeat with remaining soup. Add maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.

Description: 
This is my famous butternut squash soup recipe and it just so happens to be a perfectly vegan main dish! There are lots of warm spices and because the veggies are all cooked slowly until soft, when blended it becomes so creamy, without any cream added! Please enjoy!
