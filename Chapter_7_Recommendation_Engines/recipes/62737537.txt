Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
dash of salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons margarine
1 1/4 cups peanut butter
1 pound semi sweet or dark chocolate candy bar, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x15 inch pan. Sift together the flour and baking powder; set aside.
In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar and vanilla. Beat on high speed of an electric mixer until light and lemon-colored. Beat in the flour mixture. Microwave milk and margarine about 2 minutes, or until it begins to bubble. Stir into batter.
Pour batter into 10x15 inch pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
When cake is cool, plop peanut butter all over and spread evenly to the edges. Refrigerate to set, about 1 hour.
In a microwave safe dish, melt chocolate and spread evenly over peanut butter layer. Refrigerate to allow chocolate to harden.
