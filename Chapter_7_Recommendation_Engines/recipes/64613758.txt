Ingredients:
2 tsp olive oil, or avocado oil
1 large yellow onion, sliced
4 garlic cloves, sliced
6 cups bite size cauliflower florets
4 Tbsps olive, avocado, or melted unrefined coconut oil
2 Tbsps fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
Garnish ideas:
fresh flat-leaf parsley,
chopped fresh chives,
fresh grated Parmigiano cheese, or
fresh lemon zest

Directions:
Heat 2 tsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add onion and garlic; sauté about 5-6 minutes or until nicely browned, stirring often. Remove from heat.
In large glass bowl, toss cauliflower, remaining oil, lemon juice, sea salt, and pepper. Add onion mixture, lightly toss.
Place mixture on a flat sheet pan coated lightly with cooking spray.
Bake at 500° for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally. I like to make sure some edges are cooked nice and crispy.
Sprinkle with your favorite fresh garnish choice from above.
