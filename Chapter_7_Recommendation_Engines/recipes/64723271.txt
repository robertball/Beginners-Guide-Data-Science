Ingredients:
1 can 14-15 ounces, creamed corn
1 can 7-8 ounces whole kernel corn, drained & dried well
1 Tablespoon Sugar
2 Tablespoons Flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup whole milk
1 cup crushed saltine crackers (medium crush)
4  Tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°F.   Grease a 2 quart casserole.
In a small bowl, mix butter with saltines, set aside 2-3 tablespoons of the larger crumbs for the topping.
In another bowl mix creamed corn and whole kernel corn with sugar, flour, and salt.  Mix well, no lumps.
Add eggs and milk. Mix well.  Add in most of the saltine/butter mixture and stir until just combined.
Pour into prepared casserole, top with reserved saltine butter mixture.
Bake at 325°F (no higher) for 50 minutes to an hour.  Pull out when barely set.  Can rest 5-10 minutes before serving, but if it rests longer or over-bakes the butter will start to come out & make it greasy.
