Ingredients:
1 (18 1/4 ounce) box devil's food cake mix
1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4-1/2 tsp. cayenne
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
confectioners' sugar for rolling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°
Stir dry cake mix, cinnamon, cayenne, oil and eggs in a large bowl until dough forms. (you may want to taste the dough to ensure you can taste your cinnamon and it's spicy enough for you or not too spicy)
Dust hands with confectioners' sugar and shape dough into 1" balls.
Roll balls in confectioners' sugar and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets (I love those silpats).
Bake for 8-10 minutes or until center is JUST SET. (seriously, over 10 minutes will only make your cookie drier and/or crunchy...you want them moist and chewy)
6. Remove from pans after a minute or so and cool on wire racks.
7. Enjoy!!
