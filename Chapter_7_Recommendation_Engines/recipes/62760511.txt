Ingredients:
2 cups of sugar
2 tablespoons of cocoa powder
1/2 stick Crisco butter
pinch of salt
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2/3 cup of can milk
1/3 to 1/2 regular milk

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients in a large cook pot. Gradually melt and bring mixture to a boil, stirring continuously. Start with 1/3 cup of regular milk, but add the extra if necessary. The mixture should boil for approximately 3 minutes or until mixture begins to mix together well and thicken. Remove from heat and allow mixture to continue to thicken before adding to cake. Cake should be completely cool before adding icing because it will run. Use icing when it still pours well, but don't wait until it is too thick to pour.
