Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2-3/4 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease two to three baking sheets.
Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in the cardamom, cinnamon, mace or nutmeg, cloves, pepper, and salt until well blended.
Mix in the flour, one cup at a time, until the dough gathers together. With floured hands, pinch off small, 1/2 teaspoon amounts of dough, roll into tiny balls, and place on prepared baking sheets. Alternately, you can roll the dough into 3/8" ropes and use a knife or scissors to cut them into small pieces.
Bake in preheated oven until bottom of cookies are light tan, 10 to 12 minutes.
Cool 15 minutes on baking sheets. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
These tiny ball-shaped cookies are full of spices and the ingredient for which they're named--pepper. Traditionally served at Christmastime, the Danish twist includes the use of white pepper rather than black and mace instead of nutmeg.
