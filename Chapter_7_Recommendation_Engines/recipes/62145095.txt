Ingredients:
1 5 lb bag of potatos (I use russett) peeled cut to 1 inch cubes
3 32 oz Swanson Chicken Broth
1 Small Carton Heavy Cream
2 tbsp Dried Onion Flakes
2 tbsp Dehydrated Minced Garlic
1 package lipton soup mix
2 bunches Leeks Chopped with a few tops as well
2 tbsp Paprika
1 Red (or green) Jalapeno Pepper
Shredded Cheese (when served)
Crumbled Bacon (when served)
Add to taste Cajun Crab Boil (or cajun spice) for Spicy Version

Directions:
Put Potatos, Jalapeno, Dehydrated Garlic and Onions and 2 of the 3 Broths in a pot and boil until the Potatos are tender. Add Green Onions, Soup Mix, Paprika and the last of the Broth and Cream and cook until it is right consistency.
If you like a thicker soup, just use 2 Broths or Add dissolved Corn Starch in cold water to the finished product.
Taste before you add the Cajun Seasoning to avoid over salting.
Add crumbled bacon and shredded cheese when serving.
