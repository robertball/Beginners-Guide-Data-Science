Description: 
This is a quick and easy side to compliment your main dish. It can easily be changed by adding your favorite herbs and spices.  I like to stir it while it's cooking. It has a lovely creamy consistency without added cheese or dairy. There is no added salt due to the boullion. If you prefer low sodium substitute broth or stock.
