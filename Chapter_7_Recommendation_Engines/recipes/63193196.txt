Ingredients:
1 cup of all-purpose flour
1 cup of whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon of baking powder
1 teaspoon of salt
1/4 cup of unsalted butter or Earth Balance; slightly chilled
2/3 cup of water

Directions:
Place flours, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Mix well.
2. Cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. Note: I put the flour mixture into the bowl of a food processor and then cut the butter in by pulsing the mixture a few times.
3. Add water slowly and mix until the dough forms a ball. Note: I slowly added the water into the food processor, as I pulsed the mixture until it formed a nice ball of dough. If the dough is too dry, add 1 tablespoons of water at a time until it forms a ball.
4. Turn onto a floured surface and knead 8 times. Cover with an inverted bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.
5. Cut the dough into 10 individual pieces and roll into balls. Roll out a portion/ball of dough as thin as you can. Invert a 7 inch (18cm) bowl or 8 inch (20 cm) plate on the dough, cut around the edge and repeat until all dough is rolled.
6. Place 1 tortilla on an ungreased frying pan on medium-high heat. Dark spots will begin to appear in 15 to 20 seconds, flip, brown another 15 seconds and set tortilla aside. Continue this process until all of the tortillas are cooked through. Keep hot tortillas warm in a tea towel.
