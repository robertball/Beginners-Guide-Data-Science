Ingredients:
1/2 to 2 pounds bay scallops
4 Tablespoons of butter (1/4 cup)
2/3 cup chopped onions
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Rinse scallops and pat dry with paper towels.
Preheat an outdoor gas grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate.
Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat add onions and garlic, cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in lemon juice and salt. Place scallops in a large bowl, and toss with butter mixture. Let stand for about 2 minutes.
Using a wire grill basket, cook on preheated grill for about 3 to 4 minutes, occasionally tossing the scallops around for even cooking.
Return butter mixture to frying pan, and heat to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and keep warm while scallops cook. Toss with grilled scallops and serve with extra butter and lemon wedge.

Description: 
Growing up in Florida, our family would take our boat out in Tampa Bay and gather scallops. When we returned home, my father would grill them with butter. I think this is the best way to enjoy Bay scallops because grilling really brings out their sweet flavor.
