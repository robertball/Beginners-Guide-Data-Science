Ingredients:
2-3 lbs flank steak
1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce
1/3 cup of oil
1/3 cup of brown sugar
1/2 tsp of garlic powder
1 Tbsp of ginger
10oz (1pkg) Japanese Udon Noodles
6oz Snow Peas
1 cup of broccoli florets
1 Tbsp Mirin (sweet Japanese wine)found in most Asian sections

Directions:
Combine all liquid ingredients, except for the Mirin, in a bowl.  Pierce the flank steak many times with a large fork.  Marinate the steak in the sauce mixture for a minimum of 4 hours.  (Preferably 8hrs to overnight)
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook the noodles according to the directions on the package.  Typically 13-14 minutes for dry noodles.
Drain.
Heat a large saute pan on High.  Sear the marinaded flank steak well on both sides, approximately 2 minutes per side.
Heat the grill to a medium temperature.  Grill flank steak for a minimum of 10 minutes per side, basting with half of the remaining sauce mixture.  Flank steak is best when served medium - medium well.  Medium rare will be too tough to chew.
In the same sauce pan, add the snow peas, brocolli, and remaining sauce mixture, as well as the Mirin.  Saute for about 2 minutes, then add the drained noodles and mix well.
When the steak is done, slice it thinly against the grain.  Place the steak on top of the noodles and veggies in large bowls.
