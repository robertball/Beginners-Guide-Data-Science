Ingredients:
4 cups flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 Tbs yeast
2 cups warm milk
1/2 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together all dry ingredients. Place into a large bowl, and add the warm milk. Mix well, and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour. Once the dough has risen, knead the dough, adding in the butter as you do. Once all the butter is in and the dough is well kneaded, shape small handfulls of the dough into circles, and place on a greased cookie sheet, about 2-3 inches apart from each other. Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes, or until rusks sound hollow when tapped.
