Ingredients:
3 tablespoons margarine (such as Earth BalanceÂ®)
3 basil leaves, finely chopped
2 bunches fresh chives, finely chopped
6 cups vegetable stock, or more if needed
1 onion, cubed
1 tomato, cubed
3 Yukon gold potatoes, cubed
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
2 cups Arborio rice

Directions:
Heat margarine in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir basil and chives until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Heat vegetable stock in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat; keep warm.
Cook and stir onion, tomato, potatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper into chive mixture until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and chickpeas; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir rice into chickpea mixture; cook and stir until rice is coated and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir warm vegetable stock, 1 cup at a time, into rice mixture, waiting until the broth is absorbed before adding next cup. Continue stirring rice and adding vegetable stock until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Rainy day, and my second attempt at risotto is a delectable success to my surprise. 
Little bit of Irish, little bit of the Mediterranean, and a little bit of home makes for a great eat. This recipe is delicious vegan or non-vegan. It's a great base for additions too. Let your imagination run wild and comment back on your additions that you like.
