Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 eggs, divided
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 tablespoon water
Sesame or poppy seeds

Directions:
STIR together yeast and 1/4 cup water in a measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes.
PULSE 1 cup flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor until blended. Add yeast mixture, 1 egg, and milk; pulse until blended. (Pulsing prevents mixture from overheating, which would kill yeast.) Add butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, pulsing until combined. Gradually add enough of remaining flour until dough is no longer sticky. (Dough should be smooth.)
PLACE dough in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top.
COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Punch dough down and divide into fourths; shape each portion into 6 (1-inch) balls. Place on a lightly greased 13-x-9-inch pan.
COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour.
STIR together remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water; brush over rolls, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
BAKE at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Freeze up to 3 months, if desired.
