Ingredients:
16 oz. package frozen cauliflower
1 medium onion, finely chopped
½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic
½ teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger
½ tomato, very finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
½ teaspoon tumeric
½ teaspoon cumin powder
¼ teaspoon chili powder (or more if you like it hot)
½ teaspoon coriander
½ teaspoon salt
Canola oil

Directions:
Place cauliflower in a bowl of hot water and set aside.
Heat large nonstick skillet to medium.  Add 2 T. oil.  When oil is hot, add onion. Increase heat to high until onion begins to brown. Reduce heat to medium and sauté 2 more minutes.
Add tomato, garam masala, tumeric, cumin powder, chili powder, and coriander and salt.  Stir and if mixture is dry, add some water to create a paste. Saute until oil separates from spices.
Drain  cauliflower and add to pan. Mix well so that curry coats the cauliflower.  Add ¾ cup water. Cover and cook until cauliflower is tender but firm.
