Description: 
Small taco sandwich (finger food). I use fat-free cream cheese and sour cream, it's delicious and light! You can add any vegetables or hot peppers that you'd like to the cream cheese mixture, to layer between the tortillas. Vegetables add an extra crunch. Serve with salsa to dip into.
