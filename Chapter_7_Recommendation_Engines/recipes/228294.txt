Luscious Blueberry Pie Perfection! Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups coarse gingersnap cookie crumbs
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water
1/2 cup white sugar
4 cups fresh blueberries, divided
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Move a rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir gingersnap crumbs with light brown sugar and melted butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish.
Bake the crust on the center rack of the preheated oven just until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Baking too long will make the crust hard to cut. Remove the crust and let cool.
Stir cornstarch and water in a saucepan until smoothly mixed; add sugar and 1 1/2 cups blueberries. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the blueberry sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups blueberries and lemon juice.
Pour filling into the gingersnap crust and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 1 hour.
