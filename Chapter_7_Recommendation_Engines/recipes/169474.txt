Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package yellow rice mix
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 teaspoons lime juice
1 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Bring the rice, water, and olive oil to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Mix together the beans, corn, lime juice, and cumin in a large bowl.  Stir in the cooked rice and serve.

Description: 
I put this together with what I had in my pantry.  It makes a lot and is quite inexpensive. Serve with tortilla chips or as a filling for flour tortillas.  It's even better the next day.
