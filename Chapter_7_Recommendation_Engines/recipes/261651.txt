Ingredients:
3 red and/or green apples, cored and sliced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 (9 ounce) package HERSHEY'S Cookies 'N' Creme Baking Pieces
2 teaspoons shortening
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1 tablespoon desired sprinkles

Toss apples with lemon juice. Arrange on a serving platter or shallow serving dish.

Microwave at MEDIUM an additional 10 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, until chips are melted and smooth when stirred (the cookie pieces will not melt).
