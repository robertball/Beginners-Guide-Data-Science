Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels Sprouts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 tsp. salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tsp. lemon zest
juice of half of a lemon (1-2 tablespoons)
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Trim the small woody stem from the bottom of each sprout (the bottom 1/4 inch).  Remove any damaged outer leaves and quarter each sprout lengthwise.
Toss the sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper and spread over a baking sheet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the inside is tender and the outer leaves are slighly browned.  (The actual cooking time depends on the size of your sprouts.)
Transfer to a serving bowl.  Drizzle with lemon zest, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese.
