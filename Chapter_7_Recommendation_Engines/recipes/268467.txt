Ingredients:
1 3/4 pounds russet potatoes
2 ActiFry spoons vegetable oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
1/2 ActiFry spoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1 dash Worcestershire sauce
1 cup cubed part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Scrub potatoes and cut into fries of equal size, each about 1/2-inch (1 cm) thick on all sides.
Rinse fries thoroughly in water; drain well. Use a clean kitchen towel to thoroughly dry fries.
Place fries in the Actifry Pan. Drizzle evenly with half the oil. Cook for 40 minutes, or until the fries are crisp, golden, and cooked through. Season with half of the salt and pepper (adjust to taste).
Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring for 1 minute, or until flour is lightly browned. Whisk in broth and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until thickened. Season with remaining salt and pepper (adjust to taste).
Divide fries between 4 serving plates. Top each serving with an equal amount of cheese. Drizzle with hot gravy to melt cheese.
