Description: 
No Mormon funeral or any get-together for that matter is complete without funeral potatoes and a baked ham! This is only a basic recipe. It's good this way, but it's up to you to make it 'gourmet.' You can use potato chips, tortilla chips, or even corn flakes for the topping - I like to use sour cream and onion chips!
