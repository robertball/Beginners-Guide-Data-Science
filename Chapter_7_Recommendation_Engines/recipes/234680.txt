https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/2120743.jpg
Ingredients:
2  egg whites
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon chia seeds
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon white sugar
½ teaspoon salt
2 cups buttermilk
¼ cup canola oil
2  egg yolks

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer on high until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, chia seeds, baking powder, baking soda, white sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk buttermilk, canola oil, and egg yolks together in a separate bowl; stir into flour mixture until batter is smooth. Gently fold egg whites into batter until just mixed.
Pour about 1/4 cup batter into preheated waffle iron; cook according to manufacturer's instructions until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Cornmeal and chia seeds add a bit of crunch to these waffles. My family can't get enough of these light waffles. We love to make these Christmas morning and top them with crushed strawberries, whipped cream, and ground up candy canes.
