Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups torn spinach leaves
2 tablespoons water
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine spinach and water in a saucepan.  Cover, and cook till spinach is very tender.  Cool slightly.
Place spinach and liquid in blender container.  Add egg and salt.  Cover, and blend till smooth.  Transfer to a bowl.  Add enough flour to make a stiff dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead  for 1 minute.  Roll very thin on a floured surface.  Let rest 20 minutes.  Roll up loosely.  Slice 1/4 inch wide.  Unroll.  Cut into desired lengths.  Spread out on a rack to dry for 2 hours.

Description: 
These green spinach noodles have a very interesting texture and flavor--but they taste better than store-bought noodles because they're fresh.  Use in soups, or serve alone; they are great either way.  This is an easy recipe, and you'll get lots of compliments because you made them yourself.
