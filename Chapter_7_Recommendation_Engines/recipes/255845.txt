Ingredients:
Cake:
2 tablespoons butter
1 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour, sifted
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
Topping:
1 cup cold, strong, brewed coffee
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch baking pan.
Combine butter and unsweetened chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir milk and vanilla extract into chocolate mixture.
Mix flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; stir in chocolate mixture until batter is smooth. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Stir coffee, brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, and cocoa powder together in a bowl; pour over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Cool cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Turn cake onto a serving platter.
