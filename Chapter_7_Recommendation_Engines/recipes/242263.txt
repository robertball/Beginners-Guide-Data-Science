Ingredients:
6 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed
1 cup minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/4 cup minced fresh oregano leaves
3 green onions, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
Kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place the potatoes in the oven, directly on the rack.
Bake for 30 minutes. Poke a couple holes in the top of the potatoes with a fork and return them to the oven for another 15 minutes.
While the potatoes are baking, prepare the chimichurri sauce:
Finely mince the parsley, oregano, green onions and garlic. (If you want to save time, place ingredients in a food processor and pulse until finely minced.) Add the herbs to a 2-cup bowl. Then add the red pepper flakes, olive oil, vinegar and lemon juice. Season to taste with kosher salt. Set aside.
Slice the top third of each potato off and let the potatoes cool until you can handle them comfortably. Scoop the flesh of the potatoes into a medium mixing bowl.
Add 1 cup of the chimichurri sauce to the potatoes. Using a hand mixer, whip the potatoes until creamy and fluffy.
Spoon the chimichurri potato mixture back into the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake them at 400 degrees F for another 10 minutes. Serve them hot with an extra spoonful of the remaining chimichurri sauce.
