Ingredients:
1 TBS olive oil
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken, diced
1 cup diced onion
1 12-oz jar Herdez Mexican Cooking Sauce - Red Guajillo Chile
12-oz water
1 15-oz can corn, drained
1 15-oz can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 15-oz can diced tomatoes (do not drain)
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 cup V-8 juice
6 small corn tortillas, cut into strips
Additional toppings if desired: diced avocado, shredded cheddar cheese, salsa, diced tomato, sour cream, cilantro, hot sauce, etc.

Directions:
1. Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet. Add onions and chicken; saute until onions are tender and chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
2. Place a large soup pot on the stove and add chicken and onion mixture, Herdez Red Guajillo Chile sauce, water, corn, black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken bouillon, and V-8 juice. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer on low for 15-20 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. 10 minutes before soup is ready, lay tortilla strips on a baking sheet and bake in pre-heated oven for 10 minutes, or until nice and crispy.
4. Ladle soup into bowls, add additional toppings if desired, and add a couple tortilla strips.
