Ingredients:
1 circular round queso fresco cheese
1 16 oz container of salsa
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1 jalapeno seeded and diced
Splash of hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot, recommended)

Directions:
Cut circular round of queso fresco in half, creating two thinner circles.
Place in shallow baking dish or microwave safe container. Keep in mind that the cheese needs to marinate, and if you are going to microwave it, use a microwave safe dish.
Cover the cheese entirely with the container of salsa. Make sure to pat it into the cheese, creating almost a salsa "crust". Pour all the residual salsa "juice" into the dish for the cheese to marinate in.
Make sure the cilantro is chopped, and add the jalapeno and cilantro to the dish. Depending on the intensity of flavors you want, you can either pat them into the cheese as well, or just sprinkle throughout for flavor. Finish off by giving the whole dish a couple splashes of hot sauce.
Cover the cheese and let it marinate for a few hours. I'd say two at the least, but let it marinate as long as you possibly can. This allow the queso fresco to absorb all the flavor.
To cook microwave for 3 minutes. The cheese isn't supposed to melt into a "dip". It's supposed to be more like a brie texture. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy!Reheat as needed.

Description: 
On a recent trip to the local Costco, I ended up purchasing a HUGE thing of queso fresco, or Mexican white cheese. Not sure what to do with it, I created this modified dip, that goes perfect with any Mexican themed meal! It's so ridiculously easy, and looks much more refinded that classic chile con queso)
