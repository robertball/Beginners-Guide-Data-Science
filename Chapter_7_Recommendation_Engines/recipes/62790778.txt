Ingredients:
(1) Can Whole Kernel Corn
(1) Can Black Beans
(1) Can Black Eyes Peas
1/3 Jar Banana Pepper Rings, finely chopped
2 slices red onion, finely chopped
(1) Cup Celery, finely chopped
(1) Cup Sugar
(1) Cup Olive Oil
1/2 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar

Directions:
In a sauce pan simmer the Apple Cider Vinegar, Olive Oil and Sugar for 20 minutes to dissolve sugar.  Do NOT boil.  Allow to cool slightly.
Drain and rinse the Corn, Black Eyes Peas and Black Beans.  In a bowl add the Corn, Black Eyed Peas and Black Beans to the chopped Banana Pepper Rings, Onion and Celery.  Pour slightly cooled liquid over the mixture and stir to combine.
Refrigerate no less then 3 hours, over night is best.  You will want to drain some juice, or scoop some of the dip out of the bowl with a slotted type spoon and place in another bowl to serve.
Great with Fritos or Scoop Type Tortilla Chips.
