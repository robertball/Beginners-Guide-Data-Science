Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust
2/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
4 medium apples, peeled and diced into 1/4 inch pieces
For the topping:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter, softened
For the drizzle?
1/2 cup caramel topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a pizza pan with oil.
Place pie crust on the pan and fold under edges to give the pizza a bit of a raised crust.
Combine sugar, flour and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Add peeled, diced apples and toss.
Arrange the apples in a single layer over the pie crust to completely cover it.
To make the topping, combine the flour, brown sugar, oats, and cinnamon in a bowl. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix the butter into the flour until the butter is in pea-sized pieces. Sprinkle over the apples.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes or until apples are tender. Remove from oven and immediately drizzle with caramel topping. Cut into pizza slices.
