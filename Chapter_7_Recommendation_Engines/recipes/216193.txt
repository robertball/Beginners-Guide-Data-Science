Ingredients:
4 skinless pheasant breast halves
3/4 cup white wine
8 ounces dry fettuccine pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
8 mushrooms, sliced
1 cup chopped fresh spinach leaves
1/2 cup white wine
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup pesto sauce
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the pheasant breasts into a baking dish, and pour in 3/4 cup white wine. Bake in the preheated oven until the pheasant is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Once cool, remove the meat from the bones, and cut into bite sized pieces.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the fettuccini, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion until it has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, spinach, and pheasant pieces. Cook until the mushrooms have softened, then pour in 1/2 cup of white wine, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and pesto, and remove from the heat. Place the fettuccini in a serving bowl, pour the pheasant sauce over top, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
I receive pheasant from my father, who is a hunter, and I'm always trying to think of new ways to cook it up.  This was a really nice surprise and easy too.  The pheasant could easily be substituted with chicken.
