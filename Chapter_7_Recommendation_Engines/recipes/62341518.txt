1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sweat eggplant by sprinkling with salt and place in colander for 20 mins, then rinse and pat dry with paper towels.
Dip eggplant slices in egg, then in bread crumbs.  Place in a single layer on a baking sheet.  Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes on each side.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish spread spaghetti sauce to cover the bottom.  Place a layer of eggplant slices in the sauce.  Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with the cheeses.  Sprinkle basil on top.
