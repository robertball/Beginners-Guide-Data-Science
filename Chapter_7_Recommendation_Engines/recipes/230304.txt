Ingredients:
1/2 cup quinoa
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup skim milk
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup cashews
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup fresh blackberries
2 tablespoons creme fraiche (optional)

Directions:
Bring quinoa, water, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla extract to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and has absorbed the water, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.
Mix cherries, cashews, and honey into the quinoa mixture; top with blackberries and creme fraiche.

Description: 
Delicious, filling, and comforting on a cold morning. It's really flexible, so substitute in your favorite nuts and fruit. Cashews and cherries are just my personal favorite.
