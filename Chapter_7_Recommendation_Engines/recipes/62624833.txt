1 lb egg noodles (fine)
1/2 cup celery, diced

1 large can mushrooms

Cook celery, onion, peppers, and mushrooms in broth until partially cooked.
Salt, then add noodles and cook until tender.  Fold in chicken.
Alternate chicken mixture and cheese in layers in greased casserole pan.

Note:  This recipe doesn't say what size pan to use.  But if I remember correctly, Mom used something bigger than a 9x13 pan... maybe 10x15 or so
