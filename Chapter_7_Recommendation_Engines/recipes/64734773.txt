Ingredients:
1 T olive oil
1 link mild Italian sausage, about 6 ounces. Casing removed.
1 pound ground sirloin
1 cup finely chopped onion
1 T finely chopped garlic
32 ounces chicken broth, low sodium
24 ounces marinara sauce
8 Lasagna noodles, broken into smaller pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tsp pepper
Freshly ground Parmesan cheese, about 1 tsp per bowl

Directions:
Add the sausage and ground beef to the pot and cook using the saute function. Cook until brown, then drain and set aside.
Add the olive oil to the pot and swirl to insure the bottom of the pot is evenly coated. Add the onions and cook until just soft, do not brown, add the garlic and cook until just fragrant.
Deglaze the pan with the chicken broth.
Add the marinara sauce, meat mixture and
salt and pepper.
Stir to combine.
Add the noodles making sure that they are completely submerged.
Place the lid on the pot and close the vent.
Press pressure and adjust time to 3 minutes.
Use quick-release method.
Taste and adjust the salt.
Ladle into bowls and top with Parmesan cheese.
See cooks notes.
Note: I use the Instant Pot® Marinara sauce recipe from this site, it has lots of flavour.
Please don't leave out the cheese, it's what makes the soup tasty.
This is best served fresh, the noodles will absorb the liquid in the soup if stored.

Description: 
Ever wondered what to do with that last little bit of Marinara Sauce or those broken Lasagna noodles? Well, I've go you covered! This soup has all of the flavours of lasagna without all of the hours in the kitchen. I've made with fairly simple ingredients but feel free to add ground fennel seeds or herbs.
