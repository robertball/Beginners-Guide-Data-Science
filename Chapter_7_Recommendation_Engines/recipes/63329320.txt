Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
1-2 teaspoons salt
1/2 tsp.  Instant Yeast
1 1/2 cups warm water

Directions:
Combine and mix all dry ingredients.
Add water and mix until all of the flour is mixed in. The dough should be wet and sticky.
Cover and let raise for at least 12 hours. This dough can be raised in or out of the frigerator. It can be left in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours, but 12 to 18 hours will work fine.
After at least 12 hours, pour the dough onto a floured surface, and sprinkle with flour.
Fold all 4 sides like an envelope. The dough is very wet. So a bench scraper is needed for this step.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes.
Then fold a couple more times to make a basic bread shape. Then transfer the dough to a 12 x 18 piece of parchment paper.
Cover with a non-terry towel or oiled plastic wrap, and let raise for 2 hours.
While the dough is raising, preheat the oven to 450 degrees with the baking pan and lid inside. I have used an oval 11" x 8 1/2" corning casserole dish that works very well.
After the 2 hour raise, carefully place the parchment paper with the bread on it into the hot baking pan.
Moisten with water and sprinkle with bread topping if desired.
Bake for 30 minutes, and then remove the cover.
Bake for additional 15 minutes to finish baking and brown.
Internal temperature should be about 200 degrees when done
Remove from oven and cool on a cooling rack.
The bread should be completely cool before slicing.
