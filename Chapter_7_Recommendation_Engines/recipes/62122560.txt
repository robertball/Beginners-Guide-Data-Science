Ingredients:
3 1/2 Cups Pomegranate Juice
1 box pectin (1.75 oz)
5 cups sugar
1 tablespoon butter (if needed)
8 8oz Sterile Jars with the rubber lids for sealing

Directions:
Fill a large pot for the jars about 3/4 full of water as you will need to process your jars in this at the very end. Heat the water to boiling.
Fill a smaller pot with water and bring to a boil, sterilize the lids in this pot by boiling them for 5 minutes.  This will also soften the rubber threading on the lids and ensure a tight seal.
Pour all the juice into another large pot; stir in the pectin.
On high heat, bring the juice/pectin mixture to a rolling boil, stirring constantly.
Add 1 tablespoon butter to reduce foaming if desired.
Stir in sugar and return to a rolling boil and boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Remove the mixture from heat and skim off any foam with a metal ladle.
Pour immediately into clean, sterile jars to about 1/8 from the top or just under the threading.
Wipe the rims clean and cover with lids.
Screw the bands on and gently put jars into boiling water for about 5 minutes to ensure proper sealing and sterilization.
Remove the jars from the water and cool completely.
Check your seals to ensure proper sealing.  If the dome lid never sinks, you would need to refrigerate your jelly for it to keep.
