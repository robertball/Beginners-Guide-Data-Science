Mark Bittman's Carnitas Braised in Witbier Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 large onion, quartered
5 garlic cloves, lightly crushed
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 cinnamon stick
1 ancho or other mild dried chili
Salt and black pepper
2 12-ounce bottles Allagash white, or another beer in the Belgian witbier (wheat beer) style, like Hoegaarden
Neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, if needed
Lime wedges for serving

Directions:
Put the pork, onion, garlic, bay leaves, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, chili and some salt and pepper in a large pot with a lid or a Dutch oven. Add the beer and water if needed to cover. Turn the heat to high, bring to a boil and skim any foam that comes to the surface. Partly cover and adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles steadily. Cook until the meat is quite tender, about 1 hour, then cool.
Remove the bay leaves, spices and chili with a slotted spoon and discard. Break or roughly chop the meat into bite-size pieces, return to the pan and cook uncovered until all the liquid has evaporated. Continue to cook the meat in the remaining fat until it’s crisped and browned; add a little oil if it sticks or becomes dry. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature with the lime wedges, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

Description: 
I had made carnitas — that irresistible Mexican pork shoulder braised for hours with spices, then fried in its own fat until crisp — with beer as the braising liquid, but I wanted further guidance.
