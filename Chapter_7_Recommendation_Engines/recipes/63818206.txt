8 ounces seitan, cubed
8 ounces smoked vegan sausage cut into 2-inch slices
1/2 large onion, chopped
1/2 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped (or bok choy)
28 ounces diced tomatoes with juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup Vegetable Broth
1 tablespoon miso paste
1/2 tablespoon Cajun or Creole spice mix
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup rice, uncooked
Parsley, optional

Directions:
Add a bit of olive oil to the bottom of a 4-quart crock. Add all ingredients, except rice and parsley. Cook on low for 4 hours. Add rice and cook on high for 30 minutes more. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.
Rice can be cooked separately for a firmer texture
