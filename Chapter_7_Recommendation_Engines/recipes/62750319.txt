Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (cut in small cubes)
salt and pepper to taste
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
2 (10 ounce) cans green chile enchilada sauce
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 onion chopped
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium, non-stick skillet over medium heat, cook chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear.  Remove chicken and add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan.  Over medium heat, with tongs, place one tortilla in oil for 3 to 5 seconds per side to soften, repeat on all tortillas.
Pour 1/2 of 1 can of the enchilada sauce in the bottom of a bread loaf pan, then overlap 3 tortillas in a single layer. Top with 1/3 of the other can enchilada sauce, 1/3 chicken, 1/4 cheese, and 1/3 onion. Repeat 2 more times starting with tortillas. You should have 3 tortillas left to layer on top. Pour the other 1/2 of first can enchilada sauce on top of tortillas and sprinkle with last 1/4 cheese.
Cover, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool slightly before serving.
