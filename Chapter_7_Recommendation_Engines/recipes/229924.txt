Ingredients:
3 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced
3/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
2 cups fresh blueberries
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup cold butter

Directions:
Place apples in a large bowl and toss with 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Cover the bowl and place in refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat softened butter and 3/4 cup white sugar together in a large bowl until creamy; beat in egg.
Mix 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture, alternating with milk, until fully incorporated. Fold in blueberries.
Arrange apples in a single layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour blueberry batter over apples.
Mix 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; cut in cold butter until mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle crumb topping over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the buckle comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
