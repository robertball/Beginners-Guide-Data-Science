Description: 
For those of you who love cajun seasonings such as Tony Chachere's or Zatarain's, here is an easy great all round seasoning blend that I use on all my beef, poultry, & fish.  With this blend, there is virtually no need for any additional seasonings and saves a lot of time!  You can play with the amounts of pepper to achieve the perfect amount of spiciness that suits your family's needs.
