Ingredients:
Cookie Dough:
1 stick butter (or 1/4 C. butter and 1/4 C. shortening)
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
2 large eggs
2 cups (9 oz) MixoFlour Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Filling:
1  cup chopped dates
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
To Make The Cookie Dough: Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time until smooth. Add the flour mixture and mix until a rough dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
To Make The Filling: Combine all the ingredients in a medium-size sauce pan. Cook on low heat and stir occasionally until thickened, about 10 to 15 minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
To Make the cookie: Preheat oven to 400Â°F
Lightly flour a work surface and a rolling pin. Roll the dough gently until about 1?8 inch thick, turning the dough while rolling to prevent sticking. Cut the dough with a circular cookie cutter. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling on the cut out dough and fold over.  Crimp the edges with a fork.
Space the cookie on a lightly greased cookie sheet with 1 inch space in between. Bake about 9 minutes until the cookies are light brown. Cool on the cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
