Ingredients:
1 (8 pound) ham
20 cloves garlic, peeled
10 whole cloves
1 (6 ounce) can pineapple juice
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons dry mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Rinse ham and pat dry with paper towels; arrange ham cut-side down in a shallow roasting pan.
Make 20 incisions with the point of a knife all over the ham; stuff one garlic clove into each incision.
Press whole cloves into the ham.
Cover ham with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
While ham is baking, mix pineapple juice, brown sugar, dry mustard, and ginger in a bowl.
Remove foil from ham. Pour pineapple juice glaze over ham.
Return ham to oven uncovered and continue baking until glaze thickens, about 45 minutes more. Baste ham every 15 minutes.
Allow ham to rest 5 to 10 minutes. Remove garlic and whole cloves before slicing.
