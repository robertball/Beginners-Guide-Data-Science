Ingredients:
3 eggs, separated
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup REESE'S® Peanut Butter Chips
1 cup miniature marshmallows
1/4 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream, chilled
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
2 tablespoons water
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 F.  Line 15-1/2x10-1/2x1-inch jelly-roll pan with foil; generously grease foil.
Beat egg yolks in large bowl on high speed of mixer 3 minutes.  Gradually add 1/2 cup granulated sugar; continue beating 2 minutes.  Stir together flour, cocoa, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, baking soda and salt; add alternately with water and vanilla to egg yolk mixture, beating on low speed just until smooth.
Beat egg whites in small bowl until foamy.  Add 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and beat until stiff peaks form; carefully fold into chocolate mixture.  Spread batter evenly into prepared pan.
Bake 15 to 18 minutes or until top springs back when touched lightly.  Invert on towel sprinkled with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar; carefully remove foil.  Immediately roll cake and towel together from narrow end; place on wire rack to cool.  Prepare Peanut Butter Whipped Cream Filling.  Unroll cake; spread with filling; reroll cake.  Drizzle with Chocolate Glaze.  Refrigerate 1 hour or longer before serving.  Garnish with whipped cream.  Refrigerate leftover cake.  8 to 10 servings.
Peanut Butter Whipped Cream Filling:  Place peanut butter chips, marshmallows and milk in medium microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 1 minute; stir.  Microwave at High 30 seconds or until mixture is smooth when stirred.  Cool to room temperature.  Beat whipping cream in another medium bowl until stiff; fold in peanut butter mixture and vanilla.  About 2 cups filling.
Chocolate Glaze:  Melt butter in small saucepan over low heat; add cocoa and water, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens.  Do Not Boil.  Remove from heat; cool slightly.  Gradually add powdered sugar and vanilla, beating with whisk until smooth and slightly thickened.   About 2/3 cup glaze.
