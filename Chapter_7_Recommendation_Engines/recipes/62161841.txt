Ingredients:
2 ripe mangoes, peeled and chopped
4 ripe apricots, peeled and chopped
1 1/2 cups rice wine vinegar
1/2 cup cane or turbinado sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon fresh-squeezed lime juice
1 tablespoon ginger root, diced

Directions:
In a small saucepan, heat the vinegar and sugar over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add the mango, ginger and apricot. Continue to stir over medium heat until the mixture is soft and the fruit begins to break down.
Transfer to a food processor or blender and add the lime juice and honey.
Puree until a smooth texture is formed. The consistency will be like a fruit smoothie.
If a runnier texture is desired, add more honey or some water to the mixture.
