Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups warmed pineapple juice
2 teaspoons yeast
2 teaspoons SplendaÂ®(2 packets)
1 egg
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract
1/4 teaspoon banana extract
3 cups bread flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Pour warmed up pineapple juice in a large mixing bowl & sprinkle with yeast. Allow to rest 5 minutes. Mix in the Splenda, egg, butter, salt, & coconut extract. Stir in the bread flour a cup at a time until it's all mixed in and firms a soft dough. Cover bowl and set in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down the dough, then recover and let rise again.
Put dough in a greased 9" deep-dish pie pan. Cover and let dough rise until doubled in size.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This bread has the flavor of banana bread with the texture of a soft yeast bread. Make a peanutbutter sandwich with it, fry it in a frying pan, and you have a healthier version of Elvis' favorite sandwich.
