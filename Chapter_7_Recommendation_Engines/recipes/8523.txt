Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
¾ pound yellow squash, sliced
¾ pound zucchinis, sliced
1  medium tomato - peeled, seeded and chopped

Directions:
In a large nonstick skillet, melt butter in the oil over medium high heat. Season chicken with half of the salt and half of the pepper, and add it to skillet.   Cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.  Transfer to large plate or platter, and cover to keep warm.
Pour off fat from skillet, and add squash, zucchini, and tomato.  Season with  remaining salt and pepper.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat until squash is slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat, and return chicken to skillet.  Cover partially.  Cook until squash is soft, and chicken is white throughout but still juicy, about 5 minutes longer.
Transfer chicken to platter, and cover with foil to keep warm.  Raise heat to high.  Cook vegetable mixture, stirring often, until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Arrange vegetables around chicken, and serve.
