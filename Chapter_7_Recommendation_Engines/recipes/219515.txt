Ingredients:
12 chicken wings
1 (16 ounce) jar PaceÂ® Picante Sauce
1/3 cup orange marmalade
2 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon sesame seed, toasted

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut off the chicken wing tips and discard. Cut the chicken wings in half at the joint.
Heat 1 1/2 cups picante sauce, marmalade and mustard in a 2-quart saucepan over medium heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 40 minutes or until the mixture is reduced to 3/4 cup, stirring occasionally.
Place the chicken into a large bowl. Add the remaining picante sauce and toss to coat. Place the chicken onto the baking sheet.
Bake for 40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through, turning the chicken over once halfway through the bake time. Baste the chicken with the picante-mustard mixture during the last 10 minutes of the bake time. Sprinkle with the sesame seed, if desired.
