Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds ground beef, pork and veal mix
3 cups Prego® Flavored with Meat Italian Sauce
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 (10 ounce) packages Pepperidge Farm® Garlic Bread
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F for the bread.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion is tender.  Remove the onion and garlic from the skillet.
Heat the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the beef, pork and veal and cook until it's well browned, stirring often to break up meat.  Pour off any fat.
Return the onion and garlic to the skillet.  Stir in the sauce and red pepper.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 20 minutes or until the meat mixture is cooked through.
Meanwhile, bake the bread according to the package directions.
Cut each bread loaf into thirds.  Divide the meat mixture among the 6 bottom bread pieces.  Top each with 1/4 cup cheese and the remaining bread pieces.
