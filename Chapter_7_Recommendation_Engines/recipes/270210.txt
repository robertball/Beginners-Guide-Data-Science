Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped dark chocolate
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/3 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup water
Frosting:
2 cups shortening
1/2 cup half-and-half
5 cups confectioners' sugar
8 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a deep 10-inch round cake pan.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes. Let cool.
Combine sugar and butter in a medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy and well combined. Mix in cooled chocolate. Beat in eggs and egg yolks, one at a time. Mix in 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sour cream, and vanilla extract until smooth.
Sift flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda together in a different bowl. Add flour mixture to batter in 3 additions, mixing well after each addition. Beat in water. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 19 minutes. Immediately invert onto a cooling rack and let cool.
Meanwhile, whip shortening with an electric mixer until creamy, about 5 minutes. Beat in cream until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add confectioners' sugar; beat on high speed until frosting is light and fluffy, 7 to 10 minutes.
Spread frosting over the top and sides of the cooled cake. Cut 4 cookies into quarters using a sharp knife. Arrange quartered cookies around the top edge of the cake. Crush remaining 4 cookies; press crumbs against the sides of the cake.

Description: 
I love this chocolate cake recipe because it looks like a fancy-restaurant-style cake and tastes like it too! The Oreo® frosting is really fluffy and the best of my icing recipes.
