Ingredients:
4 large red bell peppers (about 2 #)
salt to taste
1/2 c. olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Line a roasting pan with enough foil to fold over the top later. Place the peppers in the pan, and roast, turning the peppers about every 10 minutes. Roast until the peppers collapse, about 40 minutes.
Remove from the oven, fold the foil over the peppers and allow them to cool.
Working over a bowl to catch the peppers' liquid, remove and discard the core, skin and seeds.
Place the pepper pulp in a food processor with about 2 tablespoons of the reserved liquid. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, and turn on the machine; drizzle the oil in through the feed tube. Stop the machine, taste and add additional salt or olive oil, if necessary. Store, well covered, in the refrigerator for several days, or in the freezer for up to a month.
Yield: 2 cups (about 16 servings).
