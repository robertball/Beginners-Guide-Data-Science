Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 stalks celery, cut into 4-inch pieces
2 carrots, cut into large chunks
1 potato, cut into large chunks
1 onion, cut into 8 wedges
2 large outer leaves romaine lettuce
1/2 cup gluten-free beer
2 shallots, halved
1 fennel bulb, outer layers only
1/2 green bell pepper
1/8 apple
1/4 bunch flat-leaf parsley
10 whole black peppercorns
1 wedge lemon
1 (1 inch) piece ginger
2 tablespoons tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
1 tablespoon vegan Worcestershire sauce (optional)
2 cloves garlic
1 bay leaf
8 cups water

Directions:
Coat the bottom of a slow cooker crock with olive oil. Put celery, carrots, potato, onion, lettuce, beer, shallots, fennel, bell pepper, apple, parsley, peppercorns, lemon, ginger, tamari, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and bay leaf into the slow cooker crock. Pour water over the ingredients.
Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours, or on High for 4 hours.
Remove and discard all solid chunks from the liquid using a slotted spoon.
Line a colander with cheesecloth and set over a large pot; strain broth through the cheesecloth.

Description: 
Vegetable stock for all your needs without the MSG and chemicals in industrial versions. This helps use up whatever veggies and fruit you might have around. Nothing goes to waste. Add any veggies you might have left over. I use the end pieces of green beans and whatever 'unwanted' outer parts of vegetables I get from cooking and keep them in a bag in the fridge until the next time I make stock. Even the peels of sweet potatoes and turnips make for good stock.  Don't throw out anything.
