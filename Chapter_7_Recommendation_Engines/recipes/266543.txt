Ingredients:
Crepes:
1 1/2 cups milk
3 egg yolks
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
cooking spray
5 tablespoons melted butter
Fruit:
1 pound strawberries
2 bananas, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 peaches, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 kiwifruits, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
skewers

Directions:
Mix milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Stir in flour, sugar, and salt until well blended.
Heat a crepe pan over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into the pan and tip the spread batter to the edges. Cook until bubbles form on the top and edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned and edges are golden, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.
Let crepes cool. Cut lengthwise into strips 1 to 2 inches wide. Wrap strawberries, bananas, peaches, and kiwi in the crepe strips and thread wrapped fruits onto skewers.

Description: 
This is a fun sweet crepe recipe which is easy enough for the entire family to get creative with. I picked specific fruit for this recipe, but any fruit that fits on a kebab is an option. Kids love this. You can drizzle strawberry and/or chocolate syrup or sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the finished product. Top with whipped cream if desired.
