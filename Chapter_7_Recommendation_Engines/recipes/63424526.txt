Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
3/4 cup butter
1 cup red raspberry jam, thick

Directions:
Sift all purpose flour. Measure baking powder and  salt. Mix these dry ingredients and sift.
Add brown sugar and rolled oats to dry ingredients . Cut in butter. Reserve 1 cup of oat mixture.
Press remaining oat mixture into a pan (9" square glass). Spread with red raspberry jam. Top with reserved crumb mixture. (Often I will make more crumb mixture to top jam with........Not like it is not fattening enough already!)
Bake at 350F for 25 minutes.
Cut cooled cookies into large bars and serve as dessert.
