Ingredients:
1/4 c canola oil
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 shallots, finely chopped
dried whole or crushed red chilies, ground to make 3 tbs powder (or you can use cayenne pepper)
1/2 to 1 tsp shrimp paste, OR 1 extra tbs fish sauce
2 tbs fish sauce
2-3 tbs brown sugar, or more to taste
1/2 to 1 tsp tamarind paste
1 1/2 tbs lime juice
2 tbs water

Directions:
Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add the chopped shallots and garlic, frying until they turn a very light golden brown and slightly crispy (2-3 mins).  Don't overcook the garlic or it will turn bitter.
Remove garlic and shallots with a slotte spoon from the oil and set in a bowl to cool.  Leave remaining oil in pan.
Using food processor, combine the chili with the shrimp paste, fish sauce, sugar, tamarind, lime and water.  Also add the fried garlic and shallots.
Process all together to form a thick paste.  Return this paste to your frying pan and stir it into the oil over low heat, gently simmering until you get a fairly even consistency.  Adjust the consistency by adding a little more water if you find it too thick, or more oil if you prefer a shinier sauce.
Adjust the taste, adding more fish sauce if you'd like it saltier, or more sugar if you'd like it sweeter (I usually end up adding another 1/2 tbs of fish sauce and another tbs of brown sugar)
Store in a covered jar for months in the refrigerator.  Can be used in Thai soups or as a flavor booster in stir fries.
