Ingredients:
8 medium bell peppers (any colour or a mix)
Stuffing:
1 1/2 cups roasted buckwheat kasha
2 1/2 cups water
1 lb. cottage cheese
1/3 cup walnut pieces
2 eggs, slightly beaten
6 green onions, thinly sliced
2 tbsp. fresh dill, minced
1 tsp. caraway seed
1/2 tsp. hot paprika (optional)
salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
Sauce:
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups tomato puree or passata
1 cup dry red wine
1 tbsp. sweet paprika
1 tsp. salt

Directions:
1.  Bring water to boiling in large saucepan.  Add kasha, reduce heat to a simmer and cook for about 20 miunutes, until all water is absorbed.  Remove from heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.
2.  While kasha is cooking, split peppers lengthwide and remove seeds and white portions but keep stem halves on.  Steam peppers over boiling water for 10 minutes.  Drain and arrange in one or two baking dishes and add water to a level of about 1/2 inch.
3.  Preheat oven to 350 F.
4.  Combine stuffing ingredients. Spoon stuffing into each pepper half.  Cover baking dishes with aluminum foil and place in oven.   Bake for 45 minutes.
5.  While peppers are baking, make sauce:  saute onion in heated oil until tender, about five minutes.  Add other sauce ingredients and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium low and cook for at least 30 miunutes.
6.  Open oven door and remove foil from baking dishes.  Spoon sauce over each pepper half and bake for another 15 minutes.
