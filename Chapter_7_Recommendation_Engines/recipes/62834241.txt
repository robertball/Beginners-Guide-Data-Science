Ingredients:
2/3 cup warm water
1 cup bread flour
1 tsp. SAF or bread machine yeast
7/8 cup warm water
1 1/2 tsp. sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons soft butter or margarine
3 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon gluten (optional)
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp SAF or bread machine yeast

Directions:
Mix the 2/3 cup water, 1 cup flour, and 1 tsp yeast in the bread machine and put on the dough setting. allow to mix well and turn the machine off. Let this sit for 4 hours in at room temperature. When this is done you will see a spongelike yeasty smelling mixture. Add the other ingredients and run on the dough setting if you want to shape your own bread. (I do this because I like making this into dinner rolls) or the White bread setting to bake a loaf in the bread machine.
