Ingredients:
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoons finely chopped green onion
1 pound lump crabmeat, drained and picked over
3 tablespoons milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste
11 saltine crackers, crushed
1 teaspoon baking powder
4 wedges lemon
olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Combine egg, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, seafood seasoning, and hot pepper sauce in a small mixing bowl. Stir in green onion and set aside.
Place crab meat in a medium bowl and break up with a fork. Add milk, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Add crushed saltines and baking powder and toss lightly to combine. Add to the egg mixture, stirring gently and being careful not to break apart the crab lumps.
Scoop crab with a 1/3-cup measure and form into 8 patties. Place patties on a plate, cover, and refrigerate until firm, 1 to 8 hours.
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spray crab cakes on both sides with cooking spray and place them in the air fryer basket.
Cook for 5 minutes, then gently turn the cakes over, and cook until crispy brown, about 5 minutes longer.

Description: 
Air frying crab cakes means less mess and less cleanup, but at no sacrifice to taste. They're flavorful, crisp, and lighter than if cooked with oil in a skillet. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce, aioli, or tartar sauce, as well as fresh lemon wedges.
