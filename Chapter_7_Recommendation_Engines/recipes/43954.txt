Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/4 cup bacon drippings
3 ounces crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place green beans in a saucepan with one inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Remove from heat, drain, and set aside.
Heat the bacon drippings in a large skillet over medium heat. Add green beans, and toss to coat. Saute until the beans are heated through. Sprinkle with nuts and crumbled blue cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
My sister-in-law gave me this great, simple recipe.  Green beans are sauteed in bacon fat, then tossed with toasted nuts and crumbled blue cheese.  Very rich and quite fattening, but great for holidays!
