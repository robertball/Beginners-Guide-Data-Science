Description: 
I do not know where my mother got this recipe, but the first time my mother made this recipe she refused to tell us the ingredients. Knowing how picky we were at the time, it was a good thing she did. I now make this recipe and add some green beans near the end. The sauce results in juicy chicken that is just spicy enough.
