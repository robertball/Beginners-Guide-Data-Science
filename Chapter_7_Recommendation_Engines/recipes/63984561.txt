Ingredients:
1/2 cup Vegan butter
2 cups self-rising flour
2 cups vegan white sugar
2 cups Plant soy or coconut milk
3 1/2 cups blackberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Once oven temperature is reached melt butter in a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl stir together the flour, sugar and milk; batter will be slightly lumpy. Pour mixture on top of melted butter in baking pan. Do not mix butter and mixture together.
Drop blackberries into batter; if more crust is desired add less blackberries. Bake in preheated oven for one hour or until golden brown.
