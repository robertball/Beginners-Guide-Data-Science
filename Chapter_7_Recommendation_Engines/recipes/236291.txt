Description: 
I created this coffee drink out of a craving for a little kick to my coffee. Based on my love of hot chai, I began to feel that North Americans have a distinct lack of health-giving herbs and spices in our native cuisine. Hopefully a delicious hot cup of Viennexican can assist.

 Thinking of the spiciness of Viennese coffees and of the chocolate and fruit flavors of South American beverages, I believe the combination makes a beautiful result for the taste buds and the system as a whole!
