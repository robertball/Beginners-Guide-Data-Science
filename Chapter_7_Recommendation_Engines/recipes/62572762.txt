Ingredients:
Pastry ingredients for a 10-inch pie shell

1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup shortening
6 Tablespoons cold water with ice cubes added
Pastry Alternative
Purchase pre-made 10-inch pie crust
Filling ingredients
3-¼ pounds sweet potatoes (about 5 potatoes)
½ cup Splenda brown sugar blend
¼ cup stick butter or margarine, at room temperature
1 can (14 oz.) sweetened fat-free condensed milk
1 large egg
1 Tablespoon unsweetened pineapple juice
2/3 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 teaspoon vanilla extract
¼ + 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Filling substitutions
2/3 teaspoon Butavan flavoring emulsion instead of vanilla extract
½ cup light brown sugar instead of Splenda brown sugar blend
Optional filling ingredient
2/3 teaspoon Cake & Cookie bakery emulsion ("a light, nutty taste accented with undertones of citrus and rich vanilla")
3-½ ounces sweetened flake coconut
Topping ingredients
¼ cup stick butter or margarine, refrigerated
½ cup light brown sugar (Splenda brown sugar blend does not work well in the topping)

Directions:
Pastry directions
Sift flour and salt together
Cut in shortening with pastry blender
Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon water over part of mixture, toss with fork, and push to  the side
Repeat step, above, until all of the mixture is moistened
Form into a ball
Flatten on lightly-floured surface by pressing with edge of hand 3 times in each direction
Roll from center to edge until 1/8 inch thick
Filling directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Rinse sweet potatoes in cold water, then submerge and soak.
Perforate each potato 3 times with regular fork
Tightly wrap each potato, dripping wet, in aluminum foil.
Bake potatoes at 350 degrees until potatoes are "squishy" through the foil (about 90 minutes).
Remove sweet potatoes. Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees. Score potatoes with knife lengthwise, then pull off peel.
Using electric mixer, blend together the sweet potatoes, brown sugar, butter, condensed milk, egg, pineapple juice, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and optional filling ingredients (if using)
Pour filling into pie shell, bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes
Topping directions
In a 1-½ quart bowl, stir together brown sugar, self-rising flour and pecans. Cut in cold butter.
After pie has baked 15 minutes at 425 degrees, crumble on top of pie. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Bake until a knife stuck into center comes out clean (about 45 more minutes)
Serving directions
Chill before serving
