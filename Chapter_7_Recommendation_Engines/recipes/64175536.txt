Ingredients:
5 1/2	cups all-purpose flour
1	teaspoon cream of tartar
1	teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2	cups (1 pound) butter, room temperature
2	cups sugar
1	teaspoon vanilla extract
2	large eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line  a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl stir together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.
In the large bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter and sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs, one at a time beating well after each addition.
With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture until just combined.
Divide the dough in quarters and refrigerate 3 of the quarters. Lightly flour a work surface and working with one quarter of the dough at a time, roll out to a scant 1/4-inch thickness. Using cookie cutters, cut out desired shapes. Place on baking sheet and bake until set and starting to color on the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool 5 minutes on baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
