1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Prepare crumb crust by combining cracker or wafer crumbs, butter or margarine, and 2 tablespoons sugar.  Press mixture into bottom and 2 inches up sides of a 9 inch springform pan.  Refrigerate.
Melt chocolate chips in top of a double boiler over hot water.  Set aside.
Beat cream cheese and 1 cup sugar in a large mixing bowl until smooth and creamy.  Blend in eggs.  Gradually pour in chocolate mixture beating on low speed until well-blended.  Add 1/2 cup sour cream, flour, vanilla.  Blend until smooth.  Pour into prepared crust.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 - 60 minutes or until filling is firm.  Turn oven off.  Cool cheesecake 1 hour without opening door.  Cool completely.  Chill several hours or over night.  Garnish just before serving with sweetened sour cream made by combining 1 tablespoon sugar with 1/2 cup sour cream.
