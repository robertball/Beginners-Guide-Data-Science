Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) boneless beef sirloin steak, 1/2 inch thick
1/2 cup GOOD SEASONS Classic Balsamic Vinaigrette with Extra Virgin Olive Oil Dressing
1 large red pepper, cut into 2-inch-wide strips
1/2 pound fresh asparagus spears, cleaned
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (5 ounce) bag torn mixed salad greens
1/4 cup ATHENOS Crumbled Blue Cheese

Directions:
Place steak and 1/4 cup of the dressing in large resealable plastic bag; seal bag. Turn bag over several times to evenly coat steak with dressing. Refrigerate 30 minutes to marinate.
Preheat grill to medium heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard bag and marinade. Grill steak 5 to 10 minutes on each side for medium doneness (160 degrees F). Meanwhile, grill peppers and asparagus alongside the steak 5 to 7 minutes or until crisp-tender, turning occasionally and brushing with the olive oil. Remove vegetables from grill; cut crosswise in half. Set aside. Remove steak from grill; cut across the grain into thin slices.
Place greens in large bowl. Add peppers, asparagus and remaining 1/4 cup dressing; toss to coat. Place on serving platter. Top with the steak slices; sprinkle with cheese.
