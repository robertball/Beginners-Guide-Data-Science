Description: 
Don't knock it till you've tried it. This rich, delicious, and kicky hot chocolate might make you abandon your traditional ties. No marshmallows needed; this is for grown-ups. Everything in this recipe can be altered to suit your taste, however I recommend following the recipe to the letter the first time you try.
