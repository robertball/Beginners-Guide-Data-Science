Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
2 tablespoons quick-cooking grits
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/3 cup white sugar, or to taste
1/2 sleeve buttery round crackers, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place butter into a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Pour melted butter into a small microwave-safe casserole dish and mix grits, pineapple, and Cheddar cheese into melted butter.
Microwave grits mixture on full power until mixture boils and grits are tender, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle top with sugar and cracker crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until crumbs are lightly toasted, 15 to 20 minutes.
