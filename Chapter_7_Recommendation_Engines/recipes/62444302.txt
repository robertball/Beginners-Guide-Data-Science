Ingredients:
1 large zucchini (or 2 small)
3 roma tomatoes
3 Tbsp olive oil
aluminum foil
Olive oil (to drizzle or spray)
1 tsp dried basil
salt to taste
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Slice the zucchini and tomatoes into 1/4 inch thickness.
Drizzle olive oil on aluminum foil. Fold up sides of foil to prevent spillage.
Lay zucchini slices down on the foil. Layer a tomato slice on top of each zucchini slice. Spray with additional olive oil. Sprinkle salt, basil and feta cheese on top.
Place uncovered on preheated grill for 10-15 minutes until vegetables are cooked and cheese is melted.
