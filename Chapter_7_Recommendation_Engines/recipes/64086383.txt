using shears cut on the bottom shell right down the middle

cut sirloin in roughly the same size as the lobster
thread onto skewers - use two for each kebab to prevent from twirling

Buerre Monte
place 1 Tablespoon of butter in saucepan and bring to a boil, turn down the burner to low and when not bubbling, place a pat of butter in and whisk constantly, once the emulsion has started, more butter can be added - do not boil it will break down, the mixture should be the consistency of a very thick butter sauce - and the most important is, no matter how much butter you put in, you only use 1 tablespoon of water
