Ingredients:
1 small zucchini, grated
1/4 cup finely grated onion
1 Tbsp. butter
1/4 cup horseradish or pepper cheese, grated
3 eggs
1/4 cup half-and-half
2 Tbsp. grated parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp. grated Swiss cheese
2 tsp. horseradish cheese, grated

Directions:
Melt the butter in a small microwave dish.  Cut the zucchini into thirds and grate.  [This makes the pieces shorter and more manageable.]  Microwave the zucchini and onion in the melted butter for 1 minute.  Divide and place in two greased ramekins.  Sprinkle with  1/4 cup horseradish cheese.
In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and the half-and-half.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Pour mixture over zucchini.
Sprinkle the Parmesan and Swiss cheeses over the eggs. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 350&#0176; until firm in the middle.  Remove from oven and sprinkle each dish with 1 teas. grated horseradish or pepper cheese.
