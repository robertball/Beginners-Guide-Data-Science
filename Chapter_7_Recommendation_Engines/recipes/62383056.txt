Ingredients:
Beef marinade:
- Lemon juice, 3 Tablespoons
- Lime juice, 3 Tablespoons
- Tequila, 1/2 Cup
- Ginger, about 1/2 inch fresh root, peeled (use a teaspoon) and grated (or slice thinly and squeeze through a garlic press) You can use more if you like ginger!
- Garlic, 2 cloves, peeled, at least one finely chopped, you can use the other to squeeze through the garlic press to help clean the ginger out!
- Olive Oil, 1 Tablespoon
- Spring onions (green onions/scallions), 2 Tablespoons, medium chopped
- Cajun seasoning, 2 Tablespoons (or use your favourite seasoning mix - I make my own Cajun one)
- Black pepper, freshly ground, about 1 teaspoon
***
Beef: Good quality beef steak, 1 pound, sliced into steaks about 3/4 inch thick
***
Mango and Pear Salsa:
- Fresh Mango, 4 1/2 ounces, finely diced
- Fresh Pear, 4 1/2 ounces, finely diced
- Spring onions (green onions/scallions), 2 Tablespoons finely chopped
- Fresh lime juice, 1 Tablespoon
- Fresh cilantro (coriander), 2 Tablespoons finely chopped
- Fresh chili, 1 (or to taste) deseeded and finely chopped
- Sea salt to taste

Directions:
Put the beef marinade ingredients in a large unpunctured freezer bag, and shake, squeeze, turn and otherwise ensure it is well mixed. Add the meat and keep manipulating the bag until the meat is all well covered. Remove most of the air, seal the bag and then place it in the refrigerator and leave to marinate for a minimum 6 hours, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile mix the Mango and Pear Salsa ingredients in a bowl, cover and refigerate until required, about 20 or 30 minutes before serving, or even about when you start to preheat the grill/broiler. This allows the salsa to warm to room temperature before serving it.
Pre-heat (to hot) a griddle pan on the grill or under the broiler.
Remove the steak from the marinade and place on the griddle pan. (Discard the bag and the marinade.)
Cook the steaks for about 3 or 4 minutes on each side, or until medium-rare (your choice of "doneness" of course!).
When cooked, remove from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes in a warm place.
Carve the steaks into thin slices, season with salt and pepper and serve with the salsa.
