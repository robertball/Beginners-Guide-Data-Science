Ingredients:
4 slices lavash bread
2 tablespoons tomato paste
120g sliced salami
12 cherry tomatoes (3 per pizza)
50g sliced olives
1 small red onion diced
200g mozzarella cheese (grated)

Directions:
Lay one lavash bread on a chopping board and spread half a tablespoon of tomato paste onto it to create a pizza base.
Assemble approximately six slices of salami over lavash pizza base.
Slice and quarter cherry tomatoes, then dice red onion.
Toss quartered cherry tomatoes, sliced black olives and diced red onion over the lavash pizza base.
Grab a small handful of mozzarella cheese to sprinkle over the top of lavash pizza.
Line a grilling tray with aluminum foil or baking paper and set grill to a high heat.
Place prepared lavash pizza onto aluminum lined grilling tray and grill until cheese is melted.
Repeat this process until all ingredients are used to make a total of four lavash pizzas.
Serving Suggestion:  Serve with garlic yogurt and Mediterranean salad.
Hints:
Place lavash pizzas at least 8cm below heating element.
Other cheeses and salami may be substituted.
Plain tomatoes may be thinly sliced and used instead of cherry tomatoes.
Be adventurous and experiment with other toppings such as chicken, mushrooms, rocket, spinach, brie and shallots.
