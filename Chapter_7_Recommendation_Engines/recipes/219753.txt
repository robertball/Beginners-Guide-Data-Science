Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, cut into 1/4 inch rounds
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 1/2 cups frozen corn
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 bunch chopped fresh cilantro, divided
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 green chile pepper, halved lengthwise
1/2 cup sliced black olives
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 cup water, or more as needed
1/4 cup lime juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground turkey. Cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Transfer turkey to a bowl; set aside.
In the same skillet, stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion is nearly translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the carrots and celery. Continue to cook and stir until tender, about 8 more minutes.
Stir in the corn, garlic, taco seasoning, cumin, chili powder, dried oregano, and about 1/4 cup cilantro along with the cooked turkey. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Mix in the tomatoes, kidney beans, green chile pepper, olives, chicken broth, water, and lime juice. Season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and continue to simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chile halves, and garnish with the remaining cilantro before serving.
