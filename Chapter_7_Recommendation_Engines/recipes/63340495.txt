Frost the bottoms of all cookie halves with frosting. Place 6 marshmallow teeth around curved perimeter of 24 halves. For additional support, an additional marshmallow can be placed behind the teeth. Top with remaining 24 halves.  Insert two almond slivers in between teeth for fangs. If fangs do not adhere, dip tips into frosting.
