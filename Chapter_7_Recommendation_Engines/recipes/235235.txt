Description: 
This is a variation on classic, fresh Ocean SprayÂ® cranberry sauce! My grandma has made it for years and people who don't like cranberry sauce request that I make this at our events! It's different and great! This is a nice change of pace. and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like it! Tastes best if stored in refrigerator overnight.
