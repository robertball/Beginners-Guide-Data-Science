Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups chopped onion
3 green bell peppers, chopped
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 pound lean top sirloin beef - cut into 1 inch cubes
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 cups beef broth
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 cup sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green peppers and tomato paste. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Add beef to skillet, then stir in the cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic, salt, broth, lemon juice and caraway seeds. Simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Remove the goulash from the heat and let it cool slightly. Fold in the sour cream and adjust the seasoning to taste.

Description: 
This recipe was translated for me from a recipe I got from a Hungarian restaurant in Idar Oberstein, Germany in 1972. I've been making it ever since! Serve over wide egg noodles. Delicious!
