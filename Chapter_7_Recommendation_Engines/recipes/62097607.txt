Description: 
Long ago in St. Croix, US Virgin Isands, if a homemaker did not have an oven and needed bread in a hurry, this was the answer. The cake-like dough was put into a heavy skillet, covered and baked over a wood or coal fire. Johnny cakes can also be fried. These are great for an afternoon snack with a cup of tea or coffee.
