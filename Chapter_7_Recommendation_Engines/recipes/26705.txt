Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook until tender. Reduce heat to low. Mix in anchovy filets and heavy cream. Cook and stir until thickened. Remove from heat, cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 2 hours.

Description: 
Ever since a family friend introduced us to this Italian dip, we have made it a tradition on New Year's Eve. You have to really like garlic to enjoy this. I have heard that some people omit the cream and substitute olive oil also. Serve with crusty Italian bread, raw cabbage wedges, lettuce, bread sticks or crackers.
