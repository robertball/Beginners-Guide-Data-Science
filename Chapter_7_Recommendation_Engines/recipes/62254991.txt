Yuppie Kolcannon Recipe

Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes
2 Tb balsamic vinegar
4 cups shredded green cabbage
1 large carrot, grated
1 small to medium onion, quartered and sliced
2 Tb extra-virgin olive oil
1 stick butter
1 cup milk
1 Tb garlic salt
1 ts cracked pepper

Directions:
Scrub potatoes, peel if desired (I donâ€™t), and cut into quarters. Cover with water in a large stock pot, and add another two or three inches of water to the top. Add 2 Tb balsamic vinegar, and bring to a boil. Set the timer for 20 minutes.
When the potatoes have 8 minutes left to go, place shredded cabbage into a metal colander and set directly into the boiling potato water to cook. Meanwhile, put sliced onion, grated carrot, and olive oil into a cast-iron skillet and saute at medium-high heat until onions are nicely browned.
Remove cabbage from potato water, drain well, and set aside. Drain potatoes and mash with butter and milk until creamy. Mix in cabbage, carrot and onion, garlic salt, and pepper. Serve piping-hot all by itself, or as a side dish with meat.

Description: 
Your Irish Gran's kolcannon doesn't have balsamic vinegar or extra-virgin olive oil in it; but this version is delicious, too.
