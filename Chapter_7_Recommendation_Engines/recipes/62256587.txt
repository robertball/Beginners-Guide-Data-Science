Ingredients:
Filling:
3-4 medium sized sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1 whole cinnamon stick
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup loosely packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon corn starch
Crust:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 whole egg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
A pinch of salt
8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold butter, cut into pieces
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Directions:
Combine the sweet potato chunks, cinnamon stick, vanilla extract, 1/4 cup white sugar and water to cover in a medium pot. Allow to cook until barely tender.
In a mixing bowl, get together the dry crust ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, salt). Next, cut the butter into the mixture until it becomes crumbly. Stir in the egg (and optional 1/2 tsp. vanilla, if desired).
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Strain potatoes and remove cinnamon stick.
In a separate mixing bowl combine potatoes, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and corn starch. Spoon mixture into a greased 9-in. pie baking dish, or casserole of your choice. Spoon the crust mixture on top and bake for 35 minutes.
Serve with whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.
