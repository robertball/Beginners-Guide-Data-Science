Ingredients:
12 oz white chocolate chips
3 tbsp vegetable shortening
1/2 Tsp vanilla extract
12 oz Caramels
3 drops of your choice food coloring
1-2 containers creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Combine white chocolate chips and shortening in a medium bowl. Microwave for 1 minute until melt.
After the white chocolate chips and shortening are melted in a microwave, melt all of the caramels in a separate bowl. Be careful not to burn. Mix both the liquid caramel & the liquid chocolate & creamy peanut butter together until they are thoroughly combined.
Then combine the chocolate & caramel with creamy peanut butter.
Line a 9-inch cake pan or tart pan with parchment paper or wax paper. Pour chocolate & caramel & creamy peanut butter mixture into it.
Drop 3 drops of food coloring into the chocolate mixture. Use more drops for an awesome color. Stir roughly with a spoon.
Line a kitchen cloth on your kitchen counter. Lift the pan with both of your hands to about 3 inches high from the counter surface and drop it on the cloth. Repeat until the chocolate mixture surface is flattened. Set aside for about 10 minutes.
When the chocolate starts to set (it becomes less shiny), use a mini heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut as many candies as you can.
Once dry, break up the candies around the hearts.
Enjoy!
