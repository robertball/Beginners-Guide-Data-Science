Ingredients:
1 bag of strawberry and vanilla (pink and white) marshmallows
2 7oz bottles of Health Shell Topping
1 package of candy eyes

Directions:
Place marshmallows in freezer for 1-2 minutes.
While marshmallows are chilling, run hot water over the Heath Shell Topping bottle and shake well.
Place chilled marshmallows in a room temperature baking dish.
Drizzle the chocolate topping over the chilled marshmallows.
Turn the marshmallows to coat them in the chocolate shell.
Before shell has fully hardened, add candy eyes to each chocolate covered marshmallow. If shell has already hardened, simply add a dab of fresh shell to adhere the eyeball.
Place marshmallows on a clean plate and refrigerate until ready to serve, at least 10 minutes.

Description: 
Fluffy, chocolate covered marshmallow critters that are are sure to appeal to little monsters.

We all know that Dinomite, the rare dinosaur-mite hybrid, craves soft little critters. This chocolaty treat looks like an unusual rodent and tastes like heaven. Dinomite loves them so much that he has refused to consume any hybrid critter or contest mascot since his adopted grandmother made him these treats.
