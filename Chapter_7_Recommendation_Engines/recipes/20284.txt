1/2 cup butter, melted
2 1/2 cups crispy rice cereal
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 1/4 cups flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream, softened

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together butter, cereal, brown sugar, coconut and pecans.  Spread on a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.  Let cool completely.
In a 9x13 inch dish, place two-thirds of the cereal mixture.  Spread softened ice cream over cereal.  Top with remaining cereal.  Cover tightly and freeze 8 hours or overnight.

Description: 
A family favorite that is great for entertaining any time of the year.  Very simple and elegant to make ahead.  Simply delicious!  Cut into squares and top with warm chocolate or caramel sauce.  For holidays, you may add crushed candy canes on top of the warm sauce -- and try butter pecan or peppermint ice cream instead of vanilla!
