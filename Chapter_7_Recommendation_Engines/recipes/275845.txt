Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi
olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 clove garlic, diced, or to taste
1 tablespoon tomato-basil pesto
1 teaspoon refrigerated tube Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 teaspoon refrigerated tube parsley, or to taste
1 pinch dried rosemary, or to taste
1 pound chicken-Asiago cheese Italian sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) package baby spinach, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place onion and garlic into the hot oil and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Add pesto, Italian seasoning, parsley, and rosemary and stir. Add sausage and tomatoes; saute until sausage is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cooked gnocchi. Add spinach and stir until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes more.

Description: 
This recipe uses chicken-Asiago cheese sausage with gnocchi. I put it together one day (quickly) and now it's one of my favorites. It's good by itself or great with vodka sauce or spaghetti sauce, as well. Top with Parmesan cheese or mozzarella cheese.
