Ingredients:
16 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 mango, peeled and diced
1 fresh poblano pepper, seeded and minced
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
Spread half of the tortillas with about 2 tablespoons cream cheese each. Sprinkle mango and poblano peppers over cheese, and press another tortilla on top. Brush butter over the outside of each quesadilla, top and bottom.
Grill quesadillas 5 minutes each side, or until golden brown. Remove from grill, and slice into wedges. Serve warm.

Description: 
We developed this recipe after trying a similar appetizer at a restaurant in Austin, TX.  Depending on the peppers, these quesadillas can be mild and fruity or spicy hot.
