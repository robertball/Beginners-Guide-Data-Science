In a resealable plastic bag, combine the ketchup, vinegar, oil, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, salt and pepper; add meat. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Grill, covered, over medium heat or broil 4 in. from heat for 6-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).

Description: 
This marinade makes the toughest cuts of meat tender. I'm frequently asked for the recipe. It's also good with venison and elk meat.
