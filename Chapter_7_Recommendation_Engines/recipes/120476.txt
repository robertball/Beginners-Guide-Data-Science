Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 cups sugar

1 teaspoon salt
2 (21 ounce) cans cherry pie filling

1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the extracts. Combine flour and salt; add to the creamed mixture. Mix just until combined.
Spread 3 cups batter into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spread with pie filling. Drop the remaining batter by teaspoonfuls over filling.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Combine the glaze ingredients; drizzle over bars.
