Description: 
Rompope is a traditional drink in Mexico, where it was originally made in the convents of the city of Puebla. It's an eggnog-like drink made with eggs, milk, and vanilla flavouring.  Its more commonly used in chocolate milk blends or snow cones.  I decided to make some bread from a bottle of rompope sitting in my fridge.
