Ingredients:
1 pound Johnsonville® Hot Italian Sausage Links
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine or chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, softened
1 package (6 ounces) fresh baby spinach, coarsely chopped
1 can (15 ounces) white kidney or cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup chopped seeded tomatoes
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
Assorted crackers or toasted French bread baguette slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°. In a large skillet, cook sausage, onion and garlic over medium heat until sausage is no longer pink, breaking up sausage into crumbles; drain. Stir in wine, oregano, salt and thyme. Bring to a boil; cook until liquid is almost evaporated.
Add cream cheese; stir until melted. Stir in spinach, beans and tomatoes; cook and stir until spinach is wilted. Transfer to a greased 8-in.-square or 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Sprinkle with cheeses.
Bake 20-25 minutes or until bubbly. Serve with crackers. Yield: 16 servings (1/4 cup each).
