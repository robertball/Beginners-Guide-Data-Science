Ingredients:
4 hot dogs
4 slices of bread
4 slices of American Cheese
mayo or butter

Directions:
Preheat Broiler.
Boil hot dogs for a few minutes to heat through.
In the meantime, spread a skim coat of mayo or butter (I prefer mayo) on 4 slices of bread. Place on a cookie sheet.
Slice each hot dog into 1/4" coins and place on a slice of bread.
Place a slice of American Cheese on top.
Broil about 2 minutes or until cheese starts to melt and cheese starts to brown. Watch closely after 1 minute.
Note: American cheese may be placed on bread and the hot dogs on top.
