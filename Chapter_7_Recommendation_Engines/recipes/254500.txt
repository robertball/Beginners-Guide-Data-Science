Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crust
4 cups Bing cherries, pitted and sliced
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup instant tapioca
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Press the bottom pie crust into a pie pan.
Combine cherries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, and almond extract together in bowl. Refrigerate until cherry filling begins to set, about 10 minutes. Stir filling again; chill until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
Pour the filling into the bottom half of the pie crust; cover with top crust, crimp the edges to seal, and dot with butter. Cut vents into the top with a sharp knife.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; rotate the pie 1/4 of a turn. Continue baking until the crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.
