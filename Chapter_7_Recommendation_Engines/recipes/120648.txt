Ingredients:
1/2 cup whole berry cranberry sauce
1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/3 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 cup peeled, shredded tart apple
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine cranberry sauce and orange peel; set aside.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Beat the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in apple. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups half full.
Make a well in the center of each muffin; fill with about 2 teaspoons of reserved cranberry mixture. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in muffin comes out clean.  Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Combine confectioners' sugar and orange juice; drizzle over cooled muffins.
