Directions:
Butterfly cut the tenderloin without cutting all the way though the meat.(This cut should be parallel to the widest part of the tenderloin.) Fill tenderloin with blue cheese and 1 heaping tbs garlic. Pinch tenderloin back to original shape and tie together **tightly** with cooking string, enclosing blue cheese & garlic. Sprinkle with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, covering all sides of tenderloin. Gently prick tenderloin with fork.
In shallow plastic container w/ tight fitting lid, mix together wine, olive oil, worchester sauce, lemon, garlic, and more ground pepper (to taste).
Add tenderloin to marinade with cut side up, cover w/lid and gently shake.
Refridgerate for three hours. 1 hour before grilling remove tenderloin from refridgerator to bring to room temperature. (Leave marinating in container.)
Preheat grill to appx. 450* and sear on all sides. Reduce heat to appx 350* and continue grilling to desired doneness.
