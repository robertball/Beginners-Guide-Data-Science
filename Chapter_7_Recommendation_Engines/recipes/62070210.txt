Description: 
This is a quick, easy, and tasty salad for the summer time, and it is basic enough that pretty much anything can be added to it to personalize it.  I created this after seeing a picture of a salad like this in a magazine ad. It has a great fresh taste perfect for bringing on a picnic, or serving as a side with dinner(especially burgers!)
