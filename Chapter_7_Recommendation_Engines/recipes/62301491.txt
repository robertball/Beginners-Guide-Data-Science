Ingredients:
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast
4 oz cream cheese, softened
2 tsp onion powder
1 tsp soy sauce
1 tsp minced garlic
1/2 tsp ground ginger
Wonton Wrappers

Directions:
Set oven to 400 F.
Boil (or microwave, covered) the chicken breast, until done.
Carefully shred the chicken and set aside.
In a large bowl, combined the remaining ingredients thoroughly.
Add chicken to the cream cheese mixture and combine well.
On wax paper or other clean surface, lay out single wonton wrappers.
Carefully brush all 4 edges of each wrapper with cool water.
Place 1 generous tablespoon of mixture in the center of the wontons.
Lay another wonton wrapper on top of filling and carefully pinch the edges all around, to form a square packet.
Cover prepared finished wontons with a damp cloth until ready to bake. They may be wrapped and frozen for future use at this step.
Lightly oil or spray a large cookie sheet.
Carefully arrange wontons on the sheet.  Do not overlap.
Brush the tops with oil (or spray) and bake until golden brown.
Serve warm with sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce, or chili oil.

Description: 
I love crab rangoon served at my favoirite local Chinese restaurant.  I decided to make a more economical but still wonderful twist on this traditional dish.
