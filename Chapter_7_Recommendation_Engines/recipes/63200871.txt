Directions:
Add the seasonings, hamburger, and onions together.
For SPICY TACO SEASONING- mix all powdered ingredients first in a small bowl. Then add the beef base or beef bouillion to hamburger.
Cook until hamburger is browned, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Drain grease.
Cover with a lid to keep warm.
Add 1/4 cup of oil to a small skillet. Heat the skillet for about 2 minutes on medium high. The oil must be hot in order to cook the corn tortillas.
Use tongs to hold the tortilla for around 20 seconds or until desired crispiness
Place on paper towels to absorb oil.
Add 1/4 cup of hamburger mixture to the tacos.
Garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, and salsa.
