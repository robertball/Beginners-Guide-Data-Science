Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
3/4 cup HERSHEY®'S Cocoa Powder
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup ground cinnamon
2 cups HERSHEY®'S Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
2 tablespoons shortening
2 teaspoons shortening

Directions:
In medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter.  Add cocoa; stir until smooth.  Add sweetened condensed milk; stir constantly until mixture is thick, smooth and glossy, about 4 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.  Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours or until firm.
Shape into 1-1/4 inch balls; coat with cocoa, powdered sugar or Coating Selections.  Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or until firm.  Store, covered in refrigerator.
Sugar and Cinnamon Coating:  Stir together 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon.
Chocolate Coating:  Line cookie sheet with waxed paper.  In medium microwave-safe bowl, place 2 cups (12-oz. pkg.) Hershey's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons shortening.  Microwave at High (100%) 1 minute; stir.  If necessary, microwave at High an additional 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, just until chips are melted and mixture is smooth when stirred.  Place truffle on fork and immediately dip into melted chocolate mixture; allow excess chocolate to drip off truffles.  If necessary, scrape off excess chocolate with knife or small spatula.  Place on prepared sheet.  Sprinkle with colored sprinkles, if desired.  Refrigerate as above.
