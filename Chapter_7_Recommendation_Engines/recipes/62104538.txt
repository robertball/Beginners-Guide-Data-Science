Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising cornmeal
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups buttermilk
1/2 tsp salt
2 T bacon grease

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Put grease in a cast iron skillet and place skillet in the oven to preheat.
Meanwhile combine cornmeal, baking soda, eggs, salt and buttermilk in a bowl and whisk until blended.
Carefully remove hot skillet from oven and pour grease into batter. Mix lightly.
Pour batter into skillet; it might sizzle a little.
Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
Cool 5 minutes and then turn onto large plate. Cut into pie-shaped wedges and serve hot with lots of real butter. If you like a crunchier texture, you may sprinkle a little bit of cornmeal into the skillet right before you pour in the batter.

Description: 
Real old-fashioned Southern cornbread with a crunchy golden exterior and crumbly insides, cooked in cast iron the traditional way with no flour or sugar. Additional salt and grease can be added for extra flavor. If substituting oil for the bacon fat, use solid Crisco and NOT regular oil. Solid fats help to keep your cast iron well seasoned!
