Description: 
This spicy baked dip tastes just like hot chicken wings, but without the mess.  It is very addicting, and is perfect for football and tailgating season. Serve with tortilla chips. I take this whenever I have to bring a dish and am always asked for the recipe.Modified from: Chicken Wing Dip
