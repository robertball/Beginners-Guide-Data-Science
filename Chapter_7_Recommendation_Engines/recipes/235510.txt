Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup cooked brown rice
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
fresh cracked black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
Mix ground beef, rice, parsley, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl; form into 4 oblong mini-loaves. Season the outside of each loaf generously with pepper. Arrange loaves in the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over low heat; saute onion in oil until soft and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Season onion with 1 pinch salt; serve over meat loaves.

Description: 
These single-serve meatloaves are made with rice rather than bread or breadcrumbs, so they are gluten free. A great way to use leftover rice.
