Description: 
This was originally a sweet pie that mimicked a coconut cream pie.  I decided, however, to take this idea of a dessert spaghetti squash pie, but change it up for a vegetarian dinner pie. Also, because the squash serves as the crust of the pie, this dish is gluten free.Modified from: Mock Coconut Pie (Spaghetti Squash Pie)
