Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 limes, juiced
2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
cayenne pepper to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
skewers

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Season with chili powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Place the chicken in a shallow baking dish with the sauce, and stir to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 3 hours.
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat. Thread chicken onto skewers, and discard marinade.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill skewers for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chicken juices run clear.

Description: 
Chicken cubes are marinated in a chili-lime sauce and then grilled. I've increased the amount of lime juice and chili powder.  I've also lengthened the minimum time in the refrigerator.  Serve with white long grain rice and grilled veggies for a delicious dinner.Modified from: Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs
