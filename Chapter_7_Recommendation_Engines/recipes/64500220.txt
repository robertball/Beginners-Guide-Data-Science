Ingredients:
1Tbsp olive oil
1 cup diced onion
2 stalks celery, diced
4 carrots, peeled and diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2" pieces
2 bay leaves
salt & pepper
1 tsp poultry seasoning
1 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp rubbed sage
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
4 cups unsalted chicken broth/stock
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
1 cup frozen thawed peas
1 Tbsp flour
1 tsp corn starch
1/2 cup water (or milk)
2 cups flour
1 tbsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp sage
Fresh cracked pepper
6 tbsp. butter, melted
3/4 cup milk or buttermilk
Chopped parsley for garnish.

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in large pot or Dutch oven.  Add onions, celery and carrots; cook about 10 minutes.
Add chicken; season with salt and pepper.  Cook about 7 minutes.
Add garlic, poultry seasoning, thyme, sage and pepper flakes, and cook 2 minutes.
Pour in stock and add bay leaves and sweet potato; bring to a boil.  Mix together flour, corn starch and 1/2 cup water and stir into stew.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer 10 to 15 minutes.
Add peas and continue simmering until potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk or sift together flour, baking powder and baking soda.  Stir in melted butter and milk.
Drop heaping spoonfuls of dumpling batter gently on top of stew (you should have about 8 dumplings); cover and continue simmering over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, or until dumplings are cooked through.
