Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
8 mushrooms, halved and sliced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 yam, peeled and cubed
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon onion (nigella) seeds
1 teaspoon black mustard seeds
1 teaspoon chile powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 head cauliflower, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1/2 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup vegetable stock
1 tablespoon tomato paste
3 cups fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
1 bunch fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 lemon, juiced
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Heat oil in a large flat-sided skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 2 minutes. Add yam and cook for 2 minutes.
Stir cumin, coriander, onion seeds, black mustard seeds, chile powder, paprika, and turmeric into the skillet; cook and stir until evenly distributed, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower, chickpeas, salt, and black pepper; stir until combined.
Mix vegetable stock and tomato paste together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet. Cover and cook until yam is tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in spinach, parsley, lemon juice, and lime juice and cook until flavors combine, about 1 minute.

Description: 
While I have made falafel before, I find that it's a whole process for patties that end up being a lot of extra work given that this recipe is, in essence, deconstructed then accompanied by other complementary vegetables.
