Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
1/4 lemon, juiced, or more to taste
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
2 large dill pickles, diced
1/2 white onion, diced
1 tomato, seeded and diced
4 sport peppers, chopped, or to taste (optional)
1 dash celery seed, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spray four 6x6-inch pieces of aluminum foil with cooking spray. Place salmon fillets on top.
Drizzle lemon juice over salmon fillets; sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of dill weed over each one. Spread 1 tablespoon mustard onto each salmon fillet; top with dill pickle and onion. Wrap aluminum foil around salmon, sealing the edges. Place packets onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
Place packets in shallow bowls; open with heatproof gloves. Top with diced tomatoes and sport peppers; season with celery seed.
