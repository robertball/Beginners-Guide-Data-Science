Ingredients:
1/2 package of Jimmy Dean hot sausage
1 bag of coleslaw cut cabbage & carrots
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves diced garlic
2 tsp fresh ginger, grated
1/2 Tbsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp molasses
2 Tbsp oil
Oil for frying
1/2 package of egg roll wrappers
water as needed
sweet and sour sauce for dipping

Directions:
Brown sausage in large pan.  Scoop onto papertowel and set aside.
Mix together coleslaw mix, ginger, onion, garlic and ginger.
Add 2 Tbsp oil in pan used for sausage.  Add vegetables and stir for 3-5 minutes. Place in a bowl and add sausage.
Mix together molasses, soy sauce and cornstarch until smooth, then add to meat/veg mix.
Place 2-3 tablespoons of mix onto the middle of an egg roll wrapper, run wet finger around edge of egg roll (to help seal) wrap up tightly and set aside, seam side down.
Heat oil in pan (I use cast iron) until temperature of about 365 degrees.  Add 2-3 egg rolls at a time, turning after about half of them, until they are uniformly golden brown.
Place on a papertowel to drain for just a moment.
Serve with fried rice.
