Ingredients:
1-2 lbs. ground beef
2 jalapenos, seeded and chopped
1 large onion, chopped
2 Tbsp. minced garlic
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 packet chili seasoning
1 bunch cilantro, rinsed & chopped
1 large can refried beans
1 29 oz. can pinto beans
2 15.5 oz. cans chili beans
1 15.5 oz. can navy beans
1 large bottle salsa (we use Pace)
2 14.5 oz. cans stewed tomatoes
1 large can tomatoes, crushed
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. garlic salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. cinnamon/sugar mixture

Directions:
Brown the ground beef in skillet, add mushrooms, onions and jalapenos, cook until soft. Add garlic and saute until golden, then add chili seasoning and cilantro, mix well; set aside.
In large pot, combine beans, salsa and tomatoes over low heat. Season with garlic salt, salt and pepper, cayenne and cinnamon/sugar to taste. Mix well, then add meat mixture, again mix well. Taste and adjust seasonings; more sugar may be added to reduce acidity of tomatoes.
Bring chili to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, until all flavors have thoroughly blended.

Wonderful combination of flavors - a unique and amazing chili experience!  This recipe was created by our son-in-law, to feed the whole visiting family when their first child was born.  Everyone demanded the recipe.  It really is outrageously good, and lends itself to personal adaptation.
