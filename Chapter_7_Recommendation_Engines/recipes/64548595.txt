Ingredients:
¼ cup thinly sliced scallions
½ cup finely chopped celery
3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and diced
1/8 cup canola oil
4 lbs ground turkey breast (CostCo. is good)
2 T. salt
2 T. black pepper
2 t. Tobasco chipotle pepper sauce
1 lemon, juiced and grated zest
½ bunch parsley, finely chopped
¼ cup Major Grey’s chutney, pureed

Directions:
Saute the scallions, celery and apples in canola oil until tender.  Let cool. Place ground turkey in large mixing bowl.  Add sautéed items and remaining ingredients.  Shape into 8- 8 oz. burgers. (I usually make about 14 per recipe.)  Refrigerate for 2 hours.  (I usually individually wrap and freeze)  Place on grill - 7 minutes on each side - until meat is cooked.  Let sit for 5 minutes.
