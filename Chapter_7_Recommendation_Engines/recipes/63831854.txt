Ingredients:
1 lb. Dry macaroni noodles
1 28 oz. Can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
1 quart Half n Half
2 cups Chicken broth
6 Tbsp. butter
1/4 cup flour
4 cups shredded sharp white cheddar

1 roll Ritz butter crackers, crumbled
Fresh ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Boil macaroni noodles in salted water until just under al dente. Drain noodles and return to pot. Stir in undrained tomatoes and cook over medium heat about 4 minutes until the noodles absorb the tomato liquid.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, melt butter and stir in flour. Cook over medium high heat until bubbly. Cook about one minute more. Slowly add the half n half and chicken broth, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat and stir in the cheese, one handful at a time, until all the cheese is incorporated into the sauce. Season with fresh ground black pepper.
Stir cheese sauce into the noodle and tomato mixture. Transfer to a buttered baking dish and crumble the crackers over the top. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown and casserole is nice and bubbly. Allow to rest for about 10 minutes before serving.
