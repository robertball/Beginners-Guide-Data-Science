Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons butter, melted
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups chopped pecans
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter, cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Stir in the flour and mix thoroughly. The dough should be somewhat firm. Roll into 36 small balls, place them on a plate and refrigerate for one hour.
Make the filling in a medium bowl. Beat the eggs, melted butter, vanilla and brown sugar until smooth and well blended. Stir in the nuts. Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the chilled dough balls into the bottom and up the sides of tart pans or mini muffin cups. Fill each shell with filling almost to the top. Use a squeeze top honey container if you have one, to drip about 1/2 teaspoon of honey onto the top of each cup.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is lightly browned.  Allow to cool in the tins completely before removing.

Description: 
I learned this recipe from a childhood friend whose mother made these for family parties and get-togethers.  They are a great Christmas or special occasion cookie.  My Mother makes hers with walnuts, I prefer pecans for a mini pecan pie taste.
