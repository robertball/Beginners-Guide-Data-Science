Ingredients:
* 2 limes, halved, divided
* 4 tbsp raw honey, divided
* 1 4-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped*
* 4 tbsp loose-leaf green tea, spooned into an infuser ball or piece of cheesecloth tied with twine, or 6 green tea bags
* 4 6-oz wild-caught salmon fillets, skin and bones removed
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp whole black pepper corns (I used ground pepper)
* Fresh ground black pepper, to taste (optional)

Directions:
1. Put 6 cups water into a straight-sided skillet or pot with a lid.  Add 3 lime halves (squeezing juice into the water before adding), 3 tbsp honey, ginger, salt, and peppercorns and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes to infuse water with flavor.  Remove 1/2 cup poaching liquid and set aside.
2. Remove skillet or pot from heat and add tea, allowing to steep for 3 to 5 minutes.  Remove tea and place skillet or pot heat again at the lowest heat setting before carefully sliding salmon into water.  Cover and poach until fish is just cooked through and firm to the touch, 6 to 7 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, in a small pot, simmer reserved 1/2 cup poaching liquid along with juice and zest of remaining lime half and remaining 1 tbsp honey until liquid reduces by two-thirds and thickens, about 7 to 10 minutes.
4. Remove salmon with a slotted spoon and plate.  Drizzle with a bit of reduced sauce over each fillet.  Season with black pepper, if desired.
