Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust deep dish pie
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
6 cups (7-8 small) thinly sliced granny smith apples
1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping
1/4 cup chopped pecans
3 tablespoons oats (not quick cooking)

Directions:
Preheat oven and cookie sheet to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Stir together the sugar, cornstarch and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Toss with the apples in a mixing bowl.
In bottom of unbaked shell, sprinkle oats and remaining 1 teaspoon cinnamon.
Pour half the apple mixture into the first unbaked pie shell then drizzle half the caramel topping and half the chopped pecans over the top. Repeat with apple mixture and drizzle remaining caramel topping and pecans over the top. Place the second pie shell over this and flute the edges.  Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.  Brush 1 tablespoon milk over the crust and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon white sugar. Place on preheated cookie sheet.
Bake 50 minutes, until golden brown.  Cool for 1 hour before slicing.  Top with whipped topping, if desired.

Description: 
This pie is so luscious that you may never make a plain old apple pie again. Just before the top crust is put on, caramel syrup and pecans are spooned onto the apple filling.  Serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.Modified from: Caramel Apple Pie I
