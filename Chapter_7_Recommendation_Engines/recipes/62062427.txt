Description: 
I concocted this recipe from several of my own cajun and casserole recipes for my catering business. It's good for pot lucks, family gatherings, and anytime you need to feed a huge gang of folks. If you cant find the exact flavor of soup, Cream of Anything will do. Just remember that the more seasoned your broth is, the better the flavor of the entire dish is...
