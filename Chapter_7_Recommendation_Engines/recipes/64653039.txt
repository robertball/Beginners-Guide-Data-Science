Ingredients:
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed
Pork Tenderloin
2 teaspoons canola oil
¼ cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1½ teaspoons chopped fresh sage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°F. Combine 1 tablespoon mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl; rub all over pork. Heat oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center registers 145°F, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for 5 minutes. Place the skillet over medium-high heat (take care, the handle will still be hot), add vinegar, and boil, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, about 30 seconds. Whisk in maple syrup and the remaining 2 tablespoons mustard; bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Slice the pork. Add any accumulated juices to the sauce along with sage. Serve the pork topped with the sauce.

Description: 
Pork tenderloin is about as lean as it comes so it's a great healthy option, but it shouldn't be overcooked as it can dry out. Maple and mustard make a sweet-and-savory mahogany-colored sauce. A delicate note of sage gives it a wintery touch. Fresh thyme or rosemary also work if you prefer. Serve with barley, roasted squash and a Pinot Noir.
