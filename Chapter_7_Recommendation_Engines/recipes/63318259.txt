Ingredients:
1 large pre-made pizza crust
1 1/2 cups shredded Mozarella cheese (or more if you like it extra-cheesey)
3T shredded Pamesan cheese
1 cup cooked chicken breast cut up
1/2 cup pineapple chunks or tidbits
1/2 small red onion, sliced
1/3 cup garlic ranch dressing (creamy-style)
1/4 cup BBQ sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven according to the package directions for the crust.
Spread the garlic ranch dressing over the crust to 1/2 inch of the edge with the back of a spoon.
Layer the cheeses, chicken, pineapple and onion slices on the garlic ranch dressing.  Place 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce in a sandwich bag and cut a small piece off of one corner; drizzle the BBQ sauce over the pizza.
Bake according to the package directions.

Description: 
This pizza is different from others I've tried.  What I really love about this recipe is the creamy garlic-ranch dressing is baked into the crust while the BBQ sauce is drizzled on top.
