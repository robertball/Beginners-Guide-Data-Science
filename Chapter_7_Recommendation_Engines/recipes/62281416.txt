Ingredients:
3/4 cup broth
1/3 c butter
1 tsp granules (bouillon)

Directions:
Microwave the first three ingredients until butter is melted.  Mix it with the powdered milk, egg, and whole wheat flour.  The dough will be stiff.  Knead it with your hands until totally mixed.  Bake at 325 degrees for 40 minutes.  Turn off the oven but leave them in the oven for an hour or more.

Description: 
Stealthhippie said she has been making these treats for her dogs for quite a few years.  She said it's very important to only use whole wheat flour!  If you use chicken broth, use chicken granules; if you use beef broth, then use beef granules.
