Ingredients:
1 prepared 9-inch single pie crust
1/2 cup liquid egg substitute
1/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener with brown sugar (Such as Splenda® Brown Sugar Blend)
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can fat-free evaporated milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Fit the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
In a bowl, whisk the egg substitute, sucralose sweetener, sweetener with brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice until well combined. Whisk in the pumpkin puree and evaporated milk until smooth. Pour the filling into the pie shell.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pie filling is set in the center, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a reduced-fat and very low sugar pumpkin pie that my diabetic husband loves. It has a nice texture and isn't too sweet. Those who prefer a sweeter-tasting pie may want to increase the amount of sugar substitute blend that's used. Remember the brown sugar blend does have sugar, so diabetics will need to watch how much is added.
