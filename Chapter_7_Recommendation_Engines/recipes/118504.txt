Ingredients:
4 large sweet potatoes
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/2 cup orange juice
TOPPING:
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 tablespoons cold butter or margarine

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a Dutch oven; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 40-50 minutes or until tender. Drain. When cool enough to handle, peel potatoes and cut into 1/4-in. slices. Place half in a greased 2-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with half of the cranberries, brown sugar and butter. Repeat layers. Pour orange juice over top.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. In a bowl, combine the walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon; cut in butter. Sprinkle over sweet potato mixture. Bake, uncovered, 10 minutes longer or until topping is golden brown.

Description: 
In October, my husband helps harvest cranberries at a friend's bogs, so I have access to the very freshest ingredients. Their bold autumn flavor pairs up perfectly with sweet potatoes to make a seasonal side dish my family looks forward to.
