Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix, plus ingredients to make cake according to package directions
14 ounces individually wrapped caramels (about 50 caramels)
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1/4 cup butter
1 (11.5 ounce) package semi-sweet chocolate chunks
1 (16 ounce) can chocolate frosting
Colored sprinkles (optional, but recommended!)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.  Lightly grease a 13”x9” baking pan.  Unwrap caramels and place in a medium saucepan.
Mix cake mix according to package directions.  Pour half of the batter into the prepared cake pan (I like to pour the batter into two identical bowls, so I know I’m dividing in half evenly – you want to have enough batter to spread on top!) and bake for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the unwrapped caramels, evaporated milk and butter in the medium saucepan and cook over medium low heat until caramels are melted, stirring often.
Remove bottom portion of cake from the oven and spread caramel mixture evenly over cake.  Sprinkle with chocolate chunks.  Pour remaining batter over top.  Bake for another 15-17 minutes.
Allow cake to cool completely before frosting.
