Ingredients:
1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 large celery root, trimmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 small sweet onion, such as Vidalia or Walla Walla, sliced 1/4 inch thick
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick
1 pint heavy whipping cream
shredded aged Colby or Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large steamer pot of water to a boil. Place fennel, celery root, and onion slices in the steamer insert. Steam until tender, approximately 7 to 10 minutes.
Spread the steamed vegetables and apple slices evenly in the bottom of an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Pour cream around the sides of the dish until the liquid reaches half-way to the top. Sprinkle with shredded cheese, and cover tightly with foil.
Bake in preheated oven until hot and bubbly and cheese has melted, approximately 40 minutes.

Description: 
A wonderful casserole of root vegetables, apple, and cheese served to me by my mom during my last visit. I took the basic recipe and added a few touches of my own. Try different types of cheese for the topping.
