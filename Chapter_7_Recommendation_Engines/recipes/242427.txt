https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/560x315/5248292.jpg
Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground chuck
1/3 cup plain bread crumbs
1 egg
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
24 small square dinner rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease.
Cut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll.

Description: 
If you are from the Chicago area, you have heard of White Castle® hamburgers. I believe down south they are Krystal®. This is the closest I have come to the real deal. Serve each with American cheese, dill pickle slices, and Dusseldorf mustard. Enjoy!
