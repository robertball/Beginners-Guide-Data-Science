Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups buttermilk
4 eggs
4 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon canola oil, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Mix buttermilk, eggs, 4 tablespoons oil, and vanilla extract together in a medium bowl. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and whisk until mixed.
Lightly grease the preheated skillet with 1 teaspoon canola oil. Pour batter into the hot skillet by 1/4 cup for small pancakes, 1/3 cup for medium pancakes, or 1/2 cup for large pancakes. Cook until edges are slightly dry and underside is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on second side, about 2 minutes more. Repeat until all batter is cooked. Regrease the skillet as necessary to keep pancakes from sticking.
