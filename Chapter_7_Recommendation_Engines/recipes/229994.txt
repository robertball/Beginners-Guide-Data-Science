Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 pork chops
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops with seasoned salt. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned completely, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove pork chops to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Mix celery soup, milk, sour cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Fold hash brown potatoes, 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, and about half the French-fried onions into the soup mixture; pour into a 13x9-inch baking dish. Arrange pork chops atop the mixture. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and top pork chops with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and remaining half-can French-fried onions; continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
I got this recipe from a long time good friend of mine. This is a favorite in both our homes! Definitely filling. Of course, you can add more seasoning to suit your taste. Great served with a green salad and applesauce.
