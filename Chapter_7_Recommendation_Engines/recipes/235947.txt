Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar, or as needed
48 milk chocolate candy kisses (such as Hershey's KissesÂ®), unwrapped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat shortening, 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, peanut butter, egg, milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture.
Pour 1/4 cup white sugar into a shallow bowl. Wrap each chocolate kiss in about 1 1/2 teaspoons of dough and shape into a ball. Roll the dough ball in sugar to coat. Place each ball about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until chocolate softens and cookie is set, about 6 minutes. Flatten cookies immediately by pressing on them with the bottom of a glass.

Description: 
Just like the ones with the kisses on top, but with the kiss inside! You get more chocolate in a bite that way. Great fun to make with kids, too.
