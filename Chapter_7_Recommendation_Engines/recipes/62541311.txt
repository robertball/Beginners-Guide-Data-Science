Ingredients:
8 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
4 ounces chocolate
2 eggs
1 tsp baking soda
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups caramel sauce
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp vanilla
1/2 litre heavy cream/whipping cream
5 Skor bars

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350C. Melt chocolate in the microwave for approx. 20 seconds; stir once to avoid burning. Meanwhile, whip the softened butter and sugar together. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in the melted chocolate.
2. Combine baking soda, flour and salt. Add a bit to sugar mixture at a time, alternating with the milk. Stir in vanilla.
3. Pour batter into a greased 9x13" pan and bake at 350C for 40 minutes, or until cake springs back up after being poked in the center.
4. While hot, poke holes in the top of the cake with two forks. Pour condensed milk and caramel sauce over the cake evenly. Refridgerate until cool.
5. Whip the heavy cream, sugar and vanilla in an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Top cake with whipped cream, evening it out as you go. Crunch up the Skor bars with a rolling pin and sprinkle on top. Enjoy!
