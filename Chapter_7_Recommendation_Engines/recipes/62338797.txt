Ingredients:
1 box Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix
1 box(3.4oz) Instant Coconut Cream Pudding
1/4 cup Blue Bonnet Butter
1/4 cup low fat sour cream
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl combine cake mix and pudding mix.
In a separate bowl melt butter in microwave.  Mix sour cream into melted butter.  Add vanilla and eggs to wet mixture.  Stir until even.
Stir wet mix into dry mix by hand (or a really strong electric mixer) because the dough will be very stiff.
Place very small spoonfuls of cookie dough onto greased pan and bake until edges are golden.  Be sure to make the cookies very small.
