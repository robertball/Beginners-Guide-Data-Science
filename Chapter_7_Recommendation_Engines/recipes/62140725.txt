Description: 
This is one of the oldest and original headcheese recipes I have, the way it used to be made. We live in New Mexico, so finding a whole hog's head is easy to come by at our Mexican Market. This recipe dates way back, my great grandmother was using this recipe during the depression, when they didn't waste anything!
