Description: 
I had some left over ham, but could not find a recipe I liked. When I was a kid I remember my mom making Casseroles so I figured I would give it a go. Nothing is out of a can but took very little of prep time except to boil the noodles, and to make a basic white sauce. Both me and my wife liked it very much. This should feed 6 people. We actually ate it for left overs we liked it so much.
