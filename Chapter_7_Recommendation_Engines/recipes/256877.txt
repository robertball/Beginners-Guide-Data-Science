Ingredients:
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, or more to taste
2 (6 ounce) (1 1/4-inch-thick) tenderloin steaks
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon minced shallot
2 tablespoons cognac
2 tablespoons red wine
1/4 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Crack peppercorns in a mortar or pestle or with a rolling pin. Press cracked peppercorns into the steaks.
Heat butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add steaks; cook, turning with tongs, until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and cook steaks, turning often, until they begin to firm up and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a plate and cover to keep warm.
Stir shallot into the skillet. Pour in cognac and red wine; simmer, stirring constantly, until reduced, about 2 minutes. Pour in beef broth and simmer, scraping browned bits off the bottom of the skillet, until sauce is smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in cream; cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour cream sauce over steaks.

Description: 
While this may take a while to cook, it is by far my favorite dish. I have been very frustrated with ordering Steak au Poivre when dining out only to find that what I made at home was much better. Hope you enjoy it!
