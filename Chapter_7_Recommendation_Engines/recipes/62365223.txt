Ingredients:
1 pound bacon (or ham or a mixture of both)
4 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 slices white bread, toasted and cut into cubes

Directions:
Cook bacon, drain on paper towels and cut into bite size pieces. (Or cut up 1 pound of ham.) In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, milk and salt. Add the bacon, bread cubes, and cheese, and stir to coat bread cubes evenly.  Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with foil and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours, or overnight.
In the morning, remove casserole from refrigerator and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake covered casserole 45 minutes. Uncover, reduce temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)and bake for an additional 15-30 minutes, or until set.
