Ingredients:
•	3 cups boiled, shredded chicken
•	1 tbsp. butter
•	30 oz. part-skim ricotta cheese
•	½ lb. lasagna noodles
•	1 medium onion, chopped
•	2 tsp. minced garlic from jar
•	2 cans (26.5 oz each) spaghetti sauce
•	1-2 tsp. Italian seasoning, to taste
•	1 cup shredded mozzarella
•	½ cup grated parmesan, divided
•	½ c. shredded sharp cheddar

Directions:
1.	Preheat oven to 350.
2.	Boil about 3 full-size chicken breasts until chicken falls apart easily with a fork.
3.	Drain water, shred chicken and set aside.
4.	Meanwhile boil noodles until al dente.  Lay noodles in a single layer flat on a paper towel to dry.
5.	In small sauté pan, lightly sauté chopped onions and garlic in butter, just until onion is translucent.
6.	In a large bowl, mix onions, garlic, shredded chicken, ricotta cheese, one-half the parmesan cheese, and about 1 cup of spaghetti sauce.  Add Italian seasoning and mix well.
7.	Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining parmesan cheese.  Spread a thin layer of sauce mixture on the bottom of a glass 9x13 dish.
8.	Layer 3 lasagna noodles, spread chicken mixture on top, and then add another thin layer of sauce.  Repeat, leaving a final layer of noodles on top.  Top with remaining sauce, then sprinkle mozzarella and sharp cheddar on top.
9.	Bake for 45 minutes or until heated through, and cheese bubbles.
