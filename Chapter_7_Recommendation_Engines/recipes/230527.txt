Ingredients:
8 ounces pork fatback, diced
2 (16 ounce) packages sauerkraut, drained
2 heads cabbage, cored and sliced into long, thin shreds
5 links kielbasa sausage, cubed

Directions:
Cook fatback in a large pot over low heat until the drippings render out, about 45 minutes, stirring often. Stir sauerkraut and cabbage into the pork drippings, bring to a simmer, and cook until cabbage is very tender, about 3 hours. Stir occasionally. Mix kielbasa into the cabbage and kraut; cook 45 minutes to 1 hour to blend flavors.

Description: 
This is a family recipe passed down from my grandfather and my father who still make every New Year's Day. It's the best. Trust me, you'll love this recipe. It's original and kinda simple. It's 'old school.' Serve with Jewish rye bread, butter, and horseradish. A good side is mashed potatoes with cheese, milk, and butter to create a rich, creamy, tasty mashed potatoes to go with the dish.
