In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add the water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla.  Beat until well combined.  Batter will be thin.

Description: 
My husband's Grandmother used to make these cupcakes every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  They became a family favorite.  I was asked this year to make these in honor of her memory.  They are very delicious with a nice cream cheese surprise in the center!
