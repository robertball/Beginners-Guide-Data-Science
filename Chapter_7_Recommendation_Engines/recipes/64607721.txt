Ingredients:
2 1/2 C flour (I use unbleached)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 C butter
1/2 C coconut oil
1 C white sugar
1 C brown sugar
1 C persimmon puree
2 eggs
2 t vanilla extract
1 3/4 C dry rolled oats
2 C unsweetened date pieces (the ones I purchased were coated in oat flour to keep them from sticking)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375.
Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl and set aside.
Cream together the butter and coconut oil with the sugars until fluffy.  Beat in the persimmon pulp.  Add the eggs and vanilla and beat until well combined, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally.
By hand, stir the flour mixture into the wet mixture.  When thoroughly combined, add the oats and dates and mix well.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto un-greased cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart.  Bake in preheated oven 10-12 minutes, until golden brown.  Allow to cool on sheets a few minutes before removing to wire racks.

Description: 
What does one do with an extra cup of persimmon puree and a couple of cups of date pieces?  One comes up with a new cookie recipe!   These turned out the moundy-type cookies that our family so loves.   When my husband commented 'These might be the best cookies you've ever made',  I knew they were good enough to share.
