Ingredients:
6 pounds ground venison
2 pounds ground pork
1/4 cup sugar-based curing mixture (such as Morton® Tender Quick®)
1 tablespoon fresh-ground black pepper
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons dried sage

Directions:
In a very large bowl or plastic tub, sprinkle the venison and pork with the curing mixture, pepper, pepper flakes, sugar, and sage. Mix very well to evenly incorporate everything. When working with large quantities of sausage, cook a small piece to make sure the seasoning is exactly how you like it.
Divide into 1 pound portions and freeze.

Description: 
My husband is a avid hunter and we make this sausage every year.  We add pork to the venison because the venison has such a low fat content.  For the pork we get really fatty looking roast ground at our grocery store.
