Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 (3 ounce) fillets salmon fillets
2 red bell peppers, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, sliced
Sauce:
6 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon maple syrup
5 cloves garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
1 lemon, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a sheet pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Place salmon fillets, red and yellow bell peppers, and onion on the prepared sheet pan.
Combine lemon juice, 3 tablespoons olive oil, water, maple syrup, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, cumin, and parsley in a small bowl. Drizzle 2/3 of the sauce over the ingredients on the sheet pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
Serve with lemon slices and remaining sauce.
