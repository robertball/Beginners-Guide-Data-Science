Description: 
Depending on whom you talk to, making ice cream floats with beer is either a genius idea, or a horrible mistake. The key is to choose a beer that's on the toasty, malty, sweeter side, and stay away from beers that are too hoppy, dry, and bitter. Here I pair coffee ice cream with stout and vanilla, the safest option, with a Belgian raspberry sour (or any fruity beer). I'd make a small test glass first, to make sure it works for your palate.
