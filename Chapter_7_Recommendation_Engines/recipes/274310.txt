Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
2 tablespoons grated ginger
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
5 large carrots, chopped
1 tablespoon red curry powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bay leaf
1 cup vegetable stock
1 mandarin orange, peeled and juiced

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, and cook, covered, until onion starts to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ginger and garlic; saute until garlic starts to brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add carrots, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Increase heat to high and cook until carrots begin to soften and spices become fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add vegetable stock to deglaze the pot. Lower heat and simmer until carrots start to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a slow cooker and add the juice and peel of the mandarin orange.
Cover and cook on Low until carrots are soft enough to be smashed with a fork, about 8 hours. Remove orange peel and bay leaf.  Puree soup with an immersion blender until completely smooth.
