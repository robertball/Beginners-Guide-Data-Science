Ingredients:
4 Bosc pears, halved and cored
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup Cointreau or other orange liqueur

Directions:
Place the pears into a large saucepan. Fill with enough water to cover the pears by 1 inch. Stir in the sugar and bring to a boil. Cook uncovered until the liquid has reduced into a light syrup, this may take up to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool until just warm, then stir in the liqueur and serve.
