Description: 
Using vinaigrette as a sauce for grilled meats is one of my favorite 'cheats' of all time. They take minutes to whisk together, there's absolutely no culinary finesse required, and the combinations of oils, vinegar, and flavorings are limitless. How about balsamic vinaigrette on some grilled skirt steak? Maybe mustard dressing on some pork chops? How could grilled chicken drizzled with Greek dressing and feta cheese not be awesome?
