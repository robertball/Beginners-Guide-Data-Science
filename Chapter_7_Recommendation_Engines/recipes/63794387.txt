Ingredients:
5 slices bacon, chopped roughly
1 Tbsp butter
1 tsp bacon drippings, reserved
2 leeks, chopped
4 large eggs
1 cup milk
1 cup ricotta cheese
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp. ground pepper
1/8 tsp grated nutmeg

Directions:
In a large pan, fry the bacon until crisp, set aside on paper towels.  Reserve bacon fat in a cup or mug, clean out pan.  Add butter and 1 teaspoon reserved bacon drippings to the pan.  Over medium heat cook the leeks until tender, about ten minutes.  Turn off heat, and let leeks cool in pan.
Preheat oven to 350.
In a bowl whisk eggs, add milk and ricotta until creamy.  There may be a few small lumps of ricotta, but that is fine.  Add salt, pepper, nutmeg and stir.  Fold in leeks and roughly chopped bacon.  Lightly spray and deep dish pie pan and pour in mixture.  Place in center of oven rack and cook for 40 minutes.  Allow quiche to cool on a trivet or cooling rack for 15 minutes, then serve.
