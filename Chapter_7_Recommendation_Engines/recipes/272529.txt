Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
7 fluid ounces water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon tapioca starch
1 egg yolk, beaten (optional)
2 teaspoons pandan flavor
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Heat coconut milk over medium-high heat in a small pot until it just begins to bubble, about 5 minutes.
Combine water, cornstarch, and tapioca starch in the empty coconut milk can; stir until all starches are dissolved.
Add water and starch mixture to coconut milk, stirring gently. Keep mixing until thoroughly combined, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in well beaten egg yolk. Keep cooking pudding over medium heat for 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds to prevent it from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add pandan and salt; stir for 30 seconds more. Remove from heat and let settle until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
Sankaya! My mother taught me how to make this very simple Thai breakfast/dessert.  This snack is often found on street vendor carts on the streets of Thailand (though I've grown accustomed to my mom's flavor over the years).  Serve with a nice soft loaf of bread (steamed French bread is best) and dip in this sweet and savory custard pudding.
