Ingredients:
1 lb. lean ground turkey
1 can sloppy joe sauce (eg. Manwich), divided
1&1/4 c. buttermilk baking mix
1/3 c. milk
1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Brown ground turkey in a large skillet until no longer pink. Drain well and return to pan.  Add all but 1-2 tablespoons sloppy joe sauce and cook until slightly thickened.
In a mixing bowl, stir together baking mix, milk, and remaining 1-2 tablespoons sloppy joe sauce (mixture should be slightly thin, like a thick brownie batter rather than biscuit dough; if too thick, add a bit more milk).
Grease an 8 or 9 inch square casserole.  Spread turkey mixture evenly in casserole and sprinkle with cheese.  Carefully spread biscuit mixture over top of cheese (do not press too vigorously - this part is like icing a hot cake so be careful to keep the layers separate).
Bake for 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven until biscuit layer is cooked through and top is golden brown.  Allow to cool slightly so that the casserole can set up and allow for easier serving.
This recipe also freezes well.

Description: 
I came up with this one night when I was making sloppy joes and realized that I didn't have any buns.  Now my husband requests this instead of traditional sloppy joes - surprising since sloppy joes are his favorite food!
