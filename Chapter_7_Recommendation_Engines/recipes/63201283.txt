Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
4 cloves finely chopped garlic
6 ears fresh sweet corn, cut off the cob
¾ cup milk
1 cup crumbled or shredded blue or gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium/high heat then add olive oil, butter, and garlic.  Sauté garlic for 1 minute.  Add corn and stir to cover all corn with skillet contents.  Stir fry on medium/high heat for 3 minutes.  Add milk and bring skillet to a simmer.  Cover skillet and reduce heat to low.  Simmer for 10 minutes.
Uncover skillet and continue simmering until liquid is almost gone.  Add cheese and stir to melt, just before serving.
Note: The cheese will melt very quickly when added to the skillet.  Do not add the cheese until ready to serve as it will become almost liquid if heated too much.  Add additional milk if reheating contents (without the cheese) just before serving.
