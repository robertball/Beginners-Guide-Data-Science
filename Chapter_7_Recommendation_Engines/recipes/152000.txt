Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) package white chocolate, chopped
1/3 cup crushed peppermint candies
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon shortening

Directions:
Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with foil and spray with cooking spray. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt the white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth; 1 to 2 minutes (depending on your microwave). Stir in crushed peppermint candy. Spread evenly in prepared 8x8 pan; refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Break the bark into bite size pieces.
Melt the semisweet chocolate with the shortening in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Dip bark pieces 3/4 of the way into melted chocolate; shake off excess chocolate. Place on prepared baking sheet; refrigerate until set.
