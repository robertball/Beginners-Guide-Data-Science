Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1 TBSP lime juice
1 1/2 tsp blackened seasoning (dry)
1/8 tsp cumin
2 tsp margarine
1/4 cup water
Hot cooked couscous

Directions:
Remove fat from chicken. Mix 1 1/2 tsp of the lime juice, the seasoning mixture and cumin.  Rub mixture evenly over both sides of chicken.
Spray 10-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat.  Melt margarine in skillet.  Cook chicken in margarine about 8 minutes, turning once, until chicken is no longer pink when centers of thickest pieces are cut.  Remove from skillet; keep warm.
Add remaining 1 1/2 tsp lime juice and the water to drippings in skillet.  Heat to boiling.  Boil and stir about 45 seconds or until liquid is reduced to about 2 tablespoons.  Spoon sauce over chicken.  Serve with couscous.
