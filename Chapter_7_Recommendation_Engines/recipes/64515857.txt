Ingredients:
1 lb. cranberries
1 large Granny Smith apple
1 large red apple
2 oranges
3/4 - 1 cup sugar (depends how sweet you want the salad)
2 - 3 oz. boxes cherry gelatin (can also use sugar-free gelatin)
3 1/2 cups water
1 cup pecans or walnuts (whatever your preference)

Directions:
1.  Grind the cranberries, apples and oranges with rind, with a hand grinder, Salad Shooter®, KitchenAid® attachment or whatever method you choose to use.  You want it to be a pretty small grind.  You can grind all the fruit in one bowl and save the liquid with the fruit.
2.  Bring water and sugar to a boil.
3.  Add gelatin and stir until dissolved.
4.  Add the fruit mixture and nuts; stir well.
5.  Pour in large container or cake pan.
6.  Refrigerate until set.

My 'most favorite' part of the Thanksgiving meal!  Of all the cranberry salads I've had, this is the BEST, in my humble opinion.
