Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup tapioca starch
1/2 cup potato starch
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground ginger
1 pinch ground cloves
1/2 cup quinoa
1/2 cup flax seeds
1/2 cup toasted almonds
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
3 eggs, room temperature
1 cup plain yogurt
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup agave nectar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini, squeezed dry
2 cups shredded carrot
1 apple, grated
3/4 cup raisins, soaked in hot water and drained (optional)

Directions:
Lightly grease 18 muffin cups.
Sift brown rice flour, tapioca starch, potato starch, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a bowl.
Place quinoa, flax seeds, almonds, and sunflower seeds in a coffee grinder; process until mixture is finely ground. Add mixture to rice flour mixture.
Beat eggs, yogurt, brown sugar, coconut oil, agave nectar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Stir rice flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is just blended. Fold zucchini, carrot, apple, and raisins into batter; divide evenly between prepared muffin cups. Let batter rest for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I was in the process of tweaking a Zucchini Carrot Muffin recipe to my taste when we found out we couldn't have gluten. This recipe is now better that any of the gluten efforts. I try to keep these in the freezer, but have trouble staying ahead of the crowd.
