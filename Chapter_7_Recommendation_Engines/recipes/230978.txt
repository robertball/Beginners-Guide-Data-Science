Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 (7 ounce) package almond paste, grated through large holes of grater
10 tablespoons butter, melted
3 eggs, at room temperature
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh raspberries
3 tablespoons sliced almonds
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine white sugar, almond paste, and butter in mixing bowl; beat with an electric hand mixer on medium speed until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat on high for 3 minutes.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond paste mixture and beat until just combined. Pour 2 1/4 cups of batter into prepared pan, gently smoothing to edges. Arrange blueberries and raspberries atop the batter layer; top with remaining batter. Sprinkle almonds over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Gently slide a knife around the inside edge of the pan and release springform circle.
Lightly dust cake with confectioners' sugar.
