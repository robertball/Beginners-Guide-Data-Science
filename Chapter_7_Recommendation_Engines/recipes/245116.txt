Ingredients:
1 cup plain yogurt
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil
1 pound ground beef
3/4 cup water
1 envelope taco seasoning mix
1 (4.6 ounce) package taco shells
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2/3 large English cucumber, thinly sliced
2 large carrots, thinly sliced
4 sun-dried tomatoes, cut into strips
hot sauce to taste

Directions:
Stir yogurt and basil together in a bowl; place in refrigerator.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir water and taco seasoning into beef; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer beef mixture until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Spoon about 1 tablespoon yogurt mixture into each taco shell; layer in beef mixture, mozzarella cheese, cucumber, carrots, and a few strips of sun-dried tomato. Top with hot sauce and remaining yogurt.
