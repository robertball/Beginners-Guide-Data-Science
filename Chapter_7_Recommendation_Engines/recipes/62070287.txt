Ingredients:
2 tbsp. softened cream cheese, plain or flavoured
4 eggs
1 tsp. butter

Directions:
Beat cream cheese with wisk or fork until creamy.  Add eggs, and beat well.  There will be little lumps of cream cheese in the eggs, but don't worry.
Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.  Pour in egg mixture and cook to your desired consistency(about 3-5 minutes).

Description: 
A magazine I read suggested adding cream cheese to your scrambled eggs for added creaminess and flavour, and it really makes a big difference!  Use plain cream cheese, or flavoured for a special treat.  This is a safe amount of cream cheese, any more, and your eggs will be slimy not creamy!  Try this simple addition the next time you make scrambled eggs!
