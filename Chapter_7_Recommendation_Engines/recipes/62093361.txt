Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 cup warm water
Optional*
Honey or powdered sugar

Directions:
Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. Add warm water in small amounts and knead dough until soft but not sticky. Adjust flour or water as needed. Cover bowl and let stand about 15 minutes.
Pull off large egg-sized balls of dough and roll out into fairly thin rounds. Fry rounds in hot oil until bubbles appear on the dough, turn over and fry on the other side until golden.
Serve hot. Try brushing on honey, or
powdered sugar on top, or both.
