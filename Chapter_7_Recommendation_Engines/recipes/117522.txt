Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
TOPPINGS:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
3 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first five ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 16-in. x 11-in. rectangle. Transfer to a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Build up edges slightly. Prick dough thoroughly with a fork. Brush with oil; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and garlic salt. Top with spinach, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 17-22 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 2-3 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.

Description: 
A bread machine saves time when preparing the thick homemade crust for this Italian treat. 'My boys happily call it green pizza due to all of the spinach,' shares Sharlin Blamires of Coweta, Oklahoma. And because Sharlin leaves out the meat and uses fresh tomatoes instead of canned sauce, her pizza is much lower in salt than most carryout pies.
