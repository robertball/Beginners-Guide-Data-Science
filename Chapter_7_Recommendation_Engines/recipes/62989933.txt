Ingredients:
2.5 pounds spaghetti squash
1 500g package of bacon (higher quality recommended)
1/4 minced red bell pepper
2 tbsp dried parsley
(salt)

Directions:
Half and seed squash, place upside down on plate with small amount of water, cover and cookin microwave for approx 15 minutes for larger squash or 10 minutes for smaller squash until you can push on the skin and it pushes in, let sit for 10.
While squash is cooking, slice bacon into 1" squares(easiest with cold bacon straight out of the pack and not separated.  Fry until browned yet tender.
I prefer to use all the bacon fat as the squash is fairly absorbent and it makes it super tasty, If desired, drain to taste, but leave enough for frying.   Add bell peppers and fry until tender.
Add parsley.  Add cooked spaghetti squash, stir-fry for a couple minutes.  Serve.
May wish to add some salt if you are using low salt bacon or drained most of the grease.
