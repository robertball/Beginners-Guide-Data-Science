Ingredients:
2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 Tbsp fresh minced garlic (click  for cooking tips)
1 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 red chili, seeded and diced (use seeds to add spice)
1 lb mild Italian chicken sausage, casings removed
1 large sweet potato, cubed
1 cup red lentils, rinsed
1 can (15.5oz) black beans
1 can (14.5oz) diced tomatoes and 1 petite diced tomatoes, drained
2 Tbsp tomato paste (I prefer in a tube)
2 cups unsalted chicken broth
3 cups water
1 (13.5oz) can coconut milk
1.5 tsp salt
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
2 bay leaves
Chopped cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Heat olive oil on medium heat.  Add in onion, cook 3-4 minutes until softened.  Next, add garlic, ginger and red chili.  Stir and cook another 2 minutes.  Add in sausage, constantly breaking up for 5 minutes until brown.
Add the remainder of the ingredients, stirring after each addition.
Bring to a boil and let simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the lentils and sweet potatoes are soft and soup is at the consistency you prefer (you may add more water if the soup gets too thick).
Remove the bay leaves from the soup, add to bowls and top with cilantro.  Serve with Five Grain baguette.
