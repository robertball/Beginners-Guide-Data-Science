Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash.

Place the stuffing in a 2 quart baking dish. Layer with turkey and cover with 1 cup gravy. Top with mashed potatoes and the remaining gravy.
Bake covered in the preheated oven 45 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly browned.

Description: 
Turkey Delight is a delicious way to use everyone's favorite Thanksgiving leftovers in a single dish. Turkey, gravy, potatoes and stuffing form a magnificent holiday quartet. I often prepare the dish on Thanksgiving Day, then cook it a few days later.
