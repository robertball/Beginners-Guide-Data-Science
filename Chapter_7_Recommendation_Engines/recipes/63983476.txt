Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
4 cups blended apples
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Chop apples in quarters (no need to peel) and remove seeds.
Blend in blender, gradually adding more pieces, until apples look like thick applesauce and come to four cups.
Add the other ingredients(you can put the water in earlier if the apple pieces aren't blending up nicely) and blend again until everything is mixed.
You're done!  No need to cook this applesauce.  Store in refrigerator (it freezes well, too).

Description: 
The recipe calls for apples, but you can use pears or other hard fruit (or a combination).  I make it with jujubes, which are cheap and plentiful in Taiwan where I live.  I recommend using a little less lemon juice and cinnamon at first, then taste it and possibly add more depending on the flavor of your fruit.  You may want to increase the sugar if your fruit is tart.
