Ingredients:
1 tsp cannola oil
1/2 of a medium onion, chopped
1 bell pepper, chopped
1 tsp chilli powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 (14.5 oz.) can black beans, drained
1 (14.5 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes, drained
1 and 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup shredded finely shredded cheddar cheese
12 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup salsa or pico de gallo
1/2 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt

Directions:
Warm the  oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion and the bell pepper. Cook stirring occasionally until softened, 3-5 minutes.
Add the chili powder, salt and smoked paprika. Stir. Add the quinoa, beans, tomatoes and water or broth. Stir. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and allow to simmer until all liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is soft, about 13-16 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat and uncover. Fluff the quinoa with a fork. Sprinkle with the cheddar cheese. Return cover and allow the heat from the quinoa to melt the cheese.
Serve the quinoa mixture in flour tortillas with the salsa and sour cream.

Description: 
This quick and easy dinner is all cooked in one skillet, meaning that it's a breeze to make and to clean up afterwards. This is a meatless dinner and yet it is very satisfying due to the protein in both the beans and the quinoa. The leftovers from the skillet make a wonderful side dish on their own and an even more delicious soup, just add broth! Note: This dish can be made ahead. Make the quinoa and bean filling ahead and then cover and refrigerate. Warm it up and add the cheese.
