Directions:
Combine water and sugar in a small pot over medium heat. Whisk until sugar dissolves in the water. Add 12 mint leaves. Bring to a boil and whisk for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool, about 30 minutes.
Place lime and 12 mint leaves in a glass; mash together with a muddler to extract flavors. Add fresh mango; muddle until combined. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the mint simple syrup. Stir in coconut rum. Fill glass with ice and top with club soda. Stir 1 more time to distribute flavors.

Description: 
This is a fun alternative to a standard mojito that I kinda came up with just playing around one day! Perfect drink for sipping by the pool, or chugging after a long day of work! If you want to be real fancy, feel free to garnish glass with mint, lime, and/or mango.
