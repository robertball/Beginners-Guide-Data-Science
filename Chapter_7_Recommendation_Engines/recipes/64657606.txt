Ingredients:
4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups water lukewarm
1/2 cup milk lukewarm
2 tsp salt
1 tbsp active dry yeast
1 tsp sugar
butter for brushing
Kosher Sea Salt
5 tbsp baking soda

Directions:
In the bowl of your mixer, combine the warm water with the yeast and lightly stir. In another large bowl, mix the salt, sugar, and flour together. When the yeast dissolves, add the flour mixture and the warm milk. Using the dough attachment, mix everything until the dough comes together and is no longer sticky. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size in a greased bowl, and covered with a damp towel. It should take about an hour.
Punch down the dough and divide it into 9 pieces. Take each piece and roll it into a long rope, about 3 to 4 feet and about 3/4 of an inch in diameter. Shape each rope into a pretzel shape and place them onto greased cookie sheets and let them rise again for about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 500 F degrees.
In a large pot, make a bath with baking soda and boiling water. Using a large spoon, lower each pretzel into the water and leave in for about 30 seconds to a minute. You don't have to wait until they float. Return the pretzels to the cookie sheet and brush them with melted butter and sprinkle them generously with the Kosher sea salt.
Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes, depending on the oven. When you take them out of the oven you can brush them again with butter and serve them hot and/or with mustard.
