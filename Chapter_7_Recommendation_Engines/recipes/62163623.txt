Ingredients:
1 brick cream cheese  (no fat free!)
1 chub of Jimmy Dean or Owen's original sausage
1-2 lbs fresh small or medium sized button mushrooms
A few shakes of garlic salt with parsley

Directions:
With only a damp paper towel, clean all dirt off of mushrooms. Then pop off stems and carefully remove the gills from caps. In a skillet, smash up the sausage and fry until done. Drain all of the grease off of the sausage, add the garlic salt. Stir in cream cheese. Align clean mushrooms on a cookie sheet then proceed to fill each cap with cream cheese mixture. Place in oven for 30-40 minutes @ 375 degrees.
