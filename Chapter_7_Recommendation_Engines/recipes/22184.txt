Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds boneless double center loin roast
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons chili sauce
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 green bell pepper cut into eighths
1 onion, quartered
4 cloves garlic, crushed
salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Remove fat from pork. Pierce pork deeply all over with meat fork or skewer. Place pork in heavy resealable plastic food-storage bag. Place remaining ingredients except salt and pepper to taste, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in blender or food processor. Cover and blend until smooth. Pour blended mixture over pork. Seal bag; place in dish. Refrigerate at least 4 hours but no longer than 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Remove pork from marinade; refrigerate marinade. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper to taste. Place pork on rack in shallow roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of thickest part of pork and does not rest in fat.
Roast uncovered 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours 15 minutes or until thermometer reads 155 degrees. Remove pork from pan. Cover and let stand 15 to 20 minutes or until thermometer reads 160 degrees (medium doneness).
Pour marinade into 1 1/2-quart saucepan. Stir in sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Heat to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens slightly. Serve sauce with pork.
