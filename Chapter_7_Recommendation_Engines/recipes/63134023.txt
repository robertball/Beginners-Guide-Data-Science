Ingredients:
4 cups extra thick rolled oats
3/4 cup wheat germ
3/4 cup oat bran
1/2 cup finely chopped almonds
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup
6 Tbsp. honey
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 Tbsp. real vanilla extract
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries OR 1 cup mini chocolate morsels OR 1 cup chopped dates

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment or aluminum foil.
Combine the oats, wheat germ, oat bran, almonds, pecans, and walnuts in a large bowl.  Stir together the salt, brown sugar, maple syrup, honey, oil, cinnamon, and vanilla in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then pour over the dry ingredients, and stir to coat. Spread the mixture out evenly on the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until crispy and toasted, about 25 minutes. Stir once halfway through. Cool, then stir in the cranberries or chocolate before storing in an airtight container.
