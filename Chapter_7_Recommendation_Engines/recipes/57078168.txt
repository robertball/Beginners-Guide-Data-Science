Ingredients:
5 small-medium portobellos -*-
1 8oz package cream cheese, softened -*-
1 6-8oz salmon fillet -*-
about 1/3lb bacon -*-
2-3 green onions -*-
1/2 roasted red bell pepper -*- about
1tsp lemon pepper -*-
about 1/3 cup bread crumbs (I used crushed Caesar croutons).

Directions:
Cut the bacon crosswise into 1/4in. strips and fry until crisp. Drain on paper towels.
Remove stems from mushrooms and saute in bacon grease until soft, remove from pan into mixing bowl and add green onion, red pepper, and lemon pepper.
Saute salmon in remaining bacon grease until done, about ten minutes.
Let cool and flake with fork or fingers into veggie mixture.
Fold cream cheese and bacon in until blended.
Stuff mushroom caps and top with bread crumbs or crushed croutons. Bake in 350 oven for 20 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and crumbs have browned. -*- I think that's it. They were VERY good. Hope you like them! ;)
