Ingredients:
3 celery ribs, chopped
1 cup sliced fresh carrots
3 (14.5 ounce) cans reduced sodium chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 cups cooked, cubed chicken breast
1 2/3 cups reduced-fat biscuit/baking mix
2/3 cup fat-free milk

Directions:
In a Dutch oven coated with nonstick cooking spray, saute celery and carrots for 5 minutes. Stir in the broth, poultry seasoning and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered. Add the chicken.
For dumplings, combine biscuit mix and milk. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto simmering broth. Cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean (do not lift cover while simmering).
