Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely crushed buttery crackers (such as Ritz®)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 pound sea scallops, patted dry
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C).
Mix cracker crumbs, garlic powder, and seafood seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Place melted butter in a second shallow bowl.
Dip each scallop in the melted butter and then roll in the breading until completely coated. Set on a plate and repeat with the remaining scallops.
Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Arrange scallops in the prepared basket so that they are not touching each other; you may need to work in batches.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 2 minutes. Turn scallops over gently with a small spatula and cook until opaque, about 2 more minutes.
