1 can(27 oz) whole green chiles (not jalapeños!)
1 lb. monterey jack cheese, shredded
6 eggs, separated

Pre-heat oven to 350º F.
Layer bottom of a 9x13 glass or ceramic baking dish with 1/2 can unfolded chiles, then layer 1/2 of the cheese. Repeat layer.
Whisk egg whites till soft peaks form.
Beat flour, evaporated milk and salt into egg yolks. Fold egg yolk mixture into whites.
Pour and spread egg mixture evenly over the top.
Cover with aluminum foil, slightly tented, making sure that foil does not lay on the egg mixture, and bake for 20 min.
Carefully remove cover and bake for another 15 min. until egg is lightly golden-browned.
Remove from oven. Re-cover with aluminum foil and let sit for 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
My friend Gary showed me this great casserole. He says growing up it was his favorite dinner that his mom made. It IS pretty darn good - and easy too! Not too spicy so even kids will enjoy this.
