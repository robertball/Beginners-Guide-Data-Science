Ingredients:
250g Ginger cake
450g Tin of pears Â– drained and quartered
150ml Cider
50g Dark brown sugar
300ml Home-made Custard
150ml Whipped/Topping cream
Glazed ginger
Almonds

Directions:
Cut the ginger cake into slices and arrange at the bottom of the trifle dish.
Next cut the pears into slices (Or keep quartered if you prefer) and layer on top of the cake.
Dissolve the sugar in the cider over a low heat, then pour over the cake and pears, allow to absorb.  I usually allow at least 30 minutes.
Pour cooled custard over the moist cake base and when set (If I have time leave in the fridge overnight), decorate with the whipped cream, sliced toasted almonds and glazed ginger.
