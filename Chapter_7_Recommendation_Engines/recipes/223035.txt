Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 small onion, diced
1 large portobello mushroom, cut into chunks
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 cup hot water
1/3 cube low-sodium vegetable bouillon
1 large potato, cut into cubes
1 kohlrabi bulb, cut into cubes
1 carrot, thinly sliced
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/3 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as HerbamareÂ®)
ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons miso paste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in butter for 1 minute. Stir mushroom into onion; continue cooking and stirring until mushroom softens, about 3 minutes more. Pour soy sauce over mushroom mixture; cook for 1 minute and remove from heat.
Pour hot water into a casserole dish. Stir bouillon in the hot water to dissolve. Mix potato, kohlrabi, and carrot in the bouillon mixture. Add mushroom mixture to potato mixture; stir. Top with bay leaf, parsley, seasoned salt, and black pepper. Stir again to evenly distribute seasoning.
Divide miso into 4 portions; place atop vegetable mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, stir, and continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes more.

Description: 
As a vegetarian, I'm always looking for interesting ways to combine vegetables. The flavorful gravy in this dish comes from the mushroom-soy sauce-miso combination. Eat alone or as a side dish. Enjoy!
