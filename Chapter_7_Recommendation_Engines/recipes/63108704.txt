Ingredients:
•1 leftover turkey carcass or rotisserie chicken carcass (put in all reminents from the bottom of the container too)
•water to cover
•1 large onion, chopped
•1/2 bag baby carrots, diced
•2 celery ribs, diced
•1/2 stick of butter, cubed
•1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
•1-2 cups half-and-half cream or whole milk
•16 oz Package of lundberg wild rice blend
•2 teaspoons salt, not needed if using rotisserie chicken
•1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules (or more, sometimes much more, add this until it tastes right)
•white pepper to taste
•sage, thyme, rosemarry to taste (fresh or dry)

Directions:
1.Place carcass in a soup kettle or Dutch oven and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour. Remove carcass; cool. Taste and then add bouillon until the broth has the flavor you like for broth. Strain out broth. Remove turkey/chicken from bones and cut into bite-size pieces; set aside.
2.In a soup kettle or Dutch oven, saute the onions, carrots and celery in butter until tender. Reduce heat; stir in flour until blended. Gradually add about 1 qt. of reserved broth. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
3.Add cream, rice, salt, pepper, spices, remaining broth and reserved turkey/chicken. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until rice is tender and soup is the right consistency.
