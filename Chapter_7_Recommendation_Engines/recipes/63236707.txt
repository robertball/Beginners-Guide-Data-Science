Ingredients:
1 pint strawberries (roughly 2 cups of chopped strawberries)
1/3 c. white sugar
1/2 tsp. almond extract (my favorite) or vanilla extract

Directions:
Wash strawberries and remove stems. If youâ€™re feeling ambitious, you can roughly chop the berries.
Combine berries, sugar, and extract in medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for five minutes, stirring/breaking strawberries up with a wooden spoon constantly.
After five minutes, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly (if you have a glass blender jar) and a lot (if you have a plastic blender jar). When cool enough, transfer mixture to blender and pulse until desired consistency is reached.
