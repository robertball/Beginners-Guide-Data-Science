Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell peppers
2 cups chopped fresh tomato
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried cilantro
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
1 egg white, beaten

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute turkey, garlic, onion, and green pepper until turkey is no longer pink in center. Stir in tomatoes, parsley, cilantro, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, and black pepper. Stirring occasionally, cook over medium heat about 15 minutes or until most the liquid is reduced.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Spray cookie sheet with non-stick oil. Unfold one pie crust in center of cookie sheet. Carefully spread one half of meat mixture to within 1-inch of one-half pie crust. Brush 1 inch of pie crust with egg white. Encase meat by folding other half of pie crust over meat mixture. Using a fork, press edges of crust together and pierce top of crust to make holes to allow steam to escape.
Repeat steps 4 and 5 with remaining ingredients and pie crust. Bake at 400 degrees F. 20 to 25 minutes. To serve, cut each empanada into 4 wedges.
