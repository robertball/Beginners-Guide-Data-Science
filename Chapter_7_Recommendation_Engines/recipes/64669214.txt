Oh Tri Goodness
Description: 
Finally, the underestimated and neglected turnip takes the stage. Oh that crunchy, fuschia goodness! A staple in the Middle East, pickled turnips are the perfect addition to many dishes or wonderful on their own. This recipe will yield two mason jars worth of pickled turnips, but I recommend making more than less since it does require planning ahead by one week.
