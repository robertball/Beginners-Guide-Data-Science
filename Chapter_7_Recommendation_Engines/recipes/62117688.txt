Traci's Cuban Egg Nog ~ Coquito Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 box Anise Seeds
12-16 Cinnamon Sticks
1 handful Whole Cloves
4 cups Water
3 cans Cream of Coconut
3 cans Evaporated Milk
3 cans Sweetened Condensed Milk
12-14 Eggs (use pasturized eggs to be sure they don't contain salmonella)
1/2 - 1.75 Liters Bacardi Light Rum

Directions:
Beforehand, boil the Anise Seeds, Cinnamon Sticks, and the Whole Cloves in the 4 cups of water to make a tea colored liquid.  The darker it is the more flavor it will have.  Set aside to cool completely.  I usually do this the night before.
In a large pot, mix the Cream of Coconut, the Evaporated Milk, and the Sweetened Condensed Milk.  In a blender, blend the eggs with some of the milk mixture.  Pour the egg mixture into the pot with the remaining milk mixture.  Add the cooled tea, and Rum to taste.  Refridgereate and shake before serving.
You might find that you'll need to strain while pouring, the Cream of Coconut sometimes collects at the top of your container and solidifies.  If you shake it well this helps to break up the pieces.  Some pieces may not break up enough so it helps to strain it.

Description: 
This is Good stuff!  After trying this at our Cuban friends on New Years, we asked for the recipe; they were more than willing to share it and even sent us home with a jar for later.  This makes a large batch to share with family and friends.
