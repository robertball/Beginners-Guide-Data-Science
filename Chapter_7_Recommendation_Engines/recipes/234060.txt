Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chicken stock
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 cup baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
4 pattypan squash, grated
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Stir chicken stock and eggs together in a bowl; whisk baking mix into egg mixture until wet. Stir squash, onion, Parmesan cheese, and garlic into baking mix-egg mixture until batter is evenly mixed. Set aside for 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spoon batter, 1/4 cup per pancake, into the hot oil; cook until pancakes are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer pancakes to a brown paper bag-lined surface to drain.

Description: 
A savory side dish using pattypan squash. My family can't wait every year until the squash are ripe and these cheesy little pancakes start showing up on their dinner plates. Crisp and flavorful, you can't eat just one! Keep in warm oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) until ready to serve.
