Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/2 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons whole milk
1 tablespoon butter
4 ounces cooked ham, chopped
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Whisk eggs, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Melt butter in a small nonstick skillet over low heat. Add ham; pour eggs on top. Cook until mostly set but top is still runny, 6 to 8 minutes. Top the frittata with the remaining cheese. Transfer skillet to the broiler.
Broil until the top is golden brown and center is set, about 1 to 2 minutes. Cool briefly and slice into 4 portions. Place in center of tortillas and wrap tightly.
