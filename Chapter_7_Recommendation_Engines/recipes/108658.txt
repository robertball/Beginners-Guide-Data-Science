Ingredients:

4 cups coarse cornmeal

Directions:
Bring the stock to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Pour the cornmeal into stock in a steady stream while stirring vigorously until thickened.  Cook for 40 minutes, stirring often until very thick.
Pour the funchi onto a cold, slightly wet plate, and spread evenly.  Cover with another plate, and allow to set, about 30 minutes. Cut into 8 wedges like a pie to serve.
