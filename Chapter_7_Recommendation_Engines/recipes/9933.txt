Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
3 tablespoons milk
1 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate

Directions:
Combine butter and sugar and egg yolk. Add dry ingredients and milk alternately.
Divide dough into 2 equal parts.  Melt chocolate over low heat and add to one half of the dough.
Use a rolling pin and roll each half into a rectangle. Put the chocolate rectangle on top of the vanilla one. Roll up like a jelly roll in wax paper.
Chill several hours, best if chilled overnight.
Slice them and bake at 400 degrees (200 degrees C) for about 5 minutes.
