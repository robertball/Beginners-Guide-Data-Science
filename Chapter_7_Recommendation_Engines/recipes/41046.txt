Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate pieces
1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped mixed nuts, peanuts, or cashews
1 (1 ounce) square white chocolate

Directions:
Place semisweet chocolate pieces in a heavy medium saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly just until melted. Stir in nuts. Spoon mixture by rounded teaspoons into 1-3/4-inch muffin cups lined with paper bake cups.
Place white chocolate in a heavy small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly just until melted. Drizzle a small amount of the white chocolate atop each cluster; swirl gently with a toothpick to create a marbled effect. Chill until firm (about 30 minutes in refrigerator or 10 minutes in freezer).
