Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds nectarines
1 (6 ounce) container fresh raspberries
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
7 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature and cut into chunks
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Submerge nectarines for about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool until safe to handle. Peel, halve, remove pit, and slice. Combine sliced nectarines, raspberries, and white sugar in a bowl. Transfer to a baking dish.
Combine brown sugar, butter, flour, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a bowl. Rub between your fingers to create streusel. Sprinkle streusel evenly over fruit.
Bake in the preheated oven until crumble is lightly browned, 45 to 60 minutes.
