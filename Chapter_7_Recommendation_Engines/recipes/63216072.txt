Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Fat Free Cream Cheese
2 Tbsp Fat Free Ricotta Cheese
1/3 Cup Mashed Potatoes*
2 tsp. relish
1 tsp. spicy brown mustard
1 tsp yellow mustard
1 tbsp pasteurized egg substitute (Egg Beaters)
2 drops TobascoÂ®
1 tsp buffalo sauce
1 tsp paprika plus addt'l for garnish
1 tsp turmeric powder
6 eggs

Directions:
Bring a 2quart pan filled with hot water to a boil. Lower in your six eggs and boil for 10-12 min. Run the eggs under cold water and peel. Put in a container in the refrigerator at least two hours prior to the next step.
In a work bowl, combine all remaining ingredients until fully integrated. Cover work bowl and refrigerate at least one hour.
Cut the cold eggs in half, and discard the yolks. You can spoon the mixture into the egg whites, or use a pastry bag to pipe them in if you want to be more decorative. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.

Description: 
I love deviled eggs, but the cholesterol doesn't love me back. I also have a family that hates mayonaise, even the fat free. This is a great, easy recipe. If you're a mayo lover, exchange that for the egg substitute. Make sure to give yourself enough time for everything to cool!
