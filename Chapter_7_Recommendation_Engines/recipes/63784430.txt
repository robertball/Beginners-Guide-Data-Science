1 tsp dijon mustard

1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp lemon zest
1 Tbsp mayonnaise or non-fat plain Greek yogurt
1 tsp Greek seasoning (or Italian or other herb seasoning blend)

Fresh ground black pepper
Scant 1 tbsp chopped herbs (parsley, basil, mint or combination)

Directions:
Chop or mash hard boiled eggs.  Add chopped olives and scallion.
In a small bowl, whisk together dijon mustard, olive oil and lemon juice until emulsified; stir in lemon zest, mayonnaise and seasonings and fresh herbs.  Add to egg mixture and stir to combine.
Serve with toasted pita strips or crackers.

Description: 
A flavorful twist on egg salad - had to use up some hard boiled eggs and a few olives, as I was cleaning out the fridge!  I think the brine of the olives makes this too salty for a sandwich filling, but it is perfect to serve as a snack or appetizer with some crackers.
