Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
2 tablespoons dried chopped onions
1/2 small cabbage - chopped
3/4 c shredded cheddar cheese
pepper to taste
1 (8 count) package crescent rolls

Directions:
Brown ground beef with dried chopped onions, drain. Add chopped cabbage and pepper to pan with ground beef mixture - cook until cabbage is tender. Remove from heat, add cheese.
Separate crescent rolls into 8 triangles - using a rolling pin, roll crescents to about 1/4" thick.  Place 1 1/2 - 2 spoonfuls per cresent about 1/4" in from end.  Pull the end over the meat mixture and roll the crescent.  Pull the sides over to the middle.  It should look like a diaper when it is all rolled up.
Bake in oven at 350 for 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Sprinkle with extra cheese and bake until melted if you choose.

Description: 
I make these Easy Bierocks when I don't have the time or ingredients to make the dough for regular bierocks.  Great for weekday lunches! I brown all my ground beef for the week at one time with dried chopped onion so all I have to do is add the rest of the ingredients - this saves a lot of time throughout the week when I am extremely busy!  I make extra and freeze them after they've been cooked - great to grab and take to work!
