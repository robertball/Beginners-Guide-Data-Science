Ingredients:
2 and 3/4 cups all purpose Gluten Free flour*
2 tsp salt
3 tsp baking powder
1 cup gluten free beer**
1/2 cup sparkling water
1 red bell pepper
1 onion
1 zucchini
4 chicken breast fillets
1 and 1/2 cup oil for frying

Directions:
Mix the flours, salt and baking powder together using a whisk until they are combined.
Add beer and water to the flour mixture and stir until just combined.  Set aside.
Wash and cut the vegetables into rounds or strips about 1/4 inch thickness.  Let them sit on a paper towel to dry.
Heat oil to 350Â° F.
Dip the vegetables in the batter and fry until golden brown.  Turn over and cook on the other side.  When browned on both sides, place on a paper towel to absorb extra oil.
Lastly, dip chicken into batter and fry the same way as for the vegetables.

Description: 
Gluten Free version of everybody's favourite.  The method and ingredient ratios were suggested to me by members of this site then tweaked by me. I have tested this a few times and these ingredients are optimal for a simple batter which allow the flavour of the vegetables and chicken to shine through.  My whole family enjoyed it, even those who aren't gluten intolerant.
