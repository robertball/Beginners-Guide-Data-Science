Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
2 T salt
2 T black pepper
2 T dark brown sugar
2 T paprika
1/2 T cayenne
Roast:
4 pound shoulder pork roast
2 c apple juice
1 c apple cider vinegar
2 T Worchestershire
1/2 T liquid smoke
1/2 T garlic powder
Cider Vinegar BBQ Sauce:
1 1/2 c cider vinegar
1 c yellow mustard
1/2 c ketchup
1/3 c packed brown sugar
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 t kosher salt
1 t cayanne
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix the dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Sprinkle dry rub all over the pork roast, pressing into the pork.  Cover with plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Combine the liquid ingredients and the garlic powder into a large Dutch oven.  Place the pork in the Dutch oven, add pork and cover tightly with aluminum foil, then the lid.  Roast for 4 hours or until fork tender and shreds easily.  Brush the roast with cooking liquid ever hour.
Once done, remove from oven and allow to cool enough to handle.  Shred the pork with a fork into bite size pieces.
While the pork is roasting, make BBQ sauce.  Combine vinegar, mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, salt, cayenne and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat.  Simmer gently, stirring for 10 minutes until the sugar dissolves.  Take off heat and allow to sit until roast is done and shredded.
Combine pork with BBQ sauce.  Serve on buns and top with your favorite cole slaw.
