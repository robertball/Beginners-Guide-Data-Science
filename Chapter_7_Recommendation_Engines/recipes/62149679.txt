Ingredients:
1 cup Kikkoman low sodium soy sauce
1/3 to 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (to taste)
1/4 cup cold water
1/2 medium onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced; or 2 teaspoons garlic granules
1 inch piece of fresh ginger, sliced thinly
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons brown sugar ... OPTIONAL
red pepper flakes, to taste ... OPTIONAL
3 pounds pork ribs, cut into sections

Directions:
Place all ingredients (except meat) into a small bowl and whisk to mix well.
Place ribs in a container large enough to hold them and pour marinade over the top.
Turn so that all surfaces are exposed to the liquid.
Cover container and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 8 hours. ***See Note
Discard marinade and cook ribs on a grill until brown and done to taste.
***Note***
The type of meat or fish will determine the length of time needed to marinate. Beef or pork can be soaked in marinade the longest.  Chicken will absorb the marinade more quickly and should only be soaked 4-6 hours.  The lemon juice will begin to 'cook' fish if it's left in the marinade too long, so 1 - 2 hours is enough.
