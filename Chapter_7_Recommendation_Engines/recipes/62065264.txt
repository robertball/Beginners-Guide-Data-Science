Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts
2 T. vegetable oil
1/3 c dry white wine
1 1/2  t. minced garlic
3/4 c chicken broth
2 T. fresh lemon juice
2 T. capers, drained
2 T. unsalted butter
Fresh lemon slices
Chopped fresh parsley
Bowtie pasta

Directions:
Prepare cutlets by pounding the dickens out of some chicken breasts situated between two pieces of plastic wrap.  Salt and pepper them, dust with flour and shake off excess.
Spray a sauté pan with nonstick spray; add vegetable oil and heat over medium-high.
Sauté cutlets 2-3 minutes on one side, then 1-2 minutes -covered- on the other.  Move to a warm plate.  Pour off fat from pan.
Deglaze pan with wine and add minced garlic.  Cook until garlic is slightly brown and liquid is nearly gone, about 2 minutes.
Add broth, lemon juice and capers. Return cutlets to pan and cook on each side 1 minute.
Finish with butter and lemon slices.  Once butter melts, pour sauce over cutlets.
Garnish with parsley and serve with bowtie pasta.
