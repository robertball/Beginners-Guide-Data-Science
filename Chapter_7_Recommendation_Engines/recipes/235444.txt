Ingredients:
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1/4 cup dark molasses
1/3 cup chopped crystallized ginger (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sift the flour, ground ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and allspice together into a mixing bowl; stir.
Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Beat egg and molasses into creamed butter mixture. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until just coming together into a batter. Gently fold crystallized ginger through the batter.
Roll rounded teaspoon-sized amounts of dough into small balls between your hands and place onto ungreased baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
Bake in preheated oven until the tops are rounded and slightly cracked, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
