Ingredients:
5 or 6 cups of your favorite tomato sauce
3-5 pounds of boneless pork roast (you want the one with the string around it  ask your butcher)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Frozen peas
Your favorite pasta but I recommend spaghetti or roasted vegetables
Freshly grated parmesan cheese
Cindy’s Tomato Sauce
2 (28 oz) cans of whole tomatoes
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 or 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 cup of extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon of dried oregano
1 bunch of fresh basil, chopped (take off the stem)
1 teaspoon of sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 small can of tomato paste (Italian style)

Directions:
Add your tomato sauce to the slow cooker and set to low.
Season the pork with salt and pepper.
Place roast into sauce and lot cook for 6 hours.
When you are 30 minutes to enjoy this amazing dinner; start your water if you ware making pasta. Take your peas out of the freezer and put in a glass microwave safe bowl or a sauce pan for the stove top. Place peas in the microwave for 2 minutes or heat up on the stove top
Make your pasta by following the directions on the package.
While your pasta is cooking take the roast out of the crock pot and place on a large platter. Remove string. You can put your fork through the pork and it will easily fall apart. Pour a few ladles of sauce on top of the pork
After you heat the peas, place them on the other end of the platter and pour a little ladle of sauce.
Drain the pasta and put into a large serving bowl; add a few ladles of sauce to the top.
Bring the platter to the table along with each plate filled with pasta and serve with parmesan cheese. Don’t forget the mopeen!
Cindy's Tomato Sauce
In a blender add the 2 cans of tomatoes and the basil – puree then set aside!
Heat the oil in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Add onion first then the garlic.
Sauté for about 8-9 minutes. Let simmer for 5 minutes then add in sugar and paste and bring to a boil then reduce to low heat. Pour over your pork roast in the slow cooker!

Description: 
My nana always made this dish on the stove top but I have found the slow cooker works great and I don’t need to worry about the stove being on all day! I will share my slow cooker recipe with you but if you want to make this on the stove  just keep in on low all day!
