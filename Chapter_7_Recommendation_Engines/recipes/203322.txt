Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 ripe bananas, mashed
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Whisk the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat the bananas, eggs, vegetable oil, applesauce, brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla together in a separate large bowl. Stir the flour mixture into the wet mixture. Fold the zucchini, walnuts, and coconut into the batter until evenly combined. Pour into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 25 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
My grandmother came up with this recipe to use up some larger than life zucchini that came from her garden. This is an easy way to use up those leftover bananas too!
