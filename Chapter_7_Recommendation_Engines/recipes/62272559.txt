2 tblsn dill pickle juice
1 lb. loaf processed american cheese, cubed

Directions:
In a skillet, cook bacon strips until browned and crisp, drain on paper towels until cool, then crumble; set aside.
In the same skillet, cook ground beef until well browned. Drain and rinse well in a colander to remove excess fat, then stir in pickle juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.
In a crockpot bowl, combine the processed cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and chiles, ground beef, green onions, cayenne pepper, ketchup, and dijon mustard.
Cover and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally to combine, until cheese mixture is melted.
Once cheese mixture is melted, add crumbled bacon and combine well. Garnish with additional sliced green onions if desired and serve warm with tortilla chips, bagel chips, or corn chip scoops.
