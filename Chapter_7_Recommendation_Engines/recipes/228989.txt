Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup olive oil
1 lime, juiced, or more to taste
1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, finely chopped (optional)
3 tablespoons adobo sauce from chipotle peppers
1 clove garlic, minced
1 pork tenderloin
1 fresh peach, pitted and thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix honey, olive oil, lime juice, chipotle pepper, 3 tablespoons adobo sauce, and garlic together in a bowl.
Place tenderloin in a baking dish; top with peach slices. Pour honey sauce over tenderloin. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let rest for 10 minutes; cut into very thin slices. Serve topped with the cooked peaches and pan juices.

Description: 
This sweet and spicy dish is a flavor explosion with very few ingredients! This recipe was an experiment, and I was very surprised to find the flavor and aroma was very reminiscent of Thai ingredients such as red curry, coconut milk, and lemongrass. The pork will be juicy and flavorful with no need to marinate. Garnish with lime wedges. Enjoy!
