Description: 
My husband begs me to make this all the time and my 2-year-old can't get enough of it! It never lasts for more than a day in our house. If you like guacamole, you will LOVE this recipe. My sister and I have been tweaking it for years and finally have come up with the best recipe ever. The key is to use avocados that are perfectly ripe.
