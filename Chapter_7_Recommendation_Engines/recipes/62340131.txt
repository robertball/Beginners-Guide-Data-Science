Ingredients:
1 c. butter flavored Crisco
1 1/4 c. packed brown sugar
2 tbsp. milk
1 tbsp. real vanilla
1 egg
3/4 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 3/4 c. flour
2 c. chocolate chips

Directions:
Mix first 5 ingredients until combined thoroughly.  Throw in the flour, baking soda and salt, stir until combined.  Add chips and stir.  Bake at 375 just until slightly golden (about 7 minutes) and take out and let sit on the cookie sheet for about 3-4 minutes before removing to the cooling rack.
I have found that taking a large melon baller and using it for sizing my cookies works well!

This is a mish mash of what I finally found works.  If you like cookies to stay soft for days later, you will love this recipe!
