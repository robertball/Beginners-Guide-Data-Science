Ingredients:
1 stalk celery, sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, quartered
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and mashed
1 teaspoon dried sage
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Put a celery slice in a deep skillet with a cover; add olive oil. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat until celery slice is sizzling, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining celery, onion, and garlic to olive oil; turn heat to medium. Cook and stir onion mixture until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix cauliflower, tomatoes, sage, salt, and pepper into onion mixture; cook and stir over medium-high heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes. Cover skillet with lid, reduce heat to low, and cook until a knife slides easily into cauliflower, about 15 minutes. Add chicken broth if tomato and cauliflower sauce begins to burn.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Pour tomato and cauliflower sauce over pasta; add Parmesan cheese. Toss to coat.

Description: 
The sauce was the star here with really deep flavor even though this was something I threw together just to use up some vegetables. You could sub practically any vegetable for the cauliflower, that's just what I happened to have in my veggie drawer! Use any type of pasta you like!
