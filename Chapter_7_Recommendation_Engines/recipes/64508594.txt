Ingredients:
For the quinoa:
½ tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
½ onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
½ teaspoon chili powder
190 grams (1 cup) uncooked quinoa
salt and pepper
500 ml (2 cups) vegetable broth (I used my vegetable stock powder)
For the shrimp:
½ tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
225 grams (1/2 lb) raw shrimp, tail-on
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
¼ teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper
You will also need:
fresh parsley. finely chopped
the juice of half lemon

Directions:
In a fine-meshed strainer, rinse the quinoa under cold running water.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes or until the onion softens slightly.
Add the quinoa and ½ teaspoon of chili powder. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Sautee for 1 minute then add the broth.
Bring to a boil uncovered. When it starts to boil, reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is cooked and tender. Remove from heat, add the parsley and mix well.
While quinoa is cooking, cook the shrimp.
Heat ½ tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, add the shrimp and sprinkle with ¼ teaspoon of chili powder. Season with salt and pepper and sautee until no longer translucent.
Add the garlic and cook until is very fragrant.
Mix the quinoa and shrimp together, drizzle with lemon juice and sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley. Serve the spicy garlic shrimp and quinoa immediately, while still hot.
Enjoy!
