Description: 
Salsify root is pan-roasted in ghee to give you an elegant dish to accompany your meal. Salsify may be grungy-looking, but that dirty exterior hides a delightful flavor. The mix of black, green, white, and red peppercorns give the dish a unique dimension of flavor. Use gloves when handling salsify to avoid the sticky juice getting on your hands.
