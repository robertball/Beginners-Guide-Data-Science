Description: 
This salad is always a winner at parties and potlocks and everyone asks for the recipe afterwards. The good thing about it is that you can prepare it ahead of time (even a day ahead) and leave it in the refrigerator until served. You can have it as a main dish or a side to any entree. We hope you'll love the recipe and enjoy it with family and friends! =)
