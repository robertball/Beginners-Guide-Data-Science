Ingredients:
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
4 pounds beef short ribs (bone-in), trimmed of fat
Ice cubes
1/2 cup barbecue sauce, plus additional for serving
Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Mix the sugar, paprika, chili powder, salt, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Rub all surfaces of meat generously with the dry mixture. Place ribs in the prepared dish in a single layer. Cover and chill the ribs in the refrigerator 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Preheat grill to medium indirect heat. Center one-fourth of the ribs and two ice cubes on a sheet (12x18 inches) of Reynolds Wrap(R) Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil. Bring up foil sides. Double-fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make four packets.
Grill packets on a grill rack over medium (375 degrees F to 400 degrees F) indirect heat in covered grill 1 1/2  to 2 hours or until tender.
Open packets carefully by cutting along top folds with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape.; then open top of foil packet. Brush ribs with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce. Continue grilling over direct medium heat, covered, 5 minutes more until browned and crisp, turning once.
Serve with additional barbecue sauce as desired.
