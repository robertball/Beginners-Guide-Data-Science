Ingredients:
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
½ teaspoon blood orange zest
1 pound skinless rainbow trout fillets
2 tablespoons butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix Parmesan cheese, onion powder, oregano leaves, and blood orange zest together in a shallow dish. Press trout fillets into the Parmesan mixture to coat. Shake off excess and place fillets on a plate.
Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add fillets; cook until brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until flesh flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
These rainbow trout fillets are quick and easy to make. The blood orange zest mingles with the Parmesan to bring out the fish's mild flavors without overpowering it. Cooking it in butter brings a noticeable nutty flavor.
