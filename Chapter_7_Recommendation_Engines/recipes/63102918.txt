Ingredients:
3 lbs. Lean Ground Beef (88% lean or higher)
5 (15.5oz) Can Mexican Style Mild Chili Beans
1 (46oz) Can Tomato Juice
1 (28oz) Can Tomato Puree
1 (14.5oz) Can Diced Tomatoes and Green Chiles
1/4 cup Chili Powder (mild)
2 tbsp. Onion Powder
2 tbsp. Granulated Sugar
1-1/2 tsp. Ground Cumin
1 tsp. Garlic Powder
1 tsp Kosher or Sea Salt (medium)
1/2 tsp Gr. Black Pepper
1/2 tsp Dry Mexican Oregano Leaves

Directions:
Sautee the beef until little moisture remains, but do not brown the meat.
Drain any fat and put the beef in a 5-quart heavy bottom pot.
Rinse the chili beans in a wire sieve under cold running water, and drain.
Puree the diced tomatoes and chiles if you like. Note: the 10 oz. national brand is okay to use.
Add all of the ingredients to the pot with enough water to equal one gallon, and set on medium heat.
Stir frequently until the chili approaches boiling.
Lower the heat, set a lid ajar, and simmer for about 1 hour. Stir every 15 minutes.
When done taste and add salt to suit your taste.
Spice it up with jalapeno sauce, cayenne sauce, habanera sauce, or red pepper flakes.
Another option is to use a crock pot... put the cooked meat and all of the other ingerdients in, and set it on high for 1 hour. Next set to low and forget it for up to 7 hours.

Description: 
I developed this basic recipe for use in a restaurant I cooked for in the mid 80â€™s. I have scaled it down from 15 gallons to about one gallon for home use. It is a thick and hardy family favorite with a little bite .
