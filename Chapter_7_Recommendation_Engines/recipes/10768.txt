Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter
1 1/8 cups rolled oats
2/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
5 toasted bitter almonds, ground
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (225 degrees C).
Melt the butter, and pour it immediately over the oat-grain.  Let the mixture cool down.
Add the sugar, the lightly whipped egg, and the ground bitter almond to the oat mixture.  Combine the flour with the baking powder, and then stir into the dough.
Drop by spoonfuls onto oiled cookie sheets.  Since the cookies float out,  just put 6 to 8 spoonfuls on each sheet.  Bake the cookies in the middle of the oven for about 6 minutes.  Remove and cool.
