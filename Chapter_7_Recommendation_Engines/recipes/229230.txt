Ingredients:
8 cups chicken broth
4 cups wild rice
3 cups cubed, stale cranberry-walnut bread
1 cup chicken broth
1 1/2 cups finely chopped celery
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
3/4 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup pine nuts
1 onion, diced
1 Granny Smith apple, diced
1/2 cup finely chopped dried apricots
4 cloves garlic, pressed

Directions:
Bring 8 cups chicken broth and wild rice to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and simmer until rice is partially tender, about 30 minutes.
Mix partially-cooked wild rice with chicken broth, cranberry-walnut bread, 1 cup chicken broth, celery, water chestnuts, pecans, pine nuts, onion, apple, apricots, and garlic together in a slow cooker.
Cook on Low until wild rice has softened and split, at least 40 more minutes.

Description: 
The nutty flavor of wild rice makes a great combo with dried apricots, pine nuts, and traditional ingredients. I combined some recipes and the result was eagerly consumed. When I made this I fully cooked the rice. This is a forgiving and flexible recipe. There are so many different things to add or substitute: walnuts, almonds, orange zest, dried cranberries, mushrooms, more bread, whatever you prefer.
