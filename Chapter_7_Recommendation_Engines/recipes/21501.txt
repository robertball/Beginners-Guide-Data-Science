Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup chocolate syrup
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 tablespoons corn syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (11.5 ounce) package semi-sweet chocolate chunks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, chocolate syrup, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the corn syrup and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix in the chocolate chunks by hand. Drop cookies by 1/4 cupfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
