Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, skinless, boneless, halved
2 lemons, zested and juiced (juice divided)
2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
Tapenade:
2 cloves garlic, roasted and mashed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large firm-ripe Chilean Hass avocado, halved, pitted, peeled and finely chopped
1 medium tomato, seeded and finely chopped
1/4 cup pimiento-stuffed green olives, thin-sliced
2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
In a sealable plastic bag combine lemon zest, 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Add chicken breasts, seal and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Tapenade: In medium bowl, whisk together remaining lemon juice (about 3 tablespoons), 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, roasted garlic, salt and pepper. Stir in avocado, tomato, olives and basil. Cover tightly by pressing plastic wrap onto surface of tapenade. Set aside.
Lift chicken breasts from marinade and grill or cook in skillet until done, about 5 minutes per side. Serve each chicken breast topped with one quarter of the tapenade.

Description: 
Rich and flavorful avocado adds a surprising touch to the robust flavors of tapenade, a typical Mediterranean topping. You can also serve tapenade over grilled salmon or halibut, any cut of steak or sliced roast beef. Or try tapenade in a turkey or chicken sandwich.
