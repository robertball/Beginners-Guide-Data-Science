Description: 
I didn't get the char I wanted on the calamari, but I still enjoyed a flavorful, healthy lunch. The good news, however, was that I ate the leftovers cold, tossed with the same salad ingredients, and it was actually better. So, if you are planning on doing the same recipe as shown, I would suggest serving it chilled instead.
