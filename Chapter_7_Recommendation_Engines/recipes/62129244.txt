6 large carrots, peeled
3 large orange or yellow bell peppers, sliced lengthwise into long, thin strips
3 ounces of linguini (or any long, thin pasta), broken in half

2 gloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Use a vegetable peeler to shave each carrot into thin ribbons.
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute garlic, peppers, and carrots until tender (7-9 minutes).
Meanwhile, cook pasta until tender but slightly firm to bite.
Drain pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of cooking liquid.
Add shrimp to carrots and peppers, stirring fora few minutes to heat shrimp through.
Add pasta and reserved water to skillet.
Add Parmesan cheese and mix thoroughly. Add water or broth if dry.
Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, and serve.
