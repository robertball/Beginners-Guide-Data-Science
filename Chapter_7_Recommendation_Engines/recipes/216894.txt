Ingredients:
1 cup very ripe bananas
1/2 teaspoon butter, melted
1 egg
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon good quality bourbon whiskey (such as Maker's MarkÂ®)
2 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Peel the bananas, cut into 2 or 3 chunks, and freeze until solid.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the frozen banana pieces into a baking dish; drizzle with melted butter.
Roast the bananas in the preheated oven until browned, about 20 minutes. Mash the bananas in a bowl, and chill in refrigerator.
In a bowl, whisk together the egg, white sugar, brown sugar, and bourbon whiskey until smooth. Pour the cream into a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat, and bring to a simmer. Whisk about 1 cup of the hot cream into the egg mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, incorporating each tablespoon before adding the next; pour the mixture back into the saucepan with remaining cream. Over medium-low heat, constantly whisk the cream mixture until thickened and almost boiling; stir in the mashed bananas. Transfer to a bowl and chill 4 hours to overnight.
Pour the ice cream base into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions; pack soft ice cream into a lidded container and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour.
