Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pork tenderloin
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle root beer
1 (18 ounce) bottle your favorite barbecue sauce
8 hamburger buns, split and lightly toasted

Directions:
Rub the pork with seasonings of choice.  I used McCormick BBQ seasoning. Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker; pour the root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low until well cooked and the pork shreds easily, 6 to 7 hours.  Drain well. Stir in a little bbq sauce. Serve over hamburger buns with addtional bbq sauce on the side.

Description: 
Made with Barqs rootbeer. When I re-heated it I used coke (no rootbeer on hand) and it made it taste medicinal.  Stick with rootbeer or maybe try regular beer.Modified from: Slow Cooker Pulled Pork
