Ingredients:
2-16 oz. diced canned tomatoes
2 to 3 roasted jalapeno peppers (depends on how hot you like it)
3 - cloves fresh garlic
1 - teaspoon salt
1 - teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup water.
1 cup finely chopped green onions
1-1/2 cups finely chopped cilantro

Directions:
To roast fresh jalapenos:  Preheat oven broiler and broil jalapenos until charred all over. I usually roast a couple of dozen at a time, this takes about 10 to 15 minutes.  Make sure you turn them at the half way point to make sure pepper are charred all over.  Put them in a Zip-Lock bag and fold it close and let the peppers cool to room temperature.  At this point you can remove stems from peppers and run the peppers under cold water to remove the charred skins.  Whatever you don't use put into freezer to use for later use.  They freezer beautifully.
In a blender Add in chopped tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno peppers, salt, pepper and water.  Blend until salsa is nice and smooth. Taste at this time.  If not hot enough to your liking, add another pepper.  Taste for salt and pepper.
Pour salsa into a bowl and add chopped onions and cilantro.
Serve with tortilla chips.  This will last in refrigerator for a least a week.

Description: 
This is the best tasting salsa I have ever made. I get asked all the time for this recipe. It's restaurant quality and is never failing. For extra richness, I like adding chopped up avacado's into the salsa with some good tortilla chips.
