Description: 
An Australian friend gave me this recipe for authentic sausage rolls. I absolutely love them! Serve with ketchup or sweet thai chili sauce. These can be made regular sized, which is almost a complete meal in itself, or mini sized, for the perfect party appetizers. Either way, these are sure to be a hit!
