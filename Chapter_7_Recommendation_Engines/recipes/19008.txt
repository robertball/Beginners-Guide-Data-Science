2 (12 ounce) containers frozen whipped topping, thawed

In large trifle bowl or other glass bowl, crumble half of liqueur-moistened cake. Top cake with half of chocolate pudding, half of crumbled candy bars, and one container of whipped topping. Repeat with remaining cake, pudding, candy bars, and Cool Whip(R). Shave chocolate with a vegetable peeler for garnish; sprinkle over top of dessert. Keep refrigerated until serving.
