1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white chocolate chips

Description: 
I've tried so many different cookie recipes and this is by far the best extra large cookies I've ever tasted. They taste like gourmet million dollar cookies! I used the basics from a cookiemadness recipe.
