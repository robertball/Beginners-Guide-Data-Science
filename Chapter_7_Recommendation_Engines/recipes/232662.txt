Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped green and red bell pepper
1 small onion, diced
1 egg
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup pineapple preserves
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
Sauce:
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup pineapple preserves
1/4 cup brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, bell peppers, onion, egg, 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup pineapple preserves, 1/4 cup brown sugar, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce in a food processor until combined; put into a bread pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Stir 1/3 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup pineapple preserves, and 1/4 cup brown sugar together in a bowl; pour over the meatloaf.
Continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
