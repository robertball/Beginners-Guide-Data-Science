Ingredients:
1pkg.	tortillas
4 colored peppers ( usually 2 red and  2 green), sliced thin
2 onions, sliced thin
2 cloves garlic
2 lbs.	lean ground beef
1 can	low fat refried beans
1 can	diced green chilies (or you may substitute a can of jalapenos )
cup	salsa
1  cups	Monterey jack cheese, grated
1  cups	cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Heat a fry pan on medium, add 2 tbsp. oil and lightly saut peppers and onions until just tender and onions are soft.  Set aside in a bowl.
Fry ground beef until no pink remains.  Drain off fat.  Add the beans, green chilies and salsa.  Cook until heated through and well combined.
In crock-pot place a tortilla on the bottom.  Top with 1/5 of the meat then  cup of the cheese.  Top the cheese with a tortilla; layer with  of the peppers and onions.  Repeating layers.  Top with a tortilla and cover with remaining cheese.
Turn crock pot on high for about 2  3 hours.
Line your slow cooker with two strips of tin foil that  come up over the edges making an X, this way you can pull it out and impress your friends, or serve directly from the slow cooker for a buffet.

Description: 
This is a real easy impressive dish for the slow cooker.  I often make this when I have to take a casserole somewhere.  A pie shaped slice of this is usually 4-5 inches high.  Serve this with sour cream and salsa with a salad you have a complete meal.  This easily adapts to suit your own tastes.  This works well with 5 - 6 round quart slow cooker using the large tortillas, but you can easily adapt by using the smaller tortillas for a smaller slow cooker and reducing the filling.
