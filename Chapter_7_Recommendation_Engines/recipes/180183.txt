Ingredients:
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup brown sugar
½ teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
2 tablespoons dried minced onion
½ cup bourbon whiskey
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks
2 tablespoons dry white wine

Directions:
Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, ground ginger, dry minced onion, and bourbon whiskey in a 9x13 inch baking pan.  Stir in chicken pieces.  Cover and refrigerate, stirring often, for several hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Uncover chicken; place in the preheated oven. Baste chicken every 10 minutes. Cook until the juices run clear, about 1 hour.
Remove cooked chicken from baking pan; scrape juices and browned bits from the baking dish into a skillet.  Stir in the white wine. Cook and stir over medium heat until sauce is hot, and has reduced slightly.  Stir in chicken; heat for 1 additional minute before serving.
