Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup applesauce
1/3 cup skim milk
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 16 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Sift flour, baking powder, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Mix sugar, applesauce, milk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into wet ingredients until just combined. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 minutes.

Description: 
With all the focus on carbs, fat, diet shakes and the like, I think we have all forgotten: calories still count! These muffins are moist, delicious yet not too sweet. They are muffins, not cupcakes after all. Enjoy.
