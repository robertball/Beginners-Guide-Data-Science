Ingredients:
140g all-purpose flour
50g super fine sugar
115g butter
1 tablespoon cocoa
1 tablespoon sweet chocolate, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).
Sift all but 2 tablespoons of flour into a bowl, then add the sugar.
Rub, or cut in butter until the mixture is crumbly. Divide in half.
Work in the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour to one half, then the cocoa and ground chocolate to the other half. K
nead each portion well with your fingers to form a smooth dough.
Turn onto a lightly dusted with cornstarch surface, and roll out each portion to 1/4 inch thick circles.
Using a 2 1/2 inch round cookie cutter, cut out 7 circles from each piece of rolled out dough. Out of these circles, cut two more circles, one 1 1/4 inch, and one 3/4 inch. Now you should have fourteen 2 1/2 inch rings, fourteen 1 1/2 inch rings and fourteen 3/4 inch circles.
Construct wheels on greased baking sheets by starting with the largest rings, then alternating the colors to fill in. You should end up with 7 cookies that have a chocolate ring on the outside, a plain ring in the middle and a chocolate circle in the center; and 7 cookies that have a plain ring on the outside, a chocolate ring in the middle and a plain circle in the center.
Bake for 12 minutes. Leave on sheets for 2 minutes, then remove with a flat knife. Cool completely on wire racks.
