Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2/3 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
1/4 cup ice water
3/4 cup prepared mincemeat pie filling
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Sift together the flour, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to mix in the butter until mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Stir in the orange zest. Sprinkle with ice water, and gather dough into a ball. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out approximately 18 (3 inch) diameter circles, and 18 (2 inch) circles, rerolling dough as needed.
Line muffin cups or tart tins using the 3 inch pastry circles. Fill each pastry cup with about 1 tablespoon of mincemeat filling. Top with 2 inch pastry circles, pinching circles together to seal the edges. Brush the top of each pie with egg.
Bake pies in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar just before serving.
