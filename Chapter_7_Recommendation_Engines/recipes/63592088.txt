Ingredients:
6 pounds bone-in ham
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup honey
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place ham on a rack in a foil lined roasting pan. Bake the rounded side up for one hour.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix all ingredients together. Stir until it forms a nice thick glaze.
Rub on half of the glaze and bake for 30 minutes more. Flip the ham over and rub on remaining glaze and bake for 1 hour more. Remove from oven and allow the ham to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving.
