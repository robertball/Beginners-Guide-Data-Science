Ingredients:
1 cup thinly sliced ginger
24 (1 inch) pieces cinnamon stick
2 teaspoons whole allspice berries
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
2 whole nutmegs, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons whole cloves
3 quarts water, plus more as needed
6 cups white sugar
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
Place ginger, cinnamon sticks, allspice, peppercorns, nutmeg, and cloves together in a cheesecloth pouch or a large tea bag infuser.
Combine water and spice bag in a large pot; bring to a boil. Boil, adding more water as necessary as water evaporates, until flavors are blended and 6 to 8 cups of liquid remain, about 45 minutes. Remove spice bag; when cool enough to handle, squeeze any excess liquid back into the pot.
Stir sugar and honey into spiced water; continue boiling until desired syrup consistency is reached, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer to clean bottles or jars to store.

Description: 
This simple, flavorful recipe is great as a sweetener in your favorite hot beverages and smoothies or as a topping on oatmeal, pancakes, pork, or fruit salad (apples, pears, peaches). It has a very heartwarming flavor, perfect for a cold day. Inspired by Billy's Favorite Gingerbread Spiced Coffee Syrup. I found this preparation method to be a lot easier.
