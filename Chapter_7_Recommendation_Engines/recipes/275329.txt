Ingredients:
1/2 cup eggnog
1/8 cup butter
1/8 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup water
4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 cup melted butter
Frosting:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons eggnog

Directions:
Warm 1/2 cup eggnog in a small saucepan over low heat until it bubbles, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup pumpkin; stir until melted. Add water and let mixture cool until lukewarm, about 5 minutes.
Combine cooled eggnog mixture, 1 cup flour, white sugar, egg, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to combine. Stir in remaining flour 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition with an electric mixer until dough has pulled together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Roll dough into a 12x9-inch rectangle.
Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice together in a bowl. Spread melted butter on top of dough and top with brown sugar mixture. Roll dough into a log, using a little water to seal the seam.
Cut roll into 12 slices using a very sharp knife or a piece of unflavored dental floss. Place rolls into a 9x13-inch greased baking pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, 1/4 cup pumpkin, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Add eggnog gradually until frosting reaches a spreadable consistency. Spread frosting over warm cinnamon rolls.

Description: 
I love cinnamon rolls, and thought it would be fun to add pumpkin and eggnog to a cinnamon roll recipe I already had for the fall season.
