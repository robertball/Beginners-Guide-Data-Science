Ingredients:
Whole Pumpkin

Directions:
1. Wash your pumpkin well and then preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
2. Place the pumpkin in the oven on a rack and bake until soft enough to insert a knife.
3. Once the pumpkin is done cooking, simply let is sit on top of the stove for a little while to cool. I let mine cool for about half an hour.
4. Cut in half (and it will be SO easy!). Use a spoon to remove the seeds and pulp and then scoop the flesh into a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. That’s it!

Description: 
This is absolutely the easiest way ever for making pumpkin puree. I have always hated trying to hack into a pumpkin using a knife to cut it open. The pumpkin is always so tough and I’m afraid that I’ll end up cutting of my finger or something. With this simple method there is no difficult cutting involved. Yay :)
