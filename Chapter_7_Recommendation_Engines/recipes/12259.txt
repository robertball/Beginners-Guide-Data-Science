Ingredients:
3 1/4 pounds lean ground beef
12 cups apples - peeled, cored and diced
6 cups raisins
1 cup brandy
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
3 1/2 cups white sugar

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef thoroughly. Being sure not to over-brown it.
Place chopped apples and the cooked ground beef in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is made up of pea sized chunks.
In a non-reactive skillet combine the apple and ground beef mixture with the raisins, brandy, ground cinnamon, ground allspice, ground nutmeg and the white sugar. Simmer for 30 minutes.
Cool filling to lukewarm and pour into freezer bags (2 cups per bag). Freeze filling until needed. One baggie will fill one 8 inch double crust pie. Thaw filling before using.

Description: 
An old-time delicious mincemeat pie filling. I have frozen this filling in zip-lock baggies, since I don't use a pressure canner. Apple cider can be used in place of brandy if preferred.
