Directions:
Combine the galic, oilve oil, cider vinager, parsely, and oregano in a blender and puree'.
Add the chops or steaks and let maranade for about four hours.
Combine the bread crumbs and the Parmesan/Romano cheese in a bowl. (I buy prepaired Parmesan cheese and grind an equal amount of Romano sheese to blend with it.)
Remove the pork from the marenade and roll them in the bread crumb/ cheese mix.
Pre-heat your pan till watter dances on the bottom, and add the pork, searing it.
After all pork is added to pan, dump remaining oilve oil and bread mix into the pan.
Cook on med-high heat to brown the pork and cook till juice runs clear. Serve while still hot and crispy.
