Ingredients:
1 (2 to 3 pound) whole chicken
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1 cup mozzarella
1 baguette

Directions:
Wad three pieces of aluminum foil into 3 to 4 inch balls, and place them in the bottom of the slow cooker.
Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water. Pat dry with paper towels. Season the chicken with the salt, pepper and paprika, and place in the slow cooker on top of the crumbled aluminum foil.
Set the slow cooker to High for 1 hour, then turn down to Low for about 8 to 10 hours, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
When chicken finishes, preheat oven to broil.
Cut baguette into slices and spread cheese over them evenly. Broil for 4 - 5 minutes or until cheese melts. Shred chicken onto half the the pieces and place the other half on top to make sandwiches.

This chicken is so juicy and delicious and easy to make. I love to use the meat for mini sandwiches for my kids. I shred it up and place on bread with melted cheese. Cute and tasty.Modified from: Baked Slow Cooker Chicken
