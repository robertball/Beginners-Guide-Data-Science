On a lightly floured surface roll dough out like you would making a regular 9" pie. Using a 3-4 inch glass or cookie cutter cut out 8-10 circles of dough.
Spoon a small amount of apple/pear mixture into center of dough circles, and fold over. press firmly to seal edges, and crimp with fork if desired. Place on Baking sheet. Repeat with all circles.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with second dough.
Once they are all placed on baking sheet, make 3 small slits on the tops of each hand pie.
Brush tops with egg wash

Place in oven for 25-30 minutes or till they are lightly golden brown.
Let them cool slightly and drizzle with dark chocolate.
Enjoy

Close your eyes when you take a bite of these and you can almost hear the crunch of leaves beneath your feet. These taste, and smell like Autumn, my favorite season. I like to add a drizzle of dark chocolate at the end, it makes them extra special!
