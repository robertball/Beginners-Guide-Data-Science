Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) chuck roast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large onion, chopped
1 1/4 cups diced green chile pepper (1 Pablano & 1 Jap)
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 (5 ounce) bottle Chipotle Tabascosauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tsp cumin
1 beef bouillon cube

Directions:
Trim the roast of any excess fat, and season with salt and pepper.
Place the roast in a slow cooker, and sprinkle onion over meat. Season with chile peppers, chili powder, cayenne pepper, hot pepper sauce, cumin, garlic powder and the beef cube.  Add enough water to cover 1/3 of the roast.
Cover, and cook on Low for 8 hours, checking to make sure there is always at least a small amount of liquid in the bottom. You can also use a pork roast for this recipe.
