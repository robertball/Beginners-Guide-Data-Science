Ingredients:
1 c. powdered milk
1 c. Iced cold water
4 tsp. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Place a large mixing bowl and your beaters from the mixer in the freezer about 30 minutes, or til they are chilled.
To one cup of water add some ice cubes so it gets nice and cold.
When you're ready to begin, remove those ice cubes from the ice water...make sure you have 1 cup of ice water (pour out any extra created by those cubes.)
To the bowl add 1 c. powdered milk and 1 c. ice water.
Beat with the mixer til it is stiff. This took me about 5 minutes.
Add the sugar and vanilla.
Continue beating til stiff again.
Use immediately! This whipped cream don't last long....
