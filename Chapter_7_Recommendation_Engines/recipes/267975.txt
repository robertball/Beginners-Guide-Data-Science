Ingredients:
2 cups whole grain spelt flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted natural peanut butter (such as East Wind)
1 cup maple syrup
1/3 cup olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place racks in the top half of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine spelt flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl.
Combine peanut butter, maple syrup, olive oil, and vanilla extract in a separate, larger bowl; stir well. Pour in the flour mixture and stir until barely combined and still a little dry. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Give dough another good stir. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets. Press each cookie down gently.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges appear set, 10 to 11 minutes. Avoid overbaking or cookies may become dry. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to cooling racks.
