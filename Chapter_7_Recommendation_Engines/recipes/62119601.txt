https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 ½ cups Nilla wafers finely crushed (food processor recommended)
1 cup powdered sugar
2 Tbsp powder cocoa
¼ cup amaretto (I use Disaronna)
1 cup nuts chopped (I prefer walnuts or pecans)
3 Tbsp light corn syrup
additional powdered sugar for rolling

Directions:
Mix everything together in a bowl.
Roll into 1” balls. Note: This step can be very sticky! Add a splash more of amaretto if mixture is too dry.
Roll in extra powdered sugar.
Enjoy. (You can make these ahead of time, store in airtight container, and chill to ensure the shape holds if more than a day before enjoying. You can also substitute with Bailey's or Kahlua.)

Description: 
Similar to the rum ball, but using amaretto for a sweeter taste. No bake, so watch out!
