Ingredients:
2 pounds dried pinto beans
8 cloves garlic, crushed
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 large ripe tomatoes, diced
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 bunches cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Pick over beans and wash in cold water 4 times. Place beans into a large pot, pour in enough fresh water to cover by 2 inches, and soak overnight.
Bring beans and soaking water to a boil; stir in garlic and salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer beans until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 hours, stirring often. If beans start to dry out, add more boiling water.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir tomatoes and onion in the hot oil until onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir cilantro, 5 to 6 large spoonfuls of beans, and cooking liquid into tomato mixture. Mash beans and stir tomato mixture back into simmering beans. Continue simmering until flavors are blended, about 1 hour more.
