Ingredients:
1 cup Original Bisquick® mix
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
3/4 cup small curd creamed cottage cheese
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup butter
1 cup sour cream
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

Directions:
Beat Bisquick, milk and eggs with fork or wire whisk until blended.  Lightly butter 8-inch skillet; heat over medium heat until bubbly.  For each crepe, pour 2 tablespoons batter into skillet; immediately rotate skillet until batter covers bottom.  Cook until golden brown.  Run wide spatula around edge to loosen; remove from skillet. Stack crepes, placing waxed paper between each; keep covered.
Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, 1 tablespoon butter and the vanilla.  Spoon about 1 tablespoon cheese filling onto browned side of each crepe.  Fold sides of crepe over filling, overlapping edges; roll up blintzes.
Heat 1/4 cup butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until bubbly.  Place blintzes, seam sides down, in skillet.  Cook, turning once, until golden brown.  Top each with rounded tablespoon sour cream and about 3 tablespoons pie filling.
