Description: 
This is one of the most requested meals in my house, I usually serve it with homemade garlic bread and Caesar salad. We always have everything to make this on hand, so whenever I'm pressed for time I can throw this together in less than 20 minutes and have a delicious meal! My hubby ALWAYS goes back for seconds, and sometimes even thirds!
