Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 poblano chile - halved, seeded, and thinly sliced
1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups jarred nopales, thinly sliced
8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup plain Greek yogurt, or to taste
1 cup salsa, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment and spray with cooking spray.
Add poblano chile, onion, and nopales in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until chile and onion are soft, 3 to 5 minutes.
Place 4 tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Heat until soft, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
Place 1 tortilla on a work surface. Spoon 2 tablespoons each of nopales mixture, Monterey Jack cheese, and black beans on top and fold in sides. Place chimichanga on the prepared baking sheet seam-side down. Repeat with remaining fillings and tortillas.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, turning halfway through, 15 to 20 minutes.
