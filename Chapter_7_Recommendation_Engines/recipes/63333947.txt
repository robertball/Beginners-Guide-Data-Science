Chicken, White Bean & Fire-roasted Green Chili Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 lb ground lean chicken
1 Tb canola oil
1 lb small navy beans or similar white bean
2 Qts water or low-sodium chicken stock (or half and half)
1 large sweet onion- minced or small dice
2 cans diced green chilis or 8 fire-roasted Anaheim chilies that have been skinned, seeded and diced.
2 cups diced celery
2 Tb minced garlic
1 Tb ground cumin
2 Tb lime juice
2 tsp salt
1 cup Sour Cream as garnish
1 cup reduced-fat Shredded Cheddar or Jack cheese as garnish

Directions:
In a sauce pan, brown the ground chicken using the oil until cooked through (about 10 minutes).  While this is browning, prepare the vegetables.  Drain off the fat.
In the slow-cooker, place all remaining ingredients EXCEPT the salt and lime juice and cook covered on high heat for 8 to 12 hours or until beans are very tender and disintegrate easily. You may choose to puree a small portion of the chili to aid in thickening it.  Add salt and lime juice.
At the table, pour portions in bowls and garnish with cheese and sour cream or allow diners to serve this themselves a la carte.

Description: 
This slow-cooker recipe is an award-winning chili recipe from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, but has been served in every restaurant I ever cooked in.  Kids love it because it tastes unlike the usual chili and isn't too spicy.  I love it because it's easy and tastes divine.
