Ingredients:
Cake:
·	6 tbs. butter, softened
·	¾ cup sugar, divided
·	2 eggs, separated
·	½ cup hot mashed potatoes, made without milk or butter
·	¾ cup all-purpose flour
·	¼ cup plus 2 tbs. baking cocoa
·	1 tsp. baking powder
·	¼ tsp. salt
·	½ cup milk
·	½ tsp. vanilla extract
Filling:
·	4 oz. cream cheese, softened
·	2/3 cup sugar
·	1/3 cup chocolate syrup
·	 tsp. vanilla extract
·	2 cups heavy whipping cream
·	1 tbs. instant coffee granules
·	1 cup toffee bits

Directions:
For cake, in a mixing bowl, cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Add egg yolks; beat well. Add potatoes and mix thoroughly. Combine flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating until smooth. Stir in vanilla.
In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add remaining sugar; beat until stiff peaks form. Fold into batter.  Spoon batter into greased regular –size muffin tins, two large spoonfuls in each. You will need around 18 cups to hold all the batter.  Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool.
For frosting, in chilled mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Beat in chocolate syrup and vanilla. Add the whipping cream and coffee granules. Beat on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
To assemble cakes, slice each in half horizontally. Spread larger side with filling and sprinkle with toffee bits. Top with smaller end. Frost the sides and top of each cake and sprinkle with toffee bits, or gently pat the toffee bits onto the sides of each cake.
