Ingredients:
2 cups Hidden Valley® Original Ranch® Dressing
1 cup Cheddar cheese, shredded
2 cups potato chips
4 (4 ounce) fillets catfish

Directions:
Mix dressing and cheese in medium bowl.  Place potato chips in one quart  Glad(r) Food Storage bag, seal and crush.  Tear 4 5-inch individual sheets of aluminum foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray.  Line up dressing mixture, chip bag and foil to make an assembly line.  Dip catfish fillets in mixture until well coated and then place in potato chip bag.  Once fish is coated with chips, place on aluminum foil sheet.
Grill catfish on covered grill over indirect heat for about 8 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork.

Submitter: 
Hidden Valley® Ranch
Description: 
The finest catfish in the world is found in the Mississippi Delta,  just northwest of Jackson.  Instead of just grilling it plain, I added my own touch.
