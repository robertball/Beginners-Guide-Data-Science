Ingredients:
Juice and zest of 2 medium lemons
1/4 C white sugar
1/2 C honey
1 C milk
1 C heavy cream

Directions:
Make sure the zest is grated or chopped extremely finely.  Or blitz it in a food processor for a few moments with the sugar.
Combine the juice, zest, sugar and honey.  Slowly whisk in the  milk and cream and pour into the canister of an ice cream maker.  Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for churning.
When finished churning, scoop the mixture into a container just large enough to hold it and cover tightly and freeze until it firms up some more.

Description: 
I created this while looking for a creamy frozen lemon recipe that didn't require cooking and cooling.  It has a medium tartness to it.  You can either increase the lemon juice or decrease the sugar or honey.  We found this to be smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of tang.
