Ingredients:
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon water
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed
4 teaspoons yellow mustard
8 thin slices deli baked ham
8 thin slices deli Swiss or provolone cheese
4 kosher dill pickle sandwich slices
8 thin slices deli roast pork
2 teaspoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the honey and water in a small bowl.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 12-inch square. Cut into 4 (6-inch) squares.
Spread 1 teaspoon mustard on each pastry square to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Layer each with 2 ham slices, 2 cheese slices, 1 pickle slice and 2 pork slices. Brush the edges of the pastry squares with water. Fold the pastry over the filling to form a triangle and crimp with a fork to seal. Brush the filled pastries with the honey mixture. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Place the pastries onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Let the pastries cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
