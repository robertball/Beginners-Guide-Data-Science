Ingredients:
1 onion, sliced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 jalapeno, chopped
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 taco seasoning packet
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 can stewed tomatoes, undrained
1 can black beans, drained
1 cup uncooked long-grain rice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Grease 9x13 casserole.
Combine all ingredients except the chicken and place in casserole.
Rub chicken breasts with taco seasoning, then place on top of casserole.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until chicken is tender and juicy and its juices run clear.
*Note:  If you do not have taco seasoning available, you can find a substitute recipe on this site.  I used a combination of chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.

Description: 
This recipe came about because I needed to use some ingredients in the house and also not spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  I pre-apologized to my husband in case it didn't turn out well, but he ended up asking me to add this to our please make this again list.  You can speed up cooking time by using pre-cooked chicken and rice.
