Ingredients:
4 cups reduced-sodium vegetable broth
1 (8 ounce) package seashell pasta
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons chopped spring onions
1 (12 ounce) package Quorn(<sup>&trade;</sup>) Chicken-Style Recipe Tenders
1 cup sweet peas
3 tablespoons pesto sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Place the vegetable broth into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Stir in the pasta, and boil over medium-low heat until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta, and reserve broth.
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and stir in half the spring onions; cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes, then add the vegetarian chicken-style pieces. Cook until vegetarian pieces are browned, about 3 minutes per side, then stir in remaining onion and green peas. Pour 1/2 cup of reserved vegetable broth into the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil, cook for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the peas, and stir in the pasta and pesto sauce. Mix in an additional 1/2 cup of broth to form a creamy sauce.

Description: 
A deliciously creamy pasta dish that doesn't use any cream.  The vegetable broth mixed with fresh pesto makes a very flavorful sauce. You can use real chicken but you should try the Quorn(<sup>&reg;</sup>) stuff -- it's really good.
