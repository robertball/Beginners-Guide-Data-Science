Ingredients:
Â½ c each
Apple Cider Vinegar
White Sugar
1/8 tsp. Ground Cloves
1 tsp Cinnamon, or 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice or apple pie spice.
1 Cinnamon Stick
1/4 tsp Salt  (optional)
3 T Ginger Pulp (if contains salt, omit salt called for)
3 Medium Organic Beets, stems and peels removed, cut into bite sized chunks.
2 c water, for poaching

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring to a boil the 2 cups water with the cinnamon stick, and then add the beets.
Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes or until firm but cooked.
Using a slotted spoon, remove beets and place into the pickling jar, leaving beet juices in the saucepan.
Add all remaining ingredients to the pan with beet juice, agitate well, and simmer for 15 minutes on medium-low heat, lid off.
Gently pour hot mixture over beets in the jar to cover them or fill jar to the top.
Firmly tighten lid to the jar, and allow the jar to cool down on the countertop for about 1 hour before placing into the fridge.
After two days, these gorgeous beets will be ready to eat.
Tightly re-close and store in the refrigerator.
Beets should last a few weeks after opened.
Enjoy!
I eat these with salads, cottage cheese, artichokes, serve alongside cheese platters and other fresh fruits and vegetables including candied nuts.  They add flair in both color, texture and flavor to any presentation or meal.  They are great all year around.
