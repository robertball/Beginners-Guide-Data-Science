Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package quinoa shells pasta
3/4 cup light creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip LightÂ®)
3/4 cup bacon ranch dressing
2 cups shredded lettuce
1 large tomato, seeded and chopped
1 cucumber, seeded and chopped
3 green onions, trimmed and chopped
1 (3 ounce) can real bacon bits

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in shells and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cool, about 20 minutes.
Combine creamy salad dressing and bacon ranch dressing in a large bowl. Mix in cooled pasta, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green onions, and bacon bits. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
This is a slightly healthier version of a BLT pasta salad. The quinoa pasta adds protein and is a healthier choice. A pound of cooked and drained bacon can be substituted for the real bacon bits for special occasions or if unconcerned about the fat grams!
