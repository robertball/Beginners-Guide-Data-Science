Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup quinoa

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in melted butter until just browned, about 5 minutes.

Remove saucepan from heat and rest mixture 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.
