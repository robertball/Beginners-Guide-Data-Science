Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup kosher salt
1/3 cup ground black pepper
1/4 cup ground paprika
1/4 cup garlic powder
1/4 cup Italian seasoning
2 tablespoons onion powder
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried sage
Marinade:
1/2 cup apple cider
1/4 cup apple juice concentrate
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 drops liquid smoke flavoring
7 pounds bone-in pork butt
1/2 cup yellow mustard
1 tablespoon honey
Wood Chips:
1 cup whiskey barrel wood chips (such as Jack Daniel'sÂ®)
1/2 cup apple wood chips
1/2 cup apple juice concentrate
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, Italian seasoning, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, and sage in a small container. Measure 1 tablespoon of the dry rub mixture into a large container that will fit the pork butt. Refrigerate remaining dry rub.
Mix apple cider, 1/4 cup apple juice concentrate, 2 tablespoons honey, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke into the large container to make marinade.
Score top of pork butt in a checkerboard pattern. Inject some of the marinade into the bottom, sides, and top of the pork butt. Place pork in the container with the remaining marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine whiskey barrel wood chips, apple wood chips, 1/2 cup apple juice concentrate, and water in a large resealable bag. Seal and let soak, about 20 minutes.
Preheat an electric smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Fill smoker box with wood chips according to manufacturer's instructions.
Remove pork from marinade; rub mustard and 1 tablespoon honey evenly on top. Coat pork butt heavily with dry rub. Place fat-side up on a rack.
Place the rack in the smoker; cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for medium or 170 degrees F (77 degrees C), 4 to 6 hours. Add additional soaked wood chips halfway through cooking time.
Place pork butt fat-side up on a large platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes, turning over halfway through resting time.
