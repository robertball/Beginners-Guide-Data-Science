Description: 
What a delicious way to fix eggs for every day or for company! I load them with good-for-you veggies, too. Feel free to add ham or bacon to the egg mixture. You could also add other favorite low-carb veggies like zucchini or yellow squash. I have a light appetite and use this recipe for two people. That saves two more crepes for another day to use for a different breakfast, or to use for dessert with berries and cream after dinner.
