In a separate small bowl, whisk the half & half and flour together. Pour this into the soup and stir well to blend. Cover and simmer for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
Finally, stir in the ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley. Mix together and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.

Description: 
My family loves soup and this is one of their favorites. It has lots of flavor and is fairly quick to make. It's primarily a mushroom soup but derives a lot of its flavor from other ingredients.Modified from: Hungarian Mushroom Soup
