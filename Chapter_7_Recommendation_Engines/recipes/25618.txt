Ingredients:
1 cup margarine
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup milk
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch pan. Sift together the flour, cocoa and baking powder. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
