Ingredients:
6 Filets Dover Sole (or whatever delicate white fish you have)
One Shallot, diced.
2 Small Cloves Garlic
2 Tablespoons Butter
1/2 Red Bell Pepper, diced.
1/2 teaspoon Lebanese Zaatar
3 sprigs fresh Italian Parsley
A smear or two of Better Than Bouillon Lobster Base.
A glug of EVOO
S & P

Directions:
Roll out a little more than a foot of aluminum foil. Repeat and lay them on top of one another.
Smear a few dabs of the Lobster Base on the center of the foil.
Repeat with the butter.
Add the rest of the ingredients in any order and gently roll to mix, without breaking up the filets.
Seal and place on the edge of your direct heat zone.
Grill for 20 minutes, then allow to steam off the heat for 5 minutes.
Fresh chervil can do nicely here, in moderation.
