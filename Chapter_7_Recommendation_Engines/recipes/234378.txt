1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup

Description: 
I looked at the top 5 recipes on this site, combined my favorite ingredients from each, plus a few of my own (Sriracha®/adobe sauce) and...ta-da! A meaty, spicy, flavorful, turkey chili! 

You can quickly cook up the turkey and combine ingredients in slow cooker, throw in the fridge, and take it out to cook on low before you go to work - works perfectly, easy peasy! 

All the guys love it for football games, tailgating, and just plain old cold weather. 

From my table to yours, hope you enjoy! Serve with sour cream and cheese to your liking.
