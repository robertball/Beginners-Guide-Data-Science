Ingredients:
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
6 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons rum
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 tablespoon ground red chile pepper
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground allspice
4 cups ketchup

Directions:
Mix vinegar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, Worcestershire sauce, rum, mustard, liquid smoke, ground chile, black pepper, garlic powder, and allspice together in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until sauce is smooth and brown sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.
Stir ketchup into sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is dark and thickened, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Use this toward the end of cooking as you would for any BBQ meat such as pork, ribs, or chicken. I have even used it on beef and hamburgers, sausages, hot dogs, or anything you want, for the most part.  I use it on everything from ribs to roasts to hamburgers to hot dogs. Even goes good with a good old classic grilled cheese sandwich. This is a great all-round BBQ sauce. Use right away or cool to room temperature, transfer to jars or containers, and refrigerate. The sauce will keep for several months in the fridge.
