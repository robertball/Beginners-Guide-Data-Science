Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1½ teaspoons dried thyme
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
few sprays of cooking spray
8 oz. sliced mushrooms
4 shallots, chopped
½ cup chicken broth
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
1. Sprinkle the chicken thighs with thyme and pepper. Spray a non-stick pan with cooking spray and sauté the thighs over medium-high heat on both sides until juices run clear. Be careful not to overcook. Remove from pan and keep warm.
2. Add the sliced mushrooms and shallots to the pan along with a little bit of chicken broth. Saute until slightly browned, then add the rest of the broth, the vinegar and honey. Cook down slightly, then return the chicken to the pan for a minute or so.
3. Serve chicken and sauce over the egg noodles. Tastes like more!

Description: 
I wanted to create something light with relatively few ingredients that didn’t have vying tastes. This was perfect. Very simple but delicious. The measurements for the broth and balsamic vinegar are approximate. I served it with thin no-yolk egg noodles with a little bit of browned butter, black pepper and chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Great side.
