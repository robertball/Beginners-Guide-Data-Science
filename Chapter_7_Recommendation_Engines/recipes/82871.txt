Ingredients:
4 tablespoons fish sauce
4 tablespoons lime juice
2 teaspoons brown sugar
4 Thai chiles, chopped
1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 large tomato, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh basil
16 slices SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread
1 head lettuce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Prepare the dressing by combining the fish sauce, lime juice, brown sugar and chopped chiles in a small bowl; set aside.
Place the salmon filet on a baking sheet, and rub with olive oil. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until easily flaked with a fork. Let cool for at least 15 minutes.
Place salmon in a large bowl, and break into chunks. Add onion, tomato and basil; pour dressing over, and toss lightly until well mixed.
Place equal amounts of the tuna salad mixture on 8 slices of bread, top with lettuce leaves, and top with remaining bread slices to form sandwiches.
