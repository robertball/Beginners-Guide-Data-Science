Ingredients:
2 whole trout, cleaned
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1 pinch coarse sea salt to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper
1/2 lemon, thinly sliced
1/2 sweet onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 sprigs fresh rosemary
2 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Rub each trout generously with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt; sprinkle inside of cavities with salt and black pepper. Place half the lemon and onion slices into cavity of each trout, along with minced garlic, and place a sprig of rosemary and thyme into cavities.
Turn preheated grill down to low and place the trout directly onto the grill; cook until flesh flakes easily and the skins are browned, 6 to 7 minutes per side, flipping once.
