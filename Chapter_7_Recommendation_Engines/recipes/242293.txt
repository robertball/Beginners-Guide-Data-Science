1 pound beef sirloin tip steaks, cut 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick
1 tablespoon lemon pepper

Directions:
Stack beef steaks; cut lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1-inch wide strips. Combine beef and lemon pepper in medium bowl.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add 1/2 of beef; stir-fry 1 to 3 minutes or until outside surface of beef is no longer pink. (Do not overcook.) Remove from skillet. Repeat with remaining beef, adding remaining 1 teaspoon oil to skillet, if necessary.
Spread hummus evenly in pita pockets. Fill with equal amounts of beef and toppings, as desired.
