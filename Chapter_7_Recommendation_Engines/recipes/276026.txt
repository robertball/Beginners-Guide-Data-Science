Ingredients:
1 pound sliced bacon, diced
1 medium sweet onion, chopped
6 eggs, lightly beaten
4 cups frozen shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups small curd cottage cheese
1 1/4 cups shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place bacon and onion into a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until bacon is evenly browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.
Combine eggs, hash brown potatoes, Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, and Swiss cheese in a bowl; stir in bacon-onion mixture. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Bake, uncovered, until set and bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
