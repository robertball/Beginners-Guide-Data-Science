Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
4 pineapple rings
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Divide the ground beef into four portions, and form patties around pineapple rings so that none of the pineapple is showing. In a small saucepan, mix together the ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Heat until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
Place burgers on the grill, and cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Spoon some of the brown sugar sauce over the burgers before serving.

Description: 
My favorite burgers are 'Surprise Burgers'.  The pineapple inside the burger adds a hint of sweetness, while the sauce adds some tanginess!  Warning: the added sauce and pineapple makes for a mess with little ones!
