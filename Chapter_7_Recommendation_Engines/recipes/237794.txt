black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan.
Blend onion and roasted red pepper in a blender until liquefied; transfer to a large bowl.
Mix salmon, saltine crackers, milk, egg, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper sauce, cayenne pepper, and black pepper with the onion mixture in the large bowl; transfer to the prepared loaf pan.
