Ingredients:
9 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
12 cups water
2 tablespoons butter, divided, or as needed
4 elk steaks
2 pinches Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste
2 pinches garlic salt, or to taste
1/2 cup milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon butter in a pan over medium-low heat. Add steaks and season the sides that are facing up with steak seasoning and garlic salt. Cook for 8 minutes. Flip and season with additional steak seasoning and garlic salt; continue to cook for 5 minutes.
Remove steaks from pan, cover, and allow to rest for 7 to 10 minutes to allow for juices to redistribute throughout the meat.
Drain potatoes and mash with milk, remaining butter, salt, and pepper until fluffy.
Divide steaks and mashed potatoes among serving plates.
