Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 cup crushed saltine crackers
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
4 cups mashed potatoes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, saltine crackers, onion, green bell pepper, milk, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, and seasoned salt together in a bowl.
Stir ketchup and brown sugar together in a bowl. Spoon ketchup mixture into the bottom of each muffin cup of a 6-cup muffin tin.
Fill muffin cups with beef mixture, leaving 1/2-inch space on the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain fat from muffin cups.
Top each 'cupcake' with mashed potatoes and Cheddar cheese.
Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
These look like a little cupcake with the meat inside of a muffin pan and mashed potato icing. My kids eat these up quickly.
