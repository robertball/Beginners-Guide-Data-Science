Description: 
This is my family's favorite hotdog sauce. It originates from West Virginia. We like it with a bite, but you can adjust it to your taste. We top the hotdogs with ketchup, mustard, the hotdog sauce, and finally some chopped onions...YUM!  This recipe makes enough for freezing and using later.Modified from: Heavenly Hot Dog Sauce
