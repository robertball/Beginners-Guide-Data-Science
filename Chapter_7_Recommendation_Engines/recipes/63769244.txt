Ingredients:
1 cup chopped broccoli florets
2 lbs ground turkey
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tsp diced garlic
2 tsp dill
1/4 tsp salt
2 pkg (8 oz) refrigerated crescent roll dough
1 egg white, lightly beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
Brown ground turkey in a frying pan,
Combine broccoli, turkey, cheese, mayonnaise, dill, garlic and salt in large bowl; mix well.
Unroll one package of the crescent dough; do not separate. Arrange longest sides of dough across width of cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining package of dough.
Using rolling pin, roll dough to seal perforations. On longest sides of cookie sheet, cut dough into strips 1 1/2 in. apart, 3 in. deep. (There will be 6 in. in the center for the filling.)
Spread filling evenly over center of dough. To braid, lift dough strips across filling to meet in center, twisting each strip one turn. Continue alternating strips to form a braid. Tuck ends up to seal at end of braid.
Brush egg white over dough. Bake 25-28 minutes or until deep golden brown
