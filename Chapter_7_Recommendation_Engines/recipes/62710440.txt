Ingredients:
4 oz         papardelle noodles
1 pat        butter
6 oz         bacon, sliced into matchsticks
1            onion, chopped
1            small head red cabbage, chopped
1            dash garlic powder
1/2 tsp      salt
1/4 tsp      pepper

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
Stir in the egg noodles; return to a boil.
Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes.
Drain; return noodles to the pot and stir in the butter.
Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate.
Pour off all but 1 tbsp grease from the skillet into a heatproof cup and reserve it.
Place the onion in the skillet with the 1 tablespoon of bacon grease left therein, and cook and stir over medium heat until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes.
Stir in about 1 tbsp additional bacon grease from the cup and add the cabbage; cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes.
Cover and keep cooking until the cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes.
Add the bacon to the skillet and stir in the noodles, and continue cooking just until heated through.
Taste for seasoning and serve hot.
