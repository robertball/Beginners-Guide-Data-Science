Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt and black pepper to taste
2 pounds firm white fish fillets (cod, haddock or halibut), cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
3/4 cup vegetable oil, divided
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 onions, cut in half and thinly sliced
2 carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
1 large parsnip, peeled and coarsely grated
1/2 celeriac (celery root), peeled and coarsely grated
1 cup water
4 tablespoons tomato paste

Directions:
Place eggs and flour in 2 shallow bowls. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Dip fish pieces first in the beaten eggs, then dredge in the flour.
Heat 3/4 cup vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat until hot. Add fish in batches and fry on both sides until golden, 5 to 8 minutes per batch. Remove fish from skillet and set aside.
Heat remaining 1/4 cup oil in a separate skillet and cook onions until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add carrots, parsnip, and celeriac; mix well. Add water and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer on low heat until vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes. Check and add more water if mixture becomes too dry. Stir in tomato paste and simmer for 5 minutes more.
Layer vegetables and fried fish in a 10-inch round serving dish, starting and ending with vegetables.
