1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
4 cups (2-inch) cut green beans (about 1 pound)
2 teaspoons dark sesame oil
cooking spray
1 tablespoon minced peeled fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 cups hot cooked rice
1/4 cup chopped unsalted cashews, toasted

Directions:
Combine the soy sauce and cornstarch in a medium bowl, and add pork, stirring to coat. Cover and chill.
Place beans in a large saucepan of boiling water, and cook 5 minutes. Drain beans; plunge into ice water. Drain.
Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray over medium-high heat. Add ginger and garlic; saute 1 minute. Add pork mixture; stir-fry 1-1/2 minutes. Stir in green beans; stir-fry 1-1/2 minutes or until pork is done. Stir in broth; reduce heat, and simmer 2 minutes. Serve over rice; sprinkle with cashews.
