Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 1/2 Tbsp white sugar
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 Tbsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg
1 cup buttermilk--1/2 cup in reserve
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine--1/4 cup in reserve
1/2 cup craisins, or dried fruit of choice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degress F.  yields 1 doz scones
In mixing bowl, combine flour, white sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Mix in 1 egg, 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine.  Once dough is formed, mix in 1/2 cup craisins or dried fruit of choice.
On lightly flour dusted surface, separate dough into 12 equal size balls.  Place balls on a cookie sheet coated with non-stick cooking spray.  Flatten balls by pressing a cross-hatch pattern with a fork, or slicing with a knife.
In a small bowl, mix reserved 1/2 cup buttermilk with reserved 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine.  With a spoon, lightly drizzle this mixture over scones.  Bake at 375 for 10 minutes.  Repeat drizzling and bake 10 more minutes, checking that scones are browning evenly--rotate cookie sheet if necessary.  Repeat drizzling and bake remaining 10 minutes.  Scones are done when an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
Remove scones from cookie sheet immediately and cool on wire racks.  Store loosely covered to preserve texture.
