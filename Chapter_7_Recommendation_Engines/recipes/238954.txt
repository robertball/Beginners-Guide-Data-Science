Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, divided
4 fluid ounces bourbon whiskey, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt 1/4 cup butter, 2 ounces bourbon, and olive oil together in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook sea scallops in hot butter-bourbon mixture until browned and just about cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate and drain any excess liquid from the skillet.
Whisk remaining butter, remaining bourbon, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in the same skillet over medium-high heat until sauce reduces and alcohol evaporates, 1 to 3 minutes. Drizzle sauce over scallops.

Description: 
This dish was conceptualized for the Victory Dinner Celebration at the 2014 Buzzard's Bay Cup Challenge. It played off local and imported ingredients for the event. I like to serve these over a field of wilted greens like Swiss or rainbow chard.
