Ingredients:
Recipe for 2 pie crusts, or 2 store bought crusts
1/2 stick butter, melted
2 Tbsps Brandy
1 tsp vanilla
8 medium apples- cored, peeled and sliced
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp allspice
1/8 tsp nutmeg
3   tbsp flour
Wash:
1/4 cup milk to brush top of crust with
small amount of sugar to sprinkle/toss

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Press bottom crust into a lightly buttered pie dish.
In a large bowl, mix apples, butter, vanilla and brandy- stirring gently,just to coat apples. In a smaller mixing bowl, combine sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and flour - stirring til well blended. Add the sugar mixture to the apples and stir gently til the sugar mixture has begun to melt into the liquid butter/brandy mix. (about 5 or 6 stirs) Dump apple mixture into the crusted pie plate. You will have a high mound of apples , dont worry - they will bake down! Make your mound higher in the middle. Too with the 2nd crust, sealing well and then cut 4-5 slits in top crust for steam to escape. Brush the top of crust with the 1/4 cup of milk as a wash and sprinkle with a small amount of sugar. Place on a baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees for 20 mins, then lower the oven heat and bake at 350 for 40 mins.
