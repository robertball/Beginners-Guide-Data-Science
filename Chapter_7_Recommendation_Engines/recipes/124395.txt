Description: 
THIS IS one of those dishes that our family calls 'a Mama recipe'. My mother rarely consulted a cookbook, so when asked for a recipe, she could only estimate.    I've worked out the ingredients to make it for two, but it can easily by doubled. It's simply a good, wholesome dish most folks seem to enjoy.                                                               --Betty Allen                                                             East Point, Georgia
