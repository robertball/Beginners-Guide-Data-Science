I love left overs and especially during our Hewfit challenge I am hungry more often.

Last night I made Chicken Scarpiello and packed up the extra chicken and chicken sausage and made this dish.  I will share a recipe for you to cook up chicken if you don't have leftovers handy.  Actually, go and pick up a rotisserie chicken. That would be super easy!
