1/4 green bell pepper, finely chopped
5 leaves fresh basil, finely chopped
1 avocado, halved and pitted

1 splash lime juice
1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 pinch curry powder
1 pinch ground cumin

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, bell pepper, and basil in a large bowl or mortar. Spoon avocado into the bowl. Add lemongrass paste, salt, lime juice, gochujang, curry powder, and cumin, in that order. Mash and combine using a pestle or wooden spoon until guacamole appears brown with specks of color.

Description: 
Wanted to give some Asian influences to guacamole one night, so I found some random items in the fridge and pantry and whipped it up. It looks ugly upon completion, but has definite delicious flair! Use with chips, enchiladas, or tacos, or whatever else you think benefits from guacamole. Add spices to your liking.
