Description: 
I love Thai food, but have trouble finding some of the unique ingredients at my small town's store. This coconut chicken soup has a similar flavor to traditional Thai soup with easy-to-find ingredients. My husband was very impressed with the recipe and is eager to eat it again. Recipe can also be served with or over rice.
