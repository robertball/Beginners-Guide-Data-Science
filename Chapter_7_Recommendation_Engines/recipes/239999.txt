Ingredients:
2/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
2 cups thinly sliced apples
1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, shortening, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg together in a bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth; stir in oats, apples, and flour until dough is evenly combined. Drop dough by rounded tablespoons, about 2 inches apart, onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I adapted an old oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I had to match a more autumnal feel, and it turned out really good. The apples came through nicely and the cookie itself is light, soft, and nicely crumbly.
