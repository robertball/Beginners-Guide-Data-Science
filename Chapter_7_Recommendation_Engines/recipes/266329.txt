Ingredients:
3 cups orange juice
3 medium Fuji apples, peeled and finely chopped
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, or more to taste
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
Combine orange juice, apples, cranberries, white sugar, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until apples are tender and sauce has thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
Transfer sauce to a dish; stir in softened butter and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. Sauce will continue to thicken.
