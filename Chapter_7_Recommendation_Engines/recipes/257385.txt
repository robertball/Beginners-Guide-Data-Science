1 green onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Add mung beans; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Rinse under cool running water to stop the cooking process. Drain well; transfer to a bowl.
Combine baby carrot and green onion in a small microwave-safe bowl. Cover with water and place in the microwave for 30 seconds. Drain.
Stir baby carrot and green onion into the bean sprouts in the bowl. Add sesame oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and sesame seeds; mix by hand until combined.
