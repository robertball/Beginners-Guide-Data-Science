Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups chicken broth
3 red potatoes, peeled and diced, or more to taste
1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon hot sauce
2 (13 ounce) cans shrimp bisque
3 1/4 cups half-and-half
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 pound fresh blue crabmeat

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Saute onion, celery, and garlic until tender, about 8 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in broth. Add potatoes, clam juice, wine, seafood seasoning, and hot sauce. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat. Simmer, stirring chowder occasionally, until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Mix shrimp bisque with an equal amount of half-and-half and pour into the chowder. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in shrimp and crabmeat. Simmer until shrimp just turns pink, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a rich, creamy, extremely flavorful, chowder house-quality seafood chowder! Once your guests have tasted it, they won't be able to stop eating. It's even great re-heated for leftovers. Best results if the chowder is allowed to sit in the fridge overnight and then heated in a slow cooker the next day! Absolutely delicious!
