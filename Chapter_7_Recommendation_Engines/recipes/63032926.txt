Ingredients:
Two whole 3-4 lb. chicken, natural and pasture raised, parted out, the breasts deboned and pounded to 1/4".
6 slices ham or Prosciuto, from a pastured pig
6 slices Swiss cheese, raw if available, preferably from pastured cows and as fresh and natural as possible OR 3 oz. grated fresh guyere cheese.
1/4 cup almond or coconut meal
3 TB butter, melted

Directions:
Split the chickens into parts, deboning the breasts until you have wings, legs, thighs and breasts.
In a 9 by 13 inch pan that has been buttered, lay the legs, thighs and wings into the pan, arranging them in one layer, as close as possible.  If the pan leaves too much space, consider switching to a smaller pan.
Over the legs and wings, lay first the ham then the cheese.
Over the cheese and ham, put the chicken breasts.
Mix the meal and the butter and crumble on top of the breasts.
Place in a 350 degree oven until 165 degrees by probe into the middle of the casserole.  Let cool and cut with a sharp spatula, separating pieces underneath.
