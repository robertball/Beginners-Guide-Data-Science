Ingredients:
1 cup millet
3 cups water
1/2 tsp. salt
1 T chia seed (opt)

Directions:
Toast millet lightly in dry skillet to give a nuttier taste about 4-5 min. until it turns a rich golden brown No need to rinse.  Be careful not to let them burn.
Add the water, chia and salt to the pan: Since the pan is hot, the water will sputter a bit when you pour it in. After adding water and salt, give the millet a good stir.
Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.
Decrease the heat to low, and cover the pot. Simmer until the grains absorb most of the water (they'll continue soaking it up as they sit), about 15 minutes. Stir every few minutes as the millet simmers. Avoid the temptation to peek a great deal or stir too much (unless its sticking to the bottom). Stirring too vigorously will break up the grains and change the texture. For moist porridge with added nutrition, add 1 tbsp chia seeds to your millet as it cooks. The chia make the porridge sticky yet moist and keep it that way for longer than if you omit them.
Remove From Heat and Let Stand: Like most grains, millet needs a little time off the heat to fully absorb the liquid. Allow it to sit, covered and removed from heat, for 10 minutes.
