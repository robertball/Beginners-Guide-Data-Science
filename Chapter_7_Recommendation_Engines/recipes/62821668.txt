Description: 
This is a delicious and easy dessert to make, short in ingredients and time. Looks beautiful in a trifle bowl. Great as a summer dessert or a birthday/holiday
dessert. Depending on how many people you are serving it usually does not last more than 1 day in my house! This can also be easily modified with other fresh fruits but strawberry is our favorite! Enjoy~
