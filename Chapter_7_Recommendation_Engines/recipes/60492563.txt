Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) sweet potato
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
raisins

Directions:
Boil sweet potato whole in skin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done.  Run cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin.
Break apart sweet potato in a bowl.  Add butter, and mix well with mixer. Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth.  Pour filling into an unbaked pie crusts.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until knife inserted in centers comes out clean.  Pies will puff up like a souffle, and then will sink down as they cools.
Once cool, put a dallop of whip cream on top and make an initial or fun shape out of raisins.
