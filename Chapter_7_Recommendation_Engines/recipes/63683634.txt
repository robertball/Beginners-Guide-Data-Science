1 teaspoon fresh oregano leaves, minced or to taste
1 cup american, cheddar or parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix squash and zucchini in bowl with oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Spread 1/2 of  tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Sprinkle with onion.
Arrange alternating slices of  zucchini and  yellow squash, starting at the outer edge of the dish and working concentrically towards the center. Overlap the slices a little to display the colors. Gentle spread remaining sauce over vegetables.  Sprinkle with thyme, oregano and cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender, about 45 to 60  minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
