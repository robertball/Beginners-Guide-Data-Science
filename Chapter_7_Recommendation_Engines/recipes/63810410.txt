Ingredients:
1 package turkey meatballs (we like the Trader Joes brand)
2 T honey
2 T chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped small
2 T apple cider vinegar
1 T olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Garlic to taste

Directions:
Thaw meatballs. Warm olive oil in a shallow pan and add meatballs to brown slightly. Combine all other ingredients in a bowl and whisk together. Pour over meatballs and cook a few more minutes so the meatballs absorb the sauce. Serve with rice.
