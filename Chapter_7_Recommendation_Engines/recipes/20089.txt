Ingredients:
3 ears corn, husked and cleaned
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 egg white
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Use a knife to cut the kernels from the corn cobs.  Using dull side of knife, scrape the remaining milk and pulp off of the cobs and into a bowl. Add the cut corn, egg yolk, flour, sugar, salt and pepper, and stir together.
In a separate bowl, beat the egg white to stiff peaks and fold into corn mixture.
Heat a lightly oiled skillet or frying pan, over medium heat. Drop large spoonfuls of corn batter onto the skillet a few inches apart. Cook until golden on bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn over and cook opposite side until golden. Briefly drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

This is a wonderful breakfast dish. We love it with bacon on the side and syrup on top. It's a great way to bring fresh sweet corn to your breakfast table.
