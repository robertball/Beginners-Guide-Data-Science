Ingredients:
1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter
3/4 cup (5 1/4 ounces) sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon lemon oil
1 tablespoon + 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon powder
1 1/2 cups (6 1/4 ounces) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
yellow gel-paste food colors, or bottled food color (optional)
3 tablespoons coarse or granulated sugar, for topping

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.
In a medium-sized bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fully.
Add the egg, vanilla, baking powder, salt, lemon oil, and lemon powder, beating on medium speed until well blended.
Add the flour and coconut, beating until thoroughly combined.
Use food color to tint the cookies yellow. Mix the dough, adding more color until it's as intense as you like.
Place the coarse sugar in a small bowl. Drop the dough by tablespoonfuls into the bowl, one at a time, shaking the bowl to coat with sugar.
Gently roll cookies into smooth balls with your hands, then transfer to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake the cookies for 9 to 10 minutes, for soft cookies. For crunchier cookies, bake for 12 minutes, until they're barely beginning to brown around the edges.
Remove from the oven, and after a few minutes transfer them to a rack to cool.

If you're a citrus lover, a true-blue fan of the tart, refreshing flavor of lemon or lime, these cookies are for you. Tinting them bright yellow or green is optional, but adds snap to the presentation. Recipe from King Arthur Flour
