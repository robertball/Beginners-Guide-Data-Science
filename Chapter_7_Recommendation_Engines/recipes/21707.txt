Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup finely crushed herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix
2 cups finely crushed herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked
2 eggs
1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1/3 cup butter
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/3 cups water
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups cubed tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup of the finely crushed stuffing mix. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9 inch pie plate.
In a large bowl, mix together 2 cups crushed bread stuffing, cheddar cheese, 1 cup water, milk, salmon, eggs, and chicken bouillon. Season with dry mustard, parsley and onion, and mix well. Spoon mixture into crust.
Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through; let stand 10 minutes before slicing.
Meanwhile melt remaining 1/3 cup butter, in a medium saucepan. Stir in cornstarch, 1 1/3 cup water, dill weed and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a full boil. Add tomatoes and return to a boil for 1 minute.
To serve, cut pie into 6 wedges and spoon sauce over each piece.
