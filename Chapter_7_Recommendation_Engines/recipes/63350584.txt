Ingredients:
150 g (5 or 6 oz.) of bacon, in long strips
1 medium onion, chopped
2  4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 lb (500g) of lean ground beef
? cup BBQ sauce + about 3 tablespoons reserved
½ cup finely shredded or diced white bread, about 1 slice
2 eggs, beaten
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp dried oregano
½ tsp chili powder (optional)

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 175° C (350°F), and lightly grease a baking pan.
Get a skillet hot over medium-high heat, and fry bacon for about 1 or 2 minutes on each side, just until it starts curling, and set it aside.
Drain most of the bacon grease, leaving maybe a tbsp, and sautee the onions and garlic until soft, about 6 – 7 minutes, then set aside.
Put the next 8 ingredients in a large bowl, adding the cooled onion and garlic, and mix well with your hands. Form the mixture into a meatloaf shape and put in the center of a greased 9×11 casserole dish.
Take each piece of partially cooked bacon and wrap over the top of the meatloaf, pushing the ends a bit under the meatloaf to hold the shape.
Bake for about 35 minutes, then remove from the oven and brush the remaining BBQ sauce over the bacon. (This is when I take most of the drippings out to make gravy.)
Return to the oven for about 10 more minutes (I have a fan assisted oven, and always turn it on now, it makes the bacon more crispy).
Let stand 10 minutes before serving
