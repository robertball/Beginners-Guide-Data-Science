Description: 
So, I have been on a search for the perfect pretzel recipe for a long time, as I LOVE pretzels. I found a recipe online, and did a complete overhaul to have the pretzel taste I love so much.

 The great thing about this recipe is that if you want pretzels in the traditional form or loaves, they both taste amazing.
