Description: 
You can pretty much get Mexican food like tacos and burritos in just about any corner of the country these days. However, Mexican Shrimp Cocktails don't seem to have caught on elsewhere as they have in the Bay Area. Here's my version--you can adapt your own recipe using the listed ingredients and amounts as a rough guide.
