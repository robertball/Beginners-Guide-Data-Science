Ingredients:
2 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1 1/2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter, cut in small pieces
1 (16 ounce) package maple-flavored breakfast sausage
1 cup cooked wild rice
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup chicken stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange squash halves, cut-side up, in a roasting pan. Run a fork through the meat of each half, creating grooves. Sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and pepper; dot with butter pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat is tender enough to puncture with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add wild rice, cranberries, and chicken stock; cook and stir until rice and cranberries have absorbed the chicken stock, about 5 minutes.
Spoon the sausage filling into each squash half. Return stuffed squash to oven and bake until flavors have blended, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I only make this recipe in autumn since the flavors are so fall-like. The hint of maple syrup and warm cranberries really sets it off. This is nice enough for company and pairs wonderfully with crusty bread and a full bodied white wine. My hubby starts asking for it as early as late August!
