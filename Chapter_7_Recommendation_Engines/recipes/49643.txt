Place the onion, sugar, mustard, celery seed, and black pepper into a small bowl. Pour in the vinegar, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is thick. Cover, and refrigerate at least 3 hours.

Description: 
This sweet and crunchy salad is very kid friendly! I first tried this when I visited my family in Newfoundland, and managed to get a copy of the recipe.  Make lots, there won't be any left over. Any kind of lettuce can be used as well as spinach.  Raisins can also be added.
