Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
7 cloves garlic, chopped
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 1/2 cups chopped green bell pepper
3 pounds lean ground beef
1 (5 ounce) jar green olives, pitted and halved
5 ounces capers, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2 dried bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon hot sauce
6 cups canned tomatoes, half-drained

Directions:
In a large stock pot, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Saute garlic, onion and green pepper until onions are transparent. Transfer onion mixture to a bowl and set aside. In the same pot, heat the remaining olive oil and brown the ground beef.
In a separate saucepan, combine the olives, capers, vinegar, salt, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves and hot sauce. Let simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Place the olive mixture and the onion mixture into the pot with the ground beef. Add the half drained tomatoes and cook for 1 hour over medium heat; stirring occasionally.

Description: 
My aunt introduced me to this delicious dish. In the past few years I've made changes and come up with what my family feels is the best Brazilian dish around! A great chili alternative and it freezes well.
