Ingredients:
2 lb Grass-Fed Ground Beef
2 TBS Taco Seasoning, (Allrecipes mix)
3 tsp Arrowroot Starch
1 tsp Olive Oil
1 large Yellow Onion, large dice
2 Bell Peppers (any color), large dice
3 Plum Tomatoes (or one big Tomato), seeded and diced
1 can Black Olives, sliced, drained
1 small can Diced Green Chiles, drained
1 batch Jiffy cornbread (made as directed)
sour cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
In a large oven-safe skillet, brown the beef completely, breaking up with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl and set aside. In the same skillet you cooked the beef, add the olive oil, then onions and peppers. Stir-fry until translucent and fragrant, about 10 minutes.
Add the beef back into the skillet, along with 3/4 of the olives and all of the tomatoes.
Combine the arrowroot starch and the Taco Seasoning then pour into the skillet and stir, over heat, to combine everything.
Pour the prepared cornbread batter over everything in the pan. Spread to cover evenly to edges.
Top with the remaining sliced olives and diced green chiles.
Bake for 35 minutes, until cornbread is golden.
Let sit 5 minutes before serving.
Serve with sour cream.
