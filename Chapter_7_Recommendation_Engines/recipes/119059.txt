2 (9 inch) pastry shells
2 cups diced fully cooked ham
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 teaspoons dried minced onion
4 eggs
2 cups half-and-half cream

1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Line unpricked pastry shells with a double thickness of heavy-duty foil. Bake at 400 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 minutes longer.
Divide ham, cheese and onion between the shells. In a bowl, whisk eggs, cream, salt and pepper. Pour into shells. Cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Or cover edges with foil and bake at 400 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Let stand for 5-10 minutes before cutting.
