Description: 
This sour beef dish was often cooked by my German grandmother. It is perfect for any Oktoberfest celebration and is sure to get many rave reviews. My wife was not so hot on the idea of sour beef until she tried it in Germanland in Epcot Center. Serve with potato dumplings, potato pancakes or boiled potatoes (or boiled cauliflower).
