Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 3/4 cups milk
1 tablespoon tahini
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt together in a saucepan. Stir in milk. Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add tahini and vanilla extract; stir well.

Description: 
Not having an oven in my present home made me come up with a twist to an otherwise good - but plain - chocolate pudding. If you are not a big fan of tahini, reduce the amount by half.
