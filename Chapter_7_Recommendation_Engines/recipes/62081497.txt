Ingredients:
1 tsp of ground mustard

Cut ends off of asparagus. Put asparagus in boiling water for 2 - 3 minutes until bright green, but not limp. Remove from water and place asparagus in refrigerator until well chilled (about 45 minutes).
Mix/whisk together the mustard, egg yolk, olive oil, lemon juice and soy sauce in a small bowl. Pour over chilled asparagus and serve immediately.
