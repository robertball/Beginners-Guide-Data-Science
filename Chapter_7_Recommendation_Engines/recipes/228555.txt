Description: 
I love fig preserves from my tree, but I haven't run across a lot of recipes for using the preserves on this website. So I am submitting one of my family's favorites. This one is quick and easy, yet so yummy. You can substitute any fruit preserves or jam or fresh fruits boiled down in sugar to make a syrup base. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.
