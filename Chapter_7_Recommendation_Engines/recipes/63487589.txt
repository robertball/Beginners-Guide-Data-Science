Gently rinse blueberries without breaking.
Let the berries air dry on paper towels until completely dry.
Temper chocolate. See instructions on tempering in notes.
Drop five berries at a time into chocolate and gently enrobe them with the melted chocolate. DO NOT break the berries or your chocolate will seize.
