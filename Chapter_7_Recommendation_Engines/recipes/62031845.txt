Directions:
First warm a skillet over med. low heat.  Put butter and all seasonings in pan and mix together a bit as butter melts.  Cruble tofu into pan and stir well to mix the ingredients.  Saute tofu until juices evaporate to desired juiciness.  I usually cook it about 8-10 minutes.

Description: 
A great and healthy substitute for scrambled eggs in the morning.  The kids my mom used to babysit preferred these and called them Chinese Eggs.  They didn't know what tofu was!
