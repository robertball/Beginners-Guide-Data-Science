Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 pound okra, sliced in 1/4 inch pieces
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
salt and black pepper to taste
2 cups water

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onions, and cook until softened and dark brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste until no lumps remain. Add the okra, and sprinkle with turmeric, salt, and pepper. Pour in the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the okra is very tender and the sauce has thickened slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper again before serving.

A tasty Afghan dish with okra. My mom always makes this dish for us. You can also use fresh tomatoes rather than the tomato paste.
