Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef (I prefer 93% lean)
1/2 cup instand white rice
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup finely chopped red or green bell pepper
2 garlic cloves minced or pressed
1 teaspoon Mrs. Dash Table Blend
1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper (I use 4 peppercorn mix)
1 teaspoon herbs - your choice, thyme, basil, oregano, taragon... you pick!
2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce - low sodium
1 egg beaton
1/4 cup no salt ketchup
1/4 cup milk (I use 2%)
1/4 cup Japaneese Planko bread crumbs (much lower sodium)
(Add a 1/4 cup of cheese for a change)
1/4 cup no salt ketchup to spread on top before cooking.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375
In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients together, the mixture will be very wet, this is okay!!  It needs to be wet as the rice will absorb the moisture as it cooks.  Be carefull to not pack the meat to much.  Place into a loaf pan, cover with ketchup and bake for 35-45 minutes.  Or until internal temp is 160.
