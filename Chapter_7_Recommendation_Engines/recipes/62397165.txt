Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil OR 1/2 each: oil & applesauce.
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups sour cream
2 cups blueberries, stems removed
8 - 10 strawberries, hulled and sliced small
1 cinnamon stick
A sprinkle of sanding sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In large bowl beat eggs, gradually add sugar while beating. Continue beating while slowly pouring in oil. Stir in  vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, salt and baking soda.
Stir dry ingredients into the egg mixture alternately with the sour cream. Very gently fold in the blueberries. Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups to about 2/3 full. Grate cinnamon sparingly over muffin tops, just enought for it to be noticed. Sprinkle with sanding sugar.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Minis will take less time to bake through.

Delicious muffins. Summer fresh blueberries baking in a creamy batter just smells like a sunny day. The addition of smallish sized pieces of strawberries to the creation adds a perfect pop of tang.Modified from: Blueberry Cream Muffins
