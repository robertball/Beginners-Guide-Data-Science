Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 cups frozen cut okra, thawed
1/4 teaspoon black mustard seeds
3 curry leaves, or more to taste (optional)
1 medium onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or to taste
2 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 tablespoon tamarind concentrate

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a large, deep skillet. Add okra and cook until the 'stickiness' of the okra is no longer visible and they begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set cooked okra aside in a bowl.
Heat remaining tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat in the same skillet. Add mustard seeds and cook until the seeds pop and are fragrant, about 5 minutes; add curry leaves and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir in onions and garlic and cook until softened and brown, about 5 minutes. Mix in cooked okra and tomatoes; cook until they begin to stew, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cumin, salt, coriander, turmeric, and black pepper; mix well.
Pour in water and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro and tamarind concentrate. Serve.

Description: 
Cheap and delicious, this soupy vegetarian curry goes wonderful with cooked rice. Anti-veggie eaters love this enough to go for seconds, and are surprised that 'okra tastes good!' Serve with rice.
