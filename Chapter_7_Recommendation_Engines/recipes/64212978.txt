Ingredients:
2 cups dried elderberries
2 cups distilled water
1/2 cup dried rose hips
1/2 cup dried hibiscus flower
1 Tbsp fresh ginger, grated
1 cinnamon stick
6 whole cloves
8 Tbsp Great LakesÂ© grass-fed gelatin
1 cup raw, local honey
12 oz of freshly pureed whole fruit (such as organic strawberries or blueberries)

Directions:
Add all ingredients except fruit, gelatin, and honey to a heavy sauce pan and bring to a boil.
Reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Strain through a sieve, squeezing all the juice from berries. Discard the solids. Return the liquid to the pan over low heat.
Sprinkle gelatin over top and whisk until dissolved.
Remove from heat, let cool so it is warm, but NOT HOT.
Stir in honey until dissolved and immediately pour into fun-shaped silicone molds or a 9" x 13" pan lightly greased with coconut oil.
Pop into fridge to harden about 30 mins. Remove from molds or cut into pieces and store in an airtight container in refrigerator.
