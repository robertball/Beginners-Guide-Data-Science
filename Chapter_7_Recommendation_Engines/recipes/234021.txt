Ingredients:
1 cup ditalini pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
4 slices bacon, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 quart chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can Romano beans, drained
1/4 cup tomato paste
1 pinch crushed dried chile pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 teaspoons grated Romano cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat; stir in the ditalini, and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 6 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; stir in onion and bacon and saute until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic into onion mixture; cook over medium-low heat just until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir chicken broth, beans, tomato paste, and chile pepper into onion-bacon mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until fully heated through, about 10 minutes. Stir ditalini and parsley into the soup; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle each serving with Romano cheese.

Description: 
As a Canadian, growing up in Toronto's Little Italy, this soup was always on someone's stovetop somewhere in the fall and winter months. Pasta, beans, and a thick broth, sprinkled with Parm or Romano, and served with fresh crusty Italian bread - what's not to love? I spent a lot of time, back in the day, in the cucina with my friends and their mothers learning the basics of good Italian food!
