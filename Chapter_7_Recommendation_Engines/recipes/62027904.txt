Ingredients:
9 uncooked lasagna noodles
1/4 cup of margarine or butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup flour
2 chicken flavor bouillion cubes or 2 teaspoons instant chicken bouillion granules
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups cottage cheese
1 1/2 lbs. broccoli florets, cooked and drained
1 6oz. jar Green Giant Sliced Mushrooms, drained
12 oz. shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Cook lasagna noodles to desired doneness as directed on package.  Drain; rinse with cold water.
Heat oven to 350.  Melt margarine in 4-quart saucepan.  Add onion; cook until tender.  Stir in flour, bouillion, garlic salt, thyme and pepper; cook until mixture is smooth and bubbly, stirring constantly.  Gradually add milk, cooking until mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly.  Stir in cottage cheese, broccoli and mushrooms.
In an ungreased 13x9-inch pan, layer 1/3 of the noodles (patted dry), 1/3 of the sauce (about 2 cups) and 1/3 of the Swiss cheese; repeat layers twice.  Bake at 350 for 25-35 minutes or until thoroughly heated.  Let stand 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I promise you this is THE BEST Broccoli Lasagna ever (it's made with SWISS cheese)!  This comes from an old friend, Mary Griffin's mother!  I lost contact with my friend for 15 years.... after finding her, this is the recipe I asked her for immediately!  It's THAT memorable!
