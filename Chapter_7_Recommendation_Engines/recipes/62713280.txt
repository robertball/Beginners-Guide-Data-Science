Ingredients:
For the Dough:
3/4 cup cottage cheese
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
4 tbs unsalted butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tbs baking powder
1/2 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp baking soda
Filling:
1 1/2 tbs unsalted butter, melted
2/3 brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
Glazing:
2/3 cup confectioners sugar
2-3 tbs cold milk
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease the sides and bottom of a 9 or 10 inch springform pan.
Blend cottage cheese, milk, sugar, melted butter and vanilla until smooth.Pour into a large bowl. In separate bowl mix flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Add flour mixture to liquid mixture until smooth and doughy- pour out onto floured counter and roll the dough into a rectangle.
For filling, brush the dough with the melted butter. Mix brown sugar with cinnamon and then sprinkle over the dough.
Starting from the long edge, roll the dough and use butter to press the seams. Cut the roll in half, the halves in half, and then those halves in half- you should end up with eight.
Arrange in pan and bake 20 to 25 minutes or until brown.
For glazing, mix confectioners sugar, vanilla, and cold milk. Drizzle over rolls.
