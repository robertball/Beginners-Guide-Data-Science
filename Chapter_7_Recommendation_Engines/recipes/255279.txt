Description: 
I'm not sure if using honey instead of sugar really qualifies as a 'West Coast twist,' but it does ensure that people from North Carolina can't attack me for this Eastern North Carolina-style barbecue sauce not being authentic. Anyway, while this isn't exactly what you might find in the Tar Heel State, it was fantastic on pulled pork.
