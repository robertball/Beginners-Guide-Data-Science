Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 tablespoons green curry paste
2 green onions with tops, chopped
3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
2 cups coconut milk
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup cilantro leaves, for garnish

Directions:
Toss chicken first in 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce, then in the flour, coating pieces evenly. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Place chicken in the skillet, cook and stir chicken until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken.
Reduce heat to medium and stir in curry paste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant, then stir in green onions, garlic, and ginger; cook an additional 2 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet, stirring to coat with the curry mixture. Stir the coconut milk, fish sauce, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and sugar into the chicken-curry mixture. Allow to simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes until the chicken is tender. Serve garnished with cilantro leaves.
