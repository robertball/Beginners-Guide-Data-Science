Ingredients:
1 pound carrots
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
Heavy pinch kosher salt
1 cup ginger ale
1 Tbsp chili powder
1 Tbsp chopped parsley

Directions:
In a 12-inch saute pan over medium heat, combine the carrots, butter, salt and ginger ale. Cover and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, remove the lid, stir, and reduce the heat to low. Cover again and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, add the chili powder and increase the heat to high. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the ginger ale is reduced to a glaze, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with the parsley.
