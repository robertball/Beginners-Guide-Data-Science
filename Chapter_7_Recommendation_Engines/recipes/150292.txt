Description: 
This is a super flavorful rub with a Southwest taste for flat iron steak. You can use this recipe for grilling, broiling or stove top (fry pan or stove top grill) cooking. The steak is also great served with a few slices of avocado on top. Let the rub sit for up to 2 days, if possible, for the best flavor.
