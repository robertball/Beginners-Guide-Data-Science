Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 bell pepper, sliced
1 medium onion, vertically sliced
12 ounces lean ground beef
4 ounces ground pork
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/4 cup Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups marinara sauce (such as ClassicoÂ® Tomato and Basil)
1/2 cup red wine
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
water as needed (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms, bell pepper, and onion. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Mix ground beef, ground pork, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.  Divide meat mixture into four equal portions and form into burgers.
Heat skillet over medium-high heat and brown burgers for about 4 minutes on each side. Remove burgers to a plate and set aside.
Reduce heat to low and add garlic to the skillet. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add marinara sauce, red wine, sugar, basil, and crushed red pepper flakes; mix to combine.  Add burgers back to the skillet, spoon sauce over them, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes.
Check occasionally and stir in a little water if the sauce becomes too dry.  Remove cover and add mushrooms, bell peppers, and onions back to the skillet. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.
