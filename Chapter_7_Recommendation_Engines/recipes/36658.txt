Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, divided
1 medium onion, chopped
2 medium apples, peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 banana, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/4 cup white wine
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 (10 ounce) package couscous, cooked
garnish: chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion and saute 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Add remaining 2 teaspoons butter, apple, banana, and garlic. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, 5 minutes or until slightly tender. Stir in curry powder and wine. Cook 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, salt, and pepper, and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Stir into couscous. Serve immediately; or press into ramekins, and unmold onto plates at serving time. If you prepare the couscous ahead of time, stir in additional chicken broth when reheating.
