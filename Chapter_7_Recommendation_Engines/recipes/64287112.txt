Ingredients:
1 ¼ cups Graham Cracker Crumbs
6 Tbsp Unsalted Butter, melted
¼ cup Sugar
5 8oz packages Cream Cheese, room temperature
1 cup Sour Cream
Zest 1 Lemon
4 Eggs
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Vanilla
1 ½ cups Sugar
¼ cup All Purpose Flour
¾ of cup Berry Preserves
Fresh Berries for garnish

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Line the outside of a 10 by 3” spring form pan with aluminum foil, spray it with non stick cooking spray and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the crust ingredients until it forms a coarse crumbly mixture. Pour it into your prepared pan and press it evenly. Bake for 8 minutes and set aside while you make your filling.
3. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, mix together all of the filling ingredients for about 1 minute or until thoroughly combined.
4. Pour the mixture over your crust, and bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes exactly.
5. Cool completely at room temperature then transfer to a fridge and cool overnight.
6. Add the preserves in a small pan and just heat it up enough to make the preserves a little easier to drizzle. Drizzle the preserves evenly over the top, and scatter your fresh berries all over the top. Place it on a platter and enjoy!

Description: 
This was the first ever cheesecake I made, the picture looked so nice because I decided to decorate it with homemade Katata berry sauce and some more woke berries for garnish. Of course you may use whatever fruit your heart desires! I just love the tangy-Ness of the Katata berries with the very rich and sweet cheesecake.
