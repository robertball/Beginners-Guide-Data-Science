Ingredients:
2 TBS. water
1 TBS soy sauce
1 TBS sugar
2 lbs boneless skinless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces
5 green onions, sliced
5 TBS oil (divided)
3 TBS chopped garlic (or 3 cloves chopped)
2 packages fresh baby spinach leaves
1 cup fresh basil leaves, sliced thin

Directions:
Mix soy sauce, water and sugar. Marinade chicken for half-hour or so. Meanwhile, using 1 TBS oil, stir fry green onions in wok or large skillet for 1 minute, don't overdo it. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Remove this to a small bowl. Add 3 TBS oil to wok and stir fry the chicken (and marinade) for 5 minutes, until no pink is remaining. Add spinach leaves and cover for 4 minutes, stirring once in a while so leaves get uniformly steamed. Add green onion mixture back in, stir to mix and reheat the onions. Stir in basil, heat through, and serve!

Description: 
This is easy and my kids love it. I've also made it with cubed pork from cheap pork chops. You can spice this dish up with crushed red pepper flakes. Serve over rice. Don't substitute dried basil, though! It has to be fresh! And though it sounds like a lot of basil, that makes the dish.
