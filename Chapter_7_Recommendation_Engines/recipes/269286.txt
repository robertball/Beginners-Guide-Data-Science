Ingredients:
1 cup coconut flakes
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup lightly packed brown sugar
2/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Heat a small skillet over medium-low heat. Toast coconut flakes and pecans in batches until lightly browned and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Cream butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in egg and vanilla extract. Beat to combine.
Combine flour and baking soda in a bowl. Add to butter mixture and mix until just combined. Stir in toasted pecans and coconut.
Place scoops of dough on the prepared baking sheet using a 1 1/2-tablespoon spring-hinged scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Carefully remove from baking sheet and transfer to a cooling rack.

Description: 
This is a buttery coconut-pecan cookie. The crunch comes from the pecans and coconut, but the cookie itself is chewy. I do not add salt to this recipe, as I think with salted butter enough salt is present.
