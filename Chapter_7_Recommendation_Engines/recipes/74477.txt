Ingredients:
6 U.S. Farm-Raised Catfish fillets
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon crushed dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup dry white wine
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Wash the catfish fillets and pat dry. Set aside. Combine all the dry ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
Melt the butter in a pan. Add the lemon juice and mix well. Dip the fillets into the butter mixture. Sprinkle the fillets liberally with the spice mixture on both sides, and set aside.
When ready to cook, heat a black iron skillet on the stove until very hot. Carefully place the fillets in the skillet and cook for about 2 minutes on each side. Keep moving with a spatula to prevent sticking. When the fillets are cooked, remove them from the skillet. Remove the skillet from the burner. Pour the butter mixture into the skillet, quickly adding the wine, and stir. Pour the pan juices over the fillets and serve immediately.
