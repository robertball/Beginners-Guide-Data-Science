8 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 Tbsp butter
2 large carrots
4-6 potatoes
1 large onion
2 stalks celery
1 red bell pepper
1/2 cup mayonnaise

8 oz. cheese, such as Swiss, smoked Gouda, Fontina, Gruyere, etc

Directions:
Using a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, mince onion, carrot, celery, and bell pepper.  Set aside.  Switching to the slicing attachment, slice the potatoes and set aside.  Switching to the shredder attachment, shred the cheeses and set aside.
In Dutch oven, heat butter over medium heat.  Saute onion, celery, carrots, and bell pepper until softened.  Pour in chicken broth, black pepper, and potatoes.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.  Gradually whisk in mayonnaise and cheese spread and heat through.  Remove from heat and add shredded cheese. Whisk until cheese is melted.  Stir in potato flakes and let soup sit and thicken, about 15 minutes.
