Ingredients:
1 slice bacon, cut into thirds
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup crushed butter-flavored crackers
5 tablespoons shredded Swiss cheese, divided
4 1/2 teaspoons chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/2 pound lean ground beef

Directions:
In a skillet, cook bacon over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side or until cooked but not crisp. Drain on a paper towel; set aside.
In a bowl, combine the egg, crackers, 4 tablespoons cheese, onion, garlic, salt, sage and pepper. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. Shape into a loaf and place in a greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Place bacon pieces over top. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cheese; bake 2-4 minutes longer or until a meat thermometer reads 160 degrees F and cheese is melted.

Description: 
I saw this recipe on a TV show on Amish cooking in the 1980s, and I've adapted it to suit our tastes. The Swiss cheese and bacon make it very satisfying on cold fall and winter evenings.
