https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup chopped kale, removing the center spine
¼ cup chopped cucumbers
1/8 cup chopped celery
1/8 cup chopped red or green peppers
2 tablespoons of a low carbohydrate salad dressing (I used Walden’s Sun Dried Tomato)

Directions:
Mix all together.  You can use any veggies you want, tomatoes, broccoli so feel free to mix it up! But keep the Kale as it is literally a nutritional powerhouse, containing high fiber, antioxidants, and a good supply of vitamins A, C, and K. You’ll need to add a lean (7 oz of baked salmon or chicken would be nice) to make this a complete lean and green meal.
