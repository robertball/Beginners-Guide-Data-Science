Ingredients:
3 tablespoons salted butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons blackstrap molasses
2 tablespoons canned pumpkin puree
1 tablespoon apple juice
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup raw pecans
1 cup quick-cooking oats (optional)
1/2 cup unsweetened dried cranberries
1/4 cup pitted dates, chopped
1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
1/4 cup chopped pistachios
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add maple syrup, molasses, pumpkin puree, apple juice, pumpkin spice, and vanilla extract; whisk until blended and warmed through.
Combine pecans, oats, cranberries, dates, hazelnuts, pistachios, and pumpkin seeds in a large mixing bowl. Pour in maple syrup mixture and toss to combine. Spread mixture onto the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until granola looks dry, 3 to 4 hours. Allow to cool until crisp. Crumble into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a covered container.

Description: 
Made without grains, this pumpkin seed granola is sticky, almost like a toffee. If you choose to include oats, it makes a more traditional style. Either way, the spices are spot-on for a pumpkin spiced, autumnal treat that's perfect for breakfast with milk or as an afternoon snack. Store in a sealed, covered container up to 1 month.
