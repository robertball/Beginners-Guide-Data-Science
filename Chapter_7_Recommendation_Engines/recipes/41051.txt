Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 slightly beaten egg
1 slightly beaten egg white
3/4 cup fat free milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 (1 inch thick) slices firm-textured French bread
1/4 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon powdered sugar (optional)

Directions:
Coat a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. In a pie plate combine egg, egg white, milk, vanilla, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. Soak bread slices in egg mixture for about 1 minute per side. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in a 450 degree F oven about 6 minutes or until bread is lightly browned. Turn bread over and bake 5 to 8 minutes more or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, for orange syrup, in a small saucepan stir together orange peel, orange juice, honey, cornstarch, and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir 2 minutes more.
If desired, sift powdered sugar over toast. Serve with warm orange syrup.

Description: 
Once you try this oven-baked French toast, you'll never make it the old way again. On a griddle or in a skillet, French toast must be made in batches. Baking allows you to make eight slices at one time.
