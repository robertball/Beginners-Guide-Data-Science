Description: 
This recipe is one I started making years ago by accident, when I was out of barbecue sauce and tried Bloody Mary mix instead. My children love it! (I like to wash, skin and remove fat from the chicken the night before and refrigerate, so that it only takes a few minutes to prepare the meal before I leave for work.)
