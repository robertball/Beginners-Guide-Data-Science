Ingredients:
3/4 pound spaghetti
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.
Stir the garlic, ricotta, and basil in a saucepan over medium-low until hot, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir in the spaghetti and reserved water from cooking the pasta. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
