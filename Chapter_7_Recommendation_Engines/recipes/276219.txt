Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups brown sugar
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons honey
8 small Golden Delicious apples, peeled and cut into small pieces
1 refrigerated pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine sugar, cinnamon, butter, and honey in a medium saucepan over medium heat; stir. Mix in apples. Cook until softened, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cut pie crust into 12 rounds to fit the cups of a cupcake pan and press into cups to make crusts.
Fill crusts 3/4 full with cooked apple mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust edges are golden brown and not doughy, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool before serving.
