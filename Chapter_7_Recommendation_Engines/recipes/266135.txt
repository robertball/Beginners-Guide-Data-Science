Ingredients:
1 pound small broccoli florets
2 tablespoons olive oil
sea salt to taste
fresh ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine broccoli florets and olive oil in a bowl and toss to lightly coat. Season with salt and pepper.
Lay a large sheet of aluminum foil on a flat work surface. Transfer broccoli to the center of the sheet and fold edges in to create a sealed packet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Remove packet from oven and open aluminum foil to expose broccoli. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Return packet to the oven and continue baking until floret tips start to blacken and stalks are greenish-brown, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
A simple and quick way to cook broccoli that even picky eaters love. Best part: I don't even use dishes to prepare it (all mixing and cooking happens in the foil).

 Drizzle with olive oil and additional Parmesan cheese before serving.
