Ingredients:
1/3 cup Heinz 57 Sauce, Lightly Flavoured
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon Heinz Worcestershire Sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
4 skinless, boneless salmon fillets
1 Granny Smith apple, thinly sliced
1/2 cup very thinly sliced red onion
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 kaiser rolls
Lettuce leaves

Directions:
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Line the grate with perforated non-stick foil. Combine 57 sauce with butter, Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Brush half this mixture over salmon.
Grill the salmon, basting with remaining sauce, for 4 to 5 minutes per side. Toss the apples, onion and dill with the lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper. Slice rolls in half and toast lightly on the grill.
Place a leaf of lettuce on each halved roll, top with a piece of salmon and equal amounts of slaw.
