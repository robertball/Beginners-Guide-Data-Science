While meat is cooking, throw your soup together and then turn it on low, or simmer. Once meat is done, add to soup.  Cook on low two hours. 20 minutes before ready, start dumplings. Mix ingredients together, then put spoonfuls into soup. We love dumplings so I make a big batch. Cook on Med/High for 15 minutes, ladle into bowls and serve! Hope you enjoy!
