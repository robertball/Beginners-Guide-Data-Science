Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large lime, zested and juiced
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup fresh basil, thinly sliced
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
Whisk whole wheat flour, 1 cup all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract, lime zest, and lime juice. Stir in Greek yogurt. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Add in remaining flour mixture, stirring just until combined; do not to overmix. Fold in basil.
Place blueberries in a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour. Toss to coat. Gently fold into the muffin batter.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove muffins from the oven and let cool in the pan 1 to 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes more.

Don't be fooled by this combination of flavors--it might seem strange at first, but once you taste it, you'll know they were meant for each other!
