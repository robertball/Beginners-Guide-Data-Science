Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 pound ground pork
2 red bell peppers, cut into strips
2 cups chicken broth

3/4 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce
4 ounces snow peas, trimmed and halved

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add pork and cook until browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
Add peppers to the saucepan with the pork. Cook until starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth, rice, soy sauce, and chile-garlic sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat. Stir in snow peas, scallions, cilantro, and lime juice. Let stand 5 minutes.
