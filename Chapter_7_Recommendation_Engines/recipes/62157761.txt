Ingredients:
1 box chocolate cake mix
1 vanilla ice cream box (half gallon)
1 16oz. bottle hot fudge topping
1 7oz. bottle shell topping

Directions:
Make the box mix as directed and make 24 cupcakes.
Let them cool slightly.
Using a small knife, cut a well in the top. But make sure not to go all the way down. Than scoop it out.
Warm up the hot fudge, so that it is a bit runny. Scoop about 2 Tbls. into each cake.
Place in freezer for an hour or longer.
When you are ready to serve it, warm up the cake, about 30-45 sec. per cake, top with a scoop of ice cream and drizzle on the shell topping. It will take about 5-10 sec. for the shell topping to harden. Serve.
