Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup corn flakes cereal, coarsely crushed
1 onion, finely chopped
2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/8 tablespoons white sugar
3/8 cup shortening
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.
Beat the egg in a bowl until smooth. Add the ground beef, cayenne pepper, crushed cereal, onion, salt, black pepper, and parsley. Mix until evenly combined; set aside. Stir together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a separate bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until no lumps of shortening remain and the mixture takes on a sandy appearance. Stir in the milk until a dough forms.
Roll the dough out to a 10x15-inch rectangle on a well-floured surface. Spread the meat mixture evenly over the entire surface of the dough. Roll the dough into a cylinder from one of the wide ends to form a 15-inch long log. Cut the log into 3/4-inch slices and place on to the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until dark golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Serve hot.
