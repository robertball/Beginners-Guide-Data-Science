Ingredients:
1 box French Vanilla cake mix (with pudding added)
1/3 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
3 large eggs
1/2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sour cream (plain yogurt may be substituted)
3 ripened bananas, mashed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (I set mine to 325 because it runs a little hot).  In large bowl, mix together cake mix, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  (If your cake mix doesn't have pudding added in it, just mix in a box of Jello Instant Pudding, french vanilla flavor.)  In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs, buttermilk, vegetable oil, sour cream, and bananas.  Once the liquid mixture is well-mixed, add to the dry ingredients and beat (with hand mixer) on low setting for about a mimute and then on medium-high for about 3 minutes, or until everything is blended in.  Pour batter into lined muffin pans and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until cupcakes are fully peaked and lightly browned on top.  Different ovens may need different temperature and time adjustments.

Description: 
I LOVE banana bread and have been trying to come up with a recipe for a cake that would taste like a super moist and rich banana bread.  After adding random ingredients, including mashed bananas, to a box of cake mix, I came up with something pretty tastey.  This is a very rich and sweet cake, so a small piece is all you need to enjoy!  I like making cupcakes and topping them with the Caramel Frosting I recipe from this site.
