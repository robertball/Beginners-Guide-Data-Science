Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for deep-frying
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoons baking powder
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup milk
1 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3/4 cup apples - peeled, cored and finely chopped
1/2 cup cinnamon sugar

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer or electric skillet to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Pour in the milk, eggs, vanilla, and oil and stir until well blended. Mix in apples until they are evenly distributed.
Drop spoonfuls (flattened) of the batter into the hot oil and fry until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes depending on the size. Fry in smaller batches so they are not crowded. Remove from the hot oil using a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels. Toss with cinnamon sugar while still warm.
