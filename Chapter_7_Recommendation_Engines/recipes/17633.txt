Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) can baked beans
1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 minutes, or until browned. Stir in the onion and green bell pepper and saute for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Next, add the beans, mushrooms, brown sugar and chili powder to taste. Mix together well, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes to 1 hour or more, depending on how much time you have and how thick you like your chili.

Description: 
This is a hand-me-down from my Grandma. I like it because it doesn't have kidney beans and it has a bit of a sweet taste. It's a brown chili not a red one - no tomatoes.
