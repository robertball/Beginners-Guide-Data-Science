Ingredients:
4 large cucumbers - peeled, seeded, and cubed, divided
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion, divided
1/2 cup finely chopped celery, divided
1/2 cup grated carrots, divided
4 medium jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1/4 cup Greek yogurt
1/4 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste

Directions:
Set 1/4 cup of cubed cucumber aside.
Place remaining cucumbers, 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup celery, 1/4 cup carrots, jalapeno peppers, Greek yogurt, sour cream, sugar, garlic powder, dill, salt, and pepper into the bowl of an 8-cup electric blender or food processor and pulse until all ingredients are just blended.
Pour into a large bowl and stir in reserved 1/4 cup cucumber and remaining onion, celery, and carrots to add a little crunch to an otherwise creamy mixture. Taste for salt and pepper, adding more if desired.
Place into the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
Another way to use up all those cucumbers that spring off the vine in summer. This is a spicy dill cucumber soup chilled to take down the heat a notch in summer. This soup is great made a day ahead and keeps for 3 days. Serve with some thin wheat crackers.
