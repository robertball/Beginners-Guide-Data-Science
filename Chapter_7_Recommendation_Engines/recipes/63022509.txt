Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/4 tsp. salt
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 cup Nutella, plus more for frosting
1 stick (4oz.) butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 large egg
whole hazelnuts, for garnishing

Directions:
Beat Nutella and butter with electric mixer until smooth and combined.
Beat in brown sugar, then egg and vanilla.
Beat in cocoa, baking soda, salt, and flour, until dough forms.
Divide dough in half. Transfer dough halves to 2 large sheets of wax paper. Shape dough into 2 in diameter logs.
Wrap dough logs tightly with plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350F. Slice dough log into 1/4 in thick slices, rolling log between slices to keep edges round.
Transfer slices to greased baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cookies are firm and dry.
When cookies are cool, frost each with about 1/2 tsp of Nutella in the center and garnish with one whole hazelnut.
Enjoy!
