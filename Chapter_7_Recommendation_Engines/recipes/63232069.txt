Ingredients:
5 oz whole grain rotini pasta
2 teaspoons olive oil (to toss with pasta)
1 large chicken breast, cooked, and cut into bite size pieces
4 chopped green onions
3 oz smoked gouda cheese cut into 1/4 inch cubes

1 tablespoon oregano
1 teaspoon Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning
1/2 cup of cherry tomatoes sliced in half

Directions:
Cook pasta per the instructions on the box until al dente.  Immediately run pasta under cold water to halt the cooking process.  Toss pasta with olive oil and place in a medium bowl.
Chop cooked chicken breast into bite size pieces and place in bowl with the pasta.  Add green onions and smoked gouda cheese and stir contents.
Add balsamic vinaigrette dressing, oregano, and Mrs. Dash seasoning and mix all ingredients thoroughly.
Add cherry tomatoes and stir gently.
Cover bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to let flavors blend together.

Description: 
The combination of smoked gouda cheese, chicken, cherry tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar dressing blend themselves together to provide a fireworks of flavor in every bite.  This is a recipe I made from scratch when looking for something new for a spring picnic at a local winery event.  My friends loved it!
