Description: 
This is a fast vegan smoothie with a deep pink color and a rich, creamy texture.  VERY filling, and perfect for people in a rush in the morning. You don't have to give up a good breakfast when it's this fast to make! I use vitamin fortified soy milk.Modified from: Strawberry Oatmeal Breakfast Smoothie
