Ingredients:
Topping:
2 tablespoons butter, slightly softened
1/4 cup rolled oats
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Muffins:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white whole-wheat flour
1/2 cup oat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups diced peaches
1 cup grated carrots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper liners.
Combine butter, rolled oats, dark brown sugar, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl. Mix with a fork or fingers until crumbly.
Whisk 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, white whole-wheat flour, oat flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Whisk oil, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour into flour mixture; fold until batter is just combined. Fold peaches and carrots in gently.
Spoon batter into prepared muffin pan, about 2/3 full. Sprinkle with oat topping.
Bake in the preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes; transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool completely.
