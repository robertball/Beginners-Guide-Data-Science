Ingredients:
2 Eggs
2/3 cup Milk
2 teaspoons Salt
1/4 teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
3/4 cup Oatmeal (ground)
1 1/2 pounds Ground Beef
1 Onion (chopped)
1 cup Cheddar Cheese (shredded)
1/2 cup Carrot (shredded)
1/4 cup Brown Sugar
1/4 cup Ketchup
1 tablespoon Prepared Yellow Mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and ground black pepper in a large bowl. Add ground oatmeal and stir until dissolved. Mix ground beef, onion, Cheddar cheese, and carrot into bread mixture; transfer mixture to a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Combine brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a small bowl; spread over meat mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
