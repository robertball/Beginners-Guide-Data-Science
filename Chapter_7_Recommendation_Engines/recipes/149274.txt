Ingredients:
1/4 cup softened butter
1 1/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 cups all-purpose flour
9 ounces hazelnuts, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then stir in the orange juice, lemon zest, and cinnamon.  Fold in the flour and hazelnuts, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Form into 1/2 inch by 3 inch sticks, and place onto a baking sheet 1 inch apart.
Bake in preheated oven until brown around the edges, about 15 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
