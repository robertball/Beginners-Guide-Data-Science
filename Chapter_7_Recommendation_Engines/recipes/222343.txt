Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages cheese tortellini
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
3 roma tomatoes, diced
1 (6 ounce) can black olives
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 bunch green onions, sliced
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon dried basil
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook tortellini in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until pasta floats to the surface, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Mix tortellini, feta cheese, tomatoes, olives, walnuts, green onions, and garlic together in a large bowl.
Whisk vinegar, olive oil, and basil together in a separate small bowl. Pour dressing over tortellini mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with salt. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour before serving.
