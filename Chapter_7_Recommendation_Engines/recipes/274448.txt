Ingredients:
3/4 cup golden syrup
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 apples, peeled, or more to taste
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter 1 large loaf pan or 2 smaller ones.
Warm up syrup, water, butter, and sugar in a pan over low heat until butter and sugar are just melted. Remove from heat and mix well.
Grate apples directly into the pan. Sift flour, baking soda, ginger, and allspice into the batter. Stir until just combined; do not overmix. Pour batter into the prepared pan(s).
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
