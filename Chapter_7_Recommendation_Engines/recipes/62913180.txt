Uncover pot, reduce heat to med-hi & maintain moderate boil for 20min, until beans are tender & most of liquid has evaporated. Stir frequently. If liquid evaporates too quickly, add additional water, 1/2 cup at a time, until full 20min has elapsed. Maintain water level just below bean's surface so beans don't burn.
