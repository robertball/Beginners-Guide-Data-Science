Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground ancho chile pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon mango chutney
1/2 cup chopped green onion
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup dry bread crumbs
2 cups low sodium buttery round crackers, crushed
1 egg, beaten
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 dash lemon juice
Old Bay Seasoning TM to taste
1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat, drained
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together 1/4 cup mayonnaise and yogurt. Season with curry powder, chile pepper, and garlic powder. Stir in the mango chutney. Cover and chill at least 30 minutes.
In a separate bowl, toss together the green onion, jalapeno, garlic, bread crumbs, and 1/2 the crackers. Mix in the egg, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, and Old Bay seasoning. Fold in the crabmeat. Form the mixture into 6 cakes and evenly coat with the remaining bread crumbs.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each cake about 5 minutes on each side, until heated through and golden brown. Serve with the chilled sauce mixture.

Description: 
Crab cakes are a traditional East Coast flavor; this recipe, however, gives them a Middle Eastern spin!!! They are moist and flavorful alone, but add the sauce, and WOW!
