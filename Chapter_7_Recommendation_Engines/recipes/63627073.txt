Ingredients:
4 dressed whole rainbow trout
Cooking Spray
2 1/2 tsp olive oil, divided
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp kosher salt, divided
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 cups sugar snap peas, trimmed and halved diagonally
1/2 cup vertically sliced shallots
1/4 cup pine nuts
2 tsp chopped fresh dill

Directions:
1.  Preheat broiler to high.
2.  Arrange trout, open with flesh sides up, on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray.  Brush the flesh evenly with 1 1/2 tsp oil.  Drizzle juice over the flesh.  Sprinkle flesh with cumin, 1/4 tsp salt, and pepper.  Broil 5 min or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
3.  While fish cooks, heat a medium skillet over high heat until very hot.  Combine peas, shallots, and pine nuts in a small bowl; add remaining 1 tsp oil to bowl, tossing to coat.  Add pea mixture to pan; cook 3 minutes or until peas are bright green and blackened in spots and nuts are lighlty toasted, stirring frequently.  Stir in remaining 1/4 tsp salt and dill.
