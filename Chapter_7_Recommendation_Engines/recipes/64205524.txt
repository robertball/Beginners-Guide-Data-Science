1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut butter into mixture of flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add blueberries and toss to mix.
In separate bowl beat together cream and egg, and slowly pour into dry ingredients, stirring with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead just until it comes together, 3 or 4 times. Don't overhandle.
Divide dough in half. On lightly floured board, shape each half into a 6-inch round. Cut into 6 wedges.
Bake on ungreased sheet about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Serve warm!!
