Combine lemon juice, filtered water, ginger, and honey in a blender; blend for 20 to 30 seconds.

Description: 
This lightly sweetened detox water not only quenches your thirst, it's also loaded with ginger's many health benefits. Adjust the honey and ginger to your tastes. I like to sip this throughout the day, especially during cold and flu season. I sometimes like to add turmeric or a couple pinches of cayenne pepper to the mix.
