Ingredients:
Chopped Leftover Turkey (I had 1 1/2 Cups)
Leftover Green Bean Casserole (1-2 cups)
Leftover Corn (I used corn pudding) (1 cup)
Leftover Turkey Gravy (2 cups)
Leftover Mashed Potatoes (3 cups)
1/2 cup milk
Any other left over veggies you want to add
3/4 Cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Grease a 9x13 baking dish and preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Chop the Turkey. In a large sauce pan, combine chopped turkey, leftover green bean casserole (I had half of a 9x13 pan), corn pudding, Any other leftover veggies, & Turkey gravy and bring to a simmer.
In a large bowl, mix the milk in with the mashed potatoes and microwave until heated through. Pour the veggie-gravy mixture into the 9x13 pan. Mix the cheese into the mashed potatoes and spread them over the top veggie-gravy mixture.  I had to dollop and spread so they didn't sink down. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
