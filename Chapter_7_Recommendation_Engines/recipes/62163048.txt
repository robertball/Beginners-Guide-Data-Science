Description: 
I created this tangy sauce to go with ham for a summer supper.  You could also thin it with more water and puree it to use as a glaze.  You can add more sugar for a sweeter sauce, but we all liked the tanginess.  My four year old couldn't get enough.

Use slightly firm peaches, which will keep their shape better than really ripe ones.
