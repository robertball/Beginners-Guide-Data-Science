Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 tsp minced garlic
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed
8 ounces turkey kielbasa, sliced
1 tbsp chili powder
4 ounces chicken broth
19 ounces canned crushed tomatoes
1 bay leaf
1/3 tsp dried basil
1 green onion, chopped
1/3 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp tabasco sauce
1 1/2 cups uncooked rice

Directions:
Put rice on to cook.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Saute bell pepper and garlic for 2 minutes.   Add chicken and cook until browned on all sides.  Add sausage and chili powder and cook until sausage is browned.   Add broth and, using a wire whisk, scrape up all of the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, basil, green onion, black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes.  Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove bay leaf and discard.  Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
Serve over cooked rice.
