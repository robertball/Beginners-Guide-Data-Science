Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 cinnamon sticks
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pod cardamom
3 whole cloves
3 cups water
1 cup peeled, diced potato
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup cauliflower florets
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup fresh or frozen peas
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, sliced into rings
2 tablespoons cashew pieces
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in quinoa and allow to toast briefly. Stir in the garlic, ginger, cinnamon sticks, turmeric, cardamom, and cloves. Cook and stir until the spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in the water. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil; add potatoes, carrots, and cauliflower. Recover, then reduce heat to low and cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir in the broccoli and green beans, then replace cover and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Stir in the green peas, and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon sticks and cloves.
Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion is golden, about 8 minutes. Mix in the cashew pieces, stirring constantly until lightly toasted. Transfer quinoa and vegetables to a large platter or bowl. Top with the onion/cashew mixture and chopped cilantro.
