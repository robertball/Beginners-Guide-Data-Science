Ingredients:
1 rack of ribs (~14 ribs)
1 bottle bone suckin sauce or favorite bbq sauce (thin is better than thick)
8 cups beef bouillon (cubes, powder, broth, or butter is fine)
1/2 tbsp salt
1/2 tbsp pepper
cooking spray

Directions:
Cut ribs into 3-4 bone sections. Remove membrane found on the bottom of rib racks. This membrane isn't fat, it makes the ribs chewy.
Rub salt and pepper on both sides of ribs.
Boil 8 cups of beef bouillon. Add ribs to pot. Let sit for 1.5 hours in boiling bouillon.
Preheat broiler.
Cover an oven save pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray.
Remove ribs from pot and place on foiled pan. Cover one side of ribs with bbq sauce, broil for 10 minutes.
Flip ribs over, cover other side with bbq sauce, broil for 10 more minutes.

Description: 
My boyfriend grew up eating ribs cooked this way. The meat just falls off the bone and the bone suckin sauce (NC original) makes these ribs freakin awesome.
