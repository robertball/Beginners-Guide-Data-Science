Ingredients:
Cut up chicken parts
Flour (all purpose)
Pepper
Garlic Salt (or powder)
Seasoned Salt
Onion Powder
Mrs. Dash (regular seasoning)
Paprika
Chicken Broth
Vegetable Oil (or bacon grease)

Directions:
After cleaning/rinsing chicken, season with dry seasonings (both sides).  Using a gallon-size zip-lock bag, place chicken in bag and pour enough chicken broth in with the chicken to almost cover.  Carefully close bag, trying to push as much air out as possible (this will ensure that every piece will be covered).  Place in refrigerator overnight.  Take chicken out of bag and place in a clean sink or on a platter.  Dab excess liquid with a paper towel.  Dip each piece in buttermilk, drain and place piece in flour, coating each side.  Shake off excess and place on a cookie sheet and let SIT for about 15-20 minutes.  Heat oil/bacon fat (I like to use two parts oil and one part bacon fat).  Be sure that oil is hot (I like medium/high heat).  Place skin-side down in skillet.  Turn after about 5-7 minutes on each side (for medium-sized pieces).  You're looking for a nice golden brown color.  If your oil is hot enough, it will cook thoroughly without having to place in the oven to complete cooking, trust me.
