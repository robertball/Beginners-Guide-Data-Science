Ingredients:
2 ½ teaspoons vegetable oil
6 (6 inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1/2 inch strips
3 cups chicken broth
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon chili powder
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
½ cup salsa
½ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add half of the tortilla strips, stirring often, until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil and remaining tortilla strips and set aside.
Add the broth, cumin, chili powder and oregano to the pot. Raise heat to high and bring to a boil. Add the beans, corn, chicken and salsa. Reduce heat to low, stir and simmer for about 2 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside.
Add the cilantro and half of the reserved tortilla strips. Ladle into individual bowls and garnish each bowl with some of the remaining strips.
