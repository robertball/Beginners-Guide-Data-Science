Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups cornmeal
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups whole milk
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 15x10x2-inch baking pan.
Whisk flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl; stir in milk, vegetable oil, and eggs until batter is evenly combined. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 33 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this during my previous life as a firefighter after finding myself having to repeat my more popular recipes over and over. 

This one is easy to communicate and even easier to remember, since all of the measurements are in multiples of 3, which explains some of the more arcane measurements! 

A triple recipe, of course. I use this recipe both to serve with soup or chili, as well as the foundation for Nana's cornbread turkey stuffing. Enjoy!
