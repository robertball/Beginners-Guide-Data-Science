Ingredients:
* Tomatoes - 3 pounds (1300 g)
* Onions - 4 medium
* Garlic - 3 cloves
* Peanut (groundnut) (or mustard) oil - 3 Tablespoons
* Turmeric - 1 teaspoon
* Ground coriander (cilantro) seeds - 1 teaspoon

* Burmese/Thai Fish Sauce (Ngan byar yay in Myanmar, the modern name for Burma, or Nam Pla in Thai) - 1 Tablespoon

Directions:
Peel and de-seed the tomatoes, then chop into bits around finger nail size.
Peel and slice the onions very thinly.
Peel and chop the garlic very finely.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the onions and garlic. Saut√© until golden. (Note Garlic can get bitter if overcooked, so some chefs add the garlic a bit later so that both are finished at the same time).
Add in the tomatoes and stir to mix well.
Add the turmeric. Stir.
Add the ground coriander. Stir.
Add the chillies. Stir.
Add the fish sauce. Stir.
Turn the heat down low and cook gently for 30 minutes or so.
Serve alone with rice or noodles, or serve as an accompaniment to other curries.

Description: 
A simple dish, surprisingly hot.
Peeled tomatoes are required, which is easily accomplished by cutting a small cross in the base of the tomato and/or a score round the waist of it, then covering the tomato with boiling water (not just boiled, but boilING) for one minute. Remove from the water and the skin will simply slide off. (Really fresh tomatoes need a bit more work!)
