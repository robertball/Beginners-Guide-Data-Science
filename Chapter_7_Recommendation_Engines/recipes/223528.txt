Ingredients:
2 (12 ounce) packages spaghetti
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 cucumber, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 (16 ounce) bottle fat-free Italian salad dressing
1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian salad dressing mix (such as Good SeasonsÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse in cold water.
Place spaghetti into a large salad bowl and toss with red onion, red bell pepper, cucumber, tomato, Italian salad dressing, salad dressing mix, and salt. Chill before serving; salad is better the longer it chills.

Description: 
I had this at a family reunion. Several years later I was wanting this and played around until I came up with this recipe. I am always asked to bring it to potlucks at work.
