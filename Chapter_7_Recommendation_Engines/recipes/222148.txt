Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
4  boneless chicken breasts, skin on
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
¾ cup Heinz Tomato Ketchup
⅓ cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons grainy Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
Lemon wedges
Chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Cook the bacon until just opaque. Blot on paper towels. Sprinkle chicken evenly with salt and pepper. Wrap each chicken breast in bacon, securing strips in place with toothpicks. Set aside. Preheat the grill to medium-high.
Blend ketchup with maple syrup, mustard, lemon juice and garlic. Brush half the sauce all over chicken. Place chicken on grill and turn heat down to medium. Grill, turning and basting twice with remaining sauce until bacon is almost crisp, about 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
Squeeze lemon wedges over chicken and sprinkle with chives. Remove toothpicks before serving.

An ever-popular combination of bacon and chicken tastes even better with a homemade sweet and tangy glaze featuring Heinz Ketchup, real maple syrup and mustard. Serve with baked potatoes and grilled veggies for an easy weeknight dinner.
