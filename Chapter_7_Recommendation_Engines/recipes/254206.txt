Ingredients:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons sun-dried tomato pesto
3 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
1/4 cup sliced pepperoncini peppers, drained
1/4 cup julienne-cut fresh basil
15 slices salami

Directions:
Combine the cream cheese and sun-dried tomato pesto in a mini food processor or bowl until well blended. Reserve some of the mixture to seal the pinwheels.
Spread cream cheese mixture over each tortilla all the way to the edges. Sprinkle the tortillas evenly with the pepperoncinis and basil leaving a 1 1/2-inch edge on one side.
Place 5 slices of salami over each tortilla leaving a 1 1/2-inch edge on one side.
Starting with the salami end, roll each tortilla as tightly as you can. When you get to the end, smear some of the leftover cream cheese over the end and seal the sandwich. Wrap each sandwich in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
When chilled, unwrap and slice rolls into 8 pieces per sandwich. Serve with an ice cold glass of milk!
