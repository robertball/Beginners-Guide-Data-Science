Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups bread flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water

Directions:
Combine bread flour, all-purpose flour, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in water slowly until dough comes together into a rough ball.
Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate, at least 3 hours or overnight.
Remove dough from the refrigerator and cut in half. Dust the dough, rolling pin, and your work surface with bread flour. Roll one piece of dough into a rectangle about 1/16-inch thick. Fold rectangle into thirds like a letter. Cut dough crosswise into thin strips. Repeat with second piece of dough.
