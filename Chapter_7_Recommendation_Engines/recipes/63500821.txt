Ingredients:
2 lbs Ground Turkey
10 oz frozen spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry
1 medium onion diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 c Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs
1/4 c grated Parmesan Cheese
2 eggs
1/4 c milk
2 t Italian Seasoning
1/4 t cayenne pepper
1 1/4 cups Sargento Off the Block Mozzarella Traditional Cut Shredded Cheese
2 T olive oil
2 bell peppers sliced thin
1 onion sliced
2 jars pasta sauce
6 Buns
3/4 Cup Sargento Off the Block Mozzarella Traditional Cut Shredded Cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
In a large mixing bowl combine ground turkey, spinach, onion, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, eggs, milk, Italian Seasoning, cayenne pepper, and garlic. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated evenly.
Mix in Sargento cheese.
Line a baking sheet with tin foil and spray with cooking spray.
Form into 1 1/2 inch balls and place on baking tray.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until meatballs reach 180.
While meatballs are baking, heat olive oil in a large heavy bottomed pot. Stir in bell peppers and onion, cook until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add pasta sauce and heat through.
When meatballs are done cooking add them to the sauce and let simmer 30 minutes.
Split buns and fill with bell peppers, onions, and meatballs. Top with additional Sargento Cheese.
