Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir potatoes and sausage in hot oil until the potatoes are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
My Mom would make this for us all the time. Now I make it for my family! It is so easy and delicious! Very hard to mess up. If you'd rather bake it in the oven, put potatoes, sausage, and green chiles in a 9x13-inch glass dish and proceed with instructions.
