Ingredients:
5 cups uncooked wide egg noodles (8 oz)
1 can (18 oz) cream of mushroom soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese (8 oz)
1 can (12 oz) solid white tuna in water, drained
1 box (9 oz) frozen chopped spinach, thawed, squeezed to drain
1/2 cup milk
2 tsp grated lemon peel
1 can (8 oz) refrigerated crescent dinner rolls (8 rolls)

Directions:
Heat oven to 375Â°F. Spray 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass baking dish with cooking spray. Cook and drain noodles as directed on package, using minimum time.
In 12-inch skillet, heat soup and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese over medium heat until cheese is melted. Stir in cooked noodles, tuna, spinach, milk and lemon peel; heat until bubbly. Spoon mixture into casserole.
Unroll dough; firmly press perforations to seal. Sprinkle dough with remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Starting at short side, roll up dough; pinch seam to seal. Using serrated knife, cut roll into 8 slices. Place slices, cut side up, on top of tuna mixture.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until filling is bubbly and dough is deep golden brown.
