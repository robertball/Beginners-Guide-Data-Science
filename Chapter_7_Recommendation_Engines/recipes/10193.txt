Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup chopped almonds
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
Cream the butter and sugar together.  Add the yolk, cream and vanilla.  Beat well.  Add the nuts, flour and baking powder.
Chill the dough for about 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Mold dough into little round balls.  Place on ungreased cookie sheets and bake for 12 minutes.
As you take the balls off of the cookies sheet, drop them into a bowl of confectioner's sugar.  Roll them around until they are completely covered.  Remove and cool on a rack.
