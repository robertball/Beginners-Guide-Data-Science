Ingredients:
1 egg
2/3 cup milk
1/3 cup canola oil
1 1/2 cups tapioca flour
3/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F and grease a mini-muffin tin.
Put all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor and pulse until well combined and smooth. You can use a spatula in between pulses to scrape down any bits that stick to the sides of the blender so that everything gets blended well. (At this point you can store the mixture in the fridge for up to a week.)
Spoon mixture into muffin tin, filling almost to the top of each cup.
Bake in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or till puffy and lightly browned.
Remove from oven and let cool on a rack for a few minutes.

Description: 
This is a super easy recipe and the puffs just happen to also be gluten free. Brazilian cheese puffs are nice and chewy, a lot like Japanese mochi.

Best to eat while warm but you can save and reheat later.
