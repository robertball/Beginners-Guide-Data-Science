Ingredients:
2-3 cans of chickpeas
Dried spices
Cookie sheet
Vinegar
Foil
Nonstick spray
Olive oil

Directions:
Take 2-4 cups of vinegar in a pot, put the lid on, and bring to a boil. Strain, drain, rinse and 2-3 cans of chickpeas, shake them dry in a strainer. Add the beans to the boiling vinegar, turn off the heat, add the lid and let them sit for 40 minutes.
Time to prep your cookie sheet. Line a cookie sheet with foil and spray it with a non-stick spray. I also drizzle about 2 tablespoons of olive oil on to the sheet.
Mix up your spices. I recommend chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne powder, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, a little rosemary and more. Whisk/mix the dry seasonings together with a fork.
Drain the beans from the vinegar. You can re-use the vinegar again if you save it. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Place the beans onto the cookie sheet, spread around, drizzle with about 2 more tablespoons of olive oil, sprinkle the seasonings on top and rub them around on the cookie sheet until the seasonings are evenly distributed.
Bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour. Be sure to take them out of the oven every 15 minutes, lightly stir them around and shake the cookie sheet so they will not stick and to ensure they cook evenly. They should turn a golden brown color.
