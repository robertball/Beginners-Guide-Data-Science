Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup melted butter
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
3 tablespoons peanut butter
2 eggs
1 cup dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup butterscotch chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sift together the flour, salt, cinnamon, and baking soda in small
bowl. Set aside.
Melt butter in microwave. When approximately half-done (about 20 seconds), add the brown sugar to the butter and microwave until butter is completely melted. Stir two ingredients together and add to large mixing bowl. Beat in sugar,
vanilla, almond, and peanut butter. Refrigerate mixture for 15 minutes.
Add eggs one at a time, beating thoroughly. Add all chips and stir
until evenly distributed. Gradually beat in flour mixture.
Place heaping tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until tops are golden brown. Let sit for 3
minutes before placing on tinfoil or wire racks for cooling. For best
results, chill dough in refrigerator and soak baking sheets in cold tap
water between batches.
