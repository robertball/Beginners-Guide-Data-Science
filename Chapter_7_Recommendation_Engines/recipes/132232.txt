Ingredients:
8 ounces uncooked orzo pasta
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 (8 ounce) cans pineapple chunks, drained with juice reserved
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin orange segments, drained
1 cup shredded coconut (optional)
4 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain, transfer to a large bowl, and cool.
Whisk the sugar, eggs, flour, salt, and reserved pineapple juice together in a saucepan until smooth. Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Pour over cooled pasta, and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours.
Stir the pineapple chunks and mandarin oranges into the pasta mixture. Mix in the coconut if desired. Stir in the frozen whipped topping until evenly blended. Chill until serving.

Description: 
My Mom would make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it has been a family favorite for three generations. The dressing is gently cooked, and the salad so light you can serve it anytime.
