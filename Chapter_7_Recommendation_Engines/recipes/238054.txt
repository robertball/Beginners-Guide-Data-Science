Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
8 cups tomato sauce
1/4 cup dry red wine, or more to taste
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
1 bay leaf, or more to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes
8 eggs

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir tomato sauce, red wine, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes with the onion and garlic; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 45 minutes.
Crack eggs into a bowl one at a time and gently slide them into the tomato sauce; cook until beginning to firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over the eggs to cover. Place a lid on the skillet and simmer until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.
