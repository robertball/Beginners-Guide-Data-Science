Ingredients:
1/2 pound okra, finely chopped
1 green chile pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 tablespoon shortening
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
3 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour, or as needed
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Mix okra, green chile pepper, cilantro, shortening, salt, and ginger together in a bowl. Knead rice flour and chickpea flour into the okra mixture to get a stiff dough.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wet one hand and use to hold the dough ball. Break small marble-size bits from the dough ball and drop into the hot oil, taking care to not overcrowd the pan; fry until golden brown and crisp. 7 to 10 minutes. Remove fritters to a plate lined with paper towel to drain. Repeat cooking until dough is completely used, refilling and reheating oil as needed.
