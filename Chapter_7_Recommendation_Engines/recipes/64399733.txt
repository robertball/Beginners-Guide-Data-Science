Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
10 ounces marshmallows
6 cups Cocoa Krispies or chocolate krispy cereal

Directions:
Melt three tablespoons of butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
Add ten ounces of marshmallows to the melted butter and stir them until they're melted also.
Remove the pan from heat and stir in six cups of chocolate krispy cereal.
Spread the butter/marshmallow/cereal mixture between two pieces of wax paper, flattened into a sheet with a rolling pin.
Form the mixture into 3 cone shapes and let set for at least one hour before topping with ice cream to enjoy!
