Ingredients:
3 cups milk
3 cups water
1 cup dry polenta
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1 tablespoon white sugar (optional)
6 tablespoons blackberry jam

Directions:
In a medium pan over high heat, bring to boil milk and water. Reduce heat to simmer liquid. Stirring constantly, pour in polenta in a thin, steady stream, breaking up any lumps that form. Stir in 2 tablespoons sugar and salt. Simmer, stirring often, until polenta is soft and creamy, about 30 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix sour cream and 1 tablespoon sugar.
Ladle polenta into bowls, and top with about 1 tablespoon of jam and a dollop of sweetened sour cream.

Description: 
This was my first attempt at polenta. I like it, but it is my mother Sandie who truly loves it. We always eat it with homemade blackberry jam on the weekends. You can substitute your favorite jam. Top with sweetened sour cream or creme fraiche.
