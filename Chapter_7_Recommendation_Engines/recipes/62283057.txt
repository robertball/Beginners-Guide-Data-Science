Ingredients:
1 Duncan Heinz yellow cake mix- prepare according to box in (2) 9" rounds, cool and split 2 layers into 4 even layers.
1 C. white granulated sugar
12 oz. Sour cream
12-16 oz. Coconut sweetened flakes
9 oz. Cool whip, thawed

Directions:
While cake is baking, combine sugar, 1/2 of Coconut, and sour cream.  Chill this mixture for 1 hour.  After mixture is chilled fold in cool whip until smooth and blended, but donâ€™t overwork.  After cake is baked and cooled cut the (2) 9" layers into 4 even layers.
Spread mixture between layers, frost top and sides.  Sprinkle remaining coconut on the top and sides.  Seal in an air tight container and refrigerate for three days before serving.  Refrigeration is a must!  The three days of curing makes the cake super moist and yummy sweet.  I hope you enjoy!

Description: 
This is the best coconut cake I've ever had!  The three days of curing makes the cake super moist and yummy sweet.  I hope you enjoy! I trimmed a tree for an older lady so she made me this cake as a thank-you!  At the time I worked for a small landscape company.  The landscape crew loved this cake.  I've made it ever since the recipe was shared with me!
