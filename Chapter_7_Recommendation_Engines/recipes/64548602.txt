Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or coconut oil
1 cup white granulated sugar
2 eggs
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup white flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
2 very ripe bananas, thinly sliced
2 Tbsp Demerara or brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Line a regular sized loaf pan with parchment paper or grease thoroughly
In a medium sized pot over medium heat, melt the butter or coconut oil.
Remove from heat once melted and add sugar, eggs, salt, sour cream or yogurt, and vanilla and stir together until smooth.
Sift or whisk together the flours and baking soda, making sure there are no lumps or any of the ingredients.
Fold GENTLY!! Into the wet ingredients until barely mixed. Some floury spots are perfectly acceptable, and will make your bread better.
Fold in the sliced bananas also very gently and pour into your prepared baking pan. Bake 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Be sure to poke a couple places because if you hit a banana it may come out gooey.
Cool to room temperature before removing from pan. Bon appetit!
