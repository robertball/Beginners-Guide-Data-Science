Ingredients:
12 1/2 cups chopped green tomatoes
2 onions, chopped
4 jalapeno peppers, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rings
4 serrano peppers, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rings
1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup raw sugar
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
6 limes, juiced, divided
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Combine green tomatoes, onions, jalapeno peppers, serrano peppers, and red bell pepper in a large bowl.
Mix cilantro, sugar, garlic, oregano, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
Fill a blender with about 2 cups tomato mixture, 1 teaspoon lime juice, and 1/4 of the spice mixture; blend to desired consistency and pour into a large bowl. Repeat blending with remaining tomato mixture, lime juice, and spice mixture, working in batches, until all ingredients are blended. Stir vinegar into salsa.

Description: 
A tasty twist to salsa; great served over cream cheese with tortilla chips or crackers! A great way to save those green tomatoes when there is an early frost. 
I created this recipe with the assistance of my daughter-in-law Carolyn and her niece Felicia. Thanks you two. Portion out remaining salsa into bags; freeze or refrigerate.
