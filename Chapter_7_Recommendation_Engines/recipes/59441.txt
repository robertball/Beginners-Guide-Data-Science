Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 large onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pound linguica sausage, sliced

4 small zucchini, sliced
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1/2 cup red wine
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crisp and evenly brown. Drain, reserving juices, and break into bite-size pieces. Place the pieces in a slow cooker. Cook the onion and garlic in the reserved bacon juices over medium heat until tender. Drain, and place in the slow cooker. Quickly brown the linguica sausage in the skillet over medium-high heat, and place in the slow cooker.
Add the potatoes, zucchini, tomato sauce, and red wine to the slow cooker, and season with parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir to evenly distribute ingredients. Cover, and cook 2 1/2 hours on High, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender.

Description: 
This hearty slow cooker dish concocted by my grandmother consists of linguica, potatoes, zucchini, onions, and bacon. You can add other vegetables like mushrooms and green beans, but I prefer the original recipe.
