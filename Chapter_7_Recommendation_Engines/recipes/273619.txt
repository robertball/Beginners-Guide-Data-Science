Ingredients:
Bread Pudding:
2 cups milk
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 eggs
4 bananas, cut into small chunks
10 croissants, cut into 1-inch pieces
Rum Sauce:
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup rum (such as Captain MorganÂ®)
2 tablespoons heavy cream, or more to taste

Directions:
Whisk milk, sugar, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl. Add bananas. Add croissants and mix well.
Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Refrigerate for 1 hour so croissants can absorb some of the liquid.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until center is set and top is golden brown, about 1 hour. Let cool for 30 minutes before slicing.
Meanwhile, combine brown sugar, butter, and rum in a saucepan. Cook and stir until melted together, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream. Pour warm sauce over the bread pudding right before serving.
