Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup chopped dates
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup crisp rice cereal
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups flaked coconut

Directions:
In a saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Stir in the dates, sugar and eggs. Cook and stir over low heat for 10-15 minutes or until thermometer reads 160 degrees F. Remove from the heat; stir in the pecans, cereal and vanilla. When cool enough to handle, shape into 1-in. balls; roll in coconut. Place on waxed paper-lined baking sheets. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours or until firm. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
