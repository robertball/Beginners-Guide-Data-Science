Ingredients:
*  1 pound ground beef
* 1/3 cup ketchup
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 8 ounces frozen mixed vegetables (such as carrots, peas, and corn), thawed
* 1/4 cup (1 ounce) shredded Cheddar (optional)
* 1 16-ounce package refrigerated or frozen and thawed mashed potatoes

Directions:
# Heat oven to 400Â° F.
# Place the beef in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until no trace of pink remains, about 5 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat. Stir in the ketchup and Worcestershire. Add the vegetables and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
# Spoon the beef mixture into a baking dish. Mix the cheese (if using) with the potatoes in a medium bowl. Spread the potatoes over the beef and bake until heated through, 10 minutes. Divide among individual plates.
