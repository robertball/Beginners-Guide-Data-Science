Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
10 asparagus spears, ends trimmed
1/2 (16 ounce) package rotini, elbow, or penne pasta
3 tablespoons low fat mayonnaise
3 tablespoons balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and coarsely chopped
1 cooked chicken breast, cubed
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook until tender, about 1 minute. Strain asparagus out of water and immediately plunge into a bowl filled with ice water; let sit in ice water until completely cold, then cut into 1 inch pieces. Next, add pasta to boiling water and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain, rinse with cold water until chilled, then drain well.
Stir together mayonnaise, balsamic vinaigrette, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce in a large bowl. Fold in artichoke, chicken, cranberries, almonds, crumbled bacon, and asparagus. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then fold in cooked pasta. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
I threw this simple recipe together one night to use up some leftover chicken and asparagus. All quantities are approximate and can be adjusted according to your taste. Can easily be adjusted to include pasta salad favorites such as diced onions or celery (which, if I had had any, probably would have ended up in the bowl too!) A tasty way to use up your leftovers!
