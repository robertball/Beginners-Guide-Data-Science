1 (2 to 3 pound) bone-in chicken, cut into pieces, skin removed
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt to taste
6 cloves garlic, chopped
2 bunches fresh basil, chopped
1 cup dry white wine
1  lemon, juiced

Directions:
Lightly coat chicken with flour on all sides.
Heat oil in a heavy, large skillet over medium-high heat and cook chicken in batches until browned, 5 to 10 minutes per batch. Season with salt and remove chicken pieces from skillet. Add garlic and basil to the same oil in the skillet and cook for 2 minutes.
Return chicken pieces to the skillet and add white wine. Cover and simmer over low heat until chicken is cooked through and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. Add lemon juice just before serving.
