Description: 
After trying the most wonderful potato soup at a local market I tried to come home and duplicate it. It didn't turn out exactly the way I wanted but I found my version better. I got the name Potato Chowder soup because when my husband tried it he thought it tasted like a chowder. Also a can of corn could be added as a quick variation. Very tasty and warms the soul on a dreary damp day.
