Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 cups shredded zucchini, squeezed dry

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, white sugar, and light brown sugar together in a large bowl. Fold the vanilla extract, eggs, vegetable oil, lemon juice, and zucchini into the flour mixture one ingredient at a time with a rubber spatula; divide the mixture between 2 loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe is delicious, moist and a great way to use up all the zucchini that your garden produces. Enjoy! Shred the zucchini first and let it sit in a colander to drain while putting the other ingredients together. I use very large zucchini from my garden and cut out all the seeds. Use left over shredded zucchini to make fritters. Optional additions include pecans, walnuts, dried cherries, raisins, or chocolate chips.
