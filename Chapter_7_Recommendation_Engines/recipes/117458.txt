Description: 
'Fall is the perfect time for making apple crisp because that's when the fruit is plentiful,' notes Debby Stutler of New Milton, West Virginia. 'I sometimes use two kinds of tart apples to make this old-fashioned dessert extra special-or add a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.'
