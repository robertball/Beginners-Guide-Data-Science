1/2 an onion - minced finely
1 - 2 garlic cloves - minced finely
1/2 cup prepared bread crumbs
1/4 cup cilantro leaves - minced
2 tsp Old Bay seasoning

1 TBS white vinegar
1/4 cup ketchup
1-2 tsp prepared horseradish

Directions:
Lightly beat the eggs and then add the next 7 ingredients making sure to incorporate everything together well.
Use a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop to measure out the patties and then form them into patties that are approximately 3" in diameter.
Dip the salmon patties in the beaten eggs and then cover well with the Panko breadcrumbs and place on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.
Place the salmon patties in the freezer for 15 - 30 minutes.
Melt the butter in medium high and add the olive oil.  When the oil is hot, fry the salmon patties until they are a nice golden brown.

Description: 
As kids, my mother could always find a way to get us to eat stuff we didn't think we'd like.  Growing up we lived overseas and didn't have access to fresh salmon so she would often make us salmon patties for lunch with the canned salmon that we could get.  This is a great quick lunch and now... it's my turn to try to get MY kids eating the good stuff and they LOVE THESE!
