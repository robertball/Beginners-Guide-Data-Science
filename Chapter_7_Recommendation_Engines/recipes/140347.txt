Description: 
I have a golden retriever that eats everything! She often gets into things she is not supposed to, despite extreme effort on my part to shield her. She has eaten flour, tea, coffee grounds - you name it!  When she does this, it makes her sick, so I feed her this for a couple of days, until her stomach settles. It is easy on the stomach, but nutritious and filling. If ever your pet is feeling a little under the weather, I recommend this.
