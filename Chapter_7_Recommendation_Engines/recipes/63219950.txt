6 tablespoons sugar
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 pounds rhubarb, coarsely chopped
3 cups vodka
1/2 cup Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur

Place coarsely chopped rhubarb in a wide-mouth jar. Add vodka, Grand Marnier, and cooled sugar syrup; stir.
Screw lid on tightly; let stand at room temperature for 2 to 3 weeks or until all the color leaches out of rhubarb.
