Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/2 cup whipped cream cheese
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'SÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cauliflower in boiling water until tender, about 6 minutes; drain. Pat cauliflower dry with paper towel to remove as much moisture as possible.
Blend cauliflower, cream cheese, garlic, and seasoned salt in a food processor until mostly smooth.
