Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) lobster tail
Marinade:
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
3 tablespoons lime juice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
water as needed
Pasta:
1/2 pound angel hair pasta
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon capers
1/4 cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
4 cherry tomatoes, cut into quarters
1 tablespoon lime juice

Directions:
Cut lobster tail lengthwise along shell to within 1/2-inch of the end of the tail.
Whisk 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup parsley, 3 tablespoons lime juice, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl until marinade is evenly mixed. Place lobster tail, cut-side up, in the marinade and spoon marinade over the meat; marinate for about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Line a baking dish with aluminum foil. Fill the dish with water about 1/2-inch deep. Remove lobster from marinade, reserving marinade for basting. Place lobster in the baking dish. Spoon 1/2 of the marinade over the lobster.
Bake lobster in the preheated oven, basting every 5 minutes with remaining marinade, until lobster meat is cooked through and opaque, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove meat from shell and chop.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving 3 tablespoons pasta water.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add butter and capers; cook and stir until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup parsley and tomatoes; cook and stir for 1 minute.
Mix lobster meat, 1 tablespoon lime juice, cooked pasta, and reserved pasta water into mushroom mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 1 minute.
