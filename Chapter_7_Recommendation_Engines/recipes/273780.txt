Description: 
This is my own creation of a buttermilk ranch dressing that I have tweaked after finding that most buttermilk ranch dressing recipes lacked the spicy element I expected them to have. This creamy buttermilk dressing is so versatile that it can be used on salads and veggies and in recipes that need an extra kick of flavor. It also tastes great in pasta salads.
