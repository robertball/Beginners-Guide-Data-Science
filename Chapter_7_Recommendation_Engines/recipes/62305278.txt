Ingredients:
12 oz bag of Boca Crumbles
1 pkg Taco Seasoning
8 oz Guacamole
8 oz Salsa
8 oz Sour Cream
4 oz Veggie Shreds of your choice

Directions:
Heat up the Boca crumbles in a tablespoon of oil.
Once thawed add your taco seasoning and let it cook on low until all the liquid has been soaked up.
Pour into a small baking dish or 9"-inch pie plate.
Layer the rest of your ingredients, I like to layer them in this order: Guacamole, salsa, sour cream.
Sprinkle with your Veggie Shreds and place under the broiler for about 2 - 3 min., just long enough to soften the cheese.
Serve with your favorite tortilla chips and your good to go.
