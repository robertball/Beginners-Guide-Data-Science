Ingredients:
1/2 pound green peas
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk, or as needed
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook peas in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl; mash peas using a fork.
Mix flour, Parmesan cheese, egg, milk, baking powder, salt, and pepper into mashed peas, adding more milk or flour until mixture holds together. Shape pea mixture into patties about 1/2-inch thick.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; fry patties until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
