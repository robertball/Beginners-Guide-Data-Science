Ingredients:
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a fork, your hands, or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix buttermilk into flour mixture until dough starts to stick together.
Turn dough onto a floured work surface and shape into a 1/2-inch-thick circle. Cut dough into 4 wedges and then into 8 wedges using a sharp knife. Arrange wedges on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscones are lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
