Ingredients:
0.36 oz. Dried Porcini Mushrooms
32 oz. (one box) Chicken Broth
One medium-sized Zucchini, sliced and chopped
One Bunch Baby Arugula
One Onion, chopped
Two Cloves Garlic, minced
Ten Leaves Fresh Basil, snipped
3 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Flour
½ Cup Water
Grated Parmesan Cheese for garnish

Directions:
Pour some water into a kettle and get it boiling. Pour ½ cup of the boiling water into a heat-proof measuring cup or bowl, and add the dried mushrooms to it (to reconstitute them). Let sit for ten minutes.
Slice and chop zucchini (chop pieces into quarters), chop onion, and mince garlic. Sauté zucchini and onion pieces in olive oil in a large pot for fifteen minutes, snipping and adding basil during the first few minutes.
Drain the mushroom pieces with a coffee filter or paper towel inside a strainer (save the liquid!), chop them up, and add them to the sauté during the last ten minutes. Add minced garlic and arugula during the last two minutes.
Leave the heat on, add and mix in flour, then add chicken broth and heat through. Add the liquid from the reconstituted mushrooms.
Turn the heat off once bubbles start to appear on the sides. Serve with a topping of grated Parmesan cheese.
