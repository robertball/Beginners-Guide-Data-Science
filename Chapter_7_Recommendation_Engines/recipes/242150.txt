Description: 
I came up with this recipe via trial and error after running out of barbecue sauce one too many times. Now my family will not have any other kind. I make it in double batches and store it in a mason jar in the refrigerator. It can be canned for longer storage. You can add chopped garlic and less hot sauce, if desired.
