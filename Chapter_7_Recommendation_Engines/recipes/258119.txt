Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, grated
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg (optional)
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 cup dill pickle juice, or to taste

Directions:
Mix potatoes, flour, and salt together in a bowl; add egg and mix well.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Spoon batter into skillet, spreading to form two to three 6- to 8-inch pancakes. Reduce heat to medium and fry until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes per side.
Serve pancakes alongside pickle juice.

Brandy
Description: 
This is a recipe from my father-in-law who taught it to me to feed his son when they visited from Minnesota. I think it's German or Norwegian in origin. I often make this with thin pork chops or side pork. Add green beans and/or applesauce for sides.
