Ingredients:
water
1/2 bunch (~1/2 lb) collards, chopped
10oz frozen okra
28oz whole peeled tomatoes, chopped, with puree/juice
1 chayote squash, diced
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 16oz can red kidney beans, drained
1 6oz can tomato paste
2 cups cooked brown rice
flour (optional)
dried powdered ginger
dill weed
cumin
cilantro

Directions:
Place the collards and whole garlic in a pot and add enough water to surround & cover them.  Boil for 15-20 minutes or until thoroughly cooked.  Drain.
Meanwhile, combine the okra, tomatoes, chayote, and crushed garlic in a pot and bring to a boil.  Once the okra has defrosted, bring back to a simmer.  Add ginger, dill, cumin, and cilantro to taste.  When the collards are ready, add them in.  Let simmer for at least 40 minutes, preferably for an hour or more for a deeper flavor and less of a need for flour.
When finished simmering, if necessary, drain off excess liquid.  Combine with rice.
On the side, mash together the kidney beans and tomato paste.  Add this to the vegetable-rice mixture.
Mix well.  Add some flour if necessary to thicken.  Re-season if desired.
