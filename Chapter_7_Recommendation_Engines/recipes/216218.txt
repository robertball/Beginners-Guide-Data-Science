Ingredients:
Cookie Base:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® sugar cookie mix
1 cup graham cracker cookie crumbs
1/2 cup chopped nut topping or chopped walnuts
1/2 cup coconut
1 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 egg
Filling:
4 cups powdered sugar
4 tablespoons vanilla instant pudding and pie filling mix
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup milk
Topping:
1 (12 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup butter or margarine

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Line bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan with foil, leaving foil overhanging at 2 opposite sides of pan. In large bowl, stir cookie base ingredients until well mixed. Spread into pan; press lightly. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until set. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
In another large bowl, stir together powdered sugar and pudding mix. Add 1/3 cup butter and the milk; beat with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth (filling will be very thick). Spoon over cookie base; press evenly to cover. Refrigerate while making topping.
In small microwaveable bowl, microwave topping ingredients uncovered on High 1 minute to 1 minute 30 seconds, stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Spread over filling. Refrigerate uncovered until set, about 30 minutes.
Use foil to lift bars from pan; pull foil from sides of bars. Cut into 9 rows by 4 rows. Store covered in refrigerator.
