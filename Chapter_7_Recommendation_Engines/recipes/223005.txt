Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 8 portions
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 limes, juiced
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 large sweet onion, diced
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/2 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place beef portions into the crock of a large slow cooker. Mix olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, lime juice together in a bowl; pour over the beef. Add diced tomatoes, sweet onion, green bell pepper, garlic, jalapeno pepper, beef broth, oregano, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper to the slow cooker.
Cook on High for 1 hour. Change setting to Low and continue cooking until the beef is tender, about 6 1/2 hours.
Remove beef with tongs to a cutting board. Shred with a pair of forks and return to the slow cooker. Continue cooking another 20 to 30 minutes.
