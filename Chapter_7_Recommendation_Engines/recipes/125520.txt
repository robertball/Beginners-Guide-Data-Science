Ingredients:
3 ounces blanched slivered almonds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
5 slices bacon
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'centÂ®)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 heads leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces
1 cup chow mein noodles

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Spread the almonds and sesame seeds onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the almonds are just turning golden brown, about 8 minutes. Set aside to cool completely. Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate, cool, and crumble.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate and allow to cool; crumble.
Make the dressing by shaking the sugar, vinegar, monosodium glutamate, vegetable oil, and garlic in a glass jar with a sealable lid until mixed. Combine the cooled almonds, sesame seeds, crumbled bacon, lettuce, and chow mein noodles in a bowl. Pour the dressing overtop and gently toss until coated.
