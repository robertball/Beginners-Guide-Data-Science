Ingredients:
3 tablespoons coarsely ground pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 garlic cloves, minced
rosemary
1 (3 pound) whole beef tenderloin
2 onions
red wine
low-sodium beef broth
2 T butter

Directions:
Combine the pepper, oil, rosemary, salt and garlic; rub over tenderloin. Place in roasting pan on rack.
Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 45-65 minutes or until beef reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Cover and let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
For sauce,  saute onions over low in butter until carmelized. Add red wine and beef broth- reduce to sauce consistency over high heat.

Description: 
A pepper rub gives this moist tender beef a bit of a zippy taste. It takes just minutes to prepare, and the meat slices well. Lining the baking pan with foil makes it a breeze to clean up, too. -Denise Bitner Reedsville, PennsylvaniaModified from: Peppered Beef Tenderloin
