1 tablespoon molasses

Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl and mix by hand.
Divide mixture into 16 portions and form 1/4 inch thick patties.
Pan fry over medium heat until no longer pink in the center - approximately 5 minutes per side.
These can also be baked all at once at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes or until no longer pink inside.
Unused patties freeze well and take only 1 minute on high power to defrost in the microwave.
