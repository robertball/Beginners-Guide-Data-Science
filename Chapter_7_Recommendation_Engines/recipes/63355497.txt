Knock You Naked bars Recipe

Ingredients:
1pkg.(18 1/2 oz) German Chocolate Cake mix
1 cup chopped nuts
1/3 cup + 1/2 cup evaporated milk-divided
1/2 (or 3/4) cup melted butter
60 vanilla caramels, unwrapped (one 14 oz pkg)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, nuts, 1/3 cup evaporated milk and melted butter. Press half of the batter into the bottom of a greased 13x9x2 inch glass baking dish. It's really stiff batter, so I put waxed paper over it and really smushed it out. Don't worry - it will rise some in the oven. Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for eight minutes.
In the microwave or top of a double boiler melt caramels with remaining 1/2 cup evaporated milk. When caramel mixture is well mixed, pour over baked layer. Cover with chocolate chips. Pour remaining batter on top of morsels. Return to oven and bake 18 minutes (or less for gooier brownies). Let cool before cutting.
