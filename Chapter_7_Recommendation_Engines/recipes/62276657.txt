Ingredients:

2 t paprika
2 t black pepper
1 t white pepper
1 t cayenne
1/2 t thyme
1/2 t basil
1/2 t celery salt
1/2 t italian oregano (was from my garden & dried in the microwave)
couple of turns of my sea salt grinder

Directions:
Mix them all together in a bowl. Store in an airtight container or baggie. I like to use empty spice containers.

Description: 
My husband has high blood pressure. I've enjoyed experimenting with different blends of seasoning that have helped wean us away from all the salt. The nice thing about making your own is you can adjust these ingredients according to your families taste. You can even leave out the basil, thyme & oregano.
