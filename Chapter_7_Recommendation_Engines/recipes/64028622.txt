Preheat oven to 450.
Combine tomatoes, herbes de Provence, salt and pepper in a large bowl.

Heat 1 tbsp. of oil in a large, oven-proof skillet.

Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.
Add remaining 1 tbsp. of oil to same skillet.
Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until fragrant - about 1 minute.
De-glaze pan with vinegar, scarping up browned bits.
Add tomatoes and simmer just until sauce is beginning to thicken - about 1 minute.
