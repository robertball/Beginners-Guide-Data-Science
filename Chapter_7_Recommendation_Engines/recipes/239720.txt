Ingredients:
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 (4 pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded, or more to taste
1/2 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, smashed
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons onion powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spoon garlic powder into beer in the can. Prop the chicken, butt-side down, onto the beer can so the can goes into the cavity. Place the chicken, with the can as a stand, into a large oven-proof skillet.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; add garlic and cook until butter starts bubbling, about 2 minutes. Remove garlic and discard.
Inject chicken with the garlic-infused butter using a baster or injector until all areas are injected.
Mix brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Coat chicken with brown sugar mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
