Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste
2 (9 inch) unbaked 9 inch pie crusts
1 (2 pound) package frozen Southern-style hash brown potatoes

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix beef, onion soup mix, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Evenly divide meat mixture into the pie crusts and top with hash browns.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Allow pies to rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a pure and simple comfort food without any pretense.  When the sports seasons took over, my mum had to resort to easy calories to get our large family through each night.  This one wins with kids of all ages, and is ultimately a decent base recipe for comfort food experimentation.
