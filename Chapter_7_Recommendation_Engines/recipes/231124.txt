Ingredients:
2 tablespoons honey-flavored goat cheese, or as needed
6 dried dates, halved and pitted
2 cups fresh spinach
1 Anjou pear, cubed
1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup grape tomatoes, or to taste
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Spread goat cheese inside each date half.
Cook dates on preheated grill until dates begin to caramelize and goat cheese melts, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and cut each date half into halves.
Mix spinach, pear, onion, and tomatoes together on a plate or in a bowl; top with dates. Drizzle olive oil and vinegar over salad.

Description: 
This is a quick, light salad that is very satisfying. Great for one person or a large group. I used this for myself one night for dinner, but the recipe can be made for any number of people. I also didn't think to put pecans on the salad at the time, but I'm sure it would make a great addition to it.
