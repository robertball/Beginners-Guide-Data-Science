Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
4 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp. olive oil
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
salt and pepper to taste
1 lemon, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a small bowl, stir together butter, mustard, and honey. Set aside. In another bowl, mix together bread crumbs, pecans, olive oil and parsley.
Remove skin from salmon and season salmon with salt and pepper. Brush each salmon fillet lightly with honey mustard mixture and let stand in refrigerator for 1/2 hr. Sprinkle the tops of the fillets with the bread crumb mixture.
Bake salmon 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until it flakes easily with a fork. Garnish with a wedge of lemon.
