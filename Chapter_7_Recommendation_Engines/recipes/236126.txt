Ingredients:
1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
2 stalks celery, diced
½ cup chopped onion
½ cup chopped green bell pepper
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
2  carrots, chopped
4  potatoes, diced
12  pearl onions
½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2  cooked chicken breasts, diced
¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, chopped onion, and bell pepper in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic into the celery mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Pour vegetable broth into the pot; add tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, pearl onions, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring the broth to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir chicken and red pepper flakes to the pot; cook until the chicken is hot, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vinegar into the soup just before serving.

Description: 
This is a very healthy and incredibly delicious soup! Serve with naan (Indian-style flat bread) and a salad and you'll have a wonderful dinner for a fall or winter evening! Replace chicken with a can of chickpeas for a vegetarian version. You can also vary the vegetables to your preference.
