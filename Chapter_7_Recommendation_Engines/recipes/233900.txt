Ingredients:
1 pound tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (4.6 ounce) package taco shells
1 (6 ounce) container plain yogurt
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups coleslaw mix
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 small jalapeno chile, seeded, finely chopped
1 tomato, seeded and diced

Directions:
Season tilapia fillets with taco seasoning.
Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Cook fish in hot oil until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from heat and cut into bite-size pieces.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Heat taco shells in preheated oven until crisp, about 5 minutes.
Mix yogurt, lime juice, sugar, lime zest, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in coleslaw mix, cilantro, and jalapeno; let stand 5 minutes.
Spoon about 1/4 cup fish and 1/4 cup coleslaw mixture into each taco shell. Top each with 1 tablespoon tomato.
