Image:

Ingredients:
50 egg roll wrappers
2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup fresh parsley
1 cup grated onions
1 teaspoon mace
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups water
vegetable oil for deep-frying

Directions:
One hour before starting, remove egg roll wrappers from freezer.  Saute the ground beef over low heat, stirring occasionally.  Add the parsley, onions and seasonings.  Blend well and gradually add the water.  Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally until the water evaporates and the meat is very soft, about 1 hour.
Place the meat in a food processor until it is smooth.
Cut an egg roll wrapper in half, then fold lengthwise.
Take one tablespoon of filling and place at one corner of the wrapper.  Fold the corner over into a triangle and fold up like a flag.  Repeat until all wrappers are filled. (Pastels can be frozen at this point and cooked later.)
Heat 4 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pan to 375 degrees.  Deep fry a few pastels at a time, turning when golden.  Drain.  Before serving place in a warm oven to heat through.
