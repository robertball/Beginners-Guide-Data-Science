Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can refrigerated flaky biscuit dough
2 cups chopped cooked ham
2 cups apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 egg
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons bourbon
1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease or spray with non-stick cooking spray a 9-inch square baking dish or similar sized baking dish.
Cut each biscuit into 4 equal pieces;  set aside. Sprinkle 1 cup of the ham, 1 cup of the apples and all the raisins over the bottom of the prepared pan, spreading evenly.  Arrange biscuit pieces, pointed ends up, over the mixture.  Sprinkle evenly with remaining ham and apples.
In a small mixing bowl combine brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice, maple syrup and egg, blending thoroughly. Stir in nuts, then spoon evenly over biscuit pieces and ham/apple mixture.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until nicely browned. Cool for 5 minutes, then drizzle Spice Spiked Glaze over warm coffeecake.
To Make Spice Spiked Glaze:  In a small bowl whisk together the confectioners' sugar, bourbon, 1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice, and cayenne pepper until a drizzling consistency is reached (more bourbon or milk may be added if necessary to achieve desired consistency).

Description: 
Biscuit dough, ham, apples and raisins baked with sugar and spice and everything nice! This wonderful dish started out as a simple apple coffeecake but I added leftover ham and maple syrup and adjusted other seasonings to give it more body and substance. A great brunch or light supper dish that never fails to bring compliments and requests for the recipe. Excellent use for leftover ham! Walnuts can be substituted for pecans.
