Description: 
The best fondue ever; made with beer and three kinds of cheese! Enjoy this recipe as a snack or a meal! Great for parties or great to trick your kids into eating their veggies. You will love this smooth, flavorful dish. Serve with bread, veggies, and meats of all kinds. We like green peppers, grape tomatoes, carrots, mushrooms, cucumbers, celery, ham, and salami for dipping.
