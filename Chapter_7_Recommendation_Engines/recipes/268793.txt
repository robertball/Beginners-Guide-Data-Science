Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 pound lean ground beef (80% lean)
3 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
4 ounces cream cheese
2 spears kosher dill pickles, chopped
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon steak sauce
2 teaspoons spicy brown mustard
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped into bite-sized pieces
6 grape tomatoes, halved
1/4 cup chopped red onion

Directions:
Heat a large soup pot over medium-high heat and add bacon. Cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Set aside to cool.
Add beef to the soup pot and flatten with a spatula. Cook until bottom is browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook other side, about 5 minutes more. Add broth, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, pickles, tomato paste, steak sauce, mustard, onion powder, chili powder, and black pepper. Mix well to combine, breaking meat into smaller pieces.
Reduce heat to low; cook and stir until cream cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Cover and cook soup for 25 minutes more.
Ladle soup into individual bowls. Divide lettuce between bowls and fold into soup. Crumble 1 slice of cooked bacon into each bowl and garnish with tomatoes and red onion.
