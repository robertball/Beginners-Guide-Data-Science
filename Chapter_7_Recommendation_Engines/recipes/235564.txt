Ingredients:
Crust:
48 RITZ Crackers, divided
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter
Pie Filling:
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 cup creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsalted roasted peanuts, chopped
1 cup heavy cream, whipped, divided*

Directions:
Heat oven to 300 degrees F.
To make the crust, pulse 44 of the RITZ Crackers in a food processor to make about 1 1/2 cups crumbs. In a medium bowl, blend together the crumbs,  cocoa, and sugar.  Mix in melted butter and peanut butter. Press mixture firmly into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie pan. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, then cool completely on rack.
To make the filling, beat the cream cheese, peanut butter, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl with mixer until smooth. Stir in the peanuts. Carefully fold a total of 1 1/2 cups whipped cream into the peanut mixture in three additions, until the mixture is a uniform color and no streaks remain.
Spread the filling into the cooled crust. Top with remaining whipped cream.  Coarsely crush remaining 4 crackers and sprinkle over the top. Chill completely, at least 2 hours or overnight. Store covered in refrigerator.
