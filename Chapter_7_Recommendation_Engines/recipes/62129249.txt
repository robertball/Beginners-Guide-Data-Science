Ingredients:
4 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup corn oil (or canola oil)
1 cup plump raisins

Directions:
Preheat the over to 350(F).
Lightly grease a baking sheet or line one with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt together.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, buttermilk and oil together.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the buttermilk mixture. Add the raisins. Stir until a soft dough has formed.
Shape the dough into a ball shape on a lightly floured board or, use your countertop (flour your hands for easier handling).
With a large sharp knife, make a cross on the top. Place on the pan you've already prepared.
Bake in the center of the oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
Serve warm or cold with butter. This freezes great. I've made several loaves before St. Patrick's Day, or family parties. I freeze them, take them out the morning they're needed and warm up in a hot oven for 5 -7 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is not the dark bread you see in every restaurant in Dublin or Gallway these days but I promise, it's authentic Irish Soda Bread, exactly how my late Irish grandma made it.
