Ingredients:
½ pounds boneless chicken breast
3 medium carrots, peeled and diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 cup water
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste
2 cups cheese tortellini
chopped fresh parsley for serving, if desired
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1.   Add all of the ingredients to a slow cooker except for the tortellini.
Cook on low for 6 hours.
2.   Remove the cooked chicken from the slow cooker and shred or cube and add back to the slow cooker.
3.   Add in the tortellini and cook for 15 minutes or until they are cooked all the way through.
4.   Season with salt and pepper to taste. Discard bay leaves and serve immediately with chopped parsley, if desired.
*Note:  I did this recipe in an Instant Pot.  Just follow the directions above, set it on Manual High Pressure for 45 min.  Add in the tortellini after you vent the Instant Pot and enjoy!

This Slow Cooker Chicken Tortellini Soup is super easy to make. Simply add all of the ingredients to the slow cooker except for the tortellini. Add them in about 15 minutes before serving so they don’t get mushy.
