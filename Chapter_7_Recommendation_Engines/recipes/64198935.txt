Acorn Squash - Tomato Hash Recipe

Ingredients:
1 small to medium acorn squash
2 T. olive oil
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes, undrained
4 oz. fresh mushrooms, chopped
3 T. red wine (a glug or two)
1 T. dried basil
½ bag baby spinach, stems removed
Salt and pepper to taste
Rice or couscous, prepared per directions

Directions:
Split the acorn squash in half and remove seeds. Place in a glass baking dish, open side down. Pierce the skin in a few places with a sharp knife. Add about an inch of water. Microwave on high for 10-15 minutes until the squash is tender. Remove from the dish, and carefully (it's really hot!) remove the meat of squash with a large spoon. It should be mushy. Set aside.
Preheat a large, heavy skillet on medium heat, then add olive oil. Sauté onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 4-5 minutes.
Stir in the canned tomatoes with their liquid. Simmer for several minutes. Stir in chopped mushrooms and cook for another couple minutes.
Stir in squash a bit at a time. Add red wine, enough to loosen up the mixture. Add basil. Simmer for a couple minutes, stirring occasionally.
Spread the spinach over the top of the mixture and cover the skillet for 3-5 minutes. You may want to add some more liquid when you add the spinach to get some steam going. Once spinach is wilted, stir into mixture.
Season to taste. Serve in bowls over rice or couscous.

Description: 
I made this up as a way to use a squash and some leftover couscous. It looks awful, but it tastes really good! It has a nice flavor my wife called sweet and gentle.
