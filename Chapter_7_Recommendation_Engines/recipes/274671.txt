Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 stick butter
1 cup milk
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
3 canned jalapeno peppers, chopped, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish.
Combine cream cheese and butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into a large skillet and add milk and flour. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until mixture thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine corn and jalapeno peppers in a bowl; add to cream cheese sauce. Season with salt and mix well. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about  30 minutes.

Description: 
This cream cheese-corn casserole is a Thanksgiving classic at our house. Since we like it spicy, I add jalapeno peppers.
