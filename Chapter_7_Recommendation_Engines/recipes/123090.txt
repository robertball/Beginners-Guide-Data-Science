Ingredients:
4 cups peeled and seeded butternut squash, cut into 1-inch cubes, divided
1/2 cup orange juice
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick
1 cup sliced leeks, white part only
1 medium tart apple, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup butter or margarine
4 cups chicken broth
1/3 cup whipping cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive or vegetable oil

Directions:
In a roasting pan, toss 3 cups of squash, orange juice and brown sugar; add cinnamon. Cover and bake at 450 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until squash is tender. Discard cinnamon; drain squash, reserving cooking liquid. Set squash and liquid aside.
In a Dutch oven, saute leeks, apple and onion in butter until tender. Add broth; bring to a boil. Stir in cooked squash; cook for 5 minutes. Add cream, salt and pepper; heat through. Cool slightly. In a blender or food processor, process soup in batches until smooth. Return all to the pan; heat through (do not boil).
Cut remaining squash into 1/4-in. cubes. In a skillet, saute squash cubes in oil and reserved cooking liquid until squash is tender and liquid has evaporated. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with squash cubes.

Description: 
I'M always improvising on recipes. For this one, I started with a basic creamed vegetable soup, and then added roasted squash and leeks for a distinctive taste.    This soup is a great way to get folks to eat veggies. They only know how wonderful it tastes and pretty it looks! -Dianna Wacasey, Houston, Texas
