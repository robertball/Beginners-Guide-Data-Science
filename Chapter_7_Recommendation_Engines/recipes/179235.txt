Ingredients:
3 cups KELLOGG'S® RICE KRISPIES® Cereal
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup margarine
1/4 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger
3 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring

Directions:
Process KELLOGG'S RICE KRISPIES cereal in food processor, using metal blade, about 15 seconds or until cereal becomes fine crumbs. Add flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and margarine. Process about 30 seconds or until mixture resembles coarse meal. Place mixture in large mixing bowl and stir in ginger. Add egg whites and flavoring to cereal mixture. Stir together until all dry ingredients are combined. (Mixture will be very stiff.)
Place half of dough on lightly floured surface and shape into 8-inch long rolls. Place on baking sheet coated with cooking spray and flatten into 8 x 3-inch rectangle. Repeat with remaining half of dough.
Bake at 300 degrees F about 25 minutes or until light golden brown. Place baking sheet on wire rack to cool 10 minutes. Cut each rectangle diagonally into 1/2-inch slices. Place cut side down on baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes longer or until golden brown and crisp. Do not turn. Cool completely on wire rack. Store in airtight container.
