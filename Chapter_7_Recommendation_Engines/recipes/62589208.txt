Ingredients:
5 pounds tomatoes (I used a variety of plum, heirloom, and cherry tomatoes), cut into chunks
1 large red pepper
2 poblano peppers
3 jalapeño peppers
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
3 ribs celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 cup milk (I used 2%)
8 ounces monterey jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the broiler to high.  Place the peppers on a large baking sheet, and broil for about 30 minutes, turning once, until the outsides are charred. Remove the peppers from the broiler, and immediately transfer to a large bowl and cover with plastic wrap to allow the peppers to steam for 10 minutes. Peel the skins, remove the seeds, and mince the peppers. Set aside.
Place the tomatoes in a stock pot or a large dutch oven, and cook on medium heat until soft (approximately 10-15 minutes).  Use a food mill or a strainer to remove the skins and the seeds from the cooked tomato sauce.  Set the sauce aside.
In a large pot or dutch oven (I just rinsed my and wiped it out quickly after cooking the tomatoes), heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and saute for about 10 minutes, until the vegetables are soft.
Add the smoked paprika, and season the vegetable mixture with salt and pepper.  Add the tomato sauce, and use an immersion blender to puree the mixture to your preferred consistency – I like my soup to be a little bit chunky. Add the roasted peppers, and stir them into the pureed soup.
Add the milk to the soup, and continue to cook for about 5 minutes.
Remove from the soup from the heat. Add the monterey jack cheese, and gradually stir into the tomato soup.
Serve immediately topped with crushed tortilla chips and your other toppings.

Description: 
I am calling my soup Tomato, Pepper, and Jack soup because I used roasted peppers from my garden and monterey jack cheese instead of buying pepper jack cheese.  I figured I would take advantage of the opportunity to use up some of the peppers from the garden  who knew that one small pepper plant would produce so many peppers? It’s been a challenge to use them all!  
It’s delicious topped with some plain greek yogurt or sour cream and a handful of crushed tortilla chips! (From mykitchenaddiction.com)
