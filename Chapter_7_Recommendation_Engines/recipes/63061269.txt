Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 bunch cilantro, finely chopped
1 small onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch garlic salt
1 pinch onion powder
1 raw egg
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 bay leaves,
1/8 teaspoon of cumin and
1/4 teaspoon Mexican oregano
8 oz can of drained garbanzo beans (more can be added)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
4 large carrots, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
3 stalks celery, cut into 1 inch pieces
3 potatoes, cubed

Directions:
Place the ground beef, 1/2 of the cilantro, 1/2 of the chopped onion, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, the garlic, garlic salt, and onion powder in a bowl, then add 1 raw egg. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and mix gently until combined. Form the meat mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs.
Spray a large skillet with nonstick spray, and brown the meatballs carefully over medium-high heat; remove the meatballs and set aside (the meatballs do not need to be fully cooked; they will finish cooking in the soup). Cook and stir the remaining onion in the same skillet over medium-low heat until translucent, about 10 minutes.
Pour the chicken broth into a large pot, and stir in the onion; add the carrots, celery, garbanzo beans and potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and add bay leaf, cumin Mexican oregano, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and simmer until potatoes are nearly tender, about 15 minutes. Add the meatballs and the remaining cilantro; simmer for 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
