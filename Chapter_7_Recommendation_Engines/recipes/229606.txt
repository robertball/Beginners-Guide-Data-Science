Description: 
Light and summery and fresh and AMAZING! This is a California variation on the traditional Caprese salad that is so easy and to die for! Best when using fresh and ripe ingredients, for instance your own garden or a farmer's market. Ratio of the ingredients is hard to mess up, very flexible recipe with room for personal taste variations.
