Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) boneless pork shoulder blade roast
kosher salt to taste
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 (1 ounce) envelope taco seasoning mix
2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Trim excess fat from pork; divide meat into 4 equal portions. Season each portion with salt.
Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork, working in batches, until brown crust forms, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and coat evenly with taco seasoning.
Pour broth into a pressure cooker with rack insert; place pork on rack. Place lid on pressure cooker and lock; bring to low pressure over medium-low heat until pork is tender and shreds easily, about 45 minutes. Let pressure come down naturally, about 15 minutes. Shred pork using 2 forks.
