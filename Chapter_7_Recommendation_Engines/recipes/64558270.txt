Ingredients:
1 pound box of dried pasta
4 cups of water (or you could use a mixture of water and chicken broth or all chicken broth)
1-1/2 teaspoons hot sauce (such as Frank's® Red Hot)
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 teaspoons dry mustard powder
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
12 ounces American cheese, cubed small
6 ounces processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), cubed small
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/2-1 cup heavy cream, as needed

Directions:
In the pot of a pressure cooker, place the dry pasta, water (or broth), hot sauce, butter, mustard powder and salt; stir to combine.
Close lid and manually set the pressure cooker to high pressure for 4 minutes.
When the cooking time is done, quick release the pressure and remove lid; stir.
Keep the pot on the warm setting.
Add in the cheeses, a little at a time and allow to melt (if you leave it set for a minute or two, the cheese will melt quicker).
Add the heavy cream, a little at a time, until desired thickness and consistency is reached (you may or may not use all the cream).
At this point, you can add any other seasonings desired, but we think it's perfect just like this.
Serve and enjoy!
