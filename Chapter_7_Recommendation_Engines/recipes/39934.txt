Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
24 graham crackers, crushed
1 quart milk
1 pinch salt
3 egg yolks, beaten
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
3 egg whites
1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix butter, brown sugar, and 2/3 of the crushed graham crackers. Press lightly into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix milk, salt, egg yolks, vanilla, white sugar, and cornstarch. Stirring constantly, cook until thickened, about 12 minutes. Pour into the baking dish.
In a medium bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form, then mix in confectioners' sugar. Spoon over the mixture in the baking dish, and top with remaining crushed graham crackers.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
