Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
2 teaspoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1/4 cup chopped green onions OR 1/2 cup chopped yellow onions
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt and pepper to taste
4 servings of whole wheat spaghetti
Fresh grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Boil water for pasta.  Add pasta and cook according to directions.
While cooking pasta, melt the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp, garlic, and onions. Cook and stir until the shrimp are pink on the outside, and no longer translucent in the center, about 5 minutes. Set the shrimp aside - try to remove the shrimp, but leave the juices, garlic, and onions where possible.  Pour in the wine, cream, tomatoes, basil, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes.  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the sauce will coat the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes.
Stir the shrimp back into the sauce, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat through.  Add pasta to sauce and toss.  Serve with fresh parmesan cheese.
