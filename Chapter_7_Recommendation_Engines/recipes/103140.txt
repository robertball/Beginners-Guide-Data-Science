Description: 
Traditional Brazilian seafood dish based on coconut milk and fish broth, served over rice or with farofa (cooked manioc meal).  You may use a variety of white fish as long as they are firm.  There is an oil called dende that is used in Brazil, but hard to find outside the country. Try looking in a Brazilian or Latino store.
