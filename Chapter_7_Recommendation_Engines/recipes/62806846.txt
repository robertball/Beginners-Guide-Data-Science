Ingredients:
-1 pound of chicken breasts divided into 4 parts
-1/4 cup bread crumbs
-1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese
-1/4 teaspoon thyme
-1/4 teaspoon rosemary
-1/4 teaspoon oregano
-1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-dash of pepper
-dash of sea salt
- 2 egg whites
-1 cup of light spaghetti sauce (divided into four 1/4 cups)
- 4 slices of light/2% provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix bread crumbs, seasoning, and parmesan cheese in a small dish. Put egg white in separate dish. Coat chicken in egg whites and roll in the bread crumb mixture.
Spray skillet with non-stick spray. On medium-high heat cook chicken for 3 minutes on each side. The bread crumb mixture should start to brown, but the chicken should still be a bit soft (no fully cooked).
Spray a oven-safe dish with non-stick spray and place the chicken in the dish. Place 1.5 tablespoons of spaghetti sauce over each chicken breast. Then place a slice of provolone cheese on top of this. Use the remaining sauce to cover the breasts.
Bake in the over at 350 for approximately 20 minutes. I recommend checking on the breasts half way through. The cheese should be melted and bubbly and the chicken cooked all the way through.

Description: 
A lighter version of the traditional classic. I really like cheese so I have a little extra slice of provolone on top of my chicken, but for those looking to trim the fat and calories you can leave that out of the recipe.
