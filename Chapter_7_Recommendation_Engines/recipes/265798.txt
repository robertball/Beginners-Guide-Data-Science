Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup honey
2 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Mix peanut butter and honey together in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in the microwave in 20-second increments until the mixture starts to dry out and become fragrant, about 2 minutes total time.
Stir oats into peanut butter mixture. Scoop onto the prepared baking sheet using a big scoop; flatten cookies with a fork or the back of a spoon. Place baking sheet in the freezer until cookies are completely firm and cool, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
Super-easy to make, this 3-ingredient, no-bake recipe can be made into lactation cookies, an on-the-go snack, or a cool cookie cup for ice cream. Substitute freely and make no mistakes as long as the base is the same! Don't like creamy pb? No problem! Just use crunchy. Don't want honey? Use maple syrup! Worried about gluten in the oats? Try gluten-free oats. In fact, you can use any specialty product for each of these.
