Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 egg
1 egg white

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.
In a medium sized bowl, combine almond flour, egg, and egg white until "dough" starts to come together.
Press dough into a pie pan, using the palm of your hand to reach desired thickness. Poke crust with a fork to avoid bubbles.
Bake crust for about 15-20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.
