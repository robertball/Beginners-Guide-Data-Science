Ingredients:
1 head garlic
1 pat butter or 1 teaspoon olive oil
.
1 small shallot, minced fine
1 pat butter or 1 teaspoon olive oil
.
(1) 8-oz pkg cream cheese, softened
1 tbsp cream or milk
1/3 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp ground oregano
1/3 tsp Tabasco Sauce
1 pinch coarse or Kosher salt
1 c shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
.
1/2 c finely chopped parsley (about 1/3 of a bunch)
18 pretzel sticks

Directions:
Day before:
Preheat oven to 350º.
Cut the top off of the garlic head (the pointy end), place a pat of butter on the cut side and wrap well with tinfoil.
Bake garlic head for 1 hour; remove from oven; open the foil when cool enough to touch; let cool and then refrigerate, covered, until the next day.
Meanwhile, sauté shallots in butter; let cool.
With a fork, stir cream cheese and remaining ingredients except Cheddar together.
Stir in cooked shallots and Cheddar and continue stirring until well mixed.
Taste for seasoning, but don't be surprised if it doesn't taste like much--it needs to marry overnight in the fridge.
Refrigerate for 12 hours or overnight.
Day of:
Squeeze the cloves out of the garlic head and cut them into 2 or 3 pieces, making 18 or more pieces of approximately 1/4" square; reserve any remaining cloves for another use.
Take a scoop of the cheese mixture and fold it around a small piece of roasted garlic; using your hands, roll into a 1+1/4” ball with the garlic not showing.
Repeat with remaining cheese mixture and garlic.
Roll balls in parsley and stick a pretzel stick in each one at a 45º angle.
