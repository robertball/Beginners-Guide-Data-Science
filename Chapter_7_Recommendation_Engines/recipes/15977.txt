Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/4 cup raspberry jam
1 egg
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup ground almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease 12 2-inch tart tins.
Roll out pastry. Cut 12 3-inch circles. Reserve pastry scraps. Fit pastry circles into greased tart tins. Spread 1 teaspoon of jam into bottom of each tart shell.
In a small mixing bowl, beat together egg, sugar, and salt until light in color. Mix in milk and almonds. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each tart shell. Cut pastry scraps into small strips and form a cross on top of each tart.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until tops are golden brown.
