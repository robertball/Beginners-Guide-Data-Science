Ingredients:
2 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 Cup Dry Cherry Wine (I use Ten Spoon Vinyards)(if non-alcohol recipe is desired, use additional Cherry juice or Cranberry/Cherry juice)
1 Can Sweet Cherries in Water (Drain, save water, set aside)
2 Large Shallots or about 1/2 Lbs (Slice as this as possible and set aside)
2 Cloves Garlic Pressed (set aside)
2 1 1/2 TBS Rubbed Sage (1 tsp if using ground)
1 Tsp ground Rosemary
1/4 Cup Olive Oil (or oil of your choice)
2 TBS Corn Starch dissolved in 1/4 cup reserved Cherry Juice
Salt and pepper

Directions:
1 Trim and fillet the chicken breast to 1/2 inch
2 Brown Chicken fillets on both sides
3 Remove Chicken from pan, cover, and place warm in 150 degree oven
4 Reduce skillet temp to medium and sauté sliced shallots until nearly tender
5 Add Sage and Rosemary and sauté for 1 minute with shallots
6 Add Cherry wine to deglaze the pan by bringing to a low boil for 30 seconds (scape sides and bottom to remove drippings)
7 add remaining Juice, cherries, and the Cherry juice/corn starch mixture,
8 stir until liquid clarifies and starts to thicken,
9 return chicken to pan simmer in sauce for 3-4 minutes
10 remove chicken to platter, ladle sauce with cherries overall.

Description: 
This has become a family favorite.  The prep time is a little long but my family gathers round the kitchen, helps slice and chat while we get every thing ready. Good for a cold mid-winter night.
