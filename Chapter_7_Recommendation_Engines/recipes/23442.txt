In a large bowl, combine cake mix, sugar, oil, eggs and sour cream.  Beat mixture for 4 minutes, then fold in the coconut. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the top comes out clean.
To make the glaze:   Combine confectioners' sugar, milk and almond extract, adding more milk if necessary to create the desired consistency.  Spoon glaze over cooled cake, and immediately sprinkle with sliced almonds.
