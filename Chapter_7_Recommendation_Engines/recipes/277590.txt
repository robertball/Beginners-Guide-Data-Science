Ingredients:
cooking spray
Crust:
2 cups almond flour
1/3 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as Swerve®), or more to taste
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon almond extract
Cranberry Filling:
2 cups fresh cranberries
1/3 cup low-calorie natural sweetener (such as Swerve®), or more to taste
1/4 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/4 teaspoon arrowroot powder
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray and set aside.
Pour almond flour, sweetener, melted butter, and almond extract for crust in a medium bowl and mix well. Set aside 1/3 of the mixture to be used later for the streusel topping. Press remaining 2/3 of the mixture into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until partially golden, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Combine cranberries, sweetener, orange juice, orange zest, and arrowroot powder in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until all of the cranberries have popped, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for about 5 minutes. Spread cranberry filling over the crust.
Stir pecans and cinnamon into the remaining crust mixture, mixing until incorporated. Sprinkle streusel topping evenly over the cranberry mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely before cutting into bars, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
