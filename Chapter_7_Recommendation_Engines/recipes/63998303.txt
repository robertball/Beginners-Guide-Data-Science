* 1/2 cup water

While the vegetables cool, wash mushrooms and remove stems, set caps to the side and finely chop half of the stems, discard the other half of the stems or use elsewhere.
Combine the sauteed vegetables, chopped mushroom stems, and other ingredients (except cheese slices) and mix well.
Place mushroom cups in individual buttered casserole dishes or large casserole dish. Spoon 1 teaspoon of stuffing into each mushroom. Cover with sliced cheese. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes.
