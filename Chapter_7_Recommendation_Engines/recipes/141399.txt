Ingredients:
4 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons tahini paste
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 (15.5 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup finely shredded fresh basil
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/8 teaspoon paprika (optional)

Directions:
Place garlic, salt, tahini, and lemon juice into a food processor; process until smooth. Pour in the garbanzo beans and 1/2 cup olive oil; process until smooth again, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally. Once smooth, add the sun-dried tomatoes, and pulse until they have been chopped to very small pieces and are incorporated into the hummus. Finally, add the basil, and pulse a few times until mixed in.
Spread the hummus into a shallow serving dish, and make a few decorative grooves on top. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, then drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with paprika before serving.
