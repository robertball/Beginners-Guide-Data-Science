Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package lowfat cream cheese
2 cups Ortega salsa (1 jar)
4 cups chopped cooked chicken breast meat (about 3-4 large chicken breasts)
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 small can diced green chiles
2 cans Chi-Chi's enchilada sauce
16 (6 inch) corn tortillas
3-4 cups shredded lowfat Colby-Jack  or Mexican cheese (2 packages shredded)
Sour cream for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 9x13 inch baking dishes.
Coat bottom of baking dish with a small amount of enchilada sauce.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream cheese and salsa. Cook, stirring until melted and well blended. Stir in black beans and chiles.
Fill tortillas with chicken and the cream cheese mixture, roll and place into the prepared baking dish, seam side down.
Pour rest of enchilada sauce over enchiladas, being sure to coat well (so that they don't dry out).
Cover with foil.  Bake for 15 minutes (or 17 minutes if cooking enchiladas that were prepared in advance and refrigerated before cooking)
Spread cheese over the top. Recover with aluminum foil.  Bake for 10 minutes.
Remove foil.  Bake for 5-6 minutes.   Garnish with your favorite toppings such as Cilantro, lettuce, tomato, or sour cream.
