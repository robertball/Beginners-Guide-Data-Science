Slice croissants in half horizontally with a sharp bread knife.  On bottom half, put two pieces of turkey breast, a slice of cheese, and two bacon strips.  Put the top of croissant on top of bacon.  Make other three sandwiches the same way.  Put sandwiches on cookie sheet and put in oven for 5 to 7 minutes or until cheese has melted.
