Ingredients:
3 Tbsp butter
1/3 cup chopped celery
1 large clove of minced garlic
2 cups chicken broth
8-10 grape tomatoes
1.5 cans of 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes
1 Tbsp cranberry or raspberry vinaigrette
Salt and pepper to taste
4 strips of bacon
1 large flour tortilla chopped into small rectangles
1 tsp chopped chives

Directions:
Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Add chopped celery and sweat until it starts to become tender. Add minced garlic.
Once garlic has started to cook, add the chicken broth and grape tomatoes.
Let the tomatoes stew in the broth for 10 minutes.
Add the canned tomatoes and vinaigrette.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Let the soup cool a bit, before putting it in a blender to puree. Once cooled, puree and heat back up.
While soup is heating back up, fry the tortillas in a pan with the remaining Tbsp of butter. Remove from the pan once crispy.
In the same pan fry the bacon. Once bacon is finished, crumble.
Use the bacon, tortillas, and chives as a garnish for the soup.
