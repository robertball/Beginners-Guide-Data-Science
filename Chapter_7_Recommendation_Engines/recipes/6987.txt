Ingredients:
1 cup rye flour
1/2 cup bread flour
2/3 cup water
1/4 cup water
1/2 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon caraway seed
1 cup rye flour
1 cup bread flour
1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup water (optional)
1 teaspoon salt (optional)

Directions:
The night before you want to bake the bread, feed the starter with 1 cup rye flour, 1/2 cup bread flour, and 2/3 cup water.  Cover, and let stand at room temperature overnight.
In a large bowl, mix together expanded starter, 1/4 cup water, salt, sugar, oil, seeds, and 1 cup each rye and bread flour.   Add more or less flour as necessary to get a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until satiny.  Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn once to oil the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled.
Punch down dough, and shape into loaves.  Place on a greased baking sheet.  Allow to rise until doubled in bulk.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until it sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom.
Alternate baking method for chewier, salty crust:  Bake 20 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup water and 1 teaspoon salt. Remove loaves from oven and brush crust with salt water.  Continue baking for 25 minutes more, brushing at 10 minute intervals.
