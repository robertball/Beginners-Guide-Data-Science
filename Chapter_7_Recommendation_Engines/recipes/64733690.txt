Ingredients:
1 cup chopped pecans
1 stick (½ cup) salted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups finely ground almonds or pecans
2 tablespoons arrowroot flour
1 tablespoon coconut flour
¼ cup honey
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla extract
¼ teaspoon sea salt
confectioners sugar for dusting (about ½ cup)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place pecans on a parchment lined baking sheet and toast in oven for five minutes.
Place all remaining ingredients in a large mixing bowl and combine using an electric mixer, adding pecans at end.
Place dough, covered in plastic wrap, in refrigerator for 30 minutes or freezer for 15 minutes.
Working quickly so dough remains cold, use a small cookie scoop to make 24 cookies, rolling each gently by hand and placing on parchment lined baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes or until golden around edges.
Dust immediately with confectioners sugar.
Allow to cool slightly, then roll again in confectioners sweetener.
Cool completely before enjoying.

Description: 
These delicious cookies are both grain-free and gluten-free!  To make them Paleo, substitute ghee or palm shortening for butter, and replace confectioners sugar with finely powdered coconut sugar.  As-is, they taste exactly like the classic snowell or Mexican Wedding Cake cookies.
