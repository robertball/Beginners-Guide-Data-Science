Ingredients:
2 (32 fluid ounce) containers chicken stock
6 cups butternut squash cubes
4 thin carrots, diced
4 stalks celery, diced
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 cup white wine
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 bay leaves, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup milk, or more to taste
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Stir chicken stock, butternut squash, carrots, celery, onion, wine, parsley, basil, and garlic together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Cook at a boil until squash is tender, about 1 hour.
Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid in place. Pulse blender a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Return blended soup to pot; add bay leaves. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until beginning to thicken, 30 to 60 minutes.  Season soup with salt and pepper. Stir milk and cream through the soup.
