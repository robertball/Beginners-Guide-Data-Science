Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons butter
2 Tablespoons flour
1 Cup fat free evaporated skim milk
1/3 Cup Egg Substitute (I use Egg Beaters.)
1 can cream style corn
1 sleeve unsalted saltine crackers, crushed
1/4 Teaspoon Mrs's Dash original seasoning
1/8 Teaspoon white pepper
1 Tablespoon light butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325
1) Melt butter in small saucepan. Whisk flour into the butter and stir, creating a roux; cook for two minutes.  Slowly add the evaporated milk to the roux (butter/flour mix). This is a simple medium white sauce. Simmer until thickened.
2) Add a tablespoon of the thickened sauce into the Eggbeaters; add to the white sauce.
3)Add white sauce to the creamed corn; add the Mrs's Dash and the white pepper.
4) Put 1/3 of the crushed crackers in to 2 qt casserole; add 1/2 of corn mixture; repeat layers. Top with the last 1/3 of crushed crackers.
5) Dot top of casserole with bits of the light butter.
6) Bake about 45 min or til heated through and bubbly with a nice golden crust.

Description: 
This is a lightened fat and sodium version of my Grandmother's recipe.
It is a great side with any comfort food meal, but we especially love it with meatloaf, or pork chops!
