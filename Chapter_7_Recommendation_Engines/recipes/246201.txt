Ingredients:
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
1/4 cup finely chopped onion, or more to taste
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 head bok choy, chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, water, onion, jalapeno, ginger, and garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add chicken breasts; cook until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove chicken from the pot. Cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Shred chicken and return to the pot. Stir in bok choy and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season soup with salt.
