Ingredients:
2 - Salmon Filets
1 - Stick of salted butter
6 - Garlic cloves (minced)
4 - Large slices of lemon (thinly sliced wheels)
2 - Tblsp of capers with some juice
6 - Sprigs of fresh dill
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Melt 1 stick of butter in a small bowl or ramekin in the microwave
Cut 12"x12" sheets of foil and spoon a small amount of butter on each sheet (to keep salmon from sticking)
Mince garlic and add to bowl of melted butter
Place salmon filets on foil over the smeared butter and lightly sale and pepper each filet
Start to fold the foil to create little packets that will hold the butter sauce
Spoon melted lemon butter/garlic mixture over each filet (coat thoroughly)
Place 3 sprigs of dill on each filet
Place 2 lemon wheel slices on each filet (over the dill)
Add 1 Tblsp of capers and some brine to each filet (spread evenly over lemons)
Seal the foil packet and place each foil packet on baking sheet
Bake for 10-15 minutes (depending on thickness of filets - DON'T overcook!)
Open foil packets and place back in oven on Broil for 2 minutes
Use a large spatula to serve each filet in a scampi boat and pour the sauce and caper mixture over each filet
For  side dishes, we served steamed wild rice and steamed broccolini  (with you guessed it, more butter). Steam the broccolini al dente and then saut√© in butter till lightly charred. It gives it an awesome light smokey flavor.
