Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups chicken broth
1 Tbsp butter
1/2 onion, minced
1 garlic clove, minced
3/4 cup arborio rice
1/4 cup dry white wine (I used Pinot Grigio)
1 tomato, seeded & chopped
2 cups baby spinach
1 pound shrimp, cooked
Salt & pepper to taste
Handful fresh basil
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan

Directions:
1. Bring chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat to low and keep hot.
2. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat then add onion, season with salt & pepper, and then saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic then saute for 30 more seconds.
3. Add rice then stir to coat in butter.
4. Add wine then stir until nearly absorbed by rice.
5. Add 1/2 cup chicken broth then stir continuously until broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until nearly absorbed before adding more.
When thereâ€™s 1/4 of the broth remaining, add tomatoes then continue stirring. Add baby spinach and basil with the last broth addition then continue stirring.
6. Once spinach is cooked. Add shrimp and stir.
7. Stir in parmesan cheese then add more salt & pepper to taste.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes my grandmother use to make for us as a kid. It is very versatile in that seasonal vegetables can be substituted as well as chicken. Also, can be a side or entree. Enjoy!
