Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups fat-skimmed chicken broth
2 cups low-fat (1%) milk
3/4 pound dry fettuccine pasta
1 (10 ounce) package frozen petite peas
1 ounce thin-sliced prosciutto
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg
Salt and pepper

Directions:
In a 5- to 6-quart pan, combine broth, milk, and fettuccine (break fettuccine if necessary to fit into pan); cover and bring  to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, stirring often to separate noodles, for 5 minutes. Add peas and stir occasionally until pasta is tender to bite, 2 to 4 minutes longer.
Meanwhile, separate prosciutto slices and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-wide strips.
In a small bowl, mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water until smooth. Add to pasta mixture and stir until it boils and thickens. Add sour cream, parmesan cheese, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to taste; stir until well blended and heated through, about 1 minute. Stir in prosciutto. Spoon onto plates.
