Ingredients:
7 cups rolled oats
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup bran flakes
1 cup Oat Bran
1 cup Ground flax
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1 cup almonds slivered, chopped or flakes
1/2 cup sesame seeds
2/3 cup honey
1/3 cup of vegetable or canola oil
2 tsp cinnamon or more to taste
1 tsp nutmeg or less to taste.
1 cup of raisins
1 cup of dried cranberries, blueberries or chopped dates or all of it mixed up.

Directions:
Combine everything except the fruit in the slow cooker.  Cook on medium with the lid slightly ajar for about 4 hours, stirring occasionally. When cooled add the dried fruit. Store in ziplock bags or airtight jars.  This only keeps at room tempurature for 2 weeks but I freeze it and it keeps for 2 months easily.
