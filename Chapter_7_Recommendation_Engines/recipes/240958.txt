Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup diced onion
3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, seeded and diced
1 teaspoon taco seasoning

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Use your hands to thoroughly mix ground beef, onion, chipotle peppers, and taco seasoning together in a bowl; shape into 4 patties.
Cook burgers on preheated grill until firm, hot, and grey in the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
