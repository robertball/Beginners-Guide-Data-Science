Ingredients:
2 pounds top blade steak, sliced thin
Ground black pepper
2 Tbl vegetable oil
1/2 C soy sauce (Kikkoman)
1/2 C sugar
2 Tbl mirin
2 tsp cornstarch
2 tsp grated fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, minced
1/8 tsp red pepper flakes
2 green onions, sliced thin

Directions:
Brown meat:  Pat steak dry and season with pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking.  Brown half of steak on both sides, about 5 minutes total.  Transfer steak to a clean bowl.  Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil and remaining steak, then transfer to bowl.
Assemble and simmer sauce:  While steak cooks, whisk soy sauce, sugar, mirin, cornstarch, ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes together.  Add sauce to skillet, return to medium-high heat, and simmer, scraping up any browned bits, until thickened, about 2 minutes.
Simmer meat with sauce:  Add steak and any accumulated juices to skillet and continue to simmer until steak is heated through and sauce has thickened, about 1 minute.  Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with green onions.  Serve over rice.
