Ingredients:
3 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1 medium onion, chopped
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
1 egg, beaten
1 cup cooked wild rice pilaf
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place squash halves cut side down in baking pans. Fill pans with about 1/2 inch water. Bake squash 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until tender.
While squash bakes, cook onions and sausage in a skillet, cook and stir until evenly brown.
Remove squash from the oven, and carefully scrape the pulp from the rinds. Set rinds aside. Place the pulp in a bowl. Mix in the cooked sausage mixture, egg, rice, raisins, and pecans. Scoop into the reserved rinds. Set stuffed squash in the baking dishes.
Bake 25 minutes in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven, until heated through.

Description: 
Winter squash (acorn, kabocha, butternut) is baked, scooped out, and mixed with other ingredients, then stuffed back into the rind and baked. This dish has it all -- veggies, meat, and a natural sweetness and creamy consistency without any added sugar. I use pork sausage but you can substitute something lower in fat.Modified from: Baked Stuffed Winter Squash
