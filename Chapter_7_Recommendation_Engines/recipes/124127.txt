Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup crushed cornflakes
1 tablespoon baking powder

2 eggs, separated
1 3/4 cups milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
HONEY SAUCE:
1 cup honey
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 dash ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, cornflakes, baking powder and salt. Beat egg yolks lightly; add milk and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter. Bake in a preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer's directions until golden brown. For honey sauce, combine honey, syrup, butter, cinnamon and nutmeg in a saucepan. Cook and stir on medium-low until heated through.

Description: 
The great flavor of these waffles is enhanced by the crispness of the cornflakes and by the sweet honey sauce. I like to serve these with fresh fruit and sausages.
