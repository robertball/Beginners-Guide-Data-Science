Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf white bread
4 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 pint sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a cookie sheet generously with non-stick cooking spray.
Trim crusts from bread and roll the slices flat.
In a small bowl combine sugar and cinnamon to make a mixture.
In a large mixing bowl, mix softened cream cheese, milk and vanilla until smooth. Spread this mixture onto each slice of flattened bread. Roll each bread slice up. Dip bread/cream cheese rolls in melted butter, roll the blintzes immediately in the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Cut rolls into 1 inch pieces. Arrange the blintzes on the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes. Serve with sour cream.
