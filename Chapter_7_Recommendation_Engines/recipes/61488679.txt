Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced or 1 tablespoon minced
2 teaspoons dried basil
1 eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
salt to taste
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2-3 zucchini, sliced
1 large onion, sliced into rings
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1-2 green bell pepper, sliced
2 large tomatoes, chopped or 2 cans diced tomatoes
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
1 small can tomato paste
1/2-1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat bottom and sides of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic until lightly browned. Mix in parsley and eggplant. Saute until eggplant is soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.
Spread eggplant mixture evenly across bottom of prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with onion, mushrooms, bell pepper, and tomatoes, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.
Alternate cooking technique:
Put all ingredients in a pressure cooker and cook for 5 minutes after pressure has been achieved. Then quickly end cooking by releasing pressure or using quick cool method.
