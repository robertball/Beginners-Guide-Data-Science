Ingredients:
Cooking spray
3 cups water*
3 bullion cubes*
1/2 c. chopped onion
1 clove garlic, chopped
3/4 cup carrot
1/2 cup chopped sweet red pepper
3/4 cup chopped celery
3 cups milk (I use 1% or skim)
6 Tablespoons flour
3/4 cup American cheese
1/8-1/4 tsp. nutmeg
Ground black pepper to taste
* 3 cups chicken broth may be substituted for water and bullion

Directions:
Heat Saucepan and spray lightly with cooking spray. Add onion and garlic and cook slightly (about 1 min). Add remaining veggies and stir. Add water and bullion or broth and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer 10- 15 min until veggies are tender.
In bowl stir together one cup of milk with the flour. Stir remaining two cups of milk into soup, then stir in flour/milk mixture. Continue cooking and stirring until soup thickens - about 5 min. Stir in cheese until melted. Add nutmeg and black pepper to taste.
