Ingredients:
4 sheets phyllo dough
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 eggs
4 teaspoons finely chopped green onion
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
SALSA:
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 small onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons white wine vinegar or cider vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface; brush with butter. Top with a another sheet of phyllo; brush with butter. Cut into six 4-1/2-in. squares. (Keep remaining phyllo dough covered with plastic wrap to avoid drying out.) Repeat with remaining phyllo and butter.
Stack three squares of layered phyllo in each of four greased muffin cups, rotating squares so corners do not overlap. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cheese into each cup. Top with one egg. Sprinkle with green onion, salt an pepper. Place on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until eggs are completely set and pastry is golden brown.
Meanwhile, combine the salsa ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes or until onion is tender. Serve with egg cups.
