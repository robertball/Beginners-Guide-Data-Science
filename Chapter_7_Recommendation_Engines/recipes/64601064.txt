Ingredients:
1. Cut the figs in half or in quarters
some butter,
fennel seeds
brown sugar
some red onion in sliices
olive oil
Cut multi-grain bread in slice
sliced cheese (e.g., sardo, provalone, asiago)
onions on top
white wine to de-glaze the pan around the toasts.
some toasted mixed seeds on top,

Directions:
1. Cut the figs in half or in quarters. Sauté in pan with some butter, fennel seeds and brown sugar. Remove from pan.
2. Cut some red onion in slices and sauté in the pan with olive oil until soft.
3. Cut multi-grain bread in slices and put in pan next to the onions, adding a bit more oil.
4. Add some sliced cheese (e.g., sardo, provalone, asiago) on top of the bread, then put the onions on top of the cheese. Cover with a lid for a minute or two to melt the cheese. Remove the lid.
5. With the toasts still in the pan, add some white wine to de-glaze the pan around the toasts. Add the figs on top of the onions and put the lid back on for another minute or so.
6. Remove the toasts from the pan and put on serving plates. Add some toasted mixed seeds on top, then drizzle some molasses and balsamic vinegar over the toasts.
7. Add some more white wine and a little bit of butter to the pan and put back on the stove to de-glaze for a few seconds, then drizzle over the tops of the toasts.
8. Serve
