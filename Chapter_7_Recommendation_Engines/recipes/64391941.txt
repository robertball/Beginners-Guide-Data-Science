Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup seedless red raspberry jam
granulated sugar fro sprinkling
FROSTING
1 cup powdered sugar
3/4 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
In a medium bowl beat butter at medium speed for about 30 seconds.  Add the sugar and almond extract and beet until well combined.  Beat in as much flour as you can with electric mixer and then using a wooden spoon stir in any remaining flour.  Cover and chill for 1 hour or until dough is easy to handle.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Shape dough into 1-inch balls.  Place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Using your thumb, press an indentation into the center of each ball.  Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of jam into each indentation and then sprinkle with sugar.  Bake about 15 minutes or until edges are light brown.  Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute.  Transfer cookies to wire racks to finish cooling.
For icing, in a medium bowl combine powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon water and 1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract.  Add enough of the remaining water to make a drizzling consistency.  Drizzle cookies with icing.
