Description: 
Oh my gosh, is this good! Rich and savory with just a little bit of heat. Even if you've never been a Gouda fan, this will make a believer out of you. I can't bring it anywhere without people begging for the recipe. Serve warm with baguette slices, crackers, or pita chips. Give it a try!
