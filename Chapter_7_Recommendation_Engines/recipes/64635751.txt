Ingredients:
4 small or 2 large artichokes
2 Tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp rock salt
1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 fresh hot pepper, minced
8 sprigs fresh thyme, minced
1 clove of garlic, minced
4 tsp dry white wine
4 Tbsp olive oil, divided

Directions:
Preheat an airfryer to 190Â°C.
Put the lemon juice in a shallow bowl.
Trim the tops and bottoms of each artichoke.
Arrange four pieces of aluminum foil on a work surface. The foil should be large enough to hold, and cover completely, one artichoke. Remove any tough outer leaves. Set them in the bowl with the lemon juice.
In a small bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, hot pepper, thyme, and garlic.
Place one artichoke on one piece of foil. Loosen the artichoke leaves by slightly separating them with your fingers. Stuff each artichoke with an equal amount if seasoning mixture. Drizzle each artichoke with equal amounts of white wine and 1/2 Tbsp of olive oil.
Gather the foil around the artichoke, sealing it so none of the juice can escape.
Place the artichokes in the airfryer basket assuring that the air can circulate. Cook for 25 minutes. Test one artichoke to check for doneness. If still tough, cook for 5 minutes more.
Remove the cooked artichokes from the airfryer. Open the foil packets carefully to allow the steam to escape. Drizzle with remaining oil before serving.
