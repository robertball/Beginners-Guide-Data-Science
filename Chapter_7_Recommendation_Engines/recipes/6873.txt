Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup fresh blueberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Mix together beaten eggs with the sugar.  Add milk and melted shortening or vegetable oil.
Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder.  Combine mixtures, stirring only until blended.  Carefully fold in fresh or frozen blueberries and broken walnut pieces.
Pour into greased 5 x 12  inch loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50-60 minutes.   Cool in pan but try to turn it out of pan before it is totally cool.  It will be easier to remove.  Can also be made in a normal size loaf pan or can be made into 2 pans.
