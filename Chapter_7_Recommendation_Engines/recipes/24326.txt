Ingredients:
6 yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes
1/2 cup butter
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place whole sweet potatoes in a steamer over a couple of inches of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool.
Peel, and slice sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1/2 inch slices.  Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter, brown sugar, water and salt.  When the sauce is bubbly and sugar is dissolved, pour over potatoes.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, occasionally basting the sweet potatoes with the brown sugar sauce.
