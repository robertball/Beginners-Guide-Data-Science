Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups cornflakes cereal
1 cup oatmeal
1 cup coconut flakes
1 cup walnuts
1 (12 ounce) package chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat together the butter, vegetable oil, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Then add egg, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and cream of tartar, and mix with an electric mixer until slightly fluffy. With a spoon, gradually stir in flour until well mixed. Stir in cornflakes, oatmeal, coconut, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping tablespoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets, 2 inches apart.
Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, or until slightly brown. Remove from oven; allow cookies to cool 5 minutes on baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by a co-worker. Not sure how long these actually stay fresh because they disappear quickly in my house.
