Ingredients:
enough pasta for 2 servings (I used teddy bear shaped pasta)
1 clove of garlic (I used the Gourmet Garden garlic)
1 ripe avocado
a few tbsp of olive oil
juice of half a lemon
a few leaves of fresh basil
a few fresh baby tomatoes, cut up in baby bite sized pieces
some grated parmesan

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package (usually 10-12 minutes)
Place garlic, avocado, olive oil, lemon juice, basil (and a pinch of sea salt if you are so inclined) in a blender and blend until smooth, or chop and mash with a fork. Mix the fresh tomatoes in.
Drain the pasta and toss with the avo sauce. Top with parmesan and nom.
