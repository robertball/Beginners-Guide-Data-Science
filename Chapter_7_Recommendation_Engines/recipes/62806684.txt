Ingredients:
1 family pack of chicken drummies or wings
1/2 C sugar
3/4 C soy sauce
3/4 C Ketchup
1/2 C oil ( I use olive oil but any oil will work)
2 1/2 T Ground sesame seeds
2 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp black pepper
3/4 C finely chopped green onion ( I do not use the white part just the greens)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together well.
Depending on if you have a vacuum sealer, I seal my chicken in that over night with the sauce or you can marinade wings over night.
You can either bake or grill chicken which ever you prefer.
If you decide to bake them, put chicken in shallow pan and dump the rest of the marinade in the pan and bake on 350 for 1 hour.
If you decide to grill, grill chicken accordingly and brush marinade over chicken while cooking. Whatever extra marinade you don't use, throw away.
