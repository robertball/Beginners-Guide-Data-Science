Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/3 cup molasses
1/3 cup smooth peanut butter
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup toasted wheat germ
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Cream the butter, sugar, molasses, and peanut butter in a large bowl.  Blend in the eggs and vanilla.  Mix the flour, wheat germ, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl.  Stir the dry ingredients into the creamed mixture, until evenly blended.
Stir in the oats, raisins, choc chips, and nuts.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Shape dough into large balls using 1/4 cup of dough per cookie.  Place on greased cookie sheets, leaving 3 inches between them.  Flatten slightly with a fork.  Bake for 15 to 18 minutes.  When done, the tops will still be soft to the touch.  Cool on the sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool.
