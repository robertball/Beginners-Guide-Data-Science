Ingredients:
pepper to taste
1/2 packet dry onion soup mix
1 cup red wine
1-3 carrots, chopped in large chunks

2.5 pounds chuck roast
Favorite mashed potatoes

Directions:
Preheat the toaster oven to 350 degrees.  Place all ingredients but the roast in a 9x9 baking dish.  8x8 works as well.  Add the roast, flip to coat and cover tightly with foil.
Place in the toaster oven and cook for 3.5 hours.  Do not open.
Remove from heat and allow to rest for 20-30 minutes without opening.  Prepare mashed potatoes while the roast rests.  Serve.

Description: 
This couldn't be easier.  The size is reduced to fit the toaster oven and easily feeds a family of 4-6 with sides- mashed potatoes, garlic bread and a green salad.Modified from: Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast
