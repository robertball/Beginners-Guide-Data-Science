Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/3 cup whipping cream
2 cups all-purpose flour
sugar
FILLING:
1/2 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Food coloring

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine butter, cream and flour; mix well.  Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until dough is easy to handle.
Divide into thirds; let one portion stand at room temperature for 15 minutes (keep remaining dough refrigerated until ready to roll out).  On a floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness.  Cut with a 1-1/2-in. round cookie cutter.  Place cutouts in a shallow dish filled with sugar; turn to coat.  Place on ungreased baking sheets.  Prick with a fork several times.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-9 minutes or until set.  Cool on wire racks.
For filling, in a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Add vanilla.  Tint with food coloring.  Spread about 1 teaspoon of filling over half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies.
