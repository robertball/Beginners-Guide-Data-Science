Description: 
I love cheesecake but sometimes it can be too rich and too sweet. When growing up in Puerto Rico, I remember enjoying a very light textured baked cheesecake from a local bakery. This is my version of that cheesecake. While not exactly the same, it is light, fluffy, and delicious. Serve with a light fruit syrup to take it over the top!
