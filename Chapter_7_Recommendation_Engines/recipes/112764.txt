Ingredients:
2 quarts apple juice
1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar
1 1/2 cups soy sauce
1 1/2 cups molasses
2 cups water
1 1/2 lemons, juiced
2 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 jalapeno, halved
1 onion, quartered
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
1/4 cup garlic cloves
1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Pour the apple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, molasses, water, and lemon juice into a large pot. Add the ginger, cayenne pepper, mustard, cloves, jalapeno, onion, peppercorns, garlic, horseradish, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally until the sauce has reduced to half its original volume, about 2 hours. Strain through a fine sieve and cool before serving.

Description: 
Recently on vacation we ate at a wonderful restaurant. The steak I ordered had a magnificent sauce poured over it. I ordered it two nights in a row it was so good. I asked the waiter if he knew what was in it and was shocked when he came back 5 minutes later with the recipe. I have had to scale it down due to the fact that the original recipe make about 4 gallons! I freeze left leftovers in additional containers.
