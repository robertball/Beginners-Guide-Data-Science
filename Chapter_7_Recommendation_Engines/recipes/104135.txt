Ingredients:
1/2 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
2 tablespoons water
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 1/2 cups skim milk
3 large eggs
3 egg yolks
1/3 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 cup flaked coconut
1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Combine 1/2 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend and water in a small heavy saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves. Continue cooking, without stirring, until mixture is golden in color (about 4 minutes). Immediately pour mixture evenly into a 9-inch cake pan. Mixture will harden and may crack slightly as it cools.
Combine coconut milk and skim milk in a saucepan; bring to a boil.
Beat eggs and yolks at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add 1/3 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, beating until blended. Gradually add hot milks, beating until blended. Add almond extract and coconut; beat at low speed until blended. Pour mixture over caramelized SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend. Place cake pan in a roasting pan. Add hot water to a depth of 1-inch in the roasting pan.
Bake for 40 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Remove cake pan from water and cool  on a wire rack at least 30 minutes; cover and chill for 8 hours or overnight. Loosen edges with a thin knife. Invert flan onto serving plate; sprinkle with toasted almonds.
