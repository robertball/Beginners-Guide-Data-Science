Ingredients:
1/2 of a Medium Onion
2 Cloves of Garlic
2 Cups of Mushrooms (A Tub) Mixed or all one kind
1/2 teaspoon Salt
Several Grinds of Pepper
1/2 teaspoon Dried or Fresh Thyme, and more for garnish
1 Tablespoon All Purpose Flour or Starch
1 1/2 Cups plant milk
1/2 of a Cube of Vegetable Bouillon, or 1 1/2 teaspoons  Vegetable Broth Powder (Not liquid broth!)
2 teaspoons Lemon Juice
A Few Grates of Lemon Zest
Pizza Dough

Directions:
Heat your oven to 425F. Chop up your onion, garlic, and mushrooms. Sauté the onion in 1 tablespoon of water, more as needed. When they start looking golden and delicious, add the mushrooms and garlic. Season with salt, pepper and thyme. Sauté until everything is almost cooked, but not completely. They will finish cooking in the oven. Dump the mushrooms out into a bowl, and set aside.
Stir the flour or starch into the milk, stir then pour into the empty pan and cook to thicken, scraping up any bits in the pan. If it needs more thickener, add it to a little more milk and stir in.  Add the lemon juice and the vegetable bouillon. Let it thicken and cook down.
While it is thickening, shape your dough. Put on a baking sheet with a silicon mat or parchment paper under it. Top with mushroom mixture, then the sauce. The sauce should leave a nice thick coat on the back of the spoon.
Garnish with lemon zest and more thyme.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until it looks golden and delicious.
Let it rest 10 min for the sauce to set up.
