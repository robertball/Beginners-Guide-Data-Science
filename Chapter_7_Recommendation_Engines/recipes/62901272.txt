Ingredients:
4 cups self-rising flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2/3 cup shortening
2 cups buttermilk

Directions:
Sift together the flour and sugar in a large bowl. Cut in the shortening until the mixture has a fine crumb or cornmeal texture. Stir in the buttermilk with a fork until a soft dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, pulling off any pieces sticking inside the bowl. Gather dough into a ball and knead about 10 times, until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Working on a floured surface (plain flour not self-rising), pat the dough out to 1 inch thickness. Cut into rounds with a 2 inch biscuit cutter, or the floured rim of a glass, by pressing straight down and up. Do not twist the cutter.  Place the rounds touching each other on an ungreased baking sheet, and allow to rest a few minutes.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly brown, 10 minutes.  Brush with butter.  Cook an additional 5-10 minutes until biscuits are light brown.  Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
