Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 large yellow onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes (I like no salt added)(crushed would be good too)
3 tablespoons Lea and Perrins
2 tablespoons dried Italian herb seasoning
3 bay leaves
1 tablespoon seasoned salt, or to taste (I like Mama Garlic)
Tbs Brown sugar
splash balsamic vinegar
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni-cooked as directed- for GF- use rice noodles

Directions:
1) Cook the maceroni as instructed on package, drain and set  aside.
2)Meanwhile...In a large Dutch oven or large pot/pan, cook and stir the ground beef seasoned with the Mama Garlic over medium-high heat, breaking the meat up as it cooks, until the meat is no longer pink and has started to brown, about 10 minutes. While it cooks, chop up your onions and garlic. Skim off excess fat, and stir in the onions and garlic. Cook and stir the meat mixture until the onions are translucent, about 10 more minutes.
Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, L&P, Italian seasoning, bay leaves, balsalmic vinigar and brown sugar and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer 10-20 minutes, stirring occasionally until flavor blends.
Stir in the macaroni, stir and simmer until all is hot. Discard bay leaves, and serve.
Serve w/ garlic bread and/or salad.
