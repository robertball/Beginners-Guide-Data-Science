Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, melted
12 slices day-old bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup sliced almonds, or to taste (optional)
8 eggs, beaten
3 cups milk
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour melted butter over bread cubes in a 9x13-inch baking dish; toss to coat. Stir chocolate chips and almonds into bread mixture.
Whisk eggs, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, almond extract, and nutmeg in a bowl; pour over bread mixture, lightly pressing bread with a spatula until egg mixture is absorbed.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the bread pudding springs back when lightly pressed, about 45 minutes.
