Ingredients:
4 buns
1 garlic clove, halved
1 # ground turkey
1/2 c. pizza sauce
1/3 c. finely chopped onion
1/4 c. italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 c. grated Parmesan
1 T. chopped fresh parsley
2 (1-oz) slices mozzarella cheese, cut in half

Directions:
Toast buns and rub garlic evenly over cut sides.
Combine turkey and next 5 ingredients.  Divide into 4 eqaul portions, shaping into 1/2 inch-thick patties.  Broil 7 minutes on each side or until done (or cook on grill).
Top each with 1/2 cheese slice and melt cheese.  Serve with extra pizza sauce.
Note: this is delicious with a veggie burger--cook, add parmesan sprinkles and mozza and top with plenty of pizza sauce.
