Ingredients:
2 packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (105 to 115 F - 40 to 45 C)
1/2 cup lukewarm milk (Scalded then cooled)
1/2 cup sugar
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
1/2 cup shortening, or butter/margarine, softened
4 1/2 to 5 cups all purpose flour (If self-rising, omit salt)
2/3 cup cocoa
4 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup sugar
Icing:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 tbsp milk
1/2 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water.
Stir in milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening and 2 1/2 cups of the flour as well as 1 tbsp of cinnamon. Beat until smooth. Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
Turn dough onto lightly floured board; knead until smooth and elastic, about five minutes.
Place in a greased bowl, turn greased side up and cover; let rise in warm place until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375F(190C)
Punch down dough and divide in half. Roll each half into rectangles, 15 x 9 inches.
Spread each with 2 tbsp of butter. Mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle half of the mix over each rectangle.
Roll up, beginning at wide side, and pinch edges of dough into roll to seal well. Stretch roll to make even.
Cut each roll into 15 slices. Place slightly apart in 2 greased baking pans, 13 x 9 inches or in greased muffin cups. Let rise until double.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes.
While rolls bake, mix confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla until smooth. Frost rolls while still warm.
