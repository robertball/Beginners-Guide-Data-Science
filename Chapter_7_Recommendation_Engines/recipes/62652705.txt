Ingredients:
4 cups cold cooked white rice (I use Jasmine)
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 10 oz box frozen peas and carrots, thawed
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
pepper to taste
soy sauce to taste (1/2 cup or more)
Peanut or canola oil for frying

Directions:
Partially freeze chicken to make slicing easier. Slice chicken 1/8 thick on the bias and allow to thaw completely.
Heat oil in wok (or large skillet with deep sides) over medium high heat.
Sprinkle pepper over chicken and fry quickly in oil until no longer pink. Remove and reserve.
Add eggs to wok and stir until completely cooked. Remove and reserve with chicken.
Add additional oil to wok. Add rice and vegetables, breaking apart any clumps of rice. Stir frequently until rice is hot and starts to brown slightly. Add soy sauce and mix in until light brown in color (taste and add more if you like - too much at this point will cause it to become mushy). Stir in chicken and eggs.
Serve hot.
