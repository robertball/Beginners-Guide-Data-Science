Cut the butter into several pieces and rub with fingertips into the flour till you have small pieces throughout.
Add cheese and scallion, and stir to distribute. Add milk and stir to combine.
On a floured work surface, put the dough and pat into a rough square 9 inches across. Fold dough in thirds, pat it down to an inch, turn it 90°, and fold in thirds again.
Roll dough to 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick, flouring if necessary.
Cut into biscuits, brush tops with milk or melted butter, bake at 400°F till lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
