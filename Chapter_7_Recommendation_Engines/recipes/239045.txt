Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
Sauce:
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
Meatloaf:
3 pounds ground beef
2 cups milk
8 ounces shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (such as Sargento® Off the Block)
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
2 eggs, beaten
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix (such as Lipton®)
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 cup shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (such as Sargento® Off the Block), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups with vegetable oil or line with paper liners.
Whisk ketchup, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl until sugar dissolves. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until sauce is chilled, about 30 minutes.
Knead ground beef, milk, 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, onion soup mix, chili powder, and paprika together in a large bowl until well-mixed. Fill prepared muffin cups with meat mixture, pressing down to remove any air pockets.
Cook in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Spread chilled sauce over each meatloaf 'cupcake'; return muffin pans to the oven and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over 'cupcakes'; let cool for 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy recipe that is good for any kind of get together. Whether it's a small family get together, or a game-day blow out, these are sure to delight food lovers of all ages. For the sauce I like to use stone-ground Dijon mustard. Feel free to experiment with different types of mustard, each one changes the flavor of the sauce. Regular yellow mustard makes the sauce slightly sweeter.
