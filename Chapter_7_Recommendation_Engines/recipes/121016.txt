In a bowl, combine the dates, water and butter; let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, walnuts, baking soda and salt. Stir in the eggs, vanilla and date mixture just until moistened. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
