Description: 
When Jackie from Domestic Fits first posted this, I knew that I immediately had to make them. Her wings were so wonderfully crusted, and that creamy roasted red pepper dipping sauce just tipped it to absolute perfection. I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was just as I had imagined it - crisp on the outside and completely succelent in every bite. And once you dunk them (yes I said dunk and not dip) in this amazing sauce, itâ€™ll serve as a wonderful complement of flavors.
