Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
6 cups rolled oats
1 cup hulled pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
1 cup unsalted sunflower kernels
1 cup raw sliced almonds
2/3 cup flaked coconut (optional)
1 teaspoon sea salt
Wet Ingredients:
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Mix oats, pumpkin seeds, sunflower kernels, sliced almonds, flaked coconut, and sea salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Beat coconut oil, honey, maple syrup, and vanilla extract with a whisk until smooth; pour over the dry ingredients and mix to coat. Spread the granola onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes. Use a spatula to stir the granola, rotate sheets in the oven, and continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
Let granola cool on the pans to room temperature.
