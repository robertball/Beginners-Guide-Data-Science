Ingredients:
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup farro
1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, peeled and minced, or more to taste
2 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 jalapeno, halved and sliced
2 lime wedges
2 cups baby bok choy leaves
1/4 cup water
salt to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or as desired (optional)

Directions:
Heat broth in a small pot to boiling. Add farro and reduce to low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and let sit to brown, about 5 minutes. Add jalapeno and the juice from 1 lime wedge. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes more.
Add bok choy and water to the skillet. Cook until bok choy is slightly reduced in size, 1 to 3 minutes. Add cooked farro and juice of remaining lime wedge, stirring until well mixed. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, and sesame seeds. Cook until flavors have combined, 1 to 2 minutes more.
