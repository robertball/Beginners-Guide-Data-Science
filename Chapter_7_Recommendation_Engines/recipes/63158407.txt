Ingredients:
1 tablespoons butter
1.5 tablespoons bacon grease, or canola oil
1 red bell peppers, diced
2 cubanelles, diced
1 yellow onions, diced
1/2 head garlic, minced (about 1.5 tbs)
1/2 pound boneless chuck, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1/2 pound ground beef, coarse grind
1/2 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 teaspoon granulated onion
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1.5 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cups tomato sauce
1/2 cup tomato paste
6 ounces beef stock
1/2 cup chicken stock
1 (15.5-ounce) cans pinto beans, with juice
1 (15.5-ounce) cans kidney beans, with juice

Directions:
In large stock pot over high heat, add butter and bacon grease. Add bell pepper, cubanelles and onion and cook until caramelized, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute a minute longer. Add chuck and brown. Add ground beef and sausage to brown and stir gently, trying not to break up the ground beef too much. Cook until meat is nicely browned and cooked through, about 7 to10 minutes. Add in granulated onions, granulated garlic, chili powder, paprika, cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt and pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add in tomato sauce and paste and stir for 2 minutes. Stir in beer and chicken stock. Add beans, lower heat and simmer for 2 hours.
Serve in bowls and garnish with Saltine crackers, green onions and shredded Cheddar.
