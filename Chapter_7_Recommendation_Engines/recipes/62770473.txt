Ingredients:
Approximately 34 jumbo pasta shells*
1 20 oz package ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
2 Tbsp chili powder
4 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp dried oregano
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 Tbsp no-salt seasoning**
1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)
8 oz cream cheese, in large dices (~8 chunks)
1-2 c red taco sauce
1 c jack cheese, shredded***
1 c mild cheddar cheese, shredded***
2 Tbsp butter, melted
Assorted taco toppings, if desired (i.e, chopped tomato, lettuce, sour cream, extra shredded cheese, extra taco sauce . . . )

Directions:
Bring large pot of water to boil. Add pasta shells.* Bring back to boil. Boil approximately 12 minutes. When pasta is done cooking, drain and toss in melted butter to prevent sticking. Meanwhile, brown ground turkey, onion, chili powder, cumin, oregano, garlic, no-salt seasoning, and salt, until meat is cooked through. Drain meat, if needed.**** Turn heat off, add chunks of cream cheese, cover, let sit 5-10 minutes to soften cream cheese. Stir. Stir in 1 c taco sauce and 2 c shredded cheese. If desired, pour layer of taco sauce in container to prevent stuffed shells from sticking. Stuff cooked shells with approximately 1 rounded Tbsp (NOT measuring spoon Tbsp) filling mixture.
