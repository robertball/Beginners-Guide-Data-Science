Ingredients:
For cake:
1 box Yellow cake mix
1 box Vanilla pudding mix (just the instant powder form)
1 can drained Mandarin oranges
For topping:
1 tub Cool Whip
1 brick room temp Cream Cheese, softened
1 can crushed pineapples (drained)
1 box French Vanilla pudding mix (just the instant powder mix)

Directions:
For cake, mix all ingredients together, including only the ingredients on cake box mix, and follow baking directions on cake mix box.  Do NOT make pudding with directions on the back of the box, just add in the powder to your cake mix.
Let cool completely, at least 3 hours.  Should be COMPLETELY cooled and not at all warm!  Otherwise the cake with the topping does not taste good!
mix all ingredients for topping together and spread thick onto cake
