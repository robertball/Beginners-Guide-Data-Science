Ingredients:
5 - 15oz cans pinto beans, do not drain
2 cloves chopped garlic
1 white onion (1/2 whole and 1/2 chopped)
2 chopped tomatoes
3 Tbsp. chopped fresh cilantro (I use almost the whole thing as I love the taste of it)
salt to taste
water
1 Tsp. powered chicken broth
2 sliced jalape√±os or long hot chiles. (Leave seeds in unless you don't like mildly spicy food)
6 slices of thick cut bacon cut into chunks
1/2 lb of fresh chorizo or 3 -4 small links
4 smoked ham hocks (You can substitute ham hocks for any pork meat)

Directions:
Boil ham hocks until meat pulls back on bone.
Remove meat from bone, chunk into bite size pieces and discard fat.
Cook Bacon and place on towel to cool. Place bacon grease in small bowl.
Cook Chorizo and drain. Place chorizo in a bowl.
Chunk bacon and place with chorizo.
Add chopped onion, tomatoes  and veggies with chorizo/bacon.
Place chunked ham into large pot, pour beans over meat and add the bones for flavor. Cover all with water and cook over medium/medium high heat.
Heat bacon grease in large skillet heat over medium then add veggies/meat.
When beans boil, add half onion and garlic. Let boil for a few minutes then add veggies/meat.
When beans boil again add cilantro and powdered chicken broth.
Boil for 15-20 minutes.
Remove bones and serve.
