Ingredients:
2 cups butter
1/4 cup onion juice
1/4 cup garlic juice
1/4 cup Louisiana-style hot sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
7 fluid ounces beer
3 gallons peanut oil for frying, or as needed
1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion juice, garlic juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper and beer. Mix until well blended.
Use a marinade injecting syringe or turkey baster with an injector tip to inject the marinade all over the turkey including the legs, back, wings, thighs and breasts. Place in a large plastic bag and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Do not use a kitchen trash bag. If your turkey is large, you can use an oven bag.
When it's time to fry, measure the amount of oil needed by lowering the turkey into the fryer and filling with enough oil to cover it. Remove the turkey and set aside.
Heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). When the oil has come to temperature, lower the turkey into the hot oil slowly using the hanging device that comes with turkey deep-fryers. The turkey should be completely submerged in the oil. Cook for 36 minutes, or 3 minutes per pound of turkey. The turkey is done when the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Turn off the flame and slowly remove from the oil, making sure all of the oil drains out of the cavity. Allow to rest on a serving platter for about 20 minutes before carving.

Description: 
Delicious, juicy and tender, this recipe was given to me by a true Cajun sixteen years ago and has been on our Thanksgiving table ever since. The injector and instructions for frying came with our fryer which was a good thing because this original recipe didn't explain all the nuances of frying a turkey. It is well worth the learning process, though. We strain the peanut oil after it cools and pour it back into the containers (I bought it in gallon jugs). It will keep nicely in a cool place, under 40 degrees, or in the refrigerator until needed again.
