Description: 
From blenderlady.com  This is a “beginner” Green Smoothie. As you get used to the taste of the greens, you can increase the proportion of greens to fruit, try out some of the “stronger tasting greens” (remember, Spinach is one of the “magic veggies”), and use fruits that are not as sweet – like berries for instance.
