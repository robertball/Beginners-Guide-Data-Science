Ingredients:
2 large onions, quartered
10 large cloves garlic, halved
2 lemons, quartered
2 oranges, quartered

1/4 cup black pepper
1/4 cup seasoned salt
6 jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
10 pounds live crawfish, rinsed

Directions:
Place onions, garlic, lemons, oranges, celery, and jalapeno peppers into a 4 or 5 gallon pot. Season with pepper and seasoned salt; fill with enough water to fill the pot 3/4 full. Bring to a hard boil over intense heat, and allow to boil for 20 minutes.
Add the crawfish, cover, and boil for 20 minutes until the shells turn red. Drain and eat.

Description: 
I learned this Southern style of cooking from my mother-in-law. Live crawfish are the best, but you can also use thawed, frozen whole crawfish. Just pinch the tails and suck the heads to eat. You can also cook crab, lobster, or shrimp this way.
