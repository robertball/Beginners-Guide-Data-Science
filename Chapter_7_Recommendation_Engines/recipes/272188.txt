Ingredients:
5 thick bacon strips, cut into small pieces
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 medium head cabbage, shredded or chopped
1 teaspoon paprika
1 pinch white sugar (optional)
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon and set aside. Add onion and garlic and cook in bacon grease until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in cabbage, paprika, sugar, salt, and pepper; mix to combine. Cook for about 10 minutes.
Stir cooked bacon into the skillet with the cabbage mixture. Simmer over low heat until cabbage reaches the desired consistency, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot or warm.

My family loves this fried cabbage recipe. I serve it with homemade cornbread. Make a lot, because there will not be any left.
