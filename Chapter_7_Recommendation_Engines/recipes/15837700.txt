Ingredients:
Orange Vinaigrette:
- 3 T. fresh orange juice
- 2 T. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 T. Red wine vinegar
- 1 T. minced fresh dill
- 1 tsp. grated orange zest
- 1/4 tsp. minced garlic
- kosher salt and freshly ground
pepper to taste
----------------------------------
- 3 green (spring) onions,
including green tops, thinly
sliced on the diagonal
- 1 T. finely slivered
orange zest
- 10 oz. mixed salad greens
(about 8 cups loosly packed)
- 1/2 Cup thinly sliced cucumber
- 3 oz cold Stilton cheese
crumbled (about half a cup)
- fresh dill sprigs for garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F.  Trim off leafy green tops from beets.  Wrap the beets tightly individually in squares of aluminum foil.  Place on baking sheet.  Bake about 1 hour.
Remove beets from oven and let cool in foil.  Unwrap and peel off skins.
Cut each beet crosswise on slices.
Place in a bowl.
In a small bowl whisk together the orange juice, olive oil, vinegar, minced dill, garlic, grated orange zest 1/2 tsp. salt and a grind of pepper until blended.
Pour all but 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette over the beets.  Add half of the green onions and half of the slivered orange zest; stir gently just to blend and coat beets.
In a separate bowl combine salad greens with reserved 2 tablespoons vinaigrette and toss to coat the greens.
Arrange the salad greens evenly on a platter or divide among individual plates.  Using a slotted spoon remove the beets from the bowl and arrange on salad greens.  Tuck cucumber slices in among beets.  Sprinkle salad with remaining green onions and slivered orange zest.  Top salad(s) with cheese.
Garnish with dill sprigs and serve.
