Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef top round steak, cut into thin slices
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1 cup oil for frying, or as needed
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 carrots, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 green onion, chopped
5 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or as needed

Directions:
Stir beef and eggs together in a bowl. Whisk cornstarch and water together; stir into beef mixture.
Pour oil 2 to 3 inches deep in a wok; heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook beef strips in oil, working in batches, until brown and crisp, about 4 minutes; remove to drain and keep warm. Repeat with remaining beef.
Heat sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat; stir in carrots, green onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir soy sauce, white vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes into vegetable mixture; bring to a boil. Stir beef strips into vegetables; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
