Ingredients:
15 cloves garlic, peeled
1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 1/2 cups chicken stock, heated
sea salt and finely ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup cream
5 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place garlic cloves in a small baking dish and toss with oil to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until cloves are light golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Combine garlic and hot stock in a blender. Season with salt and pepper. Blend until smooth. Add cream, butter, parsley, oregano, and thyme; process until completely blended.
Transfer sauce to a container and allow to cool, about 10 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use. Reheat the sauce over low heat when ready to serve.
