3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 cups water
1 onion, finely diced
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 bay leaf
3 carrots, quartered
3 potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup frozen corn kernels

Directions:
Dredge beef in flour and then, in a medium stock pot, brown beef on all sides in shortening.  Add salt, pepper, water, onion, paprika, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and bay leave.  Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 2 hours or until meat is tender.
Add carrots and potatoes and simmer for 45 minutes or until tender.
Remove bay leave and meat from stew, add 1 tablespoon flour or cornstarch and mix, in order to thicken stew.  After mixing let sit for a few minutes to thicken, if not to desired thickness add more flour or cornstarch and repeat.
