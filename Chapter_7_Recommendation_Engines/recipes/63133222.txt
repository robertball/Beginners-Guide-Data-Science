Ingredients:
3/4 cup granulated sugar
5 tablespoons flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Microwave the milk on high until very hot - about 4 minutes.  In a microwavable bowl, mix the sugar, flour, and salt.  Gradually whisk in the hot milk.  Microwave on high until the mixture thickens (about 4-5 minutes), stirring every minute or so.  Beat the eggs in a separate, small bowl.  Slowly drizzle about 1/3 cup of the hot custard into the eggs while whisking thoroughly.  Whisk egg mixture into custard and microwave on high for 2 more minutes.  Cool slightly, then add vanilla.  Chill.
