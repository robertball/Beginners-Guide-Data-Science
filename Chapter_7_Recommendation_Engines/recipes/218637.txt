Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) rotisserie chicken, boned and shredded
4 slices Cheddar cheese
8 slices crispy cooked bacon, halved
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
4 Kaiser rolls, halved

Directions:
Preheat a panini press to medium-high heat and lightly oil the surface.
Layer shredded chicken, 1 slice Cheddar cheese, 4 half-slices of bacon, and barbeque sauce on the bottom of each Kaiser roll. Top with the other half of each roll.
Grill sandwiches in the prepared panini press until cheese is melted and rolls are golden-brown, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Quick, easy, and tasty! We have had these with a variety of substitutions - ham or capicola instead of bacon, different cheese types, and a variety of barbeque sauces - but this combination is our favorite.
