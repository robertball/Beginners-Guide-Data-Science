Description: 
Pumpkin pie filling with the addition of cream cheese and a shortbread crust. These pumpkin squares are creamy and delicious. Great for a potluck! When I served them, people kept coming back for seconds and thirds! They loved the crust.  Use either pumpkin pie mix or plain pureed pumpkin - I've put both ways below.
