Ingredients:
2 (15 oz.) cans green beans
2 bouillon cubes, according to your entree or taste
1/8 t. ground savory

Pour green beans into saucepan.  Add bouillon and savory.  Bring to a boil and simmer over medium heat about 10 minutes.
This also works well with fresh green beans.  Add water until beans are just covered and cook until beans have reached desired tenderness.
