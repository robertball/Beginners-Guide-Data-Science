Ingredients:
1 stick of cold butter
1 cup of cold tap water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups of all-purpose flour
1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese
4 large eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
1. In a medium sized saucepan, add the water, butter, and salt, and bring to a boil over high heat.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the flour all at once. Stir rapidly. The mixture will form a dough ball that will pull away from the sides of the pan.  Continue to cook for a couple minutes.
3. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes. You want the dough to be warm. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until the eggs are incorporated into the dough. (Can be done by mixer or with a spoon). The dough will be creamy now.
4.  Add the shredded cheese, pepper to taste.
5. Spoon out about a heaping tablespoon of the dough onto a  parchment lined baking sheet.  Shape into small dinos, with at least an inch separating the spoonfuls.
6. Cook for 10 minutes at 425°F then lower heat to 350°F and cook for another 15-20 minutes, until puffed up and lightly golden.
