Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
1 (24 ounce) package white baking chocolate, broken in half
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Place cream cheese into a medium bowl and beat using a hand mixer until fluffy.
Set 1/2 the white chocolate aside and place other 1/2 into a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds and stir. Continue to microwave in 30-second intervals until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
Pour melted chocolate into whipped cream cheese. Blend using a hand mixer until mixture is well blended, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin pie spice and continue to mix until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes.
Form chocolate mixture into small balls using a spoon or melon baller and place on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Place balls in the refrigerator until firm enough to retain their shape when dipped in warm chocolate, at least 1 hour.
Melt remaining white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave in 30-second increments until completely melted. Dip each ball entirely into melted chocolate; return to wax paper and let cool until set, 20 to 30 minutes.
