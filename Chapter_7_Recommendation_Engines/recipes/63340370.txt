Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
sea salt, for sprinkling on top

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the water, sugar, and yeast.  Let sit about ten minutes, until foamy.  Stir in flour, salt, and olive oil until it starts to pull away from the side of the bowl.  Turn out onto floured work surface and knead until smooth.  Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled.  Punch down and spread out onto greased baking sheets.  Using the handle of a wooden spoon, dimple the dough all over.  Brush with 2 Tbsp olive oil.  Cover and let rise about 25 minutes. Preheat oven to 425.  Sprinkle tops with sea salt.  Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve warm.
