Ingredients:
4 ounces Havarti cheese with dill
1 ½ tablespoons butter

Slice Havarti cheese to 1/4-inch thickness.
Butter one side of each slice of bread. Flip over and spread mayonnaise over half of the slices. Spread mustard and place Havarti cheese over the remaining half; cover with the mayonnaise slices, buttered side-up.

Description: 
My mother's different way to make grilled cheese. It sounds strange at first, but I've made it for many friends and I've never gotten a complaint!
