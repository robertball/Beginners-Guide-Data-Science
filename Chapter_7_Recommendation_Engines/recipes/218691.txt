oil for frying
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg

Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk the flour and baking powder together in a bowl; set aside.
Beat the egg in a separate bowl until smooth. Stir in the minced clams and black pepper to taste. Stir in the flour to form a batter.
Drop the fritters into the hot oil by the heaping tablespoonful. Fry until golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate to serve.
