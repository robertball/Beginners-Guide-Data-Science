Ingredients:
For the cupcake itself I just used box cake mix.
1 box lemon cake
4 eggs
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup tequila
Lime Buttercream:
1/2 cup butter, softened
4-5 cups powder sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons lime zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 to 2 Tbsp. milk or half and half
Tequila, to taste

Directions:
For the cupcake:
I used the dry ingredients from the box and added these wet ingredients to it.  I did not follow the suggested ingredient list on the box.
I filled the cupcake liners 3/4 way full and baked for about 18 minutes at 350.
Buttercream directions:
In a mixer, blend butter, lime zest (make sure it is a very fine grate if you are piping out the frosting), vanilla, and salt until fully combined. Add in powder sugar one cup at a time, alternating with lime juice. If you need more liquid add the milk or half and half to reach your desired consistency.
