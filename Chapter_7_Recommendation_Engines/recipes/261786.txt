Ingredients:
1/2 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided
1/2 bunch dill, divided
1 clementine, peeled and segmented, divided
1 (2 1/2 to 3 pound) turkey breast
2 2/3 tablespoons dried onion flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (16 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce

Directions:
Place at least 1/2 the fresh parsley and 1/2 the dill into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a slow cooker. Scatter about 1/2 the clementine sections on top. Add turkey breast.
Combine onion flakes, dried parsley, turmeric, onion powder, salt, sugar, celery seed, and black pepper together in a bowl and mix well. Sprinkle generously over the turkey breast in the slow cooker.
Spoon dollops of cranberry sauce all over the turkey and in the corners of the slow cooker pot. Add remaining fresh parsley and dill. Finish with the remaining clementine sections. Cook on Low until turkey is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 hours, checking after 4 1/2 hours to make sure it doesn't overcook.

Description: 
This starts with the simplest of recipes and adds a couple of items to make it fancy without making it harder. It was just my husband and me for Thanksgiving, and I wanted it to be special without making a fuss, so I started with turkey breast, onion soup, and cranberry sauce. I make my own onion soup to cut down on sodium, and I added a few things to make it special. See what you think! I recommend using a slow cooker bag to speed up cooking!
