Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced
3/4 pound bulk chorizo sausage
5 ribs celery, sliced
1 cup dried lentils
3 cups water
1 teaspoon ground dried turmeric
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic, and cook until it turns golden brown, about 45 seconds. Add the chorizo sausage; cook and stir until the sausage is crumbly and beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in celery, and cook until the celery softens, about 4 minutes more.
Pour off any excess grease from the sausage, then add the lentils and water. Season with turmeric, curry powder, and cumin. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils are tender, about 40 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
