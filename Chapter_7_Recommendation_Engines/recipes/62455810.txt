Ingredients:
2 packages of raw pizza dough (I use Fresh & Easy)
1/2 pound thinly sliced salami
1/2 pound thinly sliced deli ham
1/2 pound thinly sliced pepperoni
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 tablespoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon pepper
1 red onion, sliced thin
sliced jalapeños

Directions:
Roll out 1.5 package of pizza dough into 10x12 rectangle. Layer salami, pepperoni and ham on dough, leave 1 inch on both sides and 1.5 inches at one end.
In a large bowl combine mozzarella, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, oregano and pepper.  Toss completely.  Sprinkle cheese over layered meat.
Layer on sliced onion and jalapeños.
Roll up dough, tucking sides in as you roll to form a thick seal.  If dough is thin, roll out remaining dough 6x12 inches, and double wrap the roll.
***Can be frozen for up to 3 months at this point***
Place on tinfoil wrapped cookie sheet, coat lightly with olive oil.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.  Spritz with water about every 10 minutes to keep crust from burning.  Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is a spicy Italian rolled sandwich - makes about 10 slices.  Always a hit at parties - can be made without jalapeños for milder version.Modified from: Three-Meat Stromboli
