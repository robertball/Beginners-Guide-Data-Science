Description: 
This delicious tropical protein packed smoothie is sure to please. Great for parents who want to sneak veggies and protein to the little ones who don't like green stuff. Word to the wise: for picky eaters, hide smoothie in an opaque glass or tumbler. I won't lie, it doesn't look appetizing but one sip and your taste buds will be sold and your tummy will dance the happy full dance! Enjoy.
