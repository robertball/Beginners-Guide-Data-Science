Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups 2% milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/2 cup cold water
3 tablespoons honey
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine the milk and salt in a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. In a cup or small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water. When the milk begins to boil, stir in the cornstarch mixture, and cook stirring constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat, and stir in the honey, butter, and vanilla. Pour into a serving dish, cover, and chill. To keep a skin from forming on the top, place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface.
