Description: 
My husband's mother made this for us when we visited recently, and the whole family fell in love with it.  It is fast, easy, and very adaptable to personal taste.  Use hotter or milder salsa and chilis to suit your preferences.  I serve this with Spanish rice and refried beans on the side.  You can also add olives and shredded chicken if you wish.
