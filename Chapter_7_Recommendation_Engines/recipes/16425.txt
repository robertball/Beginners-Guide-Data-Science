Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
1 1/4 cups pumpkin puree
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch salt
1 cup evaporated milk
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
To Make Cheesecake Layer: In a small mixing bowl, beat softened cream cheese until fluffy. Mix in 1/4 cup white sugar. Add 1 egg and vanilla extract. Stir until mixture is smooth. Pour mixture into pastry shell.
To Make Pumpkin Layer: In a medium bowl, combine pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup white sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, evaporated milk, and 2 beaten eggs. Mix thoroughly, then pour mixture over cheesecake layer.
Bake in preheated oven for 65 minutes, until set in center. Remove pie and turn oven to broiler setting.
To Make Pecan Topping: In a small bowl, mix together softened butter or margarine, brown sugar, and chopped pecans. Gently drop mixture by teaspoonfuls over pie, covering top evenly.
Broil 5 inches below oven coils until mixture begins to bubble, about 3 minutes. Do not overcook, or top will become syrupy. Cool before serving.

Description: 
This is a very rich and delicious version of the pumpkin pie. It has a cheesecake layer, a pumpkin custard layer, and is topped with caramelized pecans.  My aunt gave this recipe to me years ago, and I always get asked for the recipe.
