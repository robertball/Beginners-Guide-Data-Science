Ingredients:
1 tablespoon golden syrup
7/8 cup butter
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup flaked coconut
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Boil butter or margarine and syrup together.  Add soda. You should end up with a frothy mixture after soda is added.  Stir in coconut, flour, sugar, and oats, and stir well.  Press mixture lightly into a large baking tray.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes.  Cool, and cut into bars.

Description: 
These cookies are similar to Anzac biscuits, but are not as hard.  They are very quick to make, and go down well with a cup of tea.
