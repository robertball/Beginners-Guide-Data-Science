Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 (8 count) cans refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!Â®)
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously spray a 12-cup fluted tube pan with cooking spray.
Mix 1/2 cup sugar, flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 cup melted butter together in a bowl; sprinkle over the greased sides and bottom of tube pan.
Separate biscuit dough into 16 biscuits; cut each biscuit into 4 pieces.
Mix 3/4 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 cup melted butter into a separate bowl.
Dip each biscuit piece in the 1/2 cup melted butter; roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until well coated. Toss coated biscuit pieces and blueberries together in a large bowl; arrange biscuits and blueberries in the prepared fluted tube pan. Drizzle with 1/4 cup butter and any remaining butter from dipping.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter.
Whisk confectioners' sugar and milk together in a bowl until smooth. Drizzle over warm bread.

Description: 
Cinnamon-sugar biscuit bites are baked with blueberries and topped with a sugar glaze. I love serving this at brunches or at summer picnics. Best if served warm.
