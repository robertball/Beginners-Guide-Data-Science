Ingredients:
3 tablespoons acini de pepe or orzo
1/4 cup firmly packed parsley, finely snipped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking oil
1 tablespoon water
1/4 teaspoon dried basil, crushed
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
12 small plum tomatoes or 24 cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Drain well.
Combine parsley, Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, oil, water, basil, and garlic powder in a mixing bowl. Stir in cooked pasta.
Remove stems from tomatoes.  Cut plum tomatoes in half lengthwise. Spoon out seeds and center membrane. If using cherry tomatoes, slice a thin layer off the round end of each one to make them stand upright. Using a small spoon, scoop out and discard the pulp, leaving a 1/4-inch-thick shell.  Invert tomatoes and drain on paper towels.  Place tomatoes, right side up, on serving plate. Spoon or pipe pasta mixture into tomatoes.  Cover; refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.
To serve, let tomatoes stand at room temperature 30 minutes.
