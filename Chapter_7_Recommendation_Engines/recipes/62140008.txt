Ingredients:
For the pudding:
1/2 cup Dried carrageen (seaweed)
4. Tablespoons Honey
1 T. Vanilla
2 Cups Whole Milk
For the apple and maple sauce:
1 Cup Peeled, cored and sliced tart apple sections
1 T. butter
1/2 C. Pure Maple syrup
Water

Directions:
Soak the carrageen in hot water for 15 minutes (just below boiling) or in cold water for 1-2 hours. Discard water.
Place moistened carrageen in saucepot, along with the honey, vanilla, and milk.  Cook at a very mild simmer, stirring every few minutes, for about 30-40 minutes.  It should thicken to a pudding consistency.
Pour into moulds or dessert bowls, and allow to cool (1-4 hours in the refrigerator).
For the sauce:
In a saucepan, cook the apples in the butter at a medium high heat, or until just browning.  Reduce heat, and add the maple syrup and cinammon.  Cook at a very low heat for 5 minutes.  If sauce is too thick, add water to thin to your preferred consistency.
Plating: Pour hot sauce onto cooled pudding, and serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a pudding made from: Seaweed!  The seaweed has no flavour, but does make an amazing thickener. Because of this, it is an excellent vegetarian custard.  By using Soy Milk, it can also be turned into a brilliant vegan custard.  Your guests will never know that they are having seaweed for dessert.  Carrageen can be found or ordered in the U.S. through healthfood shops, where it is sometimes called carrageenan.
