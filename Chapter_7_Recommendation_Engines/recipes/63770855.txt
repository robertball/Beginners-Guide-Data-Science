Ingredients:
1 Cup Self-Rising flour (More if needed to handle well)
1 Cup Buttermilk
2-3 Tablespoons bacon drippings, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Combine flour and buttermilk and turn out onto floured surface.  Pat down to desired thickness...they should be sort of thin.
Place in pan coated well with bacon drippings.  Turn one side into the drippings then turn the biscuit over so both sides have been coated.  These should be close enough together to touch.
Bake at 425 around 12-15 minutes.

Description: 
This is my grandmother's old fashioned, no fuss, no muss biscuit recipe.  It's not meant to be light and fluffy.  This biscuit comes from farmers on limited means and with limited time, but they sure do hit the spot!
