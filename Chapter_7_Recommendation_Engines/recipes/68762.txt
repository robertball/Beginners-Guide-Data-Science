Description: 
This is what my girls and I drink all the time! It can also be easily turned into a punch recipe by just remembering this: equal parts vanilla vodka and sour apple schnapps mixed with 4 parts lemon lime soda and just enough grenadine to make the mixture a nice rosy color. Sometimes we'll add a little cinnamon schnapps or Goldschlager as well, to make a 'Spiced Apple'.
