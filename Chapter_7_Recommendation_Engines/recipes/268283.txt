Ingredients:
1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
4 cups chopped chanterelle mushrooms
1 shallot, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
1/2 cup grated Swiss cheese
1 (15 ounce) package pie crust pastry
4 medium eggs
1 cup half-and-half

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly oil a pan; cook chanterelle mushrooms, shallot, and garlic over medium heat until mushrooms are tender and all water has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cooked bacon. Transfer mixture to the pie crust and sprinkle Swiss cheese on top.
Beat eggs and half-and-half together in a bowl; pour egg mixture over the Swiss cheese in the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until quiche is set, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
