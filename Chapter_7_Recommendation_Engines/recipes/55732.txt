Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) firm-ripe mango
1 (10 ounce) firm-ripe avocado
6 tablespoons lime juice
3/4 pound (26 to 30 per lb.) shelled, deveined cooked shrimp, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon minced fresh serrano chili
1/3 cup chopped green onions
4 (8 inch) flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) can low-fat refried black beans
1/4 cup fat-skimmed chicken broth
3 cups shredded iceberg lettuce
1/2 cup nonfat sour cream
Salt

Directions:
Cut pit and peel from mango and discard. Cut fruit into small pieces and put in a bowl.
Pit and peel avocado. Cut into small pieces and add to mango. Add lime juice, shrimp, chili, and green onions; mix gently.
Place tortillas side by side on a 14- by 17-inch baking sheet. Bake in a 400 degree oven until crisp and lightly browned, about 10 minutes (about 9 minutes in a convection oven), turning tortillas over once after 4 to 5 minutes. Let cool on pan 1 to 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine refried beans and broth in a microwave-safe bowl, cover, and heat in a microwave oven on full power (100%) until hot, about 1 minute.
Place tortillas on plates. Spread beans equally onto tortillas. Scatter lettuce equally over beans, then top lettuce with shrimp mixture and sour cream. Add salt to taste.
