Ingredients:
8 large cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch sea salt
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small head Savoy cabbage, cored and cut into thin ribbons
2 red bell peppers - cored, seeded, and thinly sliced
2 small red or green hot chilies - stemmed, seeded, thinly sliced
2 small mangoes, peeled and sliced into thin strips
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Slice woody ends from garlic cloves, leaving papery skin intact. Lay out a 10-inch square of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil, set garlic cloves sliced-side down in the center and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Carefully pull up corners and crimp the top to secure foil tightly around garlic. Place in a small ovenproof dish and bake 15 minutes, or until garlic is translucent and very soft. (Use caution when opening foil packet - steam can be very hot.) Set foil packet aside until garlic is cool enough to handle.
Squeeze garlic from papery skins and mash with a fork in a small mixing bowl. With the same fork, whisk in lime juice, grated ginger, honey and 1/2 teaspoon sea salt. Whisking vigorously, slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup olive oil.
Toss cabbage, bell peppers and chilies with dressing in a large mixing bowl. Fold in mango slices and cilantro. Taste and add a pinch more salt or a squeeze of lime if needed.
