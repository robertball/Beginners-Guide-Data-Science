Ingredients:
1 small acorn squash
1 tart apple, peeled and diced
1/4 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoons raisins

Directions:
Cut acorn squash in half lengthwise; remove and discard seeds and membranes. Place squash cut side down in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. microwave-safe dish. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 6-8 minutes or until almost tender.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the apple, celery, raisins, brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Turn squash over; fill centers with apple mixture. Cover and microwave 4-5 minutes longer or until squash and apple filling are tender. Let stand for 3 minutes before serving.
