Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni
3/4 cup mayonnaise (such as Best Foods®)
1 large cucumber, diced
1/2 cup frozen peas
2 ribs celery, diced, or more to taste
4 radishes, sliced, or more to taste

1 pound cooked medium shrimp
3 hard-boiled eggs, sliced, or more to taste
1 small avocado, sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and pour into a salad bowl.
Add mayonnaise, cucumber, peas, celery, radishes, green onions, and seasoned salt to the macaroni; toss well. Add shrimp last. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, avocado, and tomato.
