1 cup reduced-fat biscuit/baking mix
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

In a large skillet, crumble sausage and cook until no longer pink; drain. In a bowl, combine the biscuit mix, cheese, mustard and Italian seasoning; add sausage. In another bowl, whisk the egg substitute, eggs and milk; stir into the sausage mixture. Transfer to a shallow 2-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
