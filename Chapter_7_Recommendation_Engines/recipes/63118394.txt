Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cups Fiber One® Original Bran Cereal
1/2 Cup sour cream
1/2 Cup milk
1 Cup flour
1 Teaspoon baking powder
1 Teaspoon baking soda
1 Cup sugar
1/2 Teaspoon salt
1/2 Teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
1 Cup fresh blueberries
1/2 Cup vegetable oil
Juice from 1 orange
Zest from 1 orange
1 Egg
1 Teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line muffin pans with paper liners.
Pour Fiber One® in a food processor or blender and "pulse" for 15 seconds, or until Fiber One® reaches a flour-like consistency.
In a small bowl, combine the Fiber One® with sour cream and milk.  Stir in vegetable oil, orange juice and zest, egg, and vanilla extract and set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Add blueberries, carefully coating until covered.  Combine wet ingredients into flour mixture until just blended.
Fill muffin liners 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 - 25 minutes.
Cool for 15 minutes before removing from pans.
