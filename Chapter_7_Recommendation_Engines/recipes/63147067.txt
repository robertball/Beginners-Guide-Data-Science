Description: 
Everything but the kitchen sink...recently watched Dr. Oz about black rice having a lot of health benefits and that's why I decided to try making my chicken soup with it! Also, since I haven't used any salt, once it is finished, use salt for your taste buds!Modified from: Chicken Wild Rice Soup
