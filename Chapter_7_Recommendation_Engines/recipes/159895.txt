Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 green onions, chopped
5 fresh mushrooms, chopped
3 tomatoes - blanched, peeled, and chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
3 large carrots, chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon coriander seed
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, sliced
2 green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 (8 ounce) can peas, drained
2 cups cooked, peeled, and deveined shrimp
1 (5 ounce) package vermicelli pasta
1 sprig fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Heat 3 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry 1 clove garlic and 1 chopped green onion in the hot oil 30 to 60 seconds. Add the mushrooms, tomatoes, salt, and 1/2 tablespoon lime juice and cook until the tomatoes are soft, 3 to 5 minutes; set aside.
Bring a pot of water to a boil; add the carrots and cook until fork tender, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and set aside.
Heat another 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large saucepan, cook the other clove of garlic in the hot oil 30 to 60 seconds. Add the cumin, coriander seed, and turmeric; cook another 1 to 2 minutes, allowing the spices to slightly burn on the bottom of the pan. Stir in the jalapeno pepper, 2 chopped green onions, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 tablespoon lime juice and the tomato mixture in with the spice mixture, scraping the bottom of the pan with a spatula to loosen the spices. Whisk in the coconut milk; simmer 6 minutes.
Add the cooked shrimp, carrots, and peas to the soup and stir; simmer until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Submerge the vermicelli pasta in the soup and allow to cook until the pasta is softened, 5 to 7 minutes more. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

Description: 
I threw these ingredients together when I realized I had half a can of coconut milk left in the fridge that was about to go bad. All in all, I think it came out pretty good! It's very variable and the coconut flavor is not too strong.
