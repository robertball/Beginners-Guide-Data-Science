Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
1/3 cup corn syrup
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3 eggs
1 cup corn syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup peach preserves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl mix together the flour sugar and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture is fine and crumbly. Stir in 1/3 cup corn syrup until a dough forms. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan.
In another bowl, beat cream cheese and eggs using an electric mixer, until smooth and creamy. Mix in 1 cup corn syrup and vanilla until well blended. Spread evenly over the crust.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are light brown. Remove from the oven and spread peach preserves over the hot filling immediately. Chill for at least 3 hours before cutting into small squares.
