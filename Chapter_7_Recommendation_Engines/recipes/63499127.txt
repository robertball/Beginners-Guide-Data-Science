Ingredients:
ANTIPASTO MIXTURE;
1 1/2 cups Sargento shredded part skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 lb. hard salami - minced
1/4 cup spanish olives w/ pimentos - minced
1/2 cup breadcrumbs - plain
2 cloves fresh garlic - minced
2 large eggs - beaten
FRITTER BATTER;
1 cup flour
1 tsp. baking powder
7-8 oz. beer - any kind, light or regular
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
In a medium size bowl combine all of the ingredients for the antipasto mixture (the first 6 ingredients).
Form the mixture into firm, walnut sized balls. Do this for the entire mixture and set aside. You should have about 16 balls.
In a seperate medium sized bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the fritter batter. The batter should be very thick similar to a thick pancake batter.
Carefully dip each ball into the fritter batter and set aside.
Line a plate with paper towels to blot fritters.
Deep fry the fritters, a few at a time, until golden brown. They will brown VERY quickly so keep an eye on them. Blot on the paper towels.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Put the fritters on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes to fully cook the inside.
Serve warm.
I served these with marinara sauce for dipping, but the antipasto fritters taste delicious plain also!
