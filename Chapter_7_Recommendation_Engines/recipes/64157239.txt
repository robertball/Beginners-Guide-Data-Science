Ingredients:
4 cups diced, unpeeled red potatoes (diced frozen or about 2 large potatoes)
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
12 slices chopped bacon

1/2 TSP steak seasoning
1/2 TSP chili powder
4-8 eggs (1-2 per person)
1/2 cup grated sharp or jack cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large bowl, toss together potatoes, tomatoes, bacon, olive oil, and seasonings.
Spray 9 X 13" baking dish with cooking spray and evenly spread potato mixture.
Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees F.
Crack eggs, spacing evenly, over the potatoes.
Sprinkle a small pinch of steak seasoning over each egg. Return to hot oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until whites are just set but yolks are still runny.
Sprinkle with cheese and serve immediately.

Description: 
It's 10:30 at night and I'm already thinking about breakfast!  I'm addicted to baked eggs and I've switched up this recipe so many times that I thought it time to get it documented!  It is an eggs-ceptionally easy and satisfying breakfast and my kids love it!  If that's not enough to sell you on it, it has bacon.  Bacon.
