Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package dry pasta
1 clove garlic
1 medium tomato
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
Coarsely chop the tomato and transfer to a small bowl. Sprinkle the tomato chunks with basil, olive oil, and salt. Set aside.
Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander, and then return the pasta to the pot.
Pour the tomato mixture over the pasta and toss to mix.

Description: 
This is an extremely simple pasta recipe that I love to make when I don't really feel like cooking! I use rigatoni, but you can use whatever pasta you prefer. This is especially delicious with tomatoes fresh from your garden. Serve with garlic bread and a simple lettuce salad with Italian dressing.
