Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
6 slices of bacon
1 cup smoked fontina cheese, shredded
1/2 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Pound chicken pieces to 1/4 inch thick. Meanwhile, in a large ovenproof skillet, fry bacon until crisp, reserving drippings.  Crumble bacon into small pieces.  Mix together bacon and cheese in a small bowl.  Place a small mound of cheese/bacon mixture on top of each chicken breast.  Roll up tightly and secure with toothpicks.  Sprinkle black pepper on top. Brown chicken in the same skillet that you fried the bacon in using reserved bacon drippings until chicken is golden brown.  Preheat oven to 400 degress. Bake chicken with lid on approximately 20 minutes or until fork tender.
