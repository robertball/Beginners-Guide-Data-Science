Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
3 bananas, mashed
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups almond flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Prepare a bread pan with cooking spray.
Mix eggs and vinegar together in a bowl; add bananas, coconut oil, honey, and vanilla extract and stir until blended.
Sift flour, cinnamon, baking powder, nutmeg and salt together in a large bowl; stir into banana mixture until well blended. Pour batter into prepared bread pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
