Description: 
The word 'ragu' means to stimulate the appetite. This sauce certainly fits the bill and hails from Northern Italy. It does not use garlic, has just a touch of tomato paste and a sprinkling of grated nutmeg, too. The sauce may be used on ravioli, gnocchi, spaetzle or any other type of hot, cooked pasta.
