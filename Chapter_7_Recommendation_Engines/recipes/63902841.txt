Ingredients:
2 large cooked chicken breasts	 (about 2 cups)
1/3 cup diced celery (about 2 stalks)
1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1/3 cup sweet pickle relish
1/2-2/3 cup mayonnaise (depends on how "wet" you like your salad)
toasted bread	 (whole wheat or thick texas toast are really good)

Directions:
Boil chicken until completely cooked. Remove from water and cool meat.
You can save the chicken broth, seal and refrigerate no more than a week.
After chicken is cool, cut into tiny pieces. Place in a mixing bowl with all other ingredients and mix well.
Butter one side of sandwich bread and grill. Place salad in between grilled bread slices and serve.
