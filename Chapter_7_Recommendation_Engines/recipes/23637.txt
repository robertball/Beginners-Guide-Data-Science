Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and diced pumpkin
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 tablespoon butter flavored extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tablespoons nutmeg
1 tablespoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground mace

Directions:
Place fresh pumpkin in a small pan and fill with water.  Boil pumpkin until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain and puree pumpkin. Measure 2 cups of pumpkin puree for use in this recipe.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and vegetable oil. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in the 2  cups pumpkin puree, then stir in the vanilla, almond, butter extract, and lemon extract.
In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, wheat flour,  baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and mace. Stir flour mixture into pumpkin mixture; pour into prepared pans.
Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 15 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
