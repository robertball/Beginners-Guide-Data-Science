Ingredients:
2 tablespoons finely chopped cooked bacon
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
1 medium head cabbage, cored and quartered

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix bacon, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Set aside.
Lay each cabbage quarter on a sheet of aluminum foil that is large enough to wrap it up. Pour bacon sauce evenly over each quarter to cover; wrap in foil until completely sealed.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender and heated through, 20 to 30 minutes.
