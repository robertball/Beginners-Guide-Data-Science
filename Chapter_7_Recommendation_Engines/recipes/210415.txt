Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet, Milk, or White Chocolate chips or baking bars
8 small round balloons

Directions:
If you are using baking bars, break or chop the chocolate into 1-inch pieces. In the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water, melt half the chocolate, stirring occasionally until smooth. Cool for about 5 minutes.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Inflate the balloons to a 4-inch diameter; knot. Holding a balloon by the knot, dip into the chocolate, tipping to cover the balloon halfway up with chocolate. Place the balloon, knotted side up, on the prepared baking sheet, holding the balloon in place until the chocolate starts to set. Repeat with the remaining balloons to make eight cups. Place in the freezer for 5 minutes.
Melt the remaining 3/4 pound chocolate and repeat the dipping procedure. Place in the freezer for 10 minutes.
Snip a hole in each balloon to deflate; carefully peel the balloon away from the chocolate. Refrigerate until needed. Use the same day.
