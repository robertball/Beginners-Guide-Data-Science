Ingredients:
2 1/2 C (345g) Mixed Pitted Olives such as Black, Kalamata, Green, drained
2 Tbs Capers, drained
2 Tbs Marinated Sun Dried Tomatoes, drained
1 Tbs Garlic, chopped

Directions:
In the bowl of a food processor, add the olives, capers, tomatoes, garlic, oregano, parsley, basil, lemon juice, olive oil and black pepper.
For a relish, pulse a few times, then scrape down bowl. Pulse a few more times, and the relish will be ready.
For a chunky spread (pictured here), pulse up to 15-17 times, stopping to scrape down the bowl a few times.
For a spreadable tapenade, process until a paste is formed, stopping to scrape down the bowl a few times.
Garnish with parsley leaves and olive oil for drizzling.
Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
