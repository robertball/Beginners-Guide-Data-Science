Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1 pound cooked crabmeat
1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers
1 teaspoon paprika
1 (7 ounce) jar duck sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, soy sauce, fresh ginger root, garlic, parsley and crabmeat.
Cut wonton wrappers diagonally into triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle with paprika, increasing the amount as desired.
Bake wrappers in the preheated oven until crisp and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour approximately 1/2 the duck sauce over cream cheese mixture. Serve the rest with the toasted won ton wrapper triangles for dipping.

Description: 
This quick and easy dip has all the flavor of fried Rangoon -- without the time and mess of frying. Won ton wrappers are baked crisp, then dipped in a creamy Asian-style sauce. They disappear fast at gatherings! The won ton wrappers may need to be baked in several batches.
