Description: 
While doin' time in Apple Tree Creek I found myself cooking without a stove! Thank the heavens for slow cookers and electric frypans! Serve topped with a bit of shredded Cheddar cheese and cooked, crumbled veggie bacon. Bannock made in an electric frypan is a nice accompaniment to this soup.
