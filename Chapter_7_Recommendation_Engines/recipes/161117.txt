1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Stir together 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon oyster sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch in a bowl. Add beef and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator 10 minutes before cooking.
Stir together water, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, and pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir in onion, and cook until it beings to brown on the edges, about 1 minute. Add the beef, and continue cooking and stirring until the beef is just slightly pink, about 5 minutes. Pour in the sauce; cook and stir until the sauce has thickened and turned translucent, about 1 minute more.

Description: 
My good friend Lin gave me a recipe for beef in oyster sauce, I misread the amount of black pepper called for in her recipe, and the result was fantastic! I especially like the recipe because no soy sauce is used. My husband likes to eat them with the leftover sliced uncooked onion to bring out the sweetness of the oyster sauce.
