Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 eggs
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup applesauce
1/2 cup medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil
12 drops liquid stevia
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups whole wheat flour
2 scoops whey protein powder
1/2 cup pecans, finely ground
2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat 2 muffin tins with cooking spray.
Whisk pumpkin puree, eggs, sugar, water, applesauce, MCT oil, stevia, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.
Stir flour, protein powder, ground pecans, flaxseed meal, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger together in a separate bowl. Pour over pumpkin mixture and mix until batter is just moistened.
Scoop batter into the prepared tins, filling each cup 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes.
