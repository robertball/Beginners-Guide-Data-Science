Ingredients:
4 - 5 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
12 ounces of warm beer
1/4 cup warm water
2 teaspoons sea salt
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon instant yeast
---------------------
TO TOP THE DOUGH:
3 tbsp cornmeal
1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Place all ingredients in the bread machine as directed by the manufacturer.  Start with 4 cups of flour for now.
Choose dough cycle.  Once dough begins to mix you may decide to add more flour.  Add 1/4 cup at a time until dough pulls together and away from the sides of the pan.  You might not need to add all 5 cups.  You have added enough flour when the dough forms a ball but still moves freely.
When cycle is finished remove dough to a lightly oiled surface.
Knead dough for 3 minutes.  Divide dough into 8 equal portions then let rest for 5 minutes.
Roll into balls. Let rest 5 minutes.
Flatten out to 1/2 to 3/4 inch thickness.
Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water and coat dough with mixture.  Sprinkle generously with seeds then sprinkle with cornmeal.
Bake 400 degrees for 15 - 17 minutes.  Let them get brown and crusty.  The inside will NOT get dry and the rolls will soften while cooling.  Remove to a wire rack to completely cool before cutting.
