Ingredients:
1 head kale, stems removed and thinly sliced
1 large carrot, grated
1/2 an orange, juiced
1/2 a lemon, juiced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 red onion, sliced very thinly
1 slice bacon, cooked crisp and chopped
2-3 rounded tablespoons mayonnaise

Directions:
Place the kale into a salad bowl. Toss with the carrot, orange juice, lemon juice ,and salt, and using your hands, rub the acid into the kale. Let the kale sit a few minutes while you shock the onion. Prepare a large bowl of ice water and a saucepan with boiling water. Place the thinly sliced onion into the boiling water for 15 to 30 seconds, and then shock them in the cold water, stopping the cooking immediately. Drain the water and blot the onions with a paper towel. Add the onion, bacon, olive oil, salt and pepper and toss well. Add the mayonnaise and mix the slaw well. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Can be made several hours in advance.

Description: 
I love this as a substitute for a salad and it keeps great.  I don't normally put carrot but it really makes it look better and gives it some texture.  I add the mayo to eye it - I like it creamier but my other half doesn't.  The lemon makes a HUGE difference!
