Description: 
This is a very healthy variation on a seven layer salad. The key difference in terms of health is that mayonnaise is replaced by hummus. You'll use more lettuce than anything else, and other ingredients should be added to your taste. Make sure that all of your ingredients are visible through the side of the bowl to ensure a perfect presentation.
