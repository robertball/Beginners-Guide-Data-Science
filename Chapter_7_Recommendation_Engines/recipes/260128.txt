Ingredients:
¾ cup hot sauce (such as Frank's(<sup>&reg;</sup>) <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot (<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 tablespoons blue cheese dressing (such as Naturally Fresh(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Lite)
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast
½ (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
3 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat a slow cooker on Low. Add hot sauce, cream cheese, and blue cheese dressing; mix until combined. Add chicken breasts; cook until fork-tender and no longer pink in the center, at least 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pull chicken meat apart with a fork; stir into the sauce. Transfer chicken mixture to a baking pan. Top with Cheddar cheese and blue cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and bubbly, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Buffalo chicken breast served pulled-style. I eat it in a sandwich bun or on a salad or with celery. It is wonderful!
