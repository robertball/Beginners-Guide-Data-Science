Description: 
This is the 'secret' Greek dressing recipe from the pizzeria that I work at.  The recipe makes almost a gallon but can be scaled down easily. It can be used for picnics and travels very well, since it doesn't need to be refrigerated.  This is the best dressing I have ever tasted, people offer to buy it constantly, but if we sold it we wouldn't be able to make enough to use in the restaurant!Modified from: Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing
