Ingredients:
Turkey Filling
1/3 cup butter flavor shortening or coconut oil
1/3 cup white whole wheat flour
1/2 onion diced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 3/4 cups turkey/chicken broth (had no salt so adjust salt if yours does)
2/3 cup almond milk
2 cups cooked chicken/turkey (cut up into small bite size)
1 10 oz frozen mixed vegetables or peas and carrots
Celery Pastry
2/3 cup butter flavor shortening
2 cups white whole wheat flour
2 tsp celery salt
approx 1/3 cup water

Directions:
Heat shortening/oil over low heat until melted. Stir in onions and cook till soft, add flour, salt, and pepper, stir till smooth. Add broth and milk slowly stirring constantly. Heat till boiling and boil 1 minute while stirring. Stir in chicken or turkey and frozen vegetables. Set aside.
Prepare pastry:
Mix flour and celery salt then cut shortening into mixture until crumbly. Add water a little at a time until moist. You may need more or less water than 1/3 cup. It needs to be able to hold together without being sticky.
Roll out 1/2 pastry and line large pie plate. Pour in filling. Roll out other half and put on top. Fold under bottom edge and flute edges. Cut slits on top.
Bake 425 F for 30 to 35 minutes until brown.

Description: 
This is my version of my mother in law's recipe now that we can't have dairy. A few of the ingredients in hers did have dairy. My husband said it tasted great. My favorite part of her pot pie is the celery crust.
