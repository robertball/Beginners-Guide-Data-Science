Ingredients:
Maple Rum Glaze
•	1/2 cup maple syrup (125 ml)
•	1/2 cup dark rum (125 ml)
•	1/4 cup unsalted butter (60 ml)
Grilled Jumbo Prawns
•	6 to 8 jumbo shrimp, peeled, de-veined
•	1/4 cup goat cheese (60 ml)
•	2 tablespoons sour cream (30 ml)
•	2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives (30 ml)
•	Lemon or lime juice, to taste
•	Black pepper, to taste
•	6 slices prosciutto (thinly sliced

Directions:
Glaze
Add maple syrup, rum and butter to a saucepan over medium high heat. Reduce until a glaze consistency or until coats the back of a spoon. Set the glaze aside until ready to grill shrimp.
Grilled Jumbo Prawns
Butterfly the shrimp by cutting down the center back of the shrimp but don’t cut all the way through – then open and flatten the two halves so that it resembles a butterfly. This will allow you to get more filling in the shrimp.
Cream the goat cheese and sour cream together. Stir in chives and pepper. Chill in the refrigerator to firm up and set.
Place butterflied shrimp cut side up. Using a pallet knife or small spatula evenly spread the shrimp with the goat cheese mixture.
Place a slice of proscuitto on a piece of plastic wrap. Put a shrimp on top of the prouscuitto width wise. Roll tightly but not so tight that the goat cheese squeezes out.
Preheat grill to medium high (350 degrees F.). Oil grill well.
Grill shrimp for 3 to 3 ½ minutes per side, brushing with some of the maple rum glaze.
