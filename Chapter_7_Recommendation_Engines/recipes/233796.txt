Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) bottom round roast
2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste
1 teaspoon granulated garlic, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
3 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch pieces
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
1/4 cup dry cooking sherry
1 (28 ounce) can whole tomatoes with juice, lightly crushed with hands and pulp removed
1 (5.5 ounce) can tomato-vegetable juice cocktail (such as V8Â®)
2/3 cup Cabernet Sauvignon wine
2 cups 1-inch Yukon Gold potato chunks
2 cups 1-inch carrot chunks
1 1/2 onions, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Generously season roast on all sides with salt, black pepper, and granulated garlic.
Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over high heat until oil begins to smoke. Add roast to pot and sear to form a crust, about 5 minutes per side. Remove roast and lower heat to medium.
Stir onions, celery, and garlic into pot; cook and stir, scraping any brown bits off the bottom, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add oregano and basil to onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour dry sherry into onion mixture; bring to a boil while scraping any browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Add canned tomatoes and cook until mixture just begins to bubble.
Stir vegetable juice cocktail and wine into tomato mixture. Return roast and any accumulated juices to pot, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes.
Stir potatoes, carrots, and onions into pot and simmer until meat and vegetables are tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Remove meat to rest; remove vegetables to a bowl. Slice meat and serve topped with vegetables and sauce.

Description: 
This dish takes the ordinary pot roast and transforms it into a delightful and delicious escape from the traditional meat and potatoes. It's a family favorite. Don't forget the crusty Italian bread for dipping! A traditional bruschetta goes well with this also. Although not included in recipe, you can add some cut green pepper with vegetables and throw in some sliced mushrooms for last 1/2 hour if you like. This is my recipe so feel free to make it yours.
