Description: 
This chunky, lightly sweetened and spiced spread is a nice change from plain cream cheese for your morning bagel.  It's also delicious on graham crackers, quick breads or as a dip for sliced apples or pears.  Make it even healthier by using fat-free cream cheese and milk - it's just as delicious!
