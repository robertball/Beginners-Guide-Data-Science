1 can tiny shrimp*

Directions:
Mix first 4 ingredients (electric hand mixer works best) until well blended.  Stir in shrimp gently (it crumbles easily.)  Chill for 2 hours or overnight is better, stir before serving.

Description: 
A favorite appetizer we've had at Christmas since I was a child.  Great for office munch-days, I usually double the batch!
