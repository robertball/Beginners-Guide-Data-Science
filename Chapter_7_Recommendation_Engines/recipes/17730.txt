Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
6 eggs
1/8 cup milk
2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon Italian-style seasoning
6 (3/4 inch thick) center cut pork chops

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the flour in a bowl. Combine the eggs and milk in a separate bowl, mixing together well, and then place the bread crumbs in another separate bowl. To the bread crumbs stir in the lemon pepper, parsley, garlic powder, dill and Italian-style seasoning.
Dip each chop into the flour, shaking off any excess flour, then dip into the egg/milk mixture, and, finally, dredge each chop liberally in the bread crumbs.
Lay the chops into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and pour water as needed into the dish, enough to just cover the bottom.
Bake for 40 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 20 more minutes.

Description: 
I usually prepare this recipe for 300 plus senior citizens where I work, but I've scaled it down for home use. The recipe is for freshly seasoned and breaded pork chops that come out nice and moist.
