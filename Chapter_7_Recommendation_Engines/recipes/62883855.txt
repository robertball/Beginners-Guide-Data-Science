Ingredients:
2 1/2 Cups (600ml) heavy cream (double cream)
1 Vanilla Bean Or 2 Tablespoons Of Vanilla Extract.
6 egg yokes
1/2 cup (120g) of white granulated sugar
1/2 cup (120g) demerara sugar (for the topping)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 248°F (120°C).
Place the cream, vanilla bean and seeds in a sauce pan over medium heat and bring to scalding point, then remove from heat. Remove vanilla bean and discard.
Whisk together egg yolks and caster sugar in a bowl for 2 - 3 minutes or until pale.
Pour hot cream over egg yolk mixture, continuing to whisk until well combined. Strain mixture in to a 4 cup measuring cup, evenly divide between 4 x 200ml ramekins.
Carefully place ramekins in a deep roasting pan lined with a folded tea towel. Pour boiling water in to pan to come half way up the sides of ramekins. Cover pan loosely with foil.
Bake in the oven for 40 minutes or until the custard has just set. Remove ramekins from the water bath, and set a side to cool.
Sprinkle demerara sugar evenly over the surface of the baked custards. Run a kitchen blowtorch over the custards, or place under a preheated grill until the sugar bubbles and caramelizes. Serve.
