Ingredients:
1 cup unblanched almonds

Directions:
Place almonds, 1/2 c at a time, into a clean coffee grinder or processor. Pulse several times until ground mixture resembles ground almonds.
1 cup whole almonds will grind down to 1 1/2 cups of ground almond meal/flour.
***If they are over-ground and too powdery, too much of their oils will be released, resulting in a powder that you can pack back together or if you go further, you'll end up with almond butter.  The latter two results will bring too much oily moisture to most recipes.
