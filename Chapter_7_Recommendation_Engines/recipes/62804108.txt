Ingredients:
12 oz Ronzoni Smart taste pasta (or whole wheat or low carb)
1 tsp olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1 lb Italian chicken sausage, removed from casing
1 medium head escarole, rinsed and torn into bite sized pieces
1/4 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
salt and fresh pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse escarole and tear into bite sized pieces.
Cook pasta in a large pot of salted water. Reserve 1 cup water before draining.
While pasta water boils, heat a large non-stick skillet on medium heat. Add olive oil; when hot add onions, peppers, garlic, salt and pepper.
Cook until soft, about 4-5 minutes.
Add sausage, breaking up with a wooden spoon and cook until golden, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Add escarole, cover and cook 2 minutes; remove the cover, stir and cook about 3 more minutes or until wilted. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
Add cooked pasta, red pepper flakes, reserved water and Parmigiano Reggiano, toss well and transfer to a large serving bowl. Serve immediately.
