Cut halibut into bite-size pieces. Place in a mixing bowl and combine with soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of flour. Let stand for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in deep-fryer or heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Deep fry halibut pieces until golden brown. Drain on paper towels; set aside.
