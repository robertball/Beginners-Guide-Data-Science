Ingredients:
2 eggs
kosher salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly sliced
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Beat eggs with salt and pepper in a shallow dish. Spread flour in another dish and bread crumbs in a third dish.
Working with one piece at a time, gently press chicken into the flour to coat and shake off the excess flour. Dip into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken in batches of 2 or 3 pieces until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer cooked chicken to a baking sheet and keep warm in preheated oven while cooking remaining chicken.
Serve with lemon wedges.
