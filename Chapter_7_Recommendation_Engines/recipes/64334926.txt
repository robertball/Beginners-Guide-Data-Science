1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp Mori-Nu Silken Firm Tofu
1/4 tsp Salt
1 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract

2 1/2 tsp Cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender, and blend until completely smooth.
Pour into any prepared crust. Bake 50 minutes, then remove from the oven.
Allow to cool for an hour before moving the cake, uncovered, to the refrigerator to set for at least 8 hours, during which time it will firm up and become more flavorful.
