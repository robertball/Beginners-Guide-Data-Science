6 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and chopped
6 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
1 hot banana pepper, seeded and chopped

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lemon, halved
2 1/2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Place peaches, red bell peppers, and banana pepper in a large pot.

Simmer until sugar dissolves and relish is slightly reduced, another 30 minutes.
