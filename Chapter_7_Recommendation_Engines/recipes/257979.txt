Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, unsifted
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup strong black coffee
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Combine sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Mix buttermilk, oil, coffee, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Pour over sugar mixture in the large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is smooth and thin, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
