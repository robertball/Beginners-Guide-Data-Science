Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 large lime, zested and juiced
1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup fresh basil, thinly sliced
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tbsp all purpose flour

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with liners.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in vanilla, lime zest and juice. Stir in Greek yogurt. Add half of the flour mixture and stir just until combined. Add in the remaining flour mixture, stirring until just combined--do not overmix. Fold in chopped basil.
4. Place blueberries in a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 tbsp flour. Toss to coat. Gently fold blueberries into muffin batter.
5. Fill each muffin cup 3/4 full with batter. Bake in preheated oven 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean. Cool in pan 1-2 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
