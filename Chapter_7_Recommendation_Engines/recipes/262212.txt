Ingredients:
1/3 cup dried morel mushrooms
4 slices chopped fully cooked ham
4 slices prosciutto
6 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 red onion, diced
1 (10 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes, drained and diced
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta, or more to taste
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place morels in a bowl. Cover with lukewarm water and soak for 30 minutes. Drain.
Place morels, ham, and prosciutto in a food processor. Grind to a coarse mixture.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the ham mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.
Stir tomatoes into the saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Fold cream into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and serve over linguine.
