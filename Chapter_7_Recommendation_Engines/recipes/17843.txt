Description: 
These are a soft, delicious, sugar cookie but with a hint of buttermilk. A friend of mine gave this recipe to me years ago and my family loves them so much that I have a hard time keeping them in the cookie jar! You can sprinkle the tops of these with a little granulated sugar just before baking or ice after completely cooled.
