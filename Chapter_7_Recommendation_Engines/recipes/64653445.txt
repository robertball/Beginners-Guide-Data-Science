Ingredients:
2-3lb bone-in pork shoulder (sometimes labeled as a “boston butt” or “pork butt”)
1 cup grape jelly
1 cup ketchup (we like Simply Heinz)
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Add pork to your slow cooker.
Combine jelly, ketchup, and allspice in a bowl, and then pour over pork.
Add lid to slow cooker and cook on “low” for 8-12 hours.  (The time will depend on the strength of your slow cooker.)
Remove pork from your slow cooker and separate the meat from bone with a fork.  (The meat should fall off the bone.)
Strain the juice left in your slow cooker and serve as a gravy with the meat.
Serve on sandwich buns with a side salad.  Yum!

Description: 
This slow cooker party pork recipe was inspired by the cocktail meatballs that are cooked with grape jelly and chili sauce.  The sauce combo is perfect  sweet, but not too sweet and super flavorful.
