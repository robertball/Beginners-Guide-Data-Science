Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup strawberry preserves
1/2 cup dry biscuit mix
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons cold butter
2 cups dry biscuit mix
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup milk
1 egg
1/3 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Cream together the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar in a bowl.
Shape the cream cheese mixture into a log, then wrap with plastic wrap and place in the freezer.
Place the strawberry preserves in a small bowl and freeze while preparing the remaining ingredients.
Place 1/2 cup biscuit mix and 2 tablespoons white sugar in a bowl.
Cut 2 tablespoons cold butter into the biscuit mix-sugar mixture with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; refrigerate crumb mixture.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Line 6 extra large muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk together 2 cups biscuit mix, 3/4 cup white sugar, milk, egg, and 1/3 cup of melted butter in a bowl.
Fill each prepared muffin cup half full of batter. Reserve remaining batter.
Divide the cold strawberry preserves evenly over the batter.
Cut the cold cream cheese log into 6 equal pieces, and place each piece on top of the strawberry preserves.
Top each muffin cup with remaining batter.
Sprinkle muffins with the crumb mixture and chopped pecans.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.
