Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2-3 green onions, sliced, including the green tops
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 - 10 oz. can refrigerated flaky biscuits (not the large ones)

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise and Parmesan cheese.  Stir in the onions and garlic; set aside.  Spray a cookie sheet lightly with non-stick cooking spray, making sure to cover the entire area.  Separate the dough into ten biscuits and place on the prepared cookie sheet.  Press or roll each biscuit into a 4 inch circle.  Spread the cheese mixture on top of  each biscuit to within 1/4 inch of the edge, dividing the mixture evenly among all the biscuits.  Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 13 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.

Description: 
I'm not a big fan of refrigerated biscuits or bread doughs, but I use this recipe quite often.  It's perfect when you're in a bind, or short on time, and need a bread or roll to go with dinner.  These pair well with soups, salads and entr√©es and are super quick and easy, and very tasty too!
