Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 teaspoons pepper
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
2 teaspoons garlic powder
6 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup whipping cream

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with pepper, salt, dill weed, and garlic powder.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place breasts in skillet, and increase heat to medium-high. Turn chicken frequently, until brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, until breasts are cooked through. Remove chicken to a warm serving platter, and cover with foil.
Return skillet to stove, and increase heat to high. Whisk in whipping cream, whisking continuously until reduced to sauce consistency, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour sauce over chicken, and serve.
