Ingredients:
8 Medium potatoes
1 tsp Salt
1/4 C Chopped celery
1/4 C Chopped red onion
1 Tbsp Chopped fresh dill or 1 1/2 tsp dried
2 Tbsp Chopped fresh parsley or 1 Tbsp dried
1/2 C Mayonnaise
1 Tbsp Fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste
4 Hard boiled eggs

Directions:
Peel and cut potatoes in 1" cubes. Place in large pot and cover with water, add salt and gently boil until potatoes are just tender, do not over cook. Drain and cool in cold water. Drain and let air dry for a bit.
Place potatoes in a large bowl. Add next 6 ingredients. Gently mix well.
Cut eggs into sixths and add to salad along with salt and pepper, gently incorporate.
If potato salad seems a little dry, add a touch more mayonnaise.
