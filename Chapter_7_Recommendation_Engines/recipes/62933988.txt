Directions:
Trim the flank steak of any excess fat, place in a zip-top bag, and place it in the freezer for 1  hour in order to firm up the meat (it is easier to slice).
Remove the steak from the freezer and thinly slice the meat with the grain, into long strips.
Place the strips of meat along with all of the remaining ingredients into a large, 1-gallon plastic zip-top bag and move around to evenly distribute all of the ingredients. Place the bag into the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours
remove steak strips and put it in your dehydrator for 2 to 3 hours, depending on the cut.

Description: 
Beef jerky is thought to have originated in South America during the 1550s. The Quechua tribe, who were ancestors of the ancient Inca empire, produced a meat similar to beef jerky called ch'arki, or charqui. It was made by adding salt to strips of muscle tissue from game animals such as deer, buffalo, and elk, and allowing them to dry in the sun or over fires for extended periods of time. This method of preparation enabled the people to preserve meats during times when it was readily available and eat it when food was scarce. It is also a dam good treat, men love it. This is my version.
