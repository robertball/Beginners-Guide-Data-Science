Ingredients:
2 cups flour (minus 1 tablespoon)
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream (plus 1 tablespoon)
1 tablespoon  baking powder
1/2 teaspoon    salt
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Put the 3 tbs of butter and 2 tbs of sugar into a bowl and microwave it for 1 minute.  Whip it with a fork until it's thickened (this takes a few minutes, but you'll see it eventually come together and look creamy).  Set aside.
Whisk your flour in the bag to lighten it before measuring.  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup and level off with a knife (do not tap or pack the measuring cup).  After measuring out 2 cups, remove one level tablespoon.
Add 1/4 cup of sugar, the baking powder, and the salt, and whisk together.
Pour in 1 1/4 cups + 1tbs of cold heavy whipping cream.  Mix the dough VERY GENTLY with a fork until it comes together.
Flour your hands and gently shape the dough into a ball.  Put the ball on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten it a bit.  Flour your knife and cut the dough into eight pieces.
Spread them out on the cookie sheet.
Spoon some of the butter/sugar topping over the tops of each scone and bake for about 15 minutes until golden brown.
Remove them immediately from the cookie sheet to waxed paper.

Description: 
These are my family's favorite scones.  They are unusual in that there is no butter or eggs in the dough.  You can add many things to the dough, but plain is my favorite!
