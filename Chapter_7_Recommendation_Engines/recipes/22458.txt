Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 cup quick cooking oats
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
In a small bowl, combine milk and oats; let soak for 15 minutes.
In a separate bowl, beat together egg and oil; stir in oatmeal mixture. In a third bowl, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir flour mixture into wet ingredients, just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups until cups are 2/3 full.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
