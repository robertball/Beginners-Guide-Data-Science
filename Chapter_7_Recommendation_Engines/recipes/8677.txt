Description: 
If desired serve with rice or noodles, pouring sauce from chicken over each serving. You can also cut down on calories by not dredging the chicken but just browning it in a roast pan (using cooking spray) on top of the stove, then adding the remaining ingredients as directed and roasting in the oven. It's good either way!
