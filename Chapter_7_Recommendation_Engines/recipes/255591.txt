Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds boneless beef short ribs, sliced across the grain in 1/8-inch thick slices
4 cloves garlic, finely crushed
1/4 cup grated yellow onion
1 tablespoon freshly grated gingerroot
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon light brown sugar, or to taste
1/3 cup freshly grated Asian pear
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for brushing skillet
2 cups hot steamed rice, or as needed
2 sliced green onion tops for garnish

Directions:
Mix garlic, grated onion, grated ginger, toasted sesame oil, brown sugar together in a mixing bowl. Stir in grated pear, soy sauce, and chile flakes.
Transfer meat to marinade and toss to coat on all sides. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
Season meat with salt and a drizzle of vegetable oil. Toss.
Brush a cast iron skillet with a little vegetable oil and place over high heat. When skillet is very hot, add beef in a single layer and cook until meat begins to caramelize around the edges and moisture begins to evaporate, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve over hot rice and top with green onion slices.

Description: 
In the best examples I've had of beef bulgogi in Korean restaurants, the meat, while tender, still had a little bit of chewiness to it.Â You can control texture by the thickness or thinness of the slices and how long you marinate them. But this is a fairly fast-acting marinade, so I go with an hour or two.
