Ingredients:
1 teaspoon chile oil
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large red bell pepper, chopped
3/4 cup red quinoa
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon chipotle pepper powder, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup frozen corn kernels (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes; add chopped red pepper and continue to cook and stir until slightly tender, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir quinoa with the onion mixture. Pour vegetable broth into the saucepan; season with chipotle pepper powder and cayenne pepper. Bring the broth to a boil. Cover the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
Stir black beans and corn into the quinoa mixture; simmer until the beans and corn are heated through, about 5 minutes more.
