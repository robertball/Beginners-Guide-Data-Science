Ingredients:
Salad:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup couscous
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
2 cups chopped tomatoes
2 red bell peppers, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 shallots, chopped
1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
Dressing:
3 lemons, juiced
1/4 cup curry paste (such as Patak'sÂ®)
4 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
Bring 2 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir couscous into the water. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, about 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork.
Combine quinoa, couscous, chickpeas, tomatoes, red bell peppers, celery, cranberries, pecans, shallots, parsley, and cilantro.
Combine lemon juice, curry paste, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, cumin, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Slowly pour olive oil into the blender while it is still running until dressing is emulsified. Pour dressing over quinoa-couscous mixture and toss to coat.
