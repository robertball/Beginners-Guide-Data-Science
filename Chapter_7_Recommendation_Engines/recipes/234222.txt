Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup roasted sunflower seeds
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Combine coconut, chocolate chips, oats, and sunflower seeds together in a separate bowl.
Stir sugar and butter together in a third bowl using a spoon to break up butter and create a paste with sugar. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into butter mixture using electric mixer on medium speed until light and creamy.
Beat coconut mixture into creamed butter mixture until mixture is evenly combined. Mix flour mixture into coconut-butter mixture until dough is just combined. Drop small spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
