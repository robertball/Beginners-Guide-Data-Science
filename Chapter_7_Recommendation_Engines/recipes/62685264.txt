Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup vegetable shortening
2 cups roasted, mashed, and cooled sweet potatoes
1 cup heavy cream (plus more if needed)
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and allspice. Cut in the shortening until crumbly.
Add the sweet potatoes and mix well with a wooden spoon.
Add the cream and pecans and stir until just moistened.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough to 1 1/2 inches thick. Cut out with a 2-inch floured biscuit cutter. Place biscuits 1-inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.
Serve warm or let cool on a wire rack until room temperature.
