Description: 
I was once served a curry crab appetizer that I loved, and searched all over the Internet looking for a recipe that was close. This is my own recipe created after not finding what I was looking for. It's a super easy crab dip, perfect as a last-minute appetizer served with your favorite crackers! My favorite are baked garlic and chive pita crackers.
