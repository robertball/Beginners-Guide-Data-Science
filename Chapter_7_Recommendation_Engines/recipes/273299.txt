Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 shallots, thinly sliced
1 large onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup fresh wood sorrel leaves, flowers and pods only
4 eggs
2 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (9 inch) pre-baked pie crust

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat butter over medium-low heat in a skillet. Cook and stir shallots and onion in butter until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt.
Increase heat to medium. Pour white wine into the skillet and cook until evaporated. Stir in flour. Add sorrel and stir constantly for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let cool.
While sorrel mixture is cooling, whisk together eggs, heavy cream, and black pepper in a large bowl.
Combine sorrel mixture with egg mixture, 1/2 Gruyere cheese, and 1/2 Parmesan cheese. Pour mixture into the prepared pie crust. Top with remaining 1/2 Gruyere cheese and 1/2 Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean and tart is firm, about 1 hour.
