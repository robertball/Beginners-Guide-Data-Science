Ingredients:
1 1/2  cups  gingersnap cookie crumbs (from about 30 cookies)
1/2  cup  finely chopped pecans
6  tablespoons  unsalted butter, melted
1/4  cup  sugar
FILLING:
3  8-oz. packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2  cup  packed light brown sugar
1/4  cup  sugar
2  large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature
1  cup  canned pumpkin puree
1/2  cup  sour cream, at room temperature
2  teaspoons  vanilla extract
1 1/2  tablespoons  all-purpose flour
2  teaspoons  pumpkin-pie spice
Topping:
1 cup sour cream
2 tsp sugar

Directions:
Make crust: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Butter an 8-inch springform pan. Cover outside of pan with 2 layers of foil. Stir together all crust ingredients. Press into bottom and up sides of pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Let cool on a rack.
Make filling: With an electric mixer on medium speed, beat cream cheese and both sugars until light. Beat in eggs and yolks, 1 at a time. Beat in pumpkin, sour cream and vanilla. Reduce speed to low; beat in flour and spice. Pour into crust.
Place cheesecake in a large roasting pan; fill pan with 2 inches of hot water. Bake until cake is set around edges but still slightly jiggly when lightly shaken (cheesecake will firm as it cools), 55 to 65 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature. Cover and chill for at least 10 hours or up to 2 days.
Mix sour cream and sugar for topping. Add with 5 minutes remaining to cook, optional
