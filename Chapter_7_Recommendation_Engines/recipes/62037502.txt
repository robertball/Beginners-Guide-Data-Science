Ingredients:
1 lb cucumbers
1 tbsp salt (if cucumbers arent firm)
2 tbsp butter
1/2 c chopped onion (bermudas work well)
black pepper
1/2 c sweet heavy cream, sour cream or yogurt
dill

Directions:
1. Peel cucumbers. Cut in half the long way and scoop out the seeds. Cut into 3/4 inch chunks. If the chunks arent firm, place in a colander and sprinkle with salt. Let drain 20 min (if they are firm you may omit this step).
2. Place butter in a medium to large skillet over medium heat. When it melts, add the onion and cook 5 minutes. Add cucumbers and cook another 5 minutes. Add black pepper to taste.
3. Turn heat to low and stir in cream or yogurt and plenty of dill. Stir, serve warm.
