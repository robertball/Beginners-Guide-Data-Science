Ingredients:
1 1/2 - 2 lb beef tri tip, sliced into thin strips against the grain
2 lg. red onions, peeled and cut in eight pieces
3 aj√≠ amarillo (Peruvian yellow chilis) OR
serrano chilis, seeded & diced
5 roma tomatoes cut in eighths
4 scallions, chopped
3 tbs soy sauce
1 1/2 tbs white wine vinegar
1 1/2 tbs oyster sauce
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tspn cumin
1/4 cup Beef Stock
2 tbs parsley, chopped
1/4 cup vegetable oil
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut and prep all vegetables and meat prior to heating pan.
Mix soy sauce, oyster sauce and vinegar and set aside.
Season meat with salt & pepper to taste.
Heat frying pan until steaming.  Pour in oil and wait until it is smoking hot.
Fry the meat until just cooked and the juices begin to release. Remove the meat from the frying pan.
Cook the onions in the same pan, with additional oil if needed until they are slightly dark and soft. Stir in aji (or serrano) peppers, and in 30 seconds add the garlic. In another 30 seconds, add tomatoes and cook until they are starting to soften but have not given off much juice. Add beef back into pan.
Pour in the soy sauce mixture, then add scallions & cumin. Pour in only enough beef broth to have a nice sauce for the meal without making it soupy. Allow a minute or so for simmering.
Season to taste with salt and pepper, sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

Description: 
Lomo Saltado is a dish of marinated steak, onions and tomatoes, sauteed to smoky, spicy goodness. It is usually served over white rice. One of the most popular recipes in Peru, it is traditionally served with french fries, as well. You may add them if you like.  I prefer to omit them. This recipe will serve 6-8 people.
