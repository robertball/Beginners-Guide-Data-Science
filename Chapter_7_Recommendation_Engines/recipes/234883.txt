Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped carrots
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
4 cups chopped kale (ribs removed)
1 teaspoon red curry paste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp
2 (8 ounce) cans chopped tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, carrots, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Pour chicken broth into the saucepan; add basil. Bring broth to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the basil seasons the broth, about 10 minutes.
Stir kale, curry paste, salt, and pepper into the broth; bring to a boil again, reduce heat to low, and simmer until kale softens, about 10 minutes.
Stir shrimp, tomatoes, kidney beans, and lemon juice into broth; cook at a simmer until shrimp is bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This soup is full of flavor and so healthy! You can adjust the heat by altering the amount of curry paste you use; a little goes a long way. A lemon wedge is the perfect garnish.
