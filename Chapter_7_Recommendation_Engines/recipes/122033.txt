Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and confectioners' sugar. Beat in vanilla. Gradually add flour. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until easy to handle. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make an indentation in the center of each. Bake at 350 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.
For filling, combine the sugar, cornstarch, lemon peel and salt in a saucepan. Stir in egg, lemon juice and butter until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat until thickened. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes longer. Cool. Spoon 1/2 teaspoonful into each cookie. Dust with confectioners' sugar if desired.
