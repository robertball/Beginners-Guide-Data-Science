Ingredients:
3 cups water
1 cup white sugar
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and sliced
4 small eggs

Directions:
Combine the water and sugar together in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; add the ginger slices and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Crack the eggs into individual bowls and gently drop them into the syrup. Cook the egg on one side until the white is partially set and opaque, about 3 1/2 minutes; gently turn over to cook the other side until egg white is opaque but not hard, and the yolk is still liquid, about 3 1/2 more minutes or to desired doneness. Spoon the eggs into individual bowls and spoon syrup over each egg. Garnish with the cooked ginger.

Description: 
Syrup spiked with ginger goes great with poached eggs. This is a very simple and luxurious dessert to spring on your guests. Try and find small chicken eggs, also known as pullet eggs. Normal-sized eggs will work as well.
