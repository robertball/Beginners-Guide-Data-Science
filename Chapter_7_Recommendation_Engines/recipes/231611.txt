1/2 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Line an 8-inch square dish with aluminum foil.
Stir chocolate and sweetened condensed milk together in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in microwave on High, stirring once or twice until chocolate is soft, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
Microwave fudge made with semi-sweet chocolate and sweetened condensed milk. This can be modified by omitting the nuts altogether and using different extracts in place of vanilla. We've also tried it with liquors. Always delicious!
