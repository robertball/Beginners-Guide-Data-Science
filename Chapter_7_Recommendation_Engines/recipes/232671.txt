Description: 
This relish is a super healthy way to get your veggies! You can easily make it a dip or play around with the chop size for an alternative to conventional salsa. I love it on fish tacos or a side dish with a light menu. Add herbs like parsley or cilantro for a different taste to suit your meal.
