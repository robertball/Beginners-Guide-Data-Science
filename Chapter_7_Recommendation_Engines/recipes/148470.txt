Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package medium pasta shells
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas, thawed
1/4 pound deli ham, diced

1/4 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Fill a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in the shell pasta and cook until the pasta is tender but firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Stir the peas, ham, Cheddar cheese, onion, mayonnaise, vegetable oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; add the cooked pasta and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour, or until completely chilled, before serving.
