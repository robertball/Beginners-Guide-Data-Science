Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup corn syrup
1 1/3 cups water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (1/4 ounce) packet unsweetened Kool-Aid powdered drink mix, any flavor

Directions:
Butter two large cookie sheets then set them aside.
In a 2 qt. saucepan, combine sugar and cornstarch.
Add corn syrup, water, butter, and salt.
Mix well before heating.
Bring mixture to boil on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit on the candy thermometer (hard ball stage).
Remove from heat, and immediately stir in the Kool-Aid powder.
Quickly pour onto prepared cookie sheets.
Let stand a few minutes, until cool enough to handle with your hands.
Grab a few helpers to pull the taffy with buttered hands until the taffy lightens its color and becomes firmer.
Roll taffy into bite-sized pieces.
Wrap individually in squares of wax paper.
