Ingredients:
2 lbs. pork loin
2 cloves garlic
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp dried rosemary
10-15 cranks fresh cracked pepper
½ tsp salt
2 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Combine the garlic, basil, thyme, rosemary, fresh cracked pepper, and salt in a small food processor, blender, or clean spice grinder. Pulse until the garlic is minced. In lieu of an appliance, the garlic can be minced by hand and the rosemary roughly chopped with a knife and then combined with the rest of the herbs and spices.
Add 2 Tbsp of olive oil to the herb mixture. Place the pork loin on a baking sheet covered with foil. Rub the oil and herb mix over the entire surface of the pork (including underneath).
Roast in the oven for 35-45 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees. Allow the pork loin to rest for ten minutes before slicing.

Description: 
If you haven’t quite honed your kitchen skills yet but you still need a recipe to impress, this is the recipe for you.  This is a basic herb rub that can be applied any number of meats. If you’re not into pork, try chicken breasts or even a beef roast. It’s simple yet oh so flavorful.  Be careful and  pay attention to the wording on the pork loin when you’re shopping. Pork tenderloin is a smaller muscle than regular pork loin. It’s leaner, more tender, but also about twice as expensive. So, keep an eye out.
