Ingredients:
6 large chicken breasts, pounded thin
1/2 lb Jack cheese, sliced thin
1/2 lb Swiss Cheese, sliced thin
1 lb mushroom, sliced
cracker crumbs
3 eggs, beaten with fork
flour
oil
1/2 C chicken stalk
1/2 c white wine

Directions:
Pound chicken breast very thin. On each breast place jack cheese, swiss cheese, and a few mushrooms. Fold each chicken breast in half and press edges togetheras best you can. Cover both sides with flour, dip in egg and then roll in cracker crumbs. Place in casserole and refrigerate for about 1/2 hour.
Remove from refrigerator and fry in oil until nice and brown on both sides. REmove from skillet and return to casserole. Put in the oven and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes. (Can be prepared in the morning and put in the oven before eating).
Drain oil from skillet and add chicken stalk and wine. Bring to a brisk boil and add remaining mushrooms. Saute 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 2 T butter. Use as a sauce over chicken. Sauce should boil long enough to reduce considerably.
