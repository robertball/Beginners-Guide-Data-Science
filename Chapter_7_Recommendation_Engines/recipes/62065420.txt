Ingredients:
2 loaves of Cocktail Rye bread (Light & Dark)
8 ounces of Buddig packaged Beef
8 ounces of Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Miracle Whip*

Directions:
stack the beef slices and cut lengthwise, then turn and cut again to make small diced squares. Add the cheddar cheese and stir in enough Miracle Whip to hold everything together. Place the little rye breads on a foil covered cookie sheet. Spread the breads with the beef and cheese mixture and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove to a serving plate and enjoy!
*Mayonnaise may be used instead of Miracle Whip, but it will alter the flavor.
