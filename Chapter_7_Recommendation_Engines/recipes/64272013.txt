Ingredients:
5 1/3 Cups (1lb, 8oz) White Whole Wheat Flour
1 Tbsp. Instant Yeast (or 1 packet active dry yeast)
1 Tbsp. Salt
1 Tbsp. Sucanat, Sugar or Honey
2 Cups (16 oz) Water

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together by hand or with a heavy duty stand mixer. If you are using active dry yeast you will need to proof it first with 1/4 cup of the water and 1 tsp. of the sugar. Allow dough to rest for 15 minutes. If the dough seems too dry or wet, adjust now with a bit more flour or water. Knead for 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes by mixer.
Cover and allow to rise approximately 1 hour, dough should double in size.
Punch down the dough, and shape into a circle or oblong loaf.
Cover and allow to rise again, approximately 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400°.
Bake for 30 minutes until nicely golden brown, or an internal temperature of 200°.
Notes
The amount of water necessary can vary depending on the season and your climate. Generally, if the air is dry (winter) you will need more water and if the air is moist (summer) you will need less.
The dough can take longer than one hour to rise if it is not in a warm spot.
