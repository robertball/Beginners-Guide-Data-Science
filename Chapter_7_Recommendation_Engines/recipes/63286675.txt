Ingredients:
1/3 cup finely chopped pecans
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tsp vanilla extract
Parchment paper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan for 6-8 minutes, or until toasted and fragrant, stirring halfway through.
In a medium bowl, mix butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually add flour, beating until just blended. Stir in pecans and vanilla.
Divide dough in half and shape each portion into 2 logs, about 1 1/4 inch thick, by 12 inches long. Wrap each log in parchment paper, cover and chill one hour, or until firm.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Slice logs into 1/4 inch thick rounds and place 1/2 inch apart on parchment lined baking sheets. Bake at 325 degrees for 18-20 minutes or until lightly golden. Let cool on baking sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
