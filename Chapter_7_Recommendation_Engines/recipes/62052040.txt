Ingredients:
For the crust: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks)unsalted butter or margarine, cut into pieces, softened
For the filling: 4 large eggs, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon grated lemon peel, 1/2 cup lemon juice
For cheesecake filling: 2-8 oz. pkgs. cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, 2 eggs.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F. Lightly butter a 9x13x2 baking pan.
For the crust, combine the flour and confectioners sugar in a medium bowl. Add the butter and stir or cut it in with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles course meal. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Bake until golden brown, about 15-18 minutes. For the lemon filling, whisk together the eggs, sugar, flour lemon peel and lemon juice in a medium bowl. Pour the lemon filling into the baked crust. Skim off any bubbles from the surface of the filling. Mix the cream cheese and sugar together until well incorporated. Beat the eggs separately, and add to the cream cheese. Mix well, then slowly pour over the lemon filling. As it bakes, the lemon will sink, and the cheesecake mixture will rise to the top.
Bake until the filling is set, about 30 minutes longer.
