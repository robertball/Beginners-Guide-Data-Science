Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds collard greens
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Trim the ends off of the collard greens where the stem is thickest. Stack leaves on top of each other and roll together. Cut greens into 1-inch pieces and rinse.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until it begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 5 minutes more. Add greens and saute over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, paprika, salt, and pepper; cook for 3 minutes more. Serve warm.

Description: 
This is a tasty way to use collard greens. The smoked paprika really lends a lot of flavor to this yummy side dish, so it's best not to substitute regular paprika. Makes a great side for any Southern-themed meal, especially for vegetarians!
