Ingredients:
10 1/2-ounces dark chocolate
8 (2 1/2-inch) aluminum tart tins
1/4 cup natural peanut butter
1 tbsp. butter
1 tsp. vanilla
1/4 cup icing sugar
2 tbsp. chopped peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Melt chocolate in double boiler over barely simmering water
Add about 2 tsp. of melted chocolate into aluminum tart tins. Swirl to thinly coat the tin about half way up. Transfer to freezer. Reserve melted chocolate
To make the peanut butter filling: Add butter, peanut butter, vanilla and salt to saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until mixture melts, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in icing sugar
Remove chocolate cups from freezer. To each cup, add 2 tsp. peanut butter filling and then cover with 1 tbsp. melted chocolate. Sprinkle each with chopped peanuts, if desired.
Put back in freezer to set the chocolate, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from tins and serve
