Ingredients:
3  green onions
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
½ teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
½ cup plum jam
½ cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Finely chop 2 tablespoons of green onions and set aside for the garnish. Cut remaining green onions into 1-inch pieces.
Toss chicken thighs with five-spice powder and salt in a bowl.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken thighs and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, leaving drippings in the skillet.
Cook green onion pieces in the drippings until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Stir in plum jam, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and return thighs to the skillet. Cook until syrupy, turning a few times to coat, about 5 minutes. Garnish with reserved green onions.
