Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1 cup hot milk
3 egg yolks, beaten
1/2 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellman's®)
1 pound fresh crabmeat
salt and pepper, to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon Old Bay® seasoning (optional)
3 egg whites, stiffly beaten
1 dash paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-1/2 quart baking dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour and cook about 5 minutes (reduce heat if mixture begins to brown). Slowly whisk in the hot milk and heat until mixture reaches a low boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and allow to cool at least 5 minutes (otherwise eggs will cook when added to the mixture).
Stir the beaten egg yolks into the cooled sauce. Blend in the mayonnaise. Add the crabmeat and season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and Old Bay(R) seasoning if using. Gently fold in the beaten egg whites. Pour into prepared baking dish. Dust with paprika.
Bake until browned and puffy, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
In southern Maryland we eat a lot of crab. This is an interesting way to use any leftover crab meat (we pick our own). I don't remember where I got this recipe. You can also use a good quality canned pasteurized crab meat. Either way, this recipe will wow your guests.
