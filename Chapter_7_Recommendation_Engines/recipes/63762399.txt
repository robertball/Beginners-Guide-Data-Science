Ingredients:
2 cups zucchini puree (approx 2 medium zucchini)
1 cup prunes
1/2 cup natural cocoa
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil (scant)
1t salt (I prefer kosher)
1 T vanilla
1 1/2t baking soda
1 1/2 cups Whole Wheat flour
1/2 cup All Purpose flour
1/2 cup walnut or pecan pieces (optional)
1 T Demerara Sugar
1/2 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F and spray a 13x9 baking dish with nonstick spray
In your high-powered blender or food processor, puree chunks of fresh zucchini until you have two cups of puree.  Add prunes until level of puree hits 3 cups, blend.  Add sugar, salt, vanilla and cocoa - blend until totally smooth.
In a seperate bowl, whisk flours and soda together. (If using nuts, stir them into the flour now as well.) Pour chcocolate mixture over and stir together as gently as possible.  Batter will be very thick.
Spread into prepared 13x9 pan and smooth as much as you'd like.  (This thick batter won't smooth much as it bakes.)  Sprinkle with Demerara sugar and white chocolate chips.
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes, until it just springs back when touched in the middle, or a toothpick comes out without crumbs.  Cool.  Devour.

Description: 
A great way to get more veggies into my little boy - and a tasty (nearly guilt-free) treat for me!  This is a combination of other brownie recipes I've read, with an eye to make it healthier: less oil and refined sugars, plus whole wheat flour!  By pureeing the zucchini and using prunes to get a dark, rich color - no one will ever know there's veggies in the brownies!  Who knew that gigantic zucchini would turn into Dessert?
