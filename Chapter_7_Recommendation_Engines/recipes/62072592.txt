Ingredients:

1 carrot, chopped

Directions:
In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add vegetables and cook and stir until they are brown.  Remove from heat for 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes, pour in whiskey.  Simmer over medium heat, scraping up any bits, until sauce is reduced to about 1/2 cup.  Add broth, tomato paste, rosemary, peppercorns and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for approximately 10 minutes to reduce to about 1-1/2 cups.  Strain sauce through a sieve to remove vegetables and herbs.  Return strained sauce to skillet.  In a small bowl, stir together butter and flour.  Whisk into sauce and cook stirring constantly until sauce is slightly thickened.

Description: 
To impress my guests, I fix this sauce and pour over veal scallopine or filet mignons and garnish it with a spring of rosemary.  I always use fresh rosemary for this, not dried.
