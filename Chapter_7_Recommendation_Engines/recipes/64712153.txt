Ingredients:
1 tsp. each...
dried parsley
Italian seasoning
onion powder
1/2 tsp. each...
paprika
thyme
black pepper

Directions:
Mix all herbs and spices in a custard cup or small prep bowl.
For best results, both rub the mixture inside the bird, and under the skin directly on the meat, saving about 1 tsp. to sprinkle on skin.  Rubbing the entire bird with softened butter before sprinkling the outside with the mixture will produce a beautiful, evenly browned skin.
