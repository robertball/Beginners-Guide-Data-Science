Ingredients:
1 2/3 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 pinch salt
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut, or more to taste
3/4 cup macadamia nuts, chopped
2/3 cup white chocolate chips
cooking spray

Directions:
Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a smaller bowl; whisk into the buttermilk mixture until blended. Do not overmix batter.
Squeeze juices out of the pineapple using a paper towel. Place pineapple, coconut, macadamia nuts, and chocolate chips in individual small bowls.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Pour in 1/3 cup of batter for each pancake. Sprinkle a portion of pineapple over the wet batter in the skillet. Scatter some coconut, nuts, and chocolate on top. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
