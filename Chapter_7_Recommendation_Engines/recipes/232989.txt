Ingredients:
1 gallon oil for frying, or as needed
3 pounds chicken wings and drummettes
Â½ cup unsalted butter
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley <sup>&reg;</sup>anch(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry chicken wings in small batches in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Assure oil reaches 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) between batches.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir hot sauce, ranch dressing mix, and vinegar into the melted butter.
Put cooked chicken wings in a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over wings and toss to coat.

Description: 
This is a recipe I learned from a very good friend, and every time I make it there isn't a wing left over. Always a 5-star with friends and family. You can tweak the recipe how you like. Less butter gives you a thicker sauce. I prefer a thinner sauce.
