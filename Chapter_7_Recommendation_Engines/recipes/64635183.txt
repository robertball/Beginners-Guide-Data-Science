Ingredients:
1/2 cup plain greek yogurt (usually i make my own lactose and sugar free greek yogurt but store bought is just fine)
2 1/2 tsp sugar (or you can substitute for stevia or a stevia/sugar blend)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Add all ingredients into a small bowl and stir well making sure that the sugar doesn't accumulate at the bottom. The sugar must get incorporated into the mixture. Serve,Â  or stir put into reusable food pouches for your toddler later

Description: 
My toddler loves this and calls it ice cream even though its just Greek yogurt. I like serving it to her as I can regulate the amount of sugar. 2 tsp of sugar is, I believe close to the daily amount for a toddler so usually its the only sugary food i give her in a day. I wouldnt feed my toddler ice cream because it just isnt healthy for her. So this yogurt is a great substitute for that. Also, my toddler is lactose intollerant  and usually this yogurt helps her digestion if i stir a capsule of lactase/probiotic blend into the yogurt.  I use Schiff Digestive Advantage capsules.
