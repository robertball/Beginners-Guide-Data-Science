Ingredients:
4-5 boneless skinless chicken breasts (approx 2-1/2 to 3 lbs)
1-1/2 large white onions, thinly sliced
4-5 clove garlic, minced
1 can rotel (tomatoes with chiles)
10 dried guajillo peppers, stems and seeds removed
3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon cumin
salt and pepper to taste
For serving:
1 package tostadas
1 16oz mexican crema, may sub sour cream
1/2 cojita cheese
1-1/2 cups shredded lettuce
1 avocado, pitted and sliced into peices
3 limes, quartered

Directions:
In pot place chicken breasts and cover with water.  Add chicken bouillon.  Cook chicken until no longer pink, about 20-30 minutes.
In hot water (not quite boiling) place chiles, cover and let soak about 15 minutes.  Once chiles are tender place them into the blender. Add garlic, rotel, cumin and chipotle peppers.  Blend until smooth, add water from chiles to get desired consistency.  I add about 1/2 cup. Set aside.
Once chicken is done, remove chicken and reserve liquid.  Shred chicken and place into new pot.  Add the sliced onions and chile sauce.  If sauce is to thick add the chicken broth 1/4 cup at a time.  Simmer for 20-30 minutes until onions are tender. Salt and pepper to taste.
To serve place a couple spoonfuls of tinga onto a tostada shell.  Top with cojita cheese, shredded lettuce, cream, avocado strips and a squirt of lime juice.

Description: 
I had relatives living with me a short period of time and they taught me how to make tinga.  It can be make with chicken or pork.  The smoky flavor of the peppers just right.  Add your favorite toppings.
