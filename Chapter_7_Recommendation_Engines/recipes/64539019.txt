Ingredients:
2 large romaine hearts, washed and chopped
1 cup pulled cooked chicken breast
1 (15.5 oz) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 cup grape tomatoes, sliced in half
3/4 cup sweet corn (I grilled mine)
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
1/3 cup cilantro, washed and chopped
1 small avocado, diced
1/2 cup BBQ dressing, if desired

Directions:
In a large bowl add lettuce, top with all ingredients except for avocado and BBQ dressing. Toss salad gently.
Place into cold salad bowls. Garnish with diced avocado and drizzle with BBQ dressing if desired.
Serve with low-fat corn tortilla strips.
Note: To make vegan omit chicken and goat cheese. Add in roasted diced red peppers for more flavor.
You may you any dressing you like. Sometimes I like adding 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and find that I don't need any dressing at all.
