Ingredients:
1 pound spicy ground pork sausage
1 onion, diced
1 (2 ounce) package dried beef, shredded
1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained and minced
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon garlic salt
2 quarts oil for frying
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups milk
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 cups seasoned bread crumbs

Directions:
Place spicy ground pork sausage, onion and dried beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until sausage is evenly brown and onions are soft, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Mix sauerkraut, prepared mustard, parsley, cream cheese and garlic salt with the sausage mixture. Cover and chill in the refrigerator approximately 2 hours.
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place flour in a small bowl. Blend milk and egg together in another small bowl. Place seasoned bread crumbs in a medium bowl.
Roll the chilled sausage mixture into 1 inch balls. Dredge sausage balls one at a time in flour, the egg and milk mixture and the bread crumbs.
In small batches deep fry sausage balls in the preheated oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve warm, or freeze for later use.
