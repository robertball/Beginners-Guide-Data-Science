Ingredients:
2 Russet potatoes, each cut into 6 equal wedges
olive oil
1 tablespoon herbes de Provence
1 pinch paprika, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.
Toss potato wedges, olive oil, herbes de Provence, paprika, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until potatoes are evenly coated. Place wedges on their sides onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Flip potatoes onto their other sides; return to oven and cook until crusty and golden brown, about 20 minutes more.

Description: 
Simple and delicious. The key is tossing the spices with the potatoes and oil in a bowl and then on to the pan. The silicone mat we are baking on is a very nice thing to have in your kitchen.
