Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container lowfat vanilla yogurt, no gelatin added
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup HERSHEYÂ®'S Cocoa Powder
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup lite frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
YOGURT CHEESE:  Use one 8-oz. container vanilla lowfat yogurt,  no gelatin added.  Line non-rusting colander or sieve with large piece of double thickness cheesecloth or large coffee filter; place colander over deep bowl.  Spoon yogurt into prepared colander; cover with plastic wrap.  Refrigerate until liquid no longer drains from yogurt, about 24 hours.  Remove yogurt from cheesecloth and place in separate bowl; discard liquid.
Stir together sugar and cocoa in small microwave-safe bowl.  Add water; stir until well blended.  Microwave at HIGH (100%) 45 seconds to 1 minute or until mixture boils.  Stir well.  Cool slightly; stir in vanilla.
Stir cocoa mixture into yogurt cheese in medium bowl; fold in whipped topping.  Spoon into individual dessert dishes.  Refrigerate about 1 hour.  Garnish with whipped topping and fruit, if desired.
