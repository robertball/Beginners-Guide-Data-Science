Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
1 cup quick-cooking steel-cut oats
2 apples, cored and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 1/2 teaspoons organic maple syrup, honey or agave nectar
1/3 cup chopped pecan or walnuts, toasted

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine the almond milk, 1 cup water, and the oats.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
White the oatmeal is cooking, in a small saucepan, place the apples, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of maple syrup, and 1 tablespoon of water.  Cook over medium heat until the apples are softened and the liquid has reduced to a syrupy consistency, 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in the pecans and cover to keep warm
Stir the apples and nuts into the cooked and rested oatmeal.  Divide among four bowls.  Drizzle 1 teaspoon maple syrup over each bowl and serve.
