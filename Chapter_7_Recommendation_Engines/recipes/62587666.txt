Ingredients:
2 large boneless skinless breasts
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp pepper
1 tbsp butter or olive oil
2 shallots, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 cup thinly sliced button mushrooms
1 cup frozen spinach, thawed and drained
1/4 tsp seasoned salt
1/4 tsp pepper
2 tbsp herb and garlic cream cheese
1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar
4 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375.
Slit the chicken breasts down one side with a sharp knife, not quite all the way through.  Open the breasts up, and pound with a mallet or rolling pin until about 1/2 inch thick.  Season both sides with sea salt, garlic powder, paprika and pepper.  Set aside.
In a large skillet, heat butter or olive oil over medium high heat, and saute the shallots, garlic, mushrooms and spinach.  Season with seasoned salt and pepper.  Allow to cool slightly, and add the cream cheese and grated cheddar.
Fill each breast with half of the stuffing mixture, and fold over.  Secure edges with toothpicks.  Wrap two slices of bacon around each breast, and place on a rack over a foil-lined pan.  Bake for 45 minutes, then turn on the broiler to crisp up the bacon.  Enjoy!

Description: 
I always find those huge boneless skinless breasts to be somewhat uninspiring to me....so I stuffed 'em with flavors I love and covered 'em with bacon!
