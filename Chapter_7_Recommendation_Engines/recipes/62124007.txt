Ingredients:
1 Stick Butter Room Temperature
5 Cloves Garlic Minced
Red Pepper Flakes
Grated Parmesan Cheese
Chopped Fresh Parsley or Dried
1 Loaf French Bread

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400  degrees. In a bowl mix garlic and butter.  I use butter that has the salt added.  Make sure the butter is room temperature so it will be easy to mix.
Take the French bread and cut the loaf down the middle with a serrated knife.
Spread the butter and garlic mix on top of each piece of French bread.   You can determine the amount of Red Pepper Flakes, Parmesan Cheese, and Parsley your want to add.
Place the French bread in the oven on a cookie sheet uncovered.  Let the bread get brown and crunchy.  (Usually about 10-12 mins)
Serve Hot or once cooled you can wrap in aluminum foil.  Do not wrap until cooled or the bread will turn soggy.
