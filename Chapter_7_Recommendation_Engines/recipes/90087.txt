Ingredients:
1  lime, zested and juiced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 (10.5 ounce) can chicken broth
4  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon anchovy paste (optional)
½ teaspoon white sugar
½ teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2  shallots, chopped

Directions:
Place the lime peel, soy sauce, and chicken broth in  a skillet over medium heat. Place the chicken breasts in the skillet, and bring to a boil. Cover, and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Shred chicken, and set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk together lime juice, olive oil, anchovy paste, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Stir in garlic, cilantro, shallots, and chicken. Mix well.

Description: 
This is my twist on a recipe I found for the traditional chicken salad but without the mayo! It's best served in a wrap with lettuce and tomato or over your favorite green salad. I have found it's also very easy to make even lighter by using fat-free broth, lite soy sauce, and sugar substitute - none of which affects the taste!
