Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds thick sliced bacon
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
12 eggs
1 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried dill

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserving 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon and set aside.
Cook and stir onion and bell pepper over medium heat in reserved drippings until tender, about 5 minutes; remove with slotted spoon.
Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Fold hash browns, Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, dill, onion mixture, and crumbled bacon into egg mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
