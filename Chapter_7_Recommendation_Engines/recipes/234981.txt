Description: 
This fresh and satisfying vegetarian salad keeps well and never fails to please. Wholesome, delicious, and company-worthy. A very pretty salad that can be made up in a hurry. Makes great leftovers and improves with longer marination. If marinated tofu is stored separately, this makes a fantastic and filling boxed lunch choice. Try adding a can of drained, flaked white tuna for variety.
