Ingredients:
8  ounces  packaged dried mostaccioli or cavatelli
1  14-1/2-ounce can  Italian-style tomatoes
1/2 of a  6-ounce can (1/3 cup)  tomato paste
1/4  cup  dry red wine or water
1/2  teaspoon  sugar
1/2  teaspoon  dried oregano, crushed
1/2  teaspoon  dried thyme, crushed
1/4  teaspoon  pepper
1  pound  ground beef
1    medium onion, chopped (1/2 cup)
1  clove  garlic, minced
1/2  cup  sliced pimiento-stuffed green olives
1  cup  shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain pasta; rinse with cold water. Drain again.
In a blender container or food processor bowl combine undrained tomatoes, tomato paste, wine or water, sugar, oregano, thyme, and pepper. Cover and blend or process until smooth. Set aside.
In a large skillet cook ground beef, onion, and garlic until meat is brown. Drain fat. Stir in tomato mixture. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in pasta and olives.
Divide the pasta mixture among six 10-ounce casseroles. Bake in a 375 degree F. oven for 15 minutes. (Or, spoon all of the pasta mixture into a 2-quart casserole and bake for 30 minutes.) Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Bake 5 minutes more or until heated through.
