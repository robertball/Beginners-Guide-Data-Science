Ingredients:
1 lb asparagus, trimmed
Cooking spray
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped whatever (for mine I use carrots, celery, tomatoes, mushrooms, potato)
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 teaspoon (sea) salt
ground white pepper and cumin to taste
1/2 cup shredded basil leaves, cilantro, garlic, green and red onion
7 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup cold water
3/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
Cut off asparagus tips; microwave on high for 1 minute.  Set the tips aside for later use.  Cut remaining asparagus stalks into 1-inch pieces.
Coat a large ovenproof saute pan with cooking spray and add olive oil to pan.  Heat over medium heat.  Add asparagus stalks, vegetable medley, and bell pepper; cook for 2-3 minutes, or until asparagus is crisp tender.  Sprinkle with salt and basil, etc.
Blend eggs and water; pour into the pan.  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan.
Arrange asparagus tips over the eggs, and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan.
Cook over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, or until almost cooked through.
Place in the oven for another 5-10 minutes, or until puffed and golden.
Makes 6 servings.
