Description: 
I've been drinking cosmopolitans for 5 years, and you rarely find a bartender who can make one correctly. My favorite bartender is quitting and has finally let me in on her secret. Grand Marnier. Who'd have thought? I realize it is expensive, but if you want the best, you have to pay for it. This recipe will make an addict out of you. Not so sure that's a good thing - but one thing is for sure - this is the best cosmo you will ever taste in your entire life. Period!
