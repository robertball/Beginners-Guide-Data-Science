2. Spread panko crumbs out on waxed paper, salt & pepper chicken breast if desired.
3. coat both sides of chicken with panko crumb and place on cookie sheet

Description: 
This is one of the easiest recipes I know. For some reason I get the most compliments on this recipe over any other. Delicious juicy chicken with a crunchy coating.
