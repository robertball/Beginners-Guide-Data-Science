Description: 
My family loves popovers and I enjoy making them for them.  We all so the popover dance together.  I had some fresh asparagus and my Lodge Cast Iron pan was on the stove already to sauté them.  Last minute I decided to create a large popover and I was so happy that everyone just loved it.

I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my family did!  xo Cindy

Note:  My pan is 12 inches and this recipe was developed to fit this pan.  I you have the 10 inch pan you will want to alter the recipe.
