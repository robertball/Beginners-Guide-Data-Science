Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and flavorings until well blended. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the egg mixture to form a heavy dough. Don't add more flour - remember you're making cookies, not bread!  Divide dough into two pieces. Form each piece into a long flat roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack. Let the cookies cool just enough to handle (3-5 minutes), slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices cut side up back onto the baking sheet. Bake for about 6 to 10 minutes, turn each piece and bake for another 4 minutes. Slices should be lightly toasted.  Cool on a wire rack.
