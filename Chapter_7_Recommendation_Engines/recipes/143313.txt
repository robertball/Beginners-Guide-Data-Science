Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cracked coriander seed
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1 (1 pound) fillet fresh salmon
1 tablespoon melted butter
2 cups cooked white or brown rice
1 mango, peeled, pitted and diced
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon grated fresh lemon peel

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a shallow 9x13  baking dish.
Combine the coriander seed, brown sugar, and lemon-pepper seasoning in a small bowl, and blend well.
Place the salmon fillet skin side down in the prepared baking dish. Brush top and sides of fillet with the butter. Sprinkle the fish evenly with the coriander spice mixture, gently pressing it into the fish.
Stir the mango, cilantro, and lemon peel into the rice. Spoon the rice mixture around the fish in the baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2 inch thickness. Cut the fish into 4 pieces. Divide rice between 4 serving plates and place the fish on top.
