Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 lb. chorizo or andouille sausage, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
1 glove garlic, minced
8-canned whole green chilis (the small cans hold about 3 chilies each)
6 ozs monterey jack cheese, cut in fingers to fit inside chiles
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup flour
1 tsp salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.  Saute the sausage in oil until browned.  Remove sausage from pan, set aside and drain on paper towel.  Add onion to the same skillet and saute until translucent, add garlic and cook another minute. Place sausage back in pan and combine.  Open the chiles, which have been de-seeded, and put the cheese into each one. Lay the chiles in a greased casserole dish. Top chilies with sausage mixture.  In a blender add the eggs and the milk and salt, blend for a few seconds and then add the flour to make a batter,pour this over the stuffed chiles and sausage mixture.  Bake, uncovered about 30 minutes or longer until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove from oven and let stand to set for about ten minutes.  Service with mexican rice and beans.

Chili Rellenos are stuffed chilis served often in mexican cuisine.  They are traditional, but can be time consuming.  Therefore, I came up with this casserole so my family and I can enjoy them often without all the work.  This casserole is truely unforgetable and one of our favorites.  Hope it is one of yours too.
