Ingredients:
3/4 cup sugar
4 large eggs
1 3/4 cups water
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
Sugar Garnish (optional):
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
Ice

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook sugar in heavy skillet over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until melted and caramel-colored. Carefully pour into 8 (6 oz.) ungreased  custard cups, tilting to coat bottom completely.
Beat eggs in medium bowl; stir in water, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and salt. Pour into prepared custard cups; set cups in larger shallow pan. Fill larger pan with 1 inch of hot water.
Bake 25 minutes or until knife inserted near center comes out clean. Move cups from larger pan to a wire rack; cool 1 hour. Chill several hours or overnight.
Serve by loosening side of flan with knife; invert onto individual serving plates with rim. Top with Sugar Garnish, if desired, or garnish as desired.
Sugar Garnish: Fill medium metal bowl half-full of ice. Combine sugar with water in medium saucepan; stir. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook over high heat 5 to 6 minutes or until light brown in color. Immediately put pan in ice for 1 minute. Carefully drizzle sugar decoratively over foil lined cookie sheet. Cool. To serve, peel from foil.
