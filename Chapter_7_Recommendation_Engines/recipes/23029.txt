Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
4 tablespoons butter
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups bread flour
3 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup bread flour
1/4 cup butter
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the 4 tablespoons butter; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.
Pour milk mixture into bread machine pan. Add 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract, 4 cups bread flour,  yeast and salt. Choose Dough setting; press start.
When dough is finished mixing,  leave it in the bread machine pan and cover with a towel. Let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 brown sugar and 1/3 cup flour. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; set aside. In a separate bowl, beat together 1 egg and 1 tablespoon water.
Brush loaves of risen bread with the egg wash and then sprinkle on crumb topping. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.

Description: 
This is a sweet bread that makes wonderful chicken or turkey sandwiches.  This recipe was given to me by a good friend in South Carolina that I met on the Internet. I had the pleasure of eating this bread at her beach home this spring. It makes awesome toast. We can hardly wait to cut it.
