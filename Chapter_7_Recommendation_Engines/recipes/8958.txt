Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups chicken broth
½ teaspoon dried basil
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
1 (16 ounce) package wide egg noodles

Directions:
In a medium skillet, saute chicken breasts over medium high heat for about 10 minutes, or until browned. If the chicken sticks at all, you can add a little of the broth. When chicken is browned, remove from skillet and cut into 1 inch cubes. Sprinkle with garlic powder.
In the same skillet heat the broth, basil, pepper and vegetables. Bring to a boil. Stir in the uncooked noodles and return the chicken to the skillet. Reduce heat to low. Cover skillet and simmer all together, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until chicken meat is no longer pink and noodles are soft. Serve.
