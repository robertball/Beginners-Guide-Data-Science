Ingredients:
2 (3 to 3 1/2 pound) domestic whole ducklings, dressed

1 pound smoked sausage, cut into 1/2 inch slices

Place the ducks in a slow cooker, fill with enough water to cover, and cook on Low until juices run clear, about 8 hours. Remove, reserving 3 cups of duck broth, and debone, discarding bones.
Place the water and 3 cups of duck broth into a slow cooker. Add the tomatoes, garlic, onion, celery, bell pepper, bay leaves, and gumbo base mix. Cook on High until the mixture boils. Reduce heat, and stir in the duck meat, okra, shrimp, and sausage. Cook until thickened, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
I created this gumbo using wild duck, however any type of poultry may be used as a substitute. Serve the gumbo hot over rice. It's a great meal on a cold Arkansas winter day.
