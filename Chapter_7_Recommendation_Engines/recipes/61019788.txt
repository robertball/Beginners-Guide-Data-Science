Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine
2 eggs
1 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x9 inch pan or line a muffin pan with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugar and butter. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine flour and baking powder, add to the creamed mixture and mix well. Finally stir in the milk until batter is smooth. Pour or spoon batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 30 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven. For cupcakes, bake 20 to 25 minutes. Cake is done when it springs back to the touch.

Description: 
This cake recipe is very simple and basic but bakes up into a very dense and moist cake.  I cut the cost of the original recipe by substituting margarine for the butter and reducing the amount of sugar and milk.  It makes great cupcakes.Modified from: Simple White Cake
