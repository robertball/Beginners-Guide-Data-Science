Description: 
A paleo-friendly entree that is quick and easy! It's a perfect summer recipe. The paleolithic diet is low-carb, dairy-free, and soy-free. I serve this with pineapple rings and other fruit. I also like to put a little unsweetened shredded coconut over the hash. This would also be good topped with a fruit chutney or a fruit puree. Goes great with green beans or broccoli.
