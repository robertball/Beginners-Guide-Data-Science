Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs ground venison
1 medium onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1/2 tsp chopped bay leaves
1/2 tsp red chili flakes
pinch of dried rosemary
3 14 1/2 ounce cans diced tomatoes
2 10 3/4 ounce cans condensed tomato soup
3-4 soup cans of water
1 40 ounce can of chili hot beans
1/4th jar of chili powder
2 TBSP hot sauce
2 cups dry macaroni noodles

Directions:
Cook venison, onion, green pepper, chopped bay leaves, red chili flakes and rosemary over medium heat until brown.  (You may need to add a little oil or water to this as the venison is so low in fat).  Drain if necessary.  Add diced tomatoes, tomato soup, water, chili hot beans, chili powder, hot sauce and macaroni noodles.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 - 45 minutes.  Serve.  Garnish with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream if desired.

Description: 
My husband created this recipe after much experimenting and it is wonderful!  We have this often in the winter and constantly have requests for the recipe.  If you have venison on hand, please try it!  You can also use ground beef in place of the venison.  The macaroni noodles will cook in the chili.
