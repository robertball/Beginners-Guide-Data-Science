Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup pumpkin puree (I use Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin)
1/3 cup honey
4 Tbsp melted butter
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground ginger
2 1/2 cups almond flour
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.
Line a muffin pan with paper liners.
In a large mixing bowl, use an electric beater to thoroughly combine all ingredients EXCEPT almond flour, walnuts, and raisins.
Stir in almond flour until well combined.
Stir in walnuts and raisins.
Spoon batter into muffin cups, using wet fingers to press down any bumps on the tops before baking.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean.
