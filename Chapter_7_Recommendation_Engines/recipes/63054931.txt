Ingredients:
Garlic Paste:
12 large garlic cloves
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 to 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 pork picnic shoulder (about 7 pounds)

Directions:
Add all ingredients to form a paste, add more or less red wine vinegar, it should be paste like not watery.
With a paring knife, cut deep slits into the exposed fleshy ends of pork shoulder.
Push some of the paste into the pockets with your fingers. Loosen the skin in several places and spread the rest of the paste underneath the skin and then over the surface of the roast where there is no skin. Wrap the roast in foil and refrigerate for 25 to 48 hours. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Unwrap the roast and place on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast to an internal temperature of 185°F, about 4 to 4 1/2 hours, brushing the skin every 15 to 20 minutes with cold water to keep it soft. Remove the roast to a cutting board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let stand for 20 minutes.

Description: 
The best Pork recipe I have ever come across, it initially calls for a Picnic Shoulder, but I've made due with basic Pork Tenderloins or Roast, but the bone in roast is really nice!  It is a bit hot, so I've been told, lol, so people with heartburn take a Zantac before you eat!!
