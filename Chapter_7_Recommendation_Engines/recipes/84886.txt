Ingredients:
¼ cup vegetable oil for frying
¼ cup cornstarch
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cut into strips
2 tablespoons soy sauce
½ cup orange juice
¼ cup warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon chili paste
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2  carrots, sliced

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Place the 1/4 cup cornstarch in a dish; press tofu slices in the cornstarch to coat on all sides. Stir-fry in the wok 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides. Drain tofu on paper towels. Allow wok to cool, and wipe clean.
In a bowl, mix the soy sauce, orange juice, water, sugar, chili paste, and cornstarch until smooth.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the wok, and stir-fry the carrots until tender. Form a well in the center of the carrots, and pour in the sauce. Bring sauce to a boil. Mix tofu into the wok, and continue cooking until coated with the sauce.
