Ingredients:
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
4 tablespoons (half a stick) butter, softened
1 4-oz jar pimentos, drained
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon sugar, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Beat shredded cheese, mayonnaise and softened butter in a medium mixing bowl with a mixer on low speed until well-blended. Add pimentos, garlic, salt and sugar; mix to combine. Stir in pecans.
This can be served immediately, but for best results, cover mixing bowl (or a smaller bowl, if you desire) with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to allow flavors to combine, approximately one hour. Cheese spread will harden in the refrigerator; allow to stand at room temperature for about half an hour to reach spreadable consistency.

Description: 
Pimiento cheese spread is one of those Southern comfort foods that doubles as a really delicious appetizer. If solace is what you're seeking, use the spread to make a sandwich on white bread, or grill it Ã  la grilled cheese. If an appetizer is what you need, put it in a bowl and serve it on toast points or with crackers and celery sticks.
