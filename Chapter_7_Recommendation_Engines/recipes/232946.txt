Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegan butter
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 cup almond milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Cut vegan butter and coconut oil into flour mixture using a fork until crumbly; stir in almond milk until just combined. Drop batter onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are soft and lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
These vegan biscuits are quick, easy, and fluffy. They use all whole wheat flour. I couldn't find a biscuit recipe online that met all of these criteria - so I made one up!
