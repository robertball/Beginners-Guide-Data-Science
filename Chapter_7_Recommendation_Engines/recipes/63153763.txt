Ingredients:
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks
1 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, diced
1 large bell peppers, diced
1 (6 oz) can tomato paste
1 (16 ounce) can coconut milk
1 TBSP fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Stir together the lime juice, cumin, paprika, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Add the tilapia and toss to coat.
Cover and refrigerate at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours.
When marinade is completed and fish is ready to prepare, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Quickly fry the onions in the oil 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add the bell peppers, tilapia, and tomato paste and coconut milk to the pot and stir.
Cover the pot and simmer 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the cilantro and continue cooking until the tilapia is completely cooked through, another 5 to 10 minutes.
