Ingredients:
4 large fresh artichokes
4-6 cloves of garlic, pealed and sliced into thin strips
1 lemon, slice a piece off and reserve, juice remainder
3 cups of bread crumbs
1/4 cup of shredded Parmesan
1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley
dash of black pepper
1/2 tsp of garlic powder
extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

Directions:
1. Fill up a bowl with water and add lemon juice to it. Snip the pointed tips of artichoke leaves, and cut off the stems at base. Keep Artichokes in water while cleaning. When finished cleaning, holding artichoke firmly by base, firmly rap the top of it on a hard surface; this will open it so it can be stuffed.
2. In a second bowl combine bread crumbs, Parmesan, parsley, dash of black pepper, and garlic powder. Mix together.
3. Take each Artichoke and insert the slices of garlic through out each Artichoke.
4. Holding the Artichoke with one hand start to stuff from the outside leaves to the center.
5. Place Artichokes in a pot that holds them snugly with about an inch- inch and a half of water with pieces of lemon floating in it. Drizzle the tops of each Artichoke with olive oil, soaking through.
6. Cover, leaving lid a-jar. Cook on low heat for 30-40 minutes, check by taking a speer and piercing through to Artichoke heart. If its still not fully cooked, check 5-10 minutes later. Serve and enjoy!
