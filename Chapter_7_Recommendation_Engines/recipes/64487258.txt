Ingredients:
Cooking spray or butter
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1/4 tsp almond extract
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups self rising flour
1/3 cup cocoa powder
2 cups finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
Kosher salt
1/8 cup Caramel candies (melted)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Liberally butter or spray 9x13 baking pan and dust well with powdered sugar.
In a large mixing bowl cream butter with sugars until sugars are completely dissolved.
Add eggs and extracts, mixing until just combined.
Sift and combine flour and cocoa.
Using a large wooden spatula or spoon, fold in 1 1/2 cups pecans and chocolate chips.  Fold in flour and cocoa, one cup at a time, until flour is just incorporated.  Don't over mix.
Dump into prepared pan, spread evenly and top with remaining 1/2 cup chopped nuts, pressing gently over surface to even out batter.
On a cookie sheet and on middle rack, bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool on a rack for 10 minutes.
Drizzle with melted caramel and lightly sprinkle with kosher salt.
Allow to cool completely before cutting.
