Ingredients:
4 large Potatoes or
1 kg of Mash Potatoes
1 can (400 g) Stewed Tomatoes
15 g butter
5 ml Onion powder
5 ml Garlic powder
Salt and Pepper

Directions:
Boil your potatoes and mash, I like the skins so I do not peel them, or use instant mash potatoes works great. Keep the potatoes under medium heat, and stir in the liquid from the stewed tomatoes can to turn the color  of the potatoes red. Add the rest of the ingredients, and continue to heat until the consistency of potatoes you like, loose or firm.
