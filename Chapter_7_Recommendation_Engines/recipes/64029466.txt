Ingredients:
1 (4-serving) box vanilla instant pudding mix
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
1/2 cup cold water
1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups heavy cream, divided
1 loaf pound cake or angel food cake, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup toasted coconut, divided
1/3 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Combine pudding mix, lime juice, water, and sweetened condensed milk in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well and refrigerate a few minutes while you prepare the whipped cream.
Whip 1 cup cream in another bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into pudding mixture and then return mixture to refrigerator.
In a medium trifle dish or small, individual trifle dishes, spread a thin layer of pudding mixture. Add a layer of cake cubes, a thicker layer of pudding, and a sprinkling of coconut. Repeat, ending with a layer of pudding.
Whip remaining 1 cup cream with powdered sugar. Spread on top of final layer and garnish with remaining toasted coconut. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
