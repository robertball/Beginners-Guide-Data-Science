Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup finely diced onions
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
3 tablespoons tomato paste
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup pearled farro, rinsed, drained well
2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. Add onions and salt; cook and stir until onions have softened up and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, ancho chili powder, and chipotle chili powder; cook and stir about 1 minute. Add tomato paste; cook and stir about 2 minutes over medium heat. Add oregano and drained farro. Stir until farro is completely coated with the spice/butter mixture, about 2 minutes.
Pour in chicken broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. As soon as mixture starts to bubble, stir, and cover. Remove from heat.
Place pan in preheated oven and bake until farro is tender, 50 to 60 minutes. Fluff grains with a fork.

Description: 
I learned how to make Spanish rice at a Mexican restaurant where I worked part-time years ago. Here, we're substituting the 'ancient' grain of farro for the rice, and I think it's even easier to cook perfectly than rice.
