Ingredients:
1 lb. sweet potatoes, peeled
1 medium onion, grated
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 Tbsp. fresh parsley or chives, chopped
Sea salt and pepper
2 Tbsp. coconut oil, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees.
Grate sweet potatoes into a colander.
Use hands to squeeze out as much moisture from grated potatoes as possible (to prevent hash browns from being mushy). Squeeze them again inside a few paper towels, then transfer to a large bowl.
Add grated onion, eggs, and parsley or chives and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Divide into 8 equal portions and shape into round patties.
Heat half the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When it's hot and shimmering, but not smoking, add 3 or 4 hash brown patties.
Press down on them with a spatula until they're about 1 inch thick.
Fry until golden brown about 2-3 minutes, then flip and fry another 2-3 minutes.
Transfer cooked hash browns to oven-safe dish and keep warm in oven while cooking remaining hash browns in the rest of the oil.
