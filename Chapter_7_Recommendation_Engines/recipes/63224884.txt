Ingredients:
Cooking spray
12 lasagna noodles
1 cup soft herbbed cheese (such as Boursin or Alouette)
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 1/2 cups prepared tomato sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375F. Coat a shallow baking pan with cooking spray.
Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the herbed cheese, mozzarella, and basil. Mix well.
Arrange the lasagna noodles on a flat surface. Spoon a thin layer (about 1/4 inch thick) of the cheese mixture onto each noodle. Starting from one of the shorter sides, rolll up the noodles and secure with wooden picks. Place the rolls side-by-side in the prepared pan. Pour the tomato sauce on top and then sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cheese filling melts and the top is golden brown.

Description: 
I think lasagna rolls might be cooler than regular lasagna. Why? Because tey're easier to serve and they look better on your plate! I like to make tons of the rolls so I can have them handy in the freezer. As for the prepared sauce, use your favorite jarred tomato sauce.
