Ingredients:
1 (49.5 fluid ounce) can low fat, low sodium chicken broth
5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
4 carrots, peeled and diced
4 stalks celery, diced
1 small onion, diced
1 cup broccoli florets
1 (10 ounce) can fat-free cream of celery soup
1 (10 ounce) can fat-free cream of chicken soup
8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
8 ounces pepperjack cheese, shredded
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon parsley flakes
1 (14.5 ounce) can fat-free reduced-sodium chicken broth, or to taste

Directions:
Pour 49.5 ounce can chicken broth into a 5-quart pot; add potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions; bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, and cook until the potatoes are completely tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Gently mash potatoes into the soup to thicken to your desired texture.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil; add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.
Stir broccoli, celery soup, chicken soup, Monterey Jack cheese, pepperjack cheese, pepper, and parsley into the soup; add 14.5 ounce can chicken broth. Cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a creamy, cheesy soup that I created several years ago. It makes for a hearty main dish and is also the perfect side to a roast or ham. Although I normally try to stay away from the canned cream soups, I think they fit well in this dish. Of course, it's not the healthiest of recipes, but don't we all need to splurge every now and then?
