Ingredients:
1 frozen puff pastry sheet
4 tablespoons shredded cheddar
4 tablespoons diced ham
4 eggs
chives for garnish *optional*

Directions:
1. Unfold puff pastry sheet on a flat surface and cut into 4 squares.
2. Set the air fryer to 400 degrees. Place 2 squares in the basket and cook for 6-8 minutes.
3. Remove basket from the fryer. Take a metal tablespoon and press gently in the middle of each tart to form your hole.
4. Place a tablespoon of cheese and a tablespoon of ham in each hole and top each with a cracked egg.
5. Put the basket back in the fryer and cook for 6 minutes or until desired doneness. Remove from basket and let cool for 5 minutes.
6. Repeat with remaining two squares. Garnish with chives if desired.
7. Cook's note: The easiest and safest way to get your egg in the hole is to crack it in a small juice glass first and then pour it into the hole.
