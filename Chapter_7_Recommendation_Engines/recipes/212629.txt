Ingredients:
1 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm速 Puff Pastry Sheets
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's速 Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
2 eggs
1 teaspoon dried dill weed, crushed
1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Thaw the pastry at room temperature for 40 minutes. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until they're tender. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the spinach and cook until the liquid evaporates. Remove the skillet from heat and let it cool.
Beat the soup, eggs and dill weed in a medium bowl. Stir in the cheese and spinach mixture.
Unfold the pastry on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 13 x 9-inch rectangle. Place it in a 13 x 9-inch baking pan. Top with the spinach mixture. Roll out the remaining pastry sheet and place it over the spinach mixture. Cut 4 slits in the top of the pastry.
Bake for 25 minutes or until it's golden brown.
