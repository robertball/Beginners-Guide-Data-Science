Ingredients:
6 medium bell peppers
1 (10 ounce) package frozen riced cauliflower
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pound 93% lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, diced
2 medium carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
5 leaves fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
Slice tops off peppers and place peppers on a microwave-safe plate. Remove stems from pepper tops and discard. Dice flesh from pepper tops and set aside 1/2 of the diced peppers; save remaining diced peppers for another use.
Microwave peppers on high for 3 minutes until partially cooked.
Place frozen riced cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for 4 minutes, stirring halfway through.
Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot, about 1 minute. Add beef, mushrooms, carrots, celery, onion, and reserved diced peppers and cook until onions begin to turn translucent and beef is nearly cooked, about 5 minutes. Stir in Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper; cook for 1 minute. Add cooked riced cauliflower and garlic; stir and cook until beef is browned and crumbly, breaking up any chunks with a spoon, 2 to 3 more minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Add drained tomatoes, tomato paste, and fresh basil to the skillet and cook until nearly all liquid is absorbed, about 5 more minutes. Turn off heat and allow beef mixture to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
Stuff beef mixture evenly into peppers. Stand peppers upright in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender and filling is hot, about 30 minutes.
