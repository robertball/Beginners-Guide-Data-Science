Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 T instant dry yeast
4 T honey
3 1/3 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons butter, melted
4 T honey
2 tsp salt
2 1/3 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix warm water, yeast, and 4 T  honey.  Add 3 1/3 cups white bread flour, and stir to combine.  Let set for 30 minutes, or until big and bubbly.
Mix in 2 tablespoons melted butter, 4 T honey, and salt.  Stir in 2 1/3 cups whole wheat flour.  Flour a flat surface and knead with whole wheat flour until not real sticky - just pulling away from the counter, but still sticky to touch.    Place in a greased bowl, turning once to coat the surface of the dough.  Cover with a dishtowel.  Let rise in a warm place until doubled.
Punch down, and divide into 2 loaves.  Place in greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, and allow to rise until dough has topped the pans by one inch.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes; do not overbake.  Lightly brush the tops of loaves with 1 1/2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine when done to prevent crust from getting hard.  Cool completely
