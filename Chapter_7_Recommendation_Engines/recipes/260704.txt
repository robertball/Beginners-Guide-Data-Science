Ingredients:
1 pound Italian sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®), casings removed
6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, pressed
2 (32 ounce) cartons chicken broth
1/2 cup water
1 cube chicken bouillon (such as Knorr®)
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cups chopped cauliflower florets
3 cups stemmed and chopped kale
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the Italian sausage in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off grease and transfer sausage to a plate.
Cook bacon to the same pot until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and drain, leaving about 2 teaspoons of bacon grease in the pot. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Return sausage and bacon back into the pot; stir in chicken broth, water, and bouillon cube. Season with pepper and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Stir in cauliflower and simmer until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add kale and half-and-half; simmer until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.

Description: 
I was looking for a low-carb option of one of our favorite soups. The cauliflower soaks up the flavor and my hubby didn't notice that it wasn't potatoes!
