Ingredients:
1 cup frozen chopped spinach
1 (16 ounce) package gnocchi
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (8 ounce) package crimini mushrooms, quartered
3 stalks celery, diced
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans
1/3 cup french-fried onions
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
3/4 cup vegan pesto
1/2 cup vegetable broth

Directions:
Place spinach in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and microwave on high for 4 minutes. Separate with a fork and drain.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until warm. Add mushrooms and cook until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add celery, cover, and cook for 3 more minutes. Remove mushrooms and celery to a bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet. Add gnocchi and brown, flipping halfway through, 4 to 6 minutes. Add mushroom-celery mixture, cannellini beans, spinach, onions, wine, salt, and sage; simmer until heated through, about 3 minutes.
Mix together vegan pesto and vegetable broth in a small bowl. Pour into skillet over gnocchi and serve.
