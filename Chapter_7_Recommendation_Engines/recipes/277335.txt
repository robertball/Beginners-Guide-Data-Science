Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups fresh cranberries
3/4 cup orange juice
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted, cooled
1 egg
1 orange, zested
Glaze:
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon orange juice, or more as needed
1 pinch grated orange zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in cranberries.
Whisk together orange juice, sugar, melted butter, egg, and orange zest in a separate bowl. Add orange juice mixture to flour mixture, stirring just until moistened; do not overmix. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and firm to the touch, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix together powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon orange juice, and orange zest for glaze. Add more orange juice, if necessary, to reach desired consistency. Drizzle glaze over cooled muffins.

Description: 
These cranberry-orange muffins are not overly sweet, and big on flavor. Lots of tart cranberries and sweet orange juice/zest kick the flavor up. Best when made with fresh cranberries, fresh orange juice, and lots of pulp! My family loves them without the glaze, but some of my sweet-toothed friends prefer it with, as the muffins are only slightly sweet on their own.
