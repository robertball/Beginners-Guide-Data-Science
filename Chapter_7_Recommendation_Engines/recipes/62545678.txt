Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped fine
2 cloves garlic, minced (I use a mortar and pestle, does a way better job and much easier to clean)
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1-2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce, to taste (such as Tabasco)
1 8-oz can tomato sauce (I prefer Hunts 100% natural)
1 15.2-oz can refried black beans
8 fajita size flour tortillas (smaller than burrito size)
1/2 cup shredded cheddar or monterey cheese
1 medium tomato, diced
1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in saucepan over medium high heat.
Add onion and cook 3-5 minutes until just starting to brown, but not burn.
Add garlic, chili powder, coriander, cumin, and sea salt and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Reduce heat to low. Add hot pepper sauce and tomato sauce and simmer 3 minutes.
Stir in mashed black beans and simmer until warmed through and just bubbling (be careful, this stuff has a tendency to splatter).
Warm skillet over medium heat. Heat tortillas in skillet for 30 seconds, flipping halfway through.
Assemble burritos with scoop of bean sauce, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes and cilantro (optional). Serve immediately and enjoy!
