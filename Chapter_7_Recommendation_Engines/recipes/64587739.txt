Ingredients:
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
5 large ears corn, husked
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 small orange , red or green bell pepper, diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or  1/2 to 1 tablespoon of dried
1 tablespoons rice-wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat grill to high.
Grill the corn, turning to cook all sides, until some of the kernels are slightly charred, 8 minutes total. Let stand until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
Remove the kernels from the cobs using a sharp knife. Combine the corn, tomatoes and bell pepper in a medium bowl; stir in basil, vinegar, the 2 teaspoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Combine well and enjoy.
NOTE: You may substitute different vinegars such as just using red-wine vinegars that you enjoy.
