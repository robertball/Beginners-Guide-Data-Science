Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon
2 cups orange juice
1 egg, beaten
1 (7 ounce) package flaked coconut
4 tablespoons orange marmalade
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a medium bowl with orange juice. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat salmon fillets with egg. Dip fillets in coconut, and arrange in a single layer on a medium baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until coconut is golden brown and fish is easily flaked with a fork.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, blend orange marmalade and Dijon mustard. Heat until warm, and serve as a dipping sauce for the salmon.
