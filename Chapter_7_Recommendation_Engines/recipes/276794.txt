Ingredients:
3/4 cup whipping cream
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir together cream, milk, butter, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and stir in parsley, thyme, sage, rosemary, salt, and pepper.
Arrange 1/2 of the sweet potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish, pour 1/2 of the cream mixture on top, and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Gruyere cheese. Repeat layers once more; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake, uncovered, until potatoes are tender and cream and cheese mixture is bubbly and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
