Description: 
'I learned to cook game while my husband was a forestry student,' recalls Sheila Reed from Fredericton, New Brunswick. 'We lived off the land as much as possible. I still enjoy these savory meatballs in a slightly sweet barbecue sauce. I make a bib batch for an annual pool party and there are never any left.'
