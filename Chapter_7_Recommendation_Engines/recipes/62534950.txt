Ingredients:
Premade cupcakes, baked from 2 Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Cake Mix (Butter Recipe)
5 cups cold whole milk
4 boxes (3.4-oz.) Jell­O vanilla instant pudding and pie filling mix
4 Tbsp. pure vanilla extract
2 cup heavy cream
2 package (12 oz.) Nestlé semisweet chocolate morsels

Directions:
For filling, combine milk, instant pudding mix and vanilla in a large bowl.  Beat mixture for 2 minutes or until it thickens.  Refrigerate filling for 15 minutes.  Spoon filling into a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip.  Fill cupcakes by inserting tip into tops of cupcakes.
For ganache, heat heavy cream in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat until steaming (do not boil).  Remove saucepan from heat, add chocolate morsels and powdered sugar and stir with a whisk until smooth.  Spoon, drizzle, or spread ganache over cupcakes or dunk cupcake tops into ganache.
