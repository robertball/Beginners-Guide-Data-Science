Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic
1 (19 ounce) can garbanzo beans, half the liquid reserved
5 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons tahini
1 teaspoon Vulcan Fire Salt (or combination of kosher salt & cayenne pepper)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil (and extra for drizzling)
1 tablespoon parsley

Directions:
In a food processor, add the garlic, garbanzo beans, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and process. Pour in lemon juice, tahini, cumin, parsley, smoked paprika and Vulcan salt. Blend until creamy and well mixed. Pour in 1 Tbls. olive oil, with processor on and blend until fully mixed (add extra bean liquid, if necessary). Add in parsley and pulse once or twice (mixing too much will just turn the dip green).
Transfer the mixture to a medium serving bowl. Sprinkle with pepper and drizzle olive oil over the top. Garnish with a sprinkle of parsley.
