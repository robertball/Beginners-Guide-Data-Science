Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 slices bread, toasted
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Beat eggs, milk, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs in hot skillet without stirring until set on the bottom, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip eggs and cook without stirring until set on the other side, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat.
Spread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on each piece of toast. Spread mustard over mayonnaise onto each piece of toast. Place eggs on one piece of toast and top with remaining toast.

Description: 
My dad came up with this recipe years ago. Over the years, everyone I have shared this with always reacts the same way. First, they tell me 'that sounds awful!' After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!' 

I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it.

 I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up.
