Ingredients:
Dough:
2 cups flour
2 tsps baking powder
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 cup milk
Pineapple Filling:
2 cans crushed pineapple, drained, reserve juice
1/4 cup cornstarch dissolved in reserved pineapple juice
2 tbsps sugar
Streusel Topping:
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Dough:
In a bowl add the dry ingredients, cut in butter with a pastry cutter or use your hands until coarse crumbs form. In a small bowl whisk the egg, milk and vanilla, add to flour mixture and knead until just combined. If the dough is too wet add a little flour, if it is too dry add a little milk.
Divide the dough into thirds, use 2/3 of the dough for the bottom, save the other 1/3 for the top.
Roll the 2/3 piece of dough out on a lightly floured surface in to a 11x15 rectangle, place in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, making sure it comes up the sides at least halfway.
Filling:
In a small saucepan add the pineapple and sugar, bring to a boil over medium heat, dissolve the cornstarch in the reserved pineapple juice and add to the pineapple mixture, stir until thickened.
Remove from heat and let cool in the fridge.
Scrape the filling onto the bottom dough and smooth.
Roll out the remaining 1/3 piece of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 9x13 rectangle, roll the dough onto your rolling pin and unroll on top of the pineapple mixture, make sure the edges of the dough reach the pan.
Streusel Topping:
In a small bowl add dry ingredients, add vanilla and cut in the butter until coarse crumbs form, sprinkle over top of the dough.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, bake for 45 minutes, let cool on a rack, cut into squares.
Garnish with icing sugar sprinkled over the top if desired.

Description: 
My grandmother always kept this cake in the freezer for unexpected company. A nice change from the usual bar or square recipe.
