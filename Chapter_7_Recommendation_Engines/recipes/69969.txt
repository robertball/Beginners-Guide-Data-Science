Ingredients:
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup steak sauce
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 yellow onion, minced
10 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk together vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, steak sauce, water, salt, pepper, onion, and garlic until thoroughly mixed.
Pierce several holes into meat with a sharp knife, and place in a shallow dish. Stir marinade once more and slowly pour over meat, smothering the top with the garlic and onions.
Cover and refrigerate overnight, or up to 36 hours. Cook as desired.

Description: 
Garlic lovers, this marinade is for you! I have used this on both beef roast and chicken, and I'm certain it will taste great on any cut or type of meat you choose. I typically use a 2 to 4 pound beef roast.
