Fool-proof Scones Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup mix-ins (optional) - This can be 1 cup dried fruit, chocolate chips, blueberries, etc. My favorite is 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup dried sweetened cranberries. I also like 1 cup chocolate chips plus 1 tbsp. orange zest.  If adding mix-ins, reduce sugar to 3/4 cup.
Optional toppings: Sprinkled turbinado sugar, glaze of 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 tbsp. milk and 1/2 tsp. vanilla plus 2 tsp. zest of desired citrus.

Directions:
In a small bowl, blend the sour cream and baking soda, and set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt. Cut in the butter. Stir the sour cream mixture, egg and vanilla into the flour mixture until just moistened. Add mix-ins, if desired, folding in gently.  Do not overmix.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide into two halves. Roll or pat each half into a 3/4 inch thick round. Cut each half into 8 wedges, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown on the bottom.
