Ingredients:
Butter for pan
2 16 oz. packages of wedge-cut oven fries
salt and pepper to taste
1 15 oz. jar of alfredo sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9 x 13 pan.
Arrange the wedge-cut oven fries in a pan and bake as directed until oven fries brown and become crisp.
Mix alfredo sauce and 1 cup of the cheddar cheese together and pour over oven fries.  Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese over the top.
Place 6 - 8 inches under the broiler for 5 minutes, or until the cheese melts and begins to brown, and the sauce is bubbly and hot.
