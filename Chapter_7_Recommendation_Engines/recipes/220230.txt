Ingredients:
3/4 pound salmon fillet
2 tablespoons prepared pesto
2 cups dried whole wheat rigatoni pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (14 ounce) bag fresh baby spinach
3 cloves garlic, chopped
3 small shallots, chopped
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons prepared pesto
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Coat salmon fillet with 2 tablespoons pesto. Place in a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from oven and flake salmon into chunks; set salmon aside.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in rigatoni, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until rigatoni has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain in a colander.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat.
Cook and stir spinach in oil until wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove spinach and set aside.
Cook and stir garlic, shallots, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in the same skillet until garlic and shallots are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in extra oil if needed.
Stir in drained artichoke hearts and cook until heated, about 3 minutes.
Pour in white wine and simmer until slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine 2 tablespoons pesto, cooked spinach, salmon, Parmesan cheese, and cooked pasta in the skillet and lightly toss until mixed, 1 to 2 minutes.
