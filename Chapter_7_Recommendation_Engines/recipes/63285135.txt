Ingredients:
4 Boneless Skinless Salmon Fillets (Serving Sized Portions)
2 Yellow Onions
2 Tablespoons Milk
1/4 Cup Butter (Margarine or Oil can be used as a substitute)
1/4 Cup Lemon Juice (I use bottled, you can use fresh squeezed)
3 Teaspoons Lemon Pepper Seasoning
2 Teaspoons Table Salt
1 Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper
2 Tablespoons Rosemary (Fresh or Not)

Directions:
Preheat oven or toaster oven to 450 Degrees Fahrenheit.
Combine Milk, Butter, Lemon Juice, Lemon Pepper Spice, Salt and Ground Black Pepper in a bowl or pot and microwave or hear over a high flame until all butter is melted.
Slice 2 onions roughly (may be rings, half rings or random large shreds).
Lightly oil a pan and place it on a medium flame.
Saut√© onions until they are almost translucent.
Spread onions on a foil lined tray.
Place salmon fillets on top of the onions, make sure they don't touch each other.
Pour the combined mixture evenly over the salmon fillets.
Sprinkle Rosemary evenly over the salmon fillets.
Bake for 7-10 minutes or until the salmon will flake apart when touched with a fork.
