Ingredients:
4 pounds pork shoulder, cut into cubes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder

Directions:
Season pork with salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook pork and garlic in hot oil until the pork is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir brown sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce, and five-spice powder with the pork. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook mixture at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pork is tender enough to easily pull apart with a fork, about 2 hours.

Description: 
The entire house will be filled with a spicy aroma that will make your mouth water. I normally serve this over jasmine rice with sesame seeds sprinkled on top, along with a side dish of steamed kale and garlic or stir-fried green beans with garlic and mushrooms.
