Ingredients:
Cookie crust:
1 cup finely ground chocolate cookie crumbs (such as Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers; about 20 cookies)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
Budino:
3 cups whole milk, divided
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar
5 large egg yolks
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 teaspoons dark rum
1 teaspoon kosher salt

Directions:
For cookie crust:
Mix cookie crumbs, butter, and salt in a medium bowl. Place 2 tablespoons in a small bowl; cover and chill for garnish. Press 2 tablespoons cookie mixture onto the bottom of each of eight 8-ounce mason jars or ramekins. Or put all of cookie mixture on the bottom of an 8x8 glass baking dish.
For budino:
Whisk 1/2 cup milk and cornstarch in a small bowl; set aside. Heat remaining 2 1/2 cups milk in a small saucepan just to a simmer; set aside. To make caramel stir sugar and 3/4 cup water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Increase heat; cook without stirring until thermometer reads 210°F-220°F.
Whisk egg yolks in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in hot milk, then cornstarch mixture. Slowly whisk in caramel. Return mixture to saucepan. Whisk constantly over medium heat until mixture thickens and an instantread thermometer registers 175°F, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in butter, rum, and salt.
Pour 1/2 cup budino over crust in each jar or baking dish. Cover; chill until set, 4-5 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.
Use Salted Carmel Sauce recipe found on this site. Spoon 2 tablespoons caramel sauce over each budino cup or pour over top of budino in baking dish. Top with whipped cream. Sprinkle some of reserved cookie crumbs over each.

Description: 
A rich creamy Italian pudding that is definately worth the extra time and effort. Beautiful layers of carmely creaminess best made a day ahead of time to ensure best results. Traditionally this desert is served in mason jars, but I prefer serving this desert in a glass baking dish so the layers can be enjoyed. Use Salted Caramel Sauce recipe found on this site to complete this luxurious culinary experience.
