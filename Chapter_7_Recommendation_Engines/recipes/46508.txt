Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2/3 cup rolled oats
2/3 cup brown sugar, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2/3 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup rolled oats
4 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons wheat germ
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup evaporated milk
1 1/3 cups raisins
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a muffin pan, or use paper liners.
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook 2/3 cup oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, cinnamon and allspice until golden brown. Stir in 2/3 cup water and remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar. Cook until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
In a large bowl, combine flour, 1/3 cup uncooked oats, baking powder and wheat germ. Whisk together egg and evaporated milk. Make a well in the center of flour mixture, and pour in egg mixture and cooked oatmeal. Mix just until combined. Dredge raisins in 1 tablespoon flour, then fold into batter. Spoon into muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Why can't oatmeal muffins taste more like oatmeal cookies?  These do!  The trick is to first caramelize the oatmeal.  Enjoy the nice, deep oatmeal flavor.
