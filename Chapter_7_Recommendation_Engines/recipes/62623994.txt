Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon bacon drippings (or an additional tablespoon of olive oil)
3 small to medium sized zucchini, ½” dice
3 celery stalks, ½” slices
1 medium onion, chopped
½ teaspoon kosher salt
¼ teaspoon fresh ground pepper
4 – 5 cloves garlic, diced
1 – 14 ounce can diced tomatoes, drained
2 – 14 ounce cans cannellini beans, drained
6 sprigs fresh thyme
2 dried bay leaves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Heat the oil and bacon drippings in a dutch oven over medium heat.
Add zucchini, celery, onion, salt and pepper until it starts to soften, about 10 minutes.
Add garlic, stir another minute.
Add tomatoes, 1½ cans beans, thyme, and bay leaves.
Using a fork, crush the remainder of the beans and add to the pot.
Bake until golden, about 30 minutes, stirring once mid-way through baking. Remove the bay leaves and thyme stems and serve with garlic croutons or crusty bread.

Lately I am obsessed with finding vegetable dishes I can freeze and re-heat for those days I need something fast and healthy.
This is a good one!
