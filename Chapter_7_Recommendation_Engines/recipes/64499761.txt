Ingredients:
8 oz block of Monterrey Jack or mozzarella cheese
1 lb rotisserie turkey breast
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sweet relish
salt
pepper

Directions:
Use the food processor to shred cheese block (pre-shredded cheese has a powdery texture)
Use the food processor to chop turkey to desired consistency (I like it ground but a little chunky).
Mix together turkey, mayonnaise, cheese, relish, salt, and pepper to taste.
Stir together with a spoon just until blended.

Description: 
This turkey salad recipe is terrific for leftovers during the holidays. I use this recipe as a part of my Turkey Salad Pinwheel recipe which I create for potlucks and party appetizers. This turkey salad is delicious on crackers or as a sandwich filling as well.
