Ingredients:
2 - 3 lbs chicken pieces (I use leg quarters)
2 cans cream of mushroom soup
1 cup water
2 Tablespoons Italian Seasoning or Oregano
2 Tablespoons Onion Powder
2 Tablespoons Sugar
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
4 cloves minced garlic
1 8 oz package cream cheese

Directions:
Put everything in the slow cooker EXCEPT the cream cheese. Cook on low for 6 hours on low or until chicken is tender enough to shred. Remove chicken and set aside. Add cream cheese and mix until melted. (may want to use an immersion blender to mix well) At this point, you can either shred the chicken with two forks and return it to the sauce or return it to the sauce whole. Cook for another 30 minutes or until the cream cheese if fully melted. Serve over pasta or rice.
