Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups broccoli florets
3 tablespoons water
3 tablespoons ranch dressing mix, divided
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (48 ounce) container chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) package small shell pasta
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 3/4 cups milk
1 (1.6 oz) package dry Alfredo sauce mix (such as KnorrÂ®)
1/2 cup sour cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 slices cooked and crumbled bacon

Directions:
Place broccoli and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high until steamed and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and drain excess liquid; set aside.
While broccoli is steaming, place 1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken and pepper, seal the bag, and massage to coat chicken with seasonings.
Pour chicken broth into a large pot and bring a boil over medium-high heat. Add shells and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until pasta is nearly done, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of cooking broth.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Heat butter and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the hot skillet, working in batches if necessary, and cook until browned on all sides, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate.
Add milk, Alfredo sauce mix, and remaining 2 tablespoons ranch dressing mix to the hot skillet; bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, add chicken and any accumulated juices, pasta, broccoli, sour cream, reserved 1/2 cup pasta cooking broth, salt, and pepper. Transfer mixture to the prepared casserole dish and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bacon.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.

This dish combines the flavor of ranch seasoning and salad dressing mix with the creamy goodness of Alfredo in a chicken and pasta dish. Bacon is added for a salty crunch, and broccoli is added to make the dish a complete meal. Add a green salad and some crusty bread for a well-rounded plate.
