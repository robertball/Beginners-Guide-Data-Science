Description: 
I was inspired to make this dish after tasting something similar at an Italian restaurant in Ontario. It is a different type of pasta, having a great deal of flavour from the roasted pepper and sun-dried tomato, as well as being slightly dry from the cheese. I'm a picky eater and I love this dish!
