2 tablespoons butter

In a large saucepan, melt butter. Add onion and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until onion is softened but not brown.
Scrape the flesh out of the squash and add to onions. Saute for 15-20 minutes. Add the stock and bay leaves. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 45 minutes, adding more stock if necessary.
Remove the bay leaves and puree the soup with an immersion blender  or food processor. Season with salt and nutmeg.  Add a splash of heavy cream to each bowl right before serving.
