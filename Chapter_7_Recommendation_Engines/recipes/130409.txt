1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/4 cup boiling water
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice

Bring water in the bottom a double boiler to a simmer: hot water in double boiler base should not touch pan above. In the top of the double boiler, slightly beat egg yolks.

Description: 
This is one of my Gamommy's from the early 60's. Not too different than the other recipes, but worth putting out there as an option. Serve with cooked vegetables or fish.
