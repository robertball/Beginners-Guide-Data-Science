Ingredients:
1 cup of Butter
1 cup of sugar
3 Tbsp of water
1 Tbsp of vanilla
1 7 oz bar of Hersheys chocolate bar

Directions:
Melt the butter in the electric fry pan at 350 degrees.
Add the sugar, water and vanilla.
Stir continuously as the mixture boils, for about 11 minutes.
Pour into a jelly roll cookie sheet.(You may have to tip the pan to get the toffee to cover the pan-use pot holders b/c the mixture is REALLY hot!)
Break the chocolate bar into pieces and spread the chocolate bar over the top right away-it will melt with the heat of the mixture.
Cool and crack
