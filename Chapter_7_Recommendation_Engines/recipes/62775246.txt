Ingredients:
1 medium spaghetti squash (about 2 pounds)
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 eggs
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 cup fat-free ricotta cheese
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup light spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup (2 ounces) shredded fat-free mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Place whole squash in soup pot; add 1 inch water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove the squash to a cutting board and allow to cool for 15 to 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350?F. Coat a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate with nonstick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine the oil, eggs, and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese; mix well and set aside.
Cut the slightly cooled squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds and discard. Scrape the inside of the squash with a fork, shredding it into noodle-like strands. Stir the squash into the egg mixture, then pour into the pie plate and form into a crust.
In a small bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, garlic, basil, oregano, and salt; mix well. Spread evenly over the crust then top with the spaghetti sauce.
Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven and top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Bake for 5 more minutes, or until the cheese melts. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Let cool for 10 minutes before cutting into wedges and serving.
