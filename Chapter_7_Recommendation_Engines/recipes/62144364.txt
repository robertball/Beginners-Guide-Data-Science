Ingredients:
2/3 lb Italian sausage, crumbled
28 oz. can whole plum tomatoes
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 or 2 fresh cayenne peppers, chopped
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons corn starch
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Put contents of tomato can into a large bowl. Squeeze tomatoes between fingers and crush into small pieces (you can also use canned diced tomatoes, but this changes the consistency and flavor slightly).
Heat olive oil in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat, then add garlic. Cook until slightly brown and add cayenne pepper.
Meanwhile, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until almost brown. Drain the fat and return to medium-low heat. Add the maple syrup and cook until completely brown.
Add tomatoes, salt and pepper to saucepan and turn to medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then add sausage. Continue to boil for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Reduce to simmer. Add corn starch. The amount you need may vary, so add a little at a time, stirring constantly until the sauce reaches the desired thickness. Serve over pasta with grated parmesan cheese, if desired.

Description: 
This sweet, easy to make tomato-based pasta sauce has just the right amount of kick. I found it works best served over rotini because it catches the crumbled sausage, but any type of pasta will do.
