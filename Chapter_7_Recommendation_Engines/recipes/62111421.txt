Ingredients:
* 1 can of spam, chopped
* 1 cup chopped green onion
* 1/4 cup butter, melted
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 8 eggs, beaten
* 2 cups milk
* 1 package garlic croutons
* 1 tablespoon prepared mustard
* 8 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
1. Chop Spam. Cook over medium heat until evenly brown; drain.  Add chopped green onion in with spam and turn on low.
2.   Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
3.   Melt butter in the microwave. Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place garlic croutons in the bottom of the dish, and drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.
4.  Place the spam and green onions over the shredded cheese.
5.  Beat the eggs, or whisk by hand. Add milk, mustard, and salt, and beat until well-combined. Pour over the spam and green onions.
6.  Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to stand 10 minutes before serving.
*As an additional note, you can also add a light coat of syrup to the top of the casserole when serving.  Usually done for finicky eaters that just don't like what they see.
