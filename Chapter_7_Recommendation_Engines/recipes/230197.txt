Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 (1 pound) flank steak

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the flank steak, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove flank steak from the marinade; shake to remove excess moisture. Discard remaining marinade.
Cook steak on the grill until beginning to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Slice against the grain of the meat to serve.
