Ingredients:
1 loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1/2 stick butter
1/2 tsp. parsley
1/2 tsp. oregano
1/4 tsp. salt
12-16 oz. sausage, browned and fat drained
1 cup pepperoni (approx.)
2 cups of Mozzarella cheese
Optional toppings: mushrooms, Canadian bacon, onion, green peppers, etc.
Pizza sauce for dipping

Directions:
Roll bread dough to 10" x 15" rectangle. Melt butter and add parsley. Spread some of the butter mixture on dough with basting brush, just enough to cover dough but stay away from the edges or loaf won't pinch shut. Sprinkle sausage, pepperoni, salt, oregano, and cheese (and any of the optional toppings). Roll up starting with a long side. Tuck the ends and pinch the seam shut. Spread more butter mixture on top of loaf. There will be some leftover.
Bake at 350 degrees for 30 min. Allow to cool for 5 minutes then slice. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.

I got this recipe from my step-daughter! Just flatten out bread dough, cover with pizza toppings and cheese, roll it up, and bake it! We dip the slices in pizza sauce. Delicious!
