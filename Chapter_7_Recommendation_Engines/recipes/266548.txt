Ingredients:
5  Hatch chile peppers
1 ½ tablespoons butter
1  onion, cut into strips
1 cup frozen corn
¾ tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 ½ cups shredded rotisserie chicken
1 cup Mexican crema

Directions:
Place Hatch chiles directly on the grates of a gas stove. Cook over medium heat, flipping with tongs occasionally, until blackened and charred, about 5 minutes. Place in a sealed plastic bag and allow to cool, 7 to 8 minutes. Peel off charred skins, remove seeds, and cut flesh into 1-inch squares.
Melt butter in a pan and saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in corn. Add chiles and sprinkle with chicken bouillon granules and pepper. Stir until well combined. Add chicken and crema; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Hatch chiles are in season for only 8 weeks a year, 10 weeks if the weather is extra warm. Our local markets roast and sell them in 25-lb boxes. We buy 50 lbs every year, package them, and freeze them. This flavorful recipe can be served in tortillas, over rice, or by itself.
