Ingredients:
2 c. whole or 2 % milk

Directions:
Pour milk into a double boiler or saucepan.  Heat on high until almost boiling.  Lower heat (med.-low) until a slow simmer.  Simmer until reduced by one half.  If using a saucepan be careful of it burning on the bottom.  Stir often.
If you have a gas stove you can use a Large, 4 c. glass pyrex measuring cup so that you are sure of the reduction.  (this only works with REAL pyrex as it is the only brand guaranteed heat safe)
Make in advance and refrigerate up to four-six days in a tightly sealed container.

Description: 
I hate it when I am in the middle of a recipe and realize I have none.  Then I found out how simple it is to make!  I'll never buy it again.
