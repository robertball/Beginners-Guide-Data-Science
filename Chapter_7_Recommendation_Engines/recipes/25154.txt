Ingredients:
1/4 pound slab bacon
1 tablespoon curry powder
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
9 tablespoons vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
12 cups flat leaf spinach - rinsed, dried and stems removed
12 fresh mushrooms, sliced

Directions:
Trim the rind from the bacon and cut into 1 inch cubes.  Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until brown and crispy.  Cover and reduce heat to lowest setting to keep bacon warm.
In a small, dry skillet, toast curry powder over medium heat, stirring often, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Remove from heat.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the vinegar and mustard.  Add oil in a thin stream, whisking constantly, until the oil is completely incorporated. Add curry powder and whisk until smooth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
In a large bowl, toss together the bacon, spinach, mushrooms and vinaigrette until evenly coated.  Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.
