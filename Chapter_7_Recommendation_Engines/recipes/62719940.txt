Ingredients:
2 1/2 lbs. yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 stick butter
1/2 cup flour
8 cups milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 ounces sour cream
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 pound ground beef 93/7
1/2 package of bacon
1/2 cup chopped onion
1-2 cloves of garlic
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
1.  Boil cubed potatoes on the stove in a pot of water seasoned with salt until fork soft, about 15-20 minutes.  Drain potatoes, return to pan and mash with potato masher, leaving chunks as you go.
2.  While the potatoes are cooking, chop bacon into roughly 1-2" pieces and cook over medium heat until done.  Place onto paper towels to drain and set aside.
3.  Combine onions, garlic and 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a medium skillet.  Saute until onions are almost translucent.  Add ground beef, salt and pepper to taste.  Continue cooking until ground beef is thoroughly done.
4.  Melt the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour until smooth, then gradually stir in the milk. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, continuing to stir frequently, or until slightly thickened.  Stir in salt and pepper.
5.  Add potatoes to milk/cheese mixture, and cook for 5 more minutes. Mix in sour cream, stirring until melted and well blended. Add cheddar cheese, stirring until melted and well blended.  Stir in beef mixture and bacon.  Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.  Cook for an additional 5 minutes before serving.
