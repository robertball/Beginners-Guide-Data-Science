Description: 
The arugula I planted took over my garden, but I didn't like it's peppery taste. Thanks, Michele, for suggesting this refreshing summer salad. It's my new favorite salad and everyone at work begs for it too! Michele said you can improvise by substituting beets with strawberries and watermelon.
