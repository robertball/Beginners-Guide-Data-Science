Ingredients:
2 packets dry chicken gravy mix
1 (10.75 oz.) can cream of chicken soup
2 cups water
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts
garlic powder, salt & black pepper, to taste
2 bags of success rice, cooked

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with garlic powder, black pepper and just a tad bit of salt on both sides. Note: the chicken gravy and cream of chicken soup already have salt in them so donâ€™t go overboard on seasoning with salt (about a teaspoon should work.)
In your slow cooker, whisk together the gravy packets, cream of chicken soup, and water. I just whisk until it is mostly smooth.
Add the chicken breast, and cover with the gravy.
Cook on low for 6-8 hours (or cook on high for 4 hrs).
Once cooked, break chicken up into chunks using a fork.
Then serve over rice.
