Title:

Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups potato starch
1 1/2 cups tapioca starch
2/3 cup baking powder
1/3 cup baking soda

Directions:
Combine well.
Store in an airtight container.
Always get whatever you are making into the oven or onto the stove as soon as possible after mixing in the egg replacer.  It tends to lose its effectiveness the longer you wait (due to the leavening agents in it)
To substitute for 1 egg, use 1 rounded 1/2 Tbsp egg replacer powder and 2 Tbsp (1/8 cup) water.
If your recipe calls for egg whites beaten stiff, beat the egg replacer powder with water until stiff (this wonâ€™t work for heavily egg-white-based dishes like meringues, however.)
For recipes calling for egg yolks, use 1 rounded 1/2 Tbsp egg replacer powder with 1 Tbsp water.
