Ingredients:
1 C. Cabernet Sauvignon
2/3 C. flour
3/4 C. good cocoa powder
1/4 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 C. (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
2 C. sugar
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1 tsp. vanilla
3/4 C. heavy cream
8 oz. quality semisweet chocolate

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat the bottom and sides of an 8" cake pan with butter and flour.
Bring the wine to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Cook until reduced by half,about 10 minutes. Set aside 2 Tbsp. for the icing.
While the wine is reducing, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder,and salt into a small bowl.
Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and creamy.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the reduced wine, egg, egg yolk and 3/4 tsp.of the vanilla. Stir into the butter-sugar mixture. Stir in the flour mixture, blending only until incorporated. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 18-25 minutes. Set on a cooling rack and let cool in the pan.
Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles begin to form around the edge. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips. Stir until melted. Whisk in the remaining 2 Tbsp. of wine and the remaining 1/4 tsp
vanilla. Let cool slightly. Remove the brownies from the pan and spread the melted chocolate mixture over the top. Cut into squares or diamonds and serve.

Description: 
A friend passed this on to me, as I live in a prolific wine region.  The combination of red wine with good chocolate is classic, and marries nicely in these brownies.
