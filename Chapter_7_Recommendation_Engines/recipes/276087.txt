Whiskey-Glazed Ham Recipe

Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) hickory smoked ham
40 whole cloves
2 cups Irish whiskey (such as JamesonÂ®)
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Cut crosswise slashes vertically and horizontally on ham, cutting through fat but not into the meat. Implant whole cloves where slashes intersect as deep as you can.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a large, heavy baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add whiskey. Cook until reduced by 1/3 to boil out some of the alcohol taste, 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter; stir until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in brown sugar and honey until mixture has a sauce-like consistency, 10 to 15 minutes more.
Baste ham with glaze and place onto the prepared pan. Cover entire pan with more foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes with glaze and fat drippings from the pan and recovering with foil afterwards. Remove foil and continue baking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the ham reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 30 minutes more, basting twice during this period.
Remove ham from the oven and tent foil to let juices settle back into meat, about 10 minutes. Reserve pan drippings. Trim off fat and skin and slice; set on a serving tray. Serve with pan juices.
