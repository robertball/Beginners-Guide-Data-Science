Ingredients:
3 1/2 fluid ounces canola oil
1 3/4 fluid ounces mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)

2 large garlic cloves, crushed
1 lemon, zested
1/2 teaspoon salt
24 spot prawns

Directions:
Stir canola oil, mirin, pepper flakes, garlic, lemon zest, and salt together in a small bowl.
Place prawns in a resealable plastic bag; pour in marinade. Press out excess air; seal the bag. Marinate prawns in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread prawns onto skewers; discard marinade.
Grill prawns until opaque, about 3 minutes each side.

Description: 
Every summer I leave Seattle and go up to my family home in British Columbia. While we do a lot of fishing for salmon and foraging for oysters and clams, my favorite seafood we acquire are the spot prawns. We catch them in traps set down nearly 400 feet and they are the most delicious shellfish I have ever had. No de-veining necessary and perhaps, just perhaps, better than lobster. I separate our catch by size and freeze them in bags in the ocean water they came out of. When I want to have a taste of summer I use this marinade. Delish!
