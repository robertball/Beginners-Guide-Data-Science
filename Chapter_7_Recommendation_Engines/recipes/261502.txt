Ingredients:
2 ripe avocados, halved and pitted
1/2 small onion, minced
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 Roma tomato, finely chopped
4 slices Texas toast
4 slices Havarti cheese
2 teaspoons butter, or to taste

Directions:
Mash avocados in a large bowl. Add onion, lime juice, jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Stir tomato into the guacamole.
Spread desired amount of guacamole over 2 bread slices; top each with 2 slices Havarti cheese. Cover with the remaining 2 slices bread; butter the outsides.
Heat a skillet to medium-high heat. Cook sandwiches until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more.
