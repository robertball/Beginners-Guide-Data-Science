Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
1 1/4 cups warm water
2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2/3 cup olive oil
2 eggs
5 1/2 cups white flour (plus extra for dusting)
1 cup wheat flour
Glaze:
1 egg white
3 Tablespoons milk
Sugar for sprinkling

Directions:
Dissolve honey in warm water.  Add the yeast.  Let proof for 15 minutes.
Add eggs, olive oil, salt.  Mix well.  Add flours.  Knead for 15 minutes or until smooth and elastic.  If the dough is too wet to handle, slowly add more flour, 1/4 cup at a time.  Be careful not to add too much flour. Dough should be slightly sticky.
Let rise in a greased, covered bowl for between 1 and 2 hours, or until doubled.
Punch down, knead lightly for two minutes.  Shape challah into two equal sized loaves.  Let rise between 1 and 4 hours, until loaves have about doubled in size.
Glaze challah with egg white/milk mixture.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Bake at 350 degrees about 30 minutes, or until challah is golden brown.
