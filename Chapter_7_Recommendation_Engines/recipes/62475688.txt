Olive Biscuit Cookies Recipe

Ingredients:
9 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
3/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cured olives, pitted and chopped
two pinches of sea salt

Directions:
Beat the butter in a large bowl until light and billowy. Add the sugar and stir until incorporated.
Drizzle with the olive oil and stir until combined. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour just until the dough is smooth. Add the olives and salt and stir just until evenly distributed throughout the dough. Dough will be sticky.
Roll out the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper until it is 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes, or overnight.
When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350F with racks in the top and bottom third.
Stamp out cookies using whatever size of sharp edged cookie cutter you like. (Sharp edges help cut through the olives.)
Bake on lined cookie sheets until the edges of the cookies are golden, rotating the pans from top to bottom, front to back once after about 8 minutes.
Bake for about 12 minutes total for tiny cookies, and a bit longer for larger cookies.
