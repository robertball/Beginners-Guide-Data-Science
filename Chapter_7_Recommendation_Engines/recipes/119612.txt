Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups cold milk
1/3 cup instant coffee granules
2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix

2 (10.75 ounce) loaves frozen pound cake, thawed and cubed
1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate, grated
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, stir milk and coffee granules until dissolved; remove 1 cup and set aside. Add pudding mixes to the remaining milk mixture; beat on low speed for 2 minutes or until thickened. Fold in half of the whipped topping.
Place a third of the cake cubes in a 4-qt. serving or trifle bowl. Layer with a third of the reserved milk mixture and pudding mixture and a fourth of the grated chocolate. Repeat layers twice. Garnish with remaining whipped topping and chocolate. Sprinkle with cinnamon. Cover and refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
'This is the easiest trifle I've ever made, yet it looks like I spent time on it,' says Tracy Bergland, Prior Lake, Minnesota. 'I like to pipe whipped topping around the edge of the bowl, grate chocolate in the center and sprinkle with cinnamon. It gets rave reviews.'
