Description: 
Why choose takeout when you can make this at home in the Instant Pot® with better results? This recipe can easily be doubled to feed four. You'll just need to do the chicken in two separate batches. All other directions remain the same.  Garnish with chopped green onion and serve over rice, if desired.
