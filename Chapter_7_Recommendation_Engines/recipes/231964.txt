Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground almonds
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup milk
1 cup quartered strawberries
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans or 1 square baking dish.
Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract and ground almonds with the last egg. Pour flour alternately with milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in strawberries and water; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pans and allow cake to cool completely before removing.

Description: 
This is technically considered half pound cake because it calls for half the amount of sugar, flour and butter. But amazing still.
