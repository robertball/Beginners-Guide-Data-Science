Description: 
At present time (2012), this is a 207-year-old meatloaf recipe, that has been handed down through our family since my great-great-grandmother back in 1807. It may be older than this, but that's as far back as I can trace it. Originally it was made using deer meat, but I prefer using beef as did my Mother. Enjoy.
