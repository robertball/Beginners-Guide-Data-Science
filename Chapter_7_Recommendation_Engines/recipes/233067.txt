Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup bacon bits
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground beef, Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, horseradish, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Divide beef mixture into 4 equal parts and shape into patties.
Grill on the preheated grill until patties are no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) for well-done.
Serve patties with hamburger buns.
