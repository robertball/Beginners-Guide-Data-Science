Ingredients:
1 cup ketchup
1/3 cup bourbon
1/3 cup apple cider
1/4 cup molasses
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine all ingredients and whisk together over medium heat.  Once mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 25-30 minutes until thickened.  Sauce will thicken further upon cooling. Store in the refrigerator, or freeze for future use.

Description: 
I've tweaked this recipe over the years to something I proudly serve with my pulled pork and ribs. It's also delicious on chicken. The bourbon adds a layer of flavor that will have your guests asking for the recipe. It tastes even better if made a day ahead.
