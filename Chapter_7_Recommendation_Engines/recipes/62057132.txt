Description: 

This is an extremely versatile recipe that I came up with when I had to use a leftover roast beef, I slow cooked it in a tasty tomato sauce.  You may even add curry and serve with rice.  Its real home cooking when you serve this delicious dish in a bowl with buttered mashed potatoes and bread.
