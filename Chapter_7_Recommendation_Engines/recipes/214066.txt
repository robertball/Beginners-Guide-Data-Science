Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce) package chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)
3 1/2 cups milk
2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
1 1/2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup margarine, softened
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

Directions:
Pulse the sandwich cookies in a blender until finely ground; set aside. Pour the milk into a mixing bowl, then whisk in the pudding mix until no dry lumps remain. Beat together the cream cheese and margarine until smooth, then stir in the pudding. Fold in the cookie crumbs and whipped topping until evenly blended. Spoon into a clean child's bucket, cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving.
