Ingredients:
Crepes: makes 10
1 Cup AP Flour
2 Eggs
1 Cup Milk(may require more or less)
1/4 Tsp Salt
1/4 Tsp Pepper
2 Tbsp Butter(melted)
2 Tsp Hollandaise(dry from Packet)
Filling:
6 Red Potatoes(cooked and diced)
5 Slices Bacon(crumbled)
2 Scallions(chopped)
1 Cup Ham(cubed)
1 Cup Cojack cheese(shredded)
1 Packet Hollandaise Sauce(make to directions but with 2/3 Cup milk and 4 Tbsp butter)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients for crepes with a whisk. Batter will be thin. Heat small nonstick skillet on medium heat, ladle or scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into skillet and tilt/swirl batter around in skillet until it makes a nice circle. Cook until top side turns opaque and loosens from pan. If you are feeling adventurous flip the crepe in the pan, if not, just use the spatula to turn over. Cook other side. This only takes a few minutes for each crepe. Stack the finished ones on a plate. Once they are all made, add the filling ingredients to the skillet and heat through. If you want to add some of the bacon grease back to the skillet and crisp the potatoes up a bit before adding the rest, do it at this point. Add the filling ingredients except the cheese and heat through. Add the cheese in and stir. Fill each crepe with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of filling and roll up. Make the Hollandaise sauce. Since I cheated and used a packet and took some of the dry mix out for the crepes, I used less milk than it calls for to make. Spoon over the crepes. Garnish with a little green onion and serve up!
