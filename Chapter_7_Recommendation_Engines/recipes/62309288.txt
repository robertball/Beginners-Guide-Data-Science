Description: 
This was a recipe my Mom had and we ate it every St Patrick's Day  An alternative recipe for St. Patrick's Day for those who don't care for Corn-beef & cabbage.  Cooked together in one pot and  boy is it juicy! My mom is Irish and hated the  traditional corn-beef, potatoes  & cabbage version , she got the basis for this recipe from her Italian Mother in Law.
