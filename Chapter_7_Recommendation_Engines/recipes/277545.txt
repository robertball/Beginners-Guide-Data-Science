Ingredients:
2 cups fresh broccoli florets
2 cups fresh cauliflower florets
2 eggs
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (15 ounce) package seasoned croutons, finely crushed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add broccoli and cauliflower. Cook, uncovered, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish, making sure vegetables are evenly distributed.
Beat eggs in a bowl. Mix in cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and onion. Pour evenly over vegetables in the casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Cheddar cheese over the top and level with a spoon. Pour melted butter over the entire casserole. Sprinkle with crushed croutons.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is hot and bubbling, about 40 minutes.
