Ingredients:
2  onions, quartered
1 large green chile pepper, seeded
3 cloves garlic
1 ½ inch piece fresh ginger root, peeled
1 tablespoon sunflower oil
8  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2 tablespoons butter

1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed
4  cardamom pods, crushed
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
11 ounces chicken stock
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
5 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons ground almonds

Directions:
Combine onions, chile pepper, garlic, and ginger in a blender; blend until smooth. Cut each chicken thigh into 4 pieces.
Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat and brown chicken pieces in batches until evenly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a slow cooker.
Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat and add onion mixture once butter has melted. Cook until flavors are well combined, about 3 minutes. Stir in cumin, fennel, cardamom, paprika, turmeric, and cinnamon and cook for 1 minute more. Mix in chicken stock, sugar, and salt; bring to a boil. Pour contents of skillet over chicken in the slow cooker. Cover.
Cook on Low until chicken is cooked through and flavors are well combined, about 7 hours. Stir in heavy cream and ground almonds.
