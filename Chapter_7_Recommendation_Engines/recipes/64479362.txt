3 large eggs
1 cup sour cream
½ cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup strong coffee
1 package dark chocolate chips
8 oz cold cream cheese (cut into 30 pieces)

1 8oz block of  room temp cream cheese or Neufshatel
2 Tbl spoons instant coffee

3.	Drop 1 - 1 oz scoop of batter in each cup/liner, smooth, then place 1 piece of cream cheese on top. Then, drop 1 – 1 oz scoop of batter on top of cream cheese, smooth again, so they bake evenly.
4.	Bake for 18 – 22 minutes, until toothpick inserted in edge (away from cream cheese dollop) comes out clean. Allow to cool.
5.    For icing, whip 8 oz room temp cream cheese/Neufshatel, and any left from from making the cupcakes,until fluffy, add 1 tub of ready made vanilla frosting, beat 2 minutes, then add 2 T instant coffee. Whip on high for 3 minutes, scraping bowl down halfway through.
6.     Using icing bag/offset spatula/back of a spoon, give each cupcake a crowning top of icing.
7.	Store in cool, air tight container, or give away at will.
