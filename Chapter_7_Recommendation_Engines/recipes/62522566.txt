Description: 
If you aren't lucky enough to have moose or elk burger, this is also great with lean ground beef.  I use a crock pot for simplicity.  This is fairly mild chili.  Makes 8 large servings.  Couple this with your favorite corn bread recipe and you'll have a real one-two punch!Modified from: It's Chili by George!!
