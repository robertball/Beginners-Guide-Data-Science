Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons salted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk the eggs, flour, milk, salt, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.
Put the butter in a 9x11-inch baking dish. Melt the butter in the preheated oven, making sure it doesn't burn, about 5 minutes. Pour the batter into the baking dish with the melted butter.
Return to the oven and bake until the pancake is puffed and no longer moist in the center, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Puffy oven-baked buttery pancake. It's SO easy! You may never make traditional pancakes again. Pour your favorite syrup over it, or just dust powdered sugar on top. There's not much need to add more butter because it's already baked onto the top and forms a delicious salty and buttery crust.
