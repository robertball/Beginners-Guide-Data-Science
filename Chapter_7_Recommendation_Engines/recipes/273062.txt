Ingredients:
1 1/8 cups unsalted butter
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup custard powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cream butter and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Add egg and mix. Add flour and custard powder and mix until combined.
Knead dough on a lightly floured work surface to fully incorporate ingredients, 2 to 4 minutes. Measure out 1 teaspoon of dough at a time; form into balls and press firmly into four 24-cup mini muffin pans, or in batches if needed.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.
