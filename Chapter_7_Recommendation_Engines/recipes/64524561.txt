Directions:
Rub Pork loin with honey mustard. I used Boars Head brand.
Combine dry ingredients: salt, pepper, paprika, brown sugar, thyme, sage. Measurements to taste.
Rub loin with dry ingredients and sear in pan with olive oil.
Once loin is charred on both sides transfer to crock pot with beef stock. Top loin with one container unsweetened apple sauce. About 1/4 cup.
Add chopped onion and peeled and chopped sweet potato.
I cooked on high for about 4.5 hours and then low for 2 hours.
Once plated, sprinkle brown sugar on sweet potatoes and top loin with raspberry chipotle glaze.
I  saut√©ed asparagus in butter, sea salt, and white pepper,  and added fresh sliced French bread for sides.
