Ingredients:
1 3 pound rabbit (cut up or whole)
1 teaspoon marjoram
flour as required
4 - 6" stalks of celery chunk up
2 large carrots chunk up
1 large cooking onion cut up not too fine
2 italian tomatoes, cut up to 4 pieces each
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy white wine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
mix flour and marjoram.  Dust rabbit completely in flour mixture and put in frying pan at high temperature - never use cast iron pan, best used in electric frying pan - also if using cut up rabbit, do not put too many in pan at one time, as they will become bitter.  Brown on both sides and remove. Put onions, celery carrots and tomatoes to pan, saute for two minutes.  Prepare roasting pan, add all ingredients.  Cover with wine and water.
Cover and cook for 1-1/2 hours might increase heat to 400 for the last half hour
