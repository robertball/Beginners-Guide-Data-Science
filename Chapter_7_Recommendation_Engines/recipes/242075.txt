Ingredients:
3 cups diced fresh rhubarb
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice (optional)
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup brown sugar (packed)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Mix rhubarb, 1 tablespoon flour, sugar, water, cinnamon, and allspice together in a bowl. Mix oats, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup flour together in a separate bowl; add butter and mash into the oats mixture with a pastry cutter until crumbly.
Press about half the oats mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Spread rhubarb mixture over the oats mixture; top with remaining oats mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until rhubarb layer is set, about 45 minutes.
