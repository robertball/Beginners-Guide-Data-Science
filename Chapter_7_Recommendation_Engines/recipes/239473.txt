Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 1/2 pounds chicken wings
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
3 scallions (green onions), chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Whisk honey, sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger, and garlic together in a small bowl.
Arrange chicken wings on prepared baking sheet.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the honey mixture over the wings; bake for 10 minutes. Brush remaining sauce over wings, sprinkle sesame seeds over the top, and bake wings until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish wings with scallions.
