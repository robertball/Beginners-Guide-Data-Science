Ingredients:
• 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
• 1 cup sugar
• 1 egg, beaten
• 4 Granny Smith apples, cored, peeled, and diced (2 cups)
• 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
• 1 teaspoon vanilla
• 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
• 1/2 teaspoon soda
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
• 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
• 1 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously grease an 8-inch square cake pan.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg, apples, nuts, and vanilla and stir well. Sift in dry ingredients and mix well. Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake until cake is lightly browned and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then unmold and serve hot or cold with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
