Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1 egg
1 2/3 cups whole wheat flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 package (12 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.  In a small bowl combine the whole wheat flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.  In a large bowl, with an electric mixer, beat butter, honey and brown sugar till light and fluffy.  Then beat in the vanilla and egg till well blended.  Mix the dry ingredients into the butter mixture by hand (as the dough will be stiff).  Stir in chocolate chips.  Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake cookies for 8-10 min. or until they are golden brown.  Let cool for a few minutes and serve.

Description: 
These cookies are irrisistable!  They taste just like the original chocolate chip cookie except they are healthier, made with 100% whole wheat flour, honey and brown sugar.  They turn out very chewy.
