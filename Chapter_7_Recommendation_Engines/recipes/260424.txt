Ingredients:
8 strips uncooked bacon, chopped
1/2 cup minced onion
1/2 cup minced green bell pepper
9 large eggs
3 chives, minced, or more to taste
coarse sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper liners.
Combine bacon, onion, and green bell pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Divide bacon mixture among the muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. Crack 1 egg into each cup. Sprinkle chives and a pinch of salt over each egg.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Paleo dieting can be pretty yummy, considering there's so much meat, eggs, and fish that you can feast on, but it can also be challenging on those who love a hint of salt, dairy, and grains. These breakfast muffins are paleo but full of flavor!
