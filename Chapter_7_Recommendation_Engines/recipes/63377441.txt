Ingredients:
4 oz bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 Medium Sweet Potato, cut into small cubes or grated
1/2 a medium-sized bulb Fennel (Anise), chopped
1/2 large yellow onion, chopped
1/2 a Jalapeno pepper, chopped into small pieces (seeds optional for heat)
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup Jack Daniels or similar whiskey
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Start by browning the bacon pieces slowly over medium-low heat.   Set aside and save the drippings.
In the same skillet, brown the onions and fennel until golden brown and caramelized, roughly 10 minutes.
Add the sweet potato and saut√© for another 10 minutes, covered, until pieces are tender and slightly browned.
Once all the vegetables are tender and caramelized, turn the heat up just a little and add the Jack Daniels whiskey.  This will loosen any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.
Add the bacon from earlier.
Add the brown sugar and mix completely.
Cook on medium heat for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally until all the liquor has been absorbed and you're left with a carmel-colored and incredible smelling hash.
Serve on it's own or with fried eggs!
