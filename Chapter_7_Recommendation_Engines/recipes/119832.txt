Description: 
One day when I was a girl, a neighbor brought over a dish similar to this one. I hadn't had it in 20 years but kept thinking about the fabulous flavor combination, so I decided to re-create it. I don't know it it's the same, but my family likes it today as much as I did back then.--Marian Quaid-Maltagliati, Nipomo, California
