Ingredients:
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
3 cups cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup water
1 egg, beaten
1 small onion, minced

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, combine corn meal, baking powder, salt, milk, and water. Mix in egg and chopped onion.
Shape the batter into small balls, approximately 1 tablespoon each.
Use a long handled spoon to gently slide the hush puppies into the hot oil. Cook 8 or 10 at a time, until golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon, and roll on paper towels to briefly drain. Serve hot.
