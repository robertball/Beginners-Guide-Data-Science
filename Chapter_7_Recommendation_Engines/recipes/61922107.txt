Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a shallow baking dish.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the Dijon mustard, honey, olive oil and pepper.  Place chicken in the greased baking dish, and pour some of the sauce over it, reserving some to pour over the chicken before serving.
