Ingredients:
Turkey:
PAM® Butter Flavor Cooking Spray
3 pounds Butterball® Boneless Breast of Turkey Roast, thawed if frozen
2 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon Wesson® Pure Canola Oil
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons salt, preferably kosher
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
Sandwich:
2 loaves soft Cuban, French or Italian bread (15 inches long)
1/4 cup honey mustard
1/2 pound deli-sliced Eckrich® Smoked Ham
1/2 pound County Line® Swiss Cheese
1 cup dill pickle slices

Directions:
Turkey:  Spray cold grate of outdoor gas grill with grilling spray.  Prepare grill for medium indirect heat.  (See Note)  Remove turkey from package; dry with paper towels.  Discard gravy packet or refrigerate for another use.  Lift string netting and shift position on roast for easier removal after cooking.  Cut small slits, at least 1 inch apart, over entire surface of turkey.  Insert 1 garlic slice into each slit.  Brush turkey with oil.  Combine cumin, salt and pepper in small bowl; sprinkle over turkey.
Place turkey on grill grate over drip pan.  Cover grill with lid.  Grill 1 1/4 to 1-3/4 hours, or until meat thermometer reaches 170 degrees F when inserted into center of roast.  Remove from grill.  Let stand 10 minutes.  Remove string netting; cut half of the turkey into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  Set aside; refrigerate unsliced  turkey for another use.
Sandwich:  Remove drip pan from gas grill.  Heat grill to medium direct heat.  Cut each bread loaf lengthwise in half.  Spread bottom half of each loaf with  2 tablespoons mustard; top evenly with the sliced turkey, ham, cheese and pickles.  Cover with tops of bread loaves.  Press bread loaves with hands to flatten.  Tightly wrap individually in aluminum foil.
Place wrapped loaves on grill grate.  Top each with heavy iron skillet or brick.  Grill 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until heated through.  Unwrap bread loaves.  Diagonally cut each into 3 pieces.
