1 cup texturized vegetable protein (TVP)
3/4 cup boiling water
cooking spray
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 tomatoes, chopped
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese
2 tablespoons minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together the texturized vegetable protein and boiling water. Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and spray with cooking spray. Add onion, and cook just until it begins to brown. Add the garlic, and cook for a minute. Stir in tomatoes and cumin. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 5 minutes, or until thickened.
Stir the TVP into the tomato sauce along with the chipotle peppers. Remove from heat, and stir in the shredded cheese. Serve as is, or use as a stuffing for peppers.
