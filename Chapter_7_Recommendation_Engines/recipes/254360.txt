Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon oregano

Directions:
Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until the garlic is a light brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in flour; cook and stir until the garlic mixture is a light blonde color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in milk a little at a time until combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Add mayonnaise, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until sauce is smooth and evenly warmed, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a sauce seen commonly at many Brazilian churrascarias and restaurants. It is most often used as a condiment for grilled meats and sometimes as the topping for what Brazilians call garlic bread. Good stuff. Serve with grilled chicken or steak. Good with pasta, too.
