Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can peach pie filling
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 pinch salt
12 egg roll wrappers
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup water
1 quart canola oil for frying
1/2 cup raspberry jam
1 tablespoon honey
1 quart vanilla ice cream
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the peach pie filling, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and salt.
Spread one side of each egg roll wrapper with about 1 tablespoon cream cheese. Top cream cheese with 1 tablespoon of the pie filling mixture. Fold the wrappers over the mixture. Moisten the ends with a small amount of water, and seal.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drop the egg rolls a few at a time into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
In a bowl, mix the raspberry jam, honey, and remaining water. Add more water as necessary to obtain a syrup like texture. Serve the warm egg rolls over ice cream, top with the raspberry jam mixture, and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
I had to make a dessert really quickly because we had some friends over for dinner. Unfortunately I lent out my car and was unable to make it to the grocery store. All I had was a can of peach pie filling, some raspberry jam, cream cheese, egg roll wrappers, and some vanilla ice cream in the freezer.
