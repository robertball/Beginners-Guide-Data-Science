Ingredients:
1 fresh sugar pumpkin
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pre-made 9” graham pie crusts
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
1 ½  teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 ½ teaspoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
¾ cup pure honey
¼ cup golden corn syrup
½ cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch
¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
16 Pecan Halves

Directions:
-Preheat 350F
-Cut pumpkin in half
-Line pan with aluminum foil, spray with cooking oil, rub veg. oil on cut sides of the pumpkin halves.
-Bake approx. 30 minutes at 350F.
-After baked, let the pumpkin halves rest until just warm (cold pumpkin isn't easy to scoop) - scoop out the cooked pumpkin and put into a blender.
-(You may roast the seeds at this point, toss in 1 tbs of veg. oil, spread out on pan, sprinkle with salt - bake approx. 20 minutes...it's a good excuse to keep the oven warm!)
-In the blender - blend approx 2 cups of pumpkin puree with 1/2 c of milk until smooth.
-Add spices, sugar, salt and eggs.
-In a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup - warm the honey and corn syrup, approx. 30 seconds (this makes it easier to pour)
-Add the warm honey and corn syrup to the mixture in the blender
-Add the heavy whipping cream
-Lastly add the cornstarch and cream of tartar - blend well.
-If you have decided to roast the seeds, remove them from the oven and preheat the oven to 400F for the pies.
-The mixture will look very runny - this is normal - don't be alarmed.
-Evenly distribute the mixture into 2 premade pie crusts.
-Depending on the size of your pie crusts you may have extra - discard the extra pie mixture, don't overfill your pie crusts.
-Carefully place the pie pans into the oven.
-Bake at 400F for approx. 50 minutes.
-After 50 minutes remove the pies from the oven, while they are still warm top with pecans by gently pressing them into the pies.
-Let pies set in the fridge, overnight if possible.
-Enjoy!

Don't be scared to use a fresh picked pumpkin...it's easy and roasted seeds are delicious!  This recipe has a lil' more sweetness and spice than most but sugar and spice is everything nice!
