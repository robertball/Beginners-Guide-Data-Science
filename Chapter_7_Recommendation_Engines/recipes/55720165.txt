Description: 
Ever wish you could get that restaurant style rotisserie chicken at home?  Well, with minimal preparation and about 5 hours cooking time (great for the weekends!) you can! I don't bother to baste the bird, though some like to for the first hour. The pan juices always caramelize at the bottom, and the chicken will turn golden brown...fall-off-the-bone good!Modified from: Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style
