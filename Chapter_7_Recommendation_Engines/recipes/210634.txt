Ingredients:
1/4 cup cooking oil
4 dried red chile peppers
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoons skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 sprig fresh curry leaves
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cubed
salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet. Fry the dried red chile peppers, cumin seeds, urad dal, and mustard seeds in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter. Add the curry leaves and continue cooking another 30 seconds. Stir the potatoes into the mixture. Season with salt. Cook and stir until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the red pepper and cumin powder over the potatoes; cook another 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
This is a very simple yet delicious sabji. I love eating this with some rasam and rice on the side. You can use other vegetables such as plaintains or sweet potatoes too. Serve over rice.
