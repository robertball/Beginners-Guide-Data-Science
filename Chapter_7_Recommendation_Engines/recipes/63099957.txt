Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite size pieces
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-1 inch piece of ginger, grated
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
aluminum foil cut into 4 x 4-inch squares
oil for deep frying

Directions:
Combine teriyaki sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and garlic in large bowl. Add chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate at least 3-4 hours to overnight.
Meanwhile, cut out the aluminum squares, the quantity will vary with how many pieces of chicken you have.
Heat oil in deep fryer to 350 degrees. (HINT: I would wait until you are ready to change your oil in your deep fryer before making this recipe, as it tends to ruin the oil for anything else.)
Place one piece of chicken into the center of an aluminum foil square. Fold in half to make a triangle. Seal the edges by tightly rolling the foil around the open edges. You should have triangles when done. Discard teriyaki marinade.
When oil is ready, drop the aluminum foil triangles in for about 2-4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cool slightly.
To open, grab the top of the triangle where the seal is, and pull. This will "unzip" the package

Description: 
I eat this quite a bit at our local Chinese restaurants, so I recreated it at home and made it even tastier. These are time consuming and I recommend using oil in the deep fryer that is ready to change as the marinade will ruin it for cooking anything else. I've also done this technique successfully with squid.
