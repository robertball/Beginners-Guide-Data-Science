Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 tablespoons molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 cup mashed, cooked butternut squash
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add molasses, salt, caraway, squash, and 2 cups flour; mix well. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes.
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; turn onto a floured surface and shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from pan to cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
We like this chewy, hearty bread as a substitute for white bread with holiday meals and at breakfast. My five children are grown but still live within 'eating distance', so I often bake it in large quantities.
