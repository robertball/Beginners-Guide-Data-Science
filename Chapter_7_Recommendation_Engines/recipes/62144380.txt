In a 4 quart heavy saucepan, bring sugar, butter, and milk to a rolling boil (240 degrees) for 5 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, remove from heat.
Stir in chocolate chips, marshmallow cream, vanilla, then nuts. (marshmallow cream will remove with ease if the jar is set in a shallow pan of hot water)

Cool to room temperature before slicing. Store in a tightly sealed container.
Variations:
Peanut Butter Fudge: Substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips; add chopped peanuts.

Maple Fudge: Use white chocolate chips; chopped walnuts (black walnuts are good), and maple extract.
Cherry Fudge: Use white chocolate chips; 1/2 cup well drained chopped marachino cherries, 1/2 cup almonds chopped, and almond extract.
