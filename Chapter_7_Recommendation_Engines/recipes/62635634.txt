Ingredients:
1  cup milk scalded
1/3  cup butter
1/2  cup sugar
1 1/2  teaspoons salt
2  (1/4 ounce) package dry yeast
1/4  cup lukewarm water
5  cups sifted flour
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Combine milk, butter, sugar and salt; cool to lukewarm. Soften yeast in lukewarm water; stir and combine with milk mixture.
Add 1/2 of flour and eggs; beat well. Add enough additional flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto floured board; knead for 10 minutes.
Place dough in greased bowl; let rise until doubled. Shape into rolls; place on greased baking sheet. Let rise until double.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Brush tops with melted butter. Turn out onto wire racks. Serve warm.
It's supposed to yield about 4 dozen; but I only get about 18 rolls.

Description: 
These are so nice and light and tasty! I love these, and so does whoever I make them for. YummY! I like my rolls a little sweet, so I add a bit more sugar.
