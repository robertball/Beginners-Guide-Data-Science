Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable shortening
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup butter
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, or more to taste
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat vegetable shortening, white sugar, 1/4 cup milk, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Slowly beat flour mixture into shortening mixture to make a smooth dough.
Roll dough out 1/4-inch thick on a floured work surface and cut into shapes. Arrange cookies on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool.
Beat butter, confectioners' sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons milk in a bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until frosting is spreadable and slightly fluffy. Frost cooled cookies.
