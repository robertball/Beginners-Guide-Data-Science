Ingredients:
2 Large Chicken Breasts
1 Medium Vidalia (Sweet) Onion
5 Strips of Bacon
2 Large Potatoes
1/2 Cup Canned Mushrooms (1 Cup Fresh)
1 (10.75 oz) Cream of Chicken Soup
3/4 Cup Chicken Broth
1 tablespoon melted butter
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste
Garlic Powder to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Cook the bacon; crumble and set aside; reserve bacon grease
Peel and cube the potatoes; fry potatoes in bacon grease.
Dice the onion; season with salt, pepper and garlic powder and fry in the bacon grease.
Fry the mushrooms in the bacon grease.
Coat the chicken breasts with melted butter and season with salt and pepper and grill (I used the George Foreman grill)
After the chicken is cooked, cut into cubes.
Take Cream of Chicken soup and mix with 3/4 cup broth and season with pepper to make a sauce.
In an 8x8 glass dish combine chicken, mushrooms, onions and potatoes. Top with sauce and mix it all up so everything is coated in the sauce.
Bake for 30 minutes covered with foil.
Remove foil, top with crumbled bacon and bake an additional 10 minutes, uncovered.

Description: 
A casserole with chicken, potatoes, mushroom, onions and bacon in a great tasting gravy! Works with grilled or fried chicken, your preference. You dont have to fry everything in the bacon grease, it does take a little away from the flavor, but it tastes great even if you use olive oil, vegetable oil or butter. Cooking time includes the baking time as well the frying you do during prep.
