Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup egg substitute
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
4 whole wheat hamburger buns, split
4 leaves lettuce leaves
4 slices tomato

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground turkey, onion, egg substitute, basil, horseradish, soy sauce, pepper, and garlic in a large mixing bowl; form into 4 patties.
Cook the turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve on buns with lettuce and tomato.

For those not concerned about fat intake, I add cheese. This gets thumbs up from the teenagers and boyfriend who hate anything low-fat.
