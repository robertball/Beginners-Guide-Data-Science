Description: 
My daughter and I share a love for this delicious, nutritious, and high-protein meal. Try different ingredients to suit your taste. We enjoy this meal at breakfast, but it would be suitable for any time of day. Add spinach, mushrooms, peanuts, or cashews as a topping. Serve over noodles or rice. Use additional nutritional yeast to thicken the sauce or add water to thin it.
