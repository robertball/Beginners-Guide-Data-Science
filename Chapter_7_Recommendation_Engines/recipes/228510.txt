Ingredients:
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut
1/4 cup ground flax seed
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large Granny Smith apple, shredded
3/4 pound carrots, shredded
1 cup crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 large muffin cups.
Mix brown sugar, all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, cranberries, coconut, flax seed, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add grated apple and carrots; stir to combine. Add pineapple, vegetable oil, applesauce, pecans, eggs, and vanilla extract; stir until just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
Traditional morning glory muffin recipe, tweaked to make it heartier and tastier. Half the fat, less sugar, whole wheat flour, and ground flax seed improve the muffin without anyone in my family knowing the difference. Oh, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Even the kids love these!
