Ingredients:
Tangy Creamy Cheese:
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cups cooked navy beans or Great Northern beans, rinsed and drained
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
Caramelized Onions:
2 tablespoons refined coconut oil
2 large yellow onions, finely diced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Place coconut oil, olive oil, beans, onion powder, lemon juice, cider vinegar, and salt in a food processor. Blend until thick and smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and chill, covered, until cold and set to a spreadable consistency, at least 1 hour.
Melt oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions with a pinch of salt and a few dashes pepper, stirring frequently, 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft, sweet, and amber brown, about 35 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl and cool completely, about 1 hour.
Fold caramelized onions into tangy creamy cheese with a rubber spatula. Season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with green onions.
