Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons powdered sugar
1/2 cup of lemon juice
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese softened
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
7 apples cored and sliced

Directions:
1. Combine apple slices and lemon juice in a zip lock plastic bag. Shake so all the slices are covered in the juice (the lemon juice keeps the sliced apples from turning brown after they have been sitting out for a bit).
2. Drain excess juice and chill apples in refrigerator until dip is completed.
3. Mix all other ingredients until well blended.
4. Enjoy!
