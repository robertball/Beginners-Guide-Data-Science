Ingredients:
4 English muffins, split
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
4 large fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped
8 black olives, pitted and halved
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon honey
4 slices mozzarella cheese, halved
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Toast muffin halves under broiler until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Mix garlic, butter, and basil together in a small bowl; spread butter mixture evenly onto each toasted muffin half.
Combine tomatoes, olives, and tomato paste in a large bowl; set aside. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and honey in a small bowl. Spoon some of the tomato mixture onto each muffin, then drizzle the olive oil mixture over the top, place a piece of mozzarella on top, and season with salt and pepper.
Return muffins to broiler; cook until the cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a fail proof version of bruschetta!  They turn out so yummy, I can't keep them on the plate for more then 15 minutes.  When I make this recipe, the pieces don't see the next day.  No Complaints about this recipe!
