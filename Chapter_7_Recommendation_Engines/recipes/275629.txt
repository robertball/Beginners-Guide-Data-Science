Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 1/2 cups oats
1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree
1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously coat 18 cups of a mini muffin tin with cooking spray.
Combine oats, pumpkin puree, yogurt, sugar, eggs, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice in the bowl of a food processor; process until ingredients are combined and oats are coarsely ground. Scoop batter into each muffin cup using a 2-teaspoon scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 23 minutes. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
