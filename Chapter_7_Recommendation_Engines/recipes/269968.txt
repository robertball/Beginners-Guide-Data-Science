Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups pumpkin seeds
2 teaspoons avocado oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place pumpkin seeds in a small colander and rinse well.
Lay 2 sheets of paper towels on a plate. Place pumpkin seeds on the towels and cover with 2 more paper towels. Press down to remove most of the water. Let dry for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Transfer seeds to a medium bowl. Add avocado oil, paprika, and salt. Use a medium spoon to mix. Place the seeds in the air fryer basket and cook for 35 minutes, shaking the basket frequently. Watch carefully during the last 5 minutes; the pumpkin seeds can go from perfectly cooked to burned very quickly.
