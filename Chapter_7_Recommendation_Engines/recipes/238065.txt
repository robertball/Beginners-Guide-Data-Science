Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 cups pecan halves
2 tablespoons granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir cumin and cayenne pepper into the butter until dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and immediately stir pecans, sucralose sweetener, and salt into the butter mixture to coat the nuts completely. Spread coated nuts onto a baking sheet.
Bake pecans in preheated oven until lightly browned, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes.
