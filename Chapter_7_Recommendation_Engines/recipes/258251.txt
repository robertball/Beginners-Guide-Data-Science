Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell peppers
2 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups drained canned white hominy
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
2 (14 ounce) cans vegetable broth
2 (14 ounce) cans mild red enchilada sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, undrained

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; add onion, green bell peppers, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion and bell peppers are tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
Mix hominy, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, vegetable broth, enchilada sauce, black beans, kidney beans, green chile peppers, and olives into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Season soup with salt.
