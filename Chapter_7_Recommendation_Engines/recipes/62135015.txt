Ingredients:
4 eggs
2/3 cup whole milk or cream (2% is okay too)
1 tsp vanilla
3 tbsp brown sugar, divided
2 tbsp rum, divided
6 apricots, halved and thinly sliced
8 slices high quality white or potato bread

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron.
In a small bowl combine apricot slices, 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp rum.
Heat in microwave 1 minute and set aside.
In a shallow dish beat eggs with milk, 1 tbsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp rum.
Dip a slice of bread in egg mixture. Flip so both sides are lightly coated.
Place slice on preheated waffle iron.
Spoon 1/4 of apricot mixture into the middle of the bread.  Leave a 1/2 inch ring not covered with filling so the two pieces of bread will stick together.
Dip second slice of bread as before and place on top of apricot filling.
Close waffle iron lid and cook until the waffle is to your liking.
