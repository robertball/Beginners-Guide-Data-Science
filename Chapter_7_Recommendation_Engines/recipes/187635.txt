Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
4 cups chopped fresh spinach
1 large carrot, shredded
1 apple, cored and diced
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup fresh blueberries
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Combine the tuna with the mayonnaise in a bowl, and mix until well combined.
Mix together the spinach, carrot, apple, mozzarella cheese, and blueberries in a bowl, and gently fold in the tuna salad, making sure not to crush the blueberries.
Microwave the flour tortillas for about 10 seconds, until slightly warmed and pliable. Scoop about 1 1/2 cups of the spinach-tuna mixture into the center of each tortilla, fold up the bottom 2 inches to enclose the filling, wrap, and serve.

Description: 
A quick and delicious recipe that can be eaten as a salad, a wrap, a sandwich, or however you choose. I find the apples and carrots add a nice sweetness, and the blueberries add a nice *pop.*
