Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed gingersnap cookies
1/3 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons melted butter
12 gingersnap cookies, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix crushed gingersnap cookies, brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl until well-combined. Press gingersnap mixture into the bottom of a springform pan. Arrange whole gingersnap cookies upright around the border of the springform pan, pressing into the base so that they stand firmly.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 7 minutes. Cool completely.

Description: 
This is a tasty and flavorful twist to a regular graham cracker pie crust, and is great for the holidays. Tastes really good with cheesecake, especially pumpkin or sweet potato cheesecake. I love it, and I'm sure you'll love it too.
