Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef
1 lb sausage (any kind can be used, I've used Italian and also chicken)
2 zucchini
2 yellow squash
Black olives (I prefer one 4 oz can of sliced and one 4 oz can whole)-optional
2 - 24 oz jars pasta sauce (reserve about 3/4 c)
16 oz penne pasta (I used whole grain)
2 c grated cheddar cheese
2 c grated mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Brown the ground meat and turkey, drain and set aside
Dice the zucchini and yellow squash
Saute the diced zucchini and squash in either some drippings from the meat or olive oil
Cook the pasta according to the package directions to al dente
Set aside about 3/4 c pasta sauce
While the pasta is cooking, heat the remaining pasta sauce in a dutch oven with the olives and sauteed zucchini / squash
Drain the pasta once it's done
Layer in a 9x11 casserole dish as follows: The reserved 3/4 c pasta sauce, spread evenly with a spoon; Half of the ground meat mixture on top of the sauce; Penne pasta in thin layer over the ground meat; Half of the pasta sauce and squash mixture; Cheddar and mozzarella cheese (slightly less than half); Remaining half of ground meat; Penne pasta (if some is left over, that is ok); Remaining pasta sauce and squash mixture; Remaining cheddar and mozzarella cheese
Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, or until heated thoroughly
