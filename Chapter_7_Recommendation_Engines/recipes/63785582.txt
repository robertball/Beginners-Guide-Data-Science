Ingredients:
4 Potatoes (or however many you'll be serving)
Olive Oil

Directions:
Wash potatoes and pat dry.  Poke each potato with a fork once or twice, rub each potato with oil (I used olive oil..this step is optional but I think it makes a better potato), place in crock and cook on high for about 3-4 hours.
