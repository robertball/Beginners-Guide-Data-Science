Description: 
My daughter and I love the black beans found at a popular fast food chicken restaurant, but I could not find a recipe for that particular taste. I think I came pretty close with this one. A little spicy, a little sweet but oh, so good!!! These beans go great with almost any meat but are especially good with grilled chicken.
