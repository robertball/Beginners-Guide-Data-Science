Ingredients:
1 lemon
1 lime
1 orange
2 cups PaceÂ® Picante Sauce
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 tablespoons honey
2 cups diced cantaloupe
2 cups diced honeydew
1 medium red pepper, diced
Lettuce leaves

Directions:
Grate the zest and squeeze the juice from the lemon, the lime and the orange.
Stir the picante sauce, juices and zest in a medium bowl. Reserve 1 1/4 cups for the dressing. Pour the remaining picante sauce mixture into a shallow, nonmetallic dish or gallon size resealable plastic bag. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken for 15 minutes or until cooked through, turning and brushing often with the marinade. Remove the chicken to a cutting board. Let the chicken stand for 10 minutes. Chop the chicken. Discard the remaining marinade.
Stir the honey and reserved picante sauce mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken, cantaloupe, honeydew and pepper and toss to coat. Serve the chicken mixture on the lettuce leaves.
