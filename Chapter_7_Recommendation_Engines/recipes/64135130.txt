Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 finely chopped tomato
4 Tbs. dill pickle relish
1 tsp. chopped jalapeno pepper
salt and pepper
4 tilapia fillets
2 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning
1 tsp. garlic powder
3 Tbs. butter

limes for squeezing
8 inch flour tortillas

Directions:
In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, onion, tomato, pickle relish and jalapeno pepper. Add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both sides of fish with Old Bay Seasoning and garlic powder. Lightly sprinkle with salt. Cook tilapia in melted butter until cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Chunk fillets into smaller pieces.
Place 3 to 4 chunks of fish on a tortilla followed by shredded lettuce and chopped avocado. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 a lime on the filling of each tortilla, followed by a generous amount of sauce. Wrap up the tortilla and enjoy!
