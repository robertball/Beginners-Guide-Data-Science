Ingredients:
2 (9 ounce) packages udon noodles
1/2 cup soy sauce
4 tablespoons water
4 tablespoons rice vinegar
4 tablespoons maple syrup
2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce, or to taste
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 cups fresh broccoli florets
4 cups sliced carrots
1 cup shelled edamame
4 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
While noodles are cooking, whisk together soy sauce, water, rice vinegar, maple syrup, Sriracha sauce, garlic, ginger, and cornstarch in a small bowl.
Heat oil in a large wok over high heat. Add broccoli and carrots; stir-fry until tender-crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add noodles, soy sauce mixture, and edamame. Stir-fry for another minute, using a fork to pull noodles apart. Remove from heat and mix in green onions.
