Ingredients:

2 lemons, juiced
2 tablespoons chipotle sauce, or more to taste

1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, drained, liquid reserved
1/4 cup olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Combine tahini, lemon juice, chipotle sauce, garlic, cumin, turmeric, lemon zest, pepper, and salt in a blender; blend until thoroughly combined.
Pour half of the garbanzo beans and half of the olive oil into the blender; blend, adding some of the reserved garbanzo bean liquid, until mixture is the consistency of pudding. Add remaining garbanzo beans and olive oil; blend, adding more of the liquid, until mixture is the consistency of a very thick paste. Continue blending until smooth, about 3 minutes.
