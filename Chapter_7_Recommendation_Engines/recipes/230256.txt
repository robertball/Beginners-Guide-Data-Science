Ingredients:
1 (8 1/2 pound) cooked bone-in ham (shank end)
40 whole cloves
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup bourbon whiskey
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Remove skin and excess fat from ham, leaving a fat layer about 1/4-inch thick. Score ham in a diamond pattern with a sharp knife. Push cloves into the center of the scored diamond shapes. Place ham with cut side down into a roasting pan.
Bake ham in the preheated oven until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, not touching bone, reads 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), about 2 hours.
Combine brown sugar, whiskey, and black pepper in a bowl until glaze is smooth.
Raise oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Baste ham with 1/3 the whiskey glaze. Return to oven and bake until internal temperature reaches 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), basting ham with whiskey glaze every 10 minutes. Cover ham loosely with a tent of aluminum foil if ham browns too quickly.
Let ham rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Description: 
My dad made this ham for Christmas about 15 years ago, and we loved it. I haven't made a different ham since and haven't loved one as much.
