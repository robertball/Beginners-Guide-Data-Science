Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh baby spinach
2 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over very low heat. Add garlic, onion, cherries, and mushrooms; cook and stir, without browning garlic, until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Toss in spinach, and cook and stir until spinach is just wilted, about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat. Top with crumbled goat cheese just before serving.

Description: 
A quick turn in a skillet with mushrooms, onion, and dried cherries cooks spinach, but preserves its great fresh flavor. Top with goat cheese, and serve as a side dish or over pasta.Modified from: Wilted Spinach with Cherries and Goat Cheese
