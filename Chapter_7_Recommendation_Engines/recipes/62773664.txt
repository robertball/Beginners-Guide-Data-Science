Ingredients:
1 large container greek yogurt or unflavored plain yogurt.
1 package of cream cheese, softened
2/3 cup, drained, crumbled feta cheese
1 cucumber, peeled, seeded and finely diced
4 scallions, minced (green and white parts)
2 cloves garlic, grated
1 small green chili, seeded and minced (optional)
1 cup cilantro, finely chopped
1/cup mint, finely chopped
1 lime

Directions:
Drain yogurt overnight by placing a kitchen towel in a colander and allowing the liquid to drain in to a bowl.
When you're ready to prepare the dip, soften cream cheese in microwave (high for 20 seconds).
Zest half of the lime and add juice from 1/2 of the lime.
Add feta cheese and remaining ingredients and mix.
Salt to taste (remember, the feta is salty as are the pita chips).
Best if prepared at least an hour before serving.  Can be made a day ahead.  Be sure to stir well as the cucumbers will release some juices.
Garnish with mint and cilantro leaves and sprinkle with remaining lime zest.

Description: 
We buy pita bread, slice in 8ths, coat in olive oil, salt and pepper to make our own pita chips by putting the bread pieces in a 275 degree oven for 10 minutes.  Is it Greek?  Is it Indian?  Inspired by both.
