Rosettes Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup flour
1 egg, beaten
pinch salt
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together with wire whisk until smooth, lump free and creamy. Let stand, covered in refrigerator, for 30 minutes before using.
To Make:
All oil to electric skillet or heavy fry pan to a depth that allows your deepest rosette iron to be completely submerged. I usually use corn oil. Preheat the oil to 365°F and submerge iron in hot oil to heat for 1 minute. This will also “season” the iron for easy release. Lift iron from oil, blot lightly on paper towel to remove excess oil, and then dip the heated iron into prepared batter, about three-quarters of the depth of the mold. Do not let the batter go over the top of the mold or you won’t be able to get the cookie off. Hold the iron in the batter for a few seconds, and then lift the iron, letting the excess batter drain back into the bowl.
Submerge battered iron into hot oil and cook for one minute until the formed rosette drops off mold and continues to cook on its own and expands slightly. When rosette is lightly browned on one side, use tongs to carefully flip to other side to finish browning.
Remove golden brown rosettes from oil with tongs and let drain on rack set over paper towels. Place hollow side down so all oil is drained off and rosettes are not sitting directly on oily towels. Rosettes will re-absorb oil if left sitting directly on towels.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar (the most traditional route), cinnamon, brown sugar, or granulated sugar.
Optional: Add a few drops of food coloring for tinted rosettes.
