Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lime peel

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first four ingredients. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk, oil, lime juice and peel. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fill paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
