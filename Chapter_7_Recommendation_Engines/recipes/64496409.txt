Ingredients:
2 cups fresh or frozen berries
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon lemon juice**
1 cup flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoons melted butter
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Toss the berries with cinnamon and lemon juice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Pour into a greased  8-inch baking pan.
In a bowl, combine flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and baking powder.
Stir in milk and melted butter.
Spoon over berries, covering as much as possible.
Mix 3/4 cup sugar and cornstarch, and stir in boiling water.
Slowly pour hot mixture over all.
Bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes, until cake tests done in center.
** I keep a frozen lemon in a ziplock bag in the freezer.  When a recipe calls for a small amount of lemon juice, I grate some of this lemon and use that - peel and all.

Description: 
This recipe is similar to cobbler, but we like it better.  It's heavenly with a little ice cream on top! Great with blackberries, boysenberries, and tayberries.
