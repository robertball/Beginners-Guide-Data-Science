Ingredients:
2 cups sugar
2/3 cup water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons butter (no substitutes)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Butter a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan; set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Bring to a boil, without stirring, over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F (hard-crack stage). Syrup will turn a golden color. Remove from the heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Return to heat. Cook and stir until thermometer returns to 300 degrees F. Pour into prepared pan.  Cool. Break into pieces.

Description: 
The recipe for this wonderfully buttery candy was handed down from my grandma. My brothers, sisters and I love it now as much as we did when we were little...and so do our families. It's become a cherished tradition.
