Ingredients:
Bacon oil (Cook 6-8 strips of bacon, use ALL oil and save bacon)
2 onions, diced
1 cup uncooked rice
1 cup of boiling chicken broth
1 cup of boiling tomato sauce
2 diced tomatoes
2 diced green peppers
6-8 Bacon strips, chopped
1 can sliced black olives (optional)
1 can of corn (optional)
Salt and Pepper to taste
Chili Powder to taste

Directions:
1.Put in a large frying pan: Bacon oil and 2 onions, diced.  Cook until the onion is soft.
2. Add: 1 cup uncooked rice. Stir until the rice is lightly browned (3 to 5 minutes)
3. Add: 1 cup of boiling chicken broth and 1 cup of boiling tomato sauce(Tip: While the onion is frying, boil broth and sauce together.)
4.  Add: 2 diced tomatoes, 2 diced green peppers, 6-8 Bacon strips, chopped.
5. Salt and Pepper to taste, Chili Powder to taste.
6. Stir well with a fork, cover and cook slowly until the rice is tender (about 30-40 minutes)
7. If desired, add a can of drained corn and sliced black olives. mix in (you do not have to heat the corn or olives first.)
If you are going to double the recipe (I usually make a doubled recipe), use the same amount of bacon strips and oil, and keep to 1 can of olives and 1 can of corn, double all other ingredients.
