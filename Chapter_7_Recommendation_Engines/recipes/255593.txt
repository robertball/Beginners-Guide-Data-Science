Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups almond flour
1 cup dairy-free and gluten-free chocolate chips
1/4 cup coconut flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3 eggs
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup almond oil
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup shredded zucchini, patted dry
1 tablespoon unsweetened almond milk (optional)
Glaze:
1 1/3 cups gluten-free confectioners' sugar, sifted
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
Mix almond flour, chocolate chips, coconut flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a small bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and frothy. Add brown sugar, almond oil, maple syrup, 1 teaspoon orange zest, and vanilla extract; mix well. Stir in zucchini. Fold in almond flour mixture until well blended. Thin batter with almond milk if it appears too thick.
Divide batter among prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and 1 teaspoon orange zest in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until glaze is smooth. Spoon glaze over muffins. Let stand for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
My favorite muffin recipe is a chocolate chip orange zucchini bread recipe found on Allrecipes! But when I had to cut out dairy and gluten, I had to get creative to get the same satisfaction out of a healthier version. These turned out great! Be sure to add the glaze - it really makes the muffin.
