Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 (13.8 ounce) can refrigerated pizza dough (such as PillsburyÂ®)
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
1/8 cup prepared yellow mustard
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
3/4 cup chopped dill pickles

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray; unroll pizza dough over the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook and stir beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain.
Mix mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl. Spread over the parbaked crust. Layer beef-onion mixture, Cheddar cheese, and pickles on top.
Return to the oven and bake until crust is dark golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes.
