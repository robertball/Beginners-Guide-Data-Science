Ingredients:
4 cups of raw, peeled garlic cloves.
1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Salt to taste if desired - not necessary
If you are used to oven roasted garlic, and would like to add a bit of other seasoning, feel free to do so, keeping in mind what you will be using the finished product for. I suggest maybe splitting the recipe and only seasoning half, leaving the remaining half plain. But that's the fun of cooking... personalizing recipe's to your family tastes!

Directions:
Place the olive oil in a large heavy skillet and heat on medium-low. Add the garlic cloves and toss to coat all with oil. Cover with lid and simmer, tossing frequently, until most of the garlic is slightly browned or caramelized. If it sticks, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir quickly to loosen, then re-cover and continue. (Be sure to allow all water to evaporate before storing.) When done, transfer to a quart canning jar or other easily sealed glass container, adding oil from pan too. Seal and refridgerate. If you want to, you can add EV olive oil enough to cover the garlic completely. This will give you ready-made garlic oil to add to your favorite salad dressing or other recipe's. Enjoy just as you would oven roasted garlic.

Description: 
WE LOVE GARLIC!!! This garlic is so easy and doesn't take nearly as long as traditional roasted garlic, as it is done on the stove top. It's great to have on hand to add to any recipe! It will keep for several weeks in the refridgerator if stored as suggested. (I use the already peeled garlic whole cloves you can get at Sam's Club.)
