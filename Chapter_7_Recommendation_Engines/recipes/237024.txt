Ingredients:
2 (12 fluid ounce) bottles beer
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)
1 tablespoon thyme
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as Crystal®)
1 pound shell-on medium shrimp

Directions:
Stir beer, lemon juice, seafood seasoning, thyme, and hot pepper sauce together in a non-reactive saucepan; bring to a boil and add shrimp. Return liquid to a simmer and cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 3 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and let shrimp sit in liquid at least 5 minutes more before draining. Let shrimp cool until cool enough to touch.

Description: 
This is a warm peel-and-eat shrimp recipe that I tried to duplicate from a little bar-and-grill in Deland, Florida.  The shrimp are boiled in a spicy beer and thyme broth and served hot in a beer mug. Serve with dipping sauces of lemon-butter and hot sauce. I dip first in lemon-butter and then hot sauce, but you will find what works best for you! You will need plenty of paper towels!
