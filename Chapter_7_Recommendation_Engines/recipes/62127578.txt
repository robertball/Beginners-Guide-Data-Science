Ingredients:
1 refrigerated pie crust
1 eggplant, peeled and thinly sliced
½ cup chopped green onions
½ tbsp. Italian seasoning
1 cup mayonnaise made with olive oil
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
Pinch of salt
Pinch of pepper

Directions:
Lightly toast the pie crust in the pie plate at 450° for about 8 minutes or until slightly brown.
Layer the eggplant with the green onions, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, until they are used up.
Mix together the cheeses with the mayonnaise and place on top of the last layer of eggplant, spreading to cover the pie.
Cover the browned edges of the pie crust with thin strips of aluminum foil, and bake the pie for 35 minutes at 350° or until the cheeses are slightly browned.
