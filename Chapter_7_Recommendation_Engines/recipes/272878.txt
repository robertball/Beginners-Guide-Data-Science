Ingredients:
1 large eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil together in a small bowl. Coat eggplant slices in sauce. Place on preheated grill, carefully, as they will flame up.
Cook each eggplant slice until deep brown, about 5 minutes per side.
