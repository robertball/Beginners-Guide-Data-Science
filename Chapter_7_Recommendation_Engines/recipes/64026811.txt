Ingredients:
3/4 cup honey roasted almonds (in a bag, produce area)
A big box of baby spinach
A bunch of sliced strawberries
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds**
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons minced red onion
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 cup basalmic vinegar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
Chopped up Cucumber
Chopped up Avacado
Feta/Goat/or Gorgonzola cheese

Directions:
In a small saucepan, toast sesame seeds over medium heat (maybe 60-90 seconds is all - they will burn fast!). Remove from heat, and let cool.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sugar, onion, paprika, white wine vinegar, cider vinegar, and vegetable oil. (I toss it all in a blender). DO NOT REFRIGERATE DRESSING!
Toss with spinach just before serving or serve on the side.
