Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter, softened
3/4 cup dark brown sugar
3/4 cup light brown sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 ounces semisweet chocolate chunks
2 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
In a mixing bowl beat butter and both brown sugars until creamy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla.
Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and stir just until combined.
Mix in the chocolate chunks and pecans.  Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Flatten slightly with the back of the spoon.
Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool slightly on cookie sheet.  Remove to a rack and cool completely.
