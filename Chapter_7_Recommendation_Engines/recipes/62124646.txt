Ingredients:
1 box (12 count) Ice Cream Sandwiches (any brand or flavor)
1 box (4 oz.) instant chocolate pudding
1 1/2 c. fudge topping
1/4-1/2 c. milk
8 Regular or Minty Oreo cookies, cut into chunks
2 cartons of Whipped Topping, thawed in the refrigerator
24 frozen waffles (square waffles work best), toasted just before serving

Directions:
In medium bowl, mix together pudding mix, fudge and milk until you have a frosting type consistency. Add Oreos, stir and refrigerate for at least 5 minutes.
In the center of a large piece of Heavy-duty aluminum foil (about 24"x36"), lay down 4 ice cream sandwiches side to side (like playing cards). Top sandwiches with half the pudding mixture, top with 4 more sandwiches and the other half of pudding mixture. Top with last 4 sandwiches and frost entire "cake" with whipped topping. Work fast and have everything ready before you start.  A second set of hands to unwrap the sandwiches and hand you the ingredients is helpful (kids LOVE helping with this one!).
Draw up foil around sides and loosely seal from top. Then put in freezer and let set for at least 4 hours.
When solid, slice cake into half inch slices and place between two toasted waffles and serve with pride.
Enjoy with low or loud mmmms and "oh-my-goodness"s.

Description: 
It started as a simple Ice Cream Sandwich Cake--which is awesome on it's own. Then, with a stoke of sheer brilliance, my husband implemented the Waffle Principle (everything tastes better on a waffle) and made it an easy-to-eat sensation!
