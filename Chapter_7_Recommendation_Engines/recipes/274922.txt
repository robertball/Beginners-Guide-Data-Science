Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups instant rice
olive oil
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound ground turkey
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 tablespoon chili powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir water and rice together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and cook in the microwave on high for 8 minutes. Remove from the microwave, wait until water is fully absorbed, about 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
While rice is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in just enough olive oil to coat the skillet. Add both bell peppers and garlic. Cook, stirring every so often, until the peppers are no longer hard and crunchy, about 10 minutes. Transfer peppers to a bowl.
Add ground turkey to the skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook turkey, crumbling it up as you stir, until no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Add cooked peppers, kidney beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Mix until everything is incorporated and heated through. Serve over rice.
