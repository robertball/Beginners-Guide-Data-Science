Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box Barilla® Linguine
1 (6.3 ounce) jar Barilla® Traditional Basil Pesto
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 small shallot, minced
1/4 cup red bell pepper, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup white wine
1 (6.5 ounce) can chopped clams, drained with juice reserved
3/4 cup chicken broth
1 (16 ounce) package clams in shell, scrubbed
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish
2 tablespoons shaved Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and bell pepper. Cook until softened, 3 or 4 minutes; stir in garlic. Add white wine and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Stir in canned clams, 1/2 of the reserved clam juice, and chicken broth. Arrange fresh clams on the sauce. Bring to a low simmer; reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until clam shells open, 5 or 6 minutes. Discard clams that do not open. Stir in basil pesto and shrimp. Heat through until shrimp are bright pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and chopped basil.
Distribute linguine among serving bowls; spoon clams, shrimp, and sauce over pasta. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.
