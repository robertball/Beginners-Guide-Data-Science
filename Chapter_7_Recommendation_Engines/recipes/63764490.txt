Ingredients:
2 lbs garden fresh tomatoes (a mix of several varieties works)
1 onion, chopped file
3-4 small garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp basil
1/2 tsp oregano
1 1/2 tsp salt
olive oil

Directions:
Drizzle olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of a 3.5 qt. sauce pan and heat oil to medium. Add in finely chopped onions and cook until just translucent.
While onions are cooking, cut the tomatoes and puree in a blender till file.
Once onions are done, add the minced garlic to them and cook for one minute or until fragrant.
Next add the pureed tomatoes along with spices. Bring to a simmer then lower heat to medium-low and continue to simmer until sauce is reduced.
**optional - return all of sauce to the blender and puree again. I do this because my kids don't like anything chunky.
Makes 2 cups (16 oz) you can freeze this or can what you won't use.
