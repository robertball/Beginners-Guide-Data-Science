Ingredients:
2 cups canned chicken broth
1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil
1/2 medium onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
1 large garlic clove, minced
2 medium carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
1 (10 ounce) package plain couscous
1 (16 ounce) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
salt and pepper
chopped parsley (optional)

Directions:
Microwave broth over high heat in a 1-quart glass measuring cup until piping hot, 3 to 4 minutes.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add carrots, couscous and chickpeas; stir to combine. Stir in stock, cover and turn off heat. Let stand until stock is completely absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes. Add salt, if necessary, and pepper to taste. Fluff with a fork, strew with the optional chopped parsley and serve with the Mixed Grill.

Description: 
Because my Moroccan-style couscous cooks in four to five minutes, it's another side dish that's equally good for a simple supper or a large feast. To dress it up, add shredded carrots and a can of chickpeas.
