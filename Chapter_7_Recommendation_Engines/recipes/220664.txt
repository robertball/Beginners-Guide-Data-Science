Description: 
These delicious and vegan black bean burger patties are called 'Frankenburgers' because I made them up one night without a recipe and just added whatever I had! Suggested serving is with a squirt of mustard along side brown rice and a tossed salad, or give them a try on a bun with all the fixings!
