Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup milk
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup frozen raspberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Sift 2 cups flour, sugar, baking soda, and baking powder into the bowl of a stand mixer. Cut butter into 4 or 5 chunks and add to the bowl. Mix on low speed until mixture resembles sand.
Combine lemon juice, milk, egg whites, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Beat lightly for 2 minutes with a fork or whisk. Pour over the flour mixture and mix on medium speed until fully incorporated, about 1 minute.
Dust frozen raspberries with 4 tablespoons flour to prevent sinking. Fold into the batter using a spatula. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
