Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, room temperature
1 (8 ounce) jar prepared salsa
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food, sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until no longer pink. Drain off grease.
Spread the cream cheese in an even layer in the bottom of a 9 inch square baking dish. Spread a layer of salsa over the cream cheese, then cover with a layer of ground beef. Top with slices of processed cheese and cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through. Serve hot.
