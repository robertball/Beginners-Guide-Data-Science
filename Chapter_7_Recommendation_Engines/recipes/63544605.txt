Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds chicken cut into bit size pieces
1 pound rabbit or sausage, cleaned and cut into pieces
3 whole cloves of garlic
1 14 oz can petite diced tomatoes
1/4 (10 ounce) package frozen green beans
salt to taste
1 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
1 pinch saffron threads
1 cups uncooked yellow rice, or as needed
2 cups chicken broth
6 artichoke heart peices
Hard boiled egg
Roasted Red Peppers
Lemon

Directions:
Heat a paella pan over medium-high heat, and coat with olive oil. Add the chicken, rabbit; cook and stir until nicely browned. Move the browned meat to the sides of the pan, and add the chicken broth, tomato, artichoke hearts and garlic cloves. Season with paprika, and mix well.
Bring to a boil. Simmer for about 1 hour to make a nice broth.
The goal is to make a rich tasting broth that will soak into the rice to make it delicious. Stir in half as much rice as the amount of water in the pan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Serve with slices of roasted red pepper and slice of hard boiled egg.

Description: 
I lived in Spain for two years where I was taught the art of making the Paella which originated in Valencia. I haven't found anything on here which is even close to authentic, so I thought I would add this recipe for those who would like to try a taste of Spain.Modified from: Authentic Paella Valenciana
