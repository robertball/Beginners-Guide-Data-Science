Ingredients:
12 slices white bread, cut into cubes
2 packages cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup blueberries
12 eggs
2 cups milk
1/3 cup maple syrup (or honey)
1 tsp. nutmeg
Syrup:
1 c  sugar
2 Tbsp  cornstarch
1 c  water
1 c  blueberries, fresh or frozen
1 Tbsp butter

Directions:
Place bread cubes in a greased 13 X 9 inch casserole dish.
Beat cream cheese and the sugar and drop heaping tablespoons on top of the bread.
Sprinkle blueberries over the top.
In a mixing bowl, combine the eggs, milk, nutmeg, and syrup (or honey).
Pour over the casserole. At this point you can refrigerate overnight OR you can bake.
Heat oven to 350 degrees while giving the bread a chance to soak up the egg mixture.
Bake covered for 30 minutes.
Uncover and bake an additional 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and the center is set.
Top with blueberry sauce.
To make Blueberry Sauce: In a saucepan, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add in water, stirring until smooth. Heat to boiling, stirring for 2-3 minutes. Add in the blueberries, return to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, stirring occasionally for 8-10 minutes or until the blueberries begin to burst. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 tablespoon of butter until melted.
