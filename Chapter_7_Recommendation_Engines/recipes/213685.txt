Ingredients:
12 room temperature eggs, separated
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
zest from 1 lemon
zest from 1 orange
1/4 cup potato flour
1 cup matzo cake meal
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch angel food cake pan.
Beat the egg yolks into a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until frothy. Gradually add the sugar until completely incorporated. Beat in the orange juice, lemon zest, and orange zest. Sift the potato flour and matzo cake meal together in a bowl; gently stir into the egg yolk mixture.
Beat the egg whites in a bowl with the salt using an electric mixer on high speed until stiff and shiny. Use a rubber spatula to fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Gently run the spatula through the center of the mixture, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining egg whites, folding until just incorporated. Gently pour the batter into the prepared angel food cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is set and lightly browned, about 1 hour. Remove from oven, invert the pan, and let cool completely before removing the cake from the pan.

Description: 
This cake is great for Passover because it uses matzah meal flour instead of regular white flour. It also includes neither butter nor leavening agents. If you cannot find potato flour or matzah meal flour, all-purpose flour will work just fine. However, it wouldn't be kosher. A good sponge cake needs a great deal of air beaten into the eggs.
