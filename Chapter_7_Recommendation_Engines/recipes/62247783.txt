Description: 
This is a recipe I learned from my mother in law who is from Michocan, Mexico.  This is a bit spicy so you may use less chilies if you dont want it to spicy.  This recipe is a bit of work but well worth it!  I never thought I liked nopales, and now they are one of my favorite things to experiment with.
