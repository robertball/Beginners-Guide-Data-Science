Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
1 cup milk, or as needed
1/2 cup applesauce
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Mix in brown sugar, breaking it up into pea-sized pieces. Beat eggs in a separate bowl and stir milk, applesauce, and vanilla extract into eggs. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the milk mixture; stir until just combined. If batter is too thick, add more milk.
Grease a skillet or griddle with vegetable oil and place over medium-high heat. Scoop 2 tablespoons of batter onto the hot skillet and cook pancake until browned on the bottom and bubbles appear in the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until browned, 2 or 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This is my version of a great recipe that I found in my Mom's recipe book. It actually came from my grandmother Momo around WW2. My only real change was substituting applesauce for the oil. Feel free to try either way.
