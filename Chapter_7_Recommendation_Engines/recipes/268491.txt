Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon butter
2 slices bacon, chopped
Â½ bunch fresh sage leaves
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoon chopped hazelnuts

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts with the flat side of a meat mallet to flatten out and ensure even cooking.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and season with salt and pepper. Cook until chicken breasts are browned and no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer to serving plates and keep warm.
Add butter, bacon, sage leaves, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, and chopped hazelnuts to the same skillet. Bring to a quick boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring regularly, until sauce thickens slightly, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sage sauce over chicken.
