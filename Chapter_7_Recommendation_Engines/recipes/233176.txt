1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup pecans
3 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
2 tablespoons white sugar
water
1/2 cup golden raisins
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon whiskey (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir pecans in melted butter until lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer toasted pecans to a bowl with a slotted spoon, reserving butter in pan. Cook and stir apples in reserved butter until apples begin to soften, about 2 minutes; add sugar.
Stir water, raisins, and salt into apple mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until raisins are plump, about 5 minutes. Add whiskey, vanilla extract, and toasted pecans.
