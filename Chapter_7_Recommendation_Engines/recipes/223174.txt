Ingredients:
4 chicken leg quarters
1 tablespoon New Mexico chile powder
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12.5 fl oz) can mango nectar
1/4 cup dark rum
1/4 cup orange juice
1 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons chile paste

Directions:
Cut chicken leg quarters at the joint without cutting all the way through. Arrange chicken on a baking dish.
Mix New Mexico chile powder, ancho chile powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Rub chile powder mixture over chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat chicken with olive oil.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 45 minutes. Chicken will not be cooked through.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Heat mango nectar, rum, orange juice, lime juice, honey, and chile paste in a skillet over medium-high heat. Simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Brush mango glaze over chicken legs.
Grill chicken on preheated grill until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 more minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
The chicken is rubbed with a simple blend of Mexican spices and and baked for the initial cooking, then finished on the grill with tangy sweet glaze that's got just enough heat. The glaze works equally well on grilled pork chops. My family prefers leg quarters, but any chicken will work by simply adjusting the cooking time.
