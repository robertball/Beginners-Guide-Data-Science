Ingredients:
Parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil
2 lbs washed fingerling potatoes or Yukon gold (I stay away from the starchier potatoes such as the russets)
Halved lengthwise, or very small round white or red potatoes whole
1 tbsp minced fresh thyme
1 tbsp minced fresh oregano
1 tbsp minced chives
1 tbsp minced fresh garlic
2 ½ tbsp. olive oil
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ tsp freshly ground black paper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or nonstick foil.
Add the potatoes to a large bowl, and add the remaining ingredients to coat to potatoes.
Spread the potatoes in a single layer to the prepared baking sheet. Roast for 30-35 minutes in the oven tossing occasionally while roasting until tender and golden.

Perfect with burgers, roast chicken or scrambled eggs. Also makes a nice side dish for Thanksgiving. For Thanksgiving I make a larger batch depending on the number of guests.
