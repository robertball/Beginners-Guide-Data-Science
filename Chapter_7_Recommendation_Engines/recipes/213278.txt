Ingredients:
1 cup Pace® Salsa Verde
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1 large red pepper, diced
1 large avocado, diced
1/2 cup sour cream
4 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
2 cups shredded lettuce

Directions:
Stir 1/2 cup salsa, chicken, pepper and avocado in a large bowl. Stir the remaining salsa and sour cream in a small bowl.
Spread 1/4 cup sour cream mixture onto each tortilla to within 1/2 inch of the edge. Top each with 1 cup chicken mixture and 1/2 cup lettuce. Fold the sides of the tortillas over the filling and then fold up the ends to enclose the filling. Cut each wrap in half before serving.
