Ingredients:
4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
5 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup rum
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Place chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, beat cream cheese in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually beat in powdered sugar and rum; mix until well combined. Beat in melted chocolate.
Roll mixture into small balls and roll in chopped nuts. Refrigerate until firm.
