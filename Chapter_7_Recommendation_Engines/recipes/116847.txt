Description: 
I first served this pasta dish with a tossed salad when friends dropped by and stayed for dinner, recalls Amy Burns of Charleston, Illinois. Since then, I've modified it to include some vegetables, so it's a complete meal by itself. My sons ask for it all the time.  Frozen peas, corn, chopped broccoli and sliced zucchini can be used alone or in any combination that you like in place of the vegetable medley listed, she adds.
