Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) package kasseri cheese
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons brandy, at room temperature
1/2 lemon, or to taste
1 tablespoon freshly chopped Italian parsley

Directions:
Brush each side of the kasseri cheese with water. Dredge both sides in flour, making sure the surface is completely covered.
Preheat a well seasoned cast iron skillet on medium-high heat until smoking. Pour in olive oil. Carefully place the floured cheese in the hot oil. Cook until cheese begins to ooze and a golden brown crust forms, about 2 minutes. Quickly flip cheese over with a spatula. Fry until bottom is golden brown, about 30 seconds more.
Remove skillet from heat and transfer onto a napkin-lined plate. Pour brandy over the cheese. Light the brandy using a fireplace lighter. Now you can exclaim "Opa!" and marvel at the fire. Squeeze some lemon juice on top to extinguish the last few flames and garnish with parsley.

Description: 
This flaming cheese ritual was started by restaurateurs in Chicago, who encouraged customers to yell, 'Opa!' as the plate was being ignited. You can recreate the tradition at home in minutes, whether you'd like to spark up a little romance with an old flame on date night or just try a fast and fun cheese dish on a chilly weeknight. Serve with sliced fresh or grilled bread.
