Ingredients:
1 eggplant, cut into 1/8th inch slices
1 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Oil for frying

Directions:
In a gallon size bag, shake together everything but the eggplant and oil.
Heat a large iron skillet to medium heat and pour in enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan.
Take a handful of eggplant slices and coat with flour mixture.
Once oil is hot, add coated eggplant slices and cook for 2-3 minutes or until crisp and light brown then flip and cook another minute or two.
Carefully remove slices and move to a plate covered with paper towels or a cooling rack.
Repeat with remaining eggplant and enjoy!
