1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2.5 tsp yeast

Directions:
. Mix the warm water, warm milk and yeast first. Let it stand for about 10 minutes for the yeast to proof. Then add the remaining ingredients. Let it rise until doubled in size (about 1hr.) Then follow the rest of the recipe. My husband and boys arm wrestle for the last one. This recipe is also wonderful for cinnamon rolls. Happy Baking!
