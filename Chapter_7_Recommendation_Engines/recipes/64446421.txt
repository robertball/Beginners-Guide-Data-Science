Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
3 c. of turkey gravy (2 - 16 oz. jars will work)
1/2 c. diced onions
1/3 c. chopped celery
6 oz. stuffing (like Stove-Top Stuffing in a box)
1/2 cup Craisins or other dried cranberries

Directions:
Pour 1/2 c. dry stuffing over the bottom of a large (4.5 Quart+) slow
cooker.
(Note: For best results your slow cooker should be 1/2-2/3 full when
cooking.
The size you need will be dependent on whether you are using chicken
breasts, a turkey breast or a whole chicken.)
Place chicken breasts/whole chicken or turkey on top of stuffing.
Pour 1 & 1/2 c. gravy on the poultry.
Combine other 1 & 1/2 c. gravy, remaining stuffing; and cranberries in a
medium sized bowl.
Top the poultry with the mixture from the bowl.
Cover. Cook on Low for 6-7 hours.~ Pairs well with mashed potatoes
