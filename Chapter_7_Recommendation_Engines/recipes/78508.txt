Ingredients:
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped

1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Directions:
Toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until fragrant. Remove from heat, and set aside to cool.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the red and green bell peppers, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir until wilted and soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, and continue to cook and stir for another 15 minutes. Mix in the tuna, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15 more minutes. Stir in the pine nuts, and serve.

Description: 
I had this at a tapas bar in Spain way back and was able to figure out how to mimic it.  It's an easy way to clean out the fridge and pantry.  And, perfect for a low carb diet.  I was introduced to this as a tapa.  But you could always pair it with a salad or other veggie side dish for dinner.
