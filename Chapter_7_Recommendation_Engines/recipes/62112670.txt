Ingredients:
1 pound Ground Beef (or 4 packaged patties)
2 TBS Worchestershire Sauce
1 TBS Teriyaki Sauce
1/4 TSP Vinegar
A hint of Lime (Or Lemon) Juice
1/2 TSP Steak Rub
1/8 TSP Coarse Ground Pepper
1/8 TSP Garlic Powder
1/8 TSP Cajun Shake Seasoning
1/2 TSP Parsley Flakes
1/2 TSP Basil Leaves
1/2 TSP Minced Onion

Directions:
Once patties are made, mix together sauces in a small bowl.
Using a brush, gently brush the combination over each side of each patty.
Sprinkle the Steak Rub, the Pepper, Garlic Powder, Cajun Seasoning, Parsley Flakes, Basil Leaves, and Minced onion onto each side of each patty, rubbing and patting the seasonings into the patty until it is well into the meat.
Place on prepared grill. Each time you turn the burgers over, add another brushing of left over sauce on them until you've run out. This helps keep them juicy!
Once cooked thoroughly or until to your liking, remove from grill, add on a bun with condiments, and enjoy!
