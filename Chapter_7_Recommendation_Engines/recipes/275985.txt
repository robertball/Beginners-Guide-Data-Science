2 ounces cream cheese
1 tablespoon crumbled blue cheese
1 tablespoon buffalo sauce
1 ounce cubed, cooked chicken

nonstick cooking spray
1/2 tablespoon buffalo sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine cream cheese, blue cheese, and 1 tablespoon buffalo sauce in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute, then stir. Microwave for up to 1 more minute, stirring every 15 seconds, stopping when mixture is creamy and smooth. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes. Mix in cooked chicken and ranch dressing.
Whip eggs in a bowl until light and lemon-colored.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray. Pour in the eggs and cook until slightly set, about 3 minutes. Add chicken mixture and cook until top is set, 1 to 2 more minutes. Fold omelet onto itself and slide onto a plate. Drizzle with buffalo sauce.
