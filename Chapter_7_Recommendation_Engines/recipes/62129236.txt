Ingredients:
BATTER
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
2 cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
5 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
50 peppermint hard candies (use more or less depending on the desired amount of peppermint. Candy canes are a good substitute)
TOPPING
crushed peppermint candies
1/4 cup chopped semi-sweet chocolate
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour (or use cocoa powder) a 9 x 13 inch baking pan.
Cream together butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl.
Add flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder and mix well.
In a food processor, grind the (unwrapped!) peppermint candies until powder-like (larger chunks are okay).
Sift the crushed candies, adding the candy dust to the batter and setting the larger pieces aside.
Mix the batter well. The thickness will vary depending on the amount of candies used, but it should resemble a very thick cake batter, with tiny particles of candy suspended throughout.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
In a smaller bowl, combine the ingredients for the topping.
Sprinkle topping in a thin, even layer over the top of the batter. You may not need to use all the topping.
Bake for 45-50 minutes or until brownies are just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan.

Description: 
These chocolaty, minty delights are more like a dense cake than a brownie. The batter is so thick that spoonfuls could also be dropped onto a baking sheet and baked as cookies!
