3 green onions, sliced
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
4 teaspoons fat-free creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip Free®)
4 teaspoons prepared horseradish

1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups cubed cooked pork roast

Directions:
Mix the pork, celery, and green onions in a large bowl.
Combine the mustard, creamy salad dressing, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, and salt in blender. Blend to make a saucy dressing, about 1 minute. Lightly toss the dressing with the pork mixture. Cover and refrigerate until serving.
