Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 egg
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pinch parsley flakes, or to taste
Crust:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Beat 1 egg in a large bowl until foamy. Add onion, ground beef, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and garlic; mix until combined. Mold mixture into a loaf on a baking sheet.
Unroll crescent rolls and use to cover meatloaf completely, seaming seals and perforations so that no meat is visible.
Whisk remaining egg and water in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over crust.
Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until crust is very dark and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
