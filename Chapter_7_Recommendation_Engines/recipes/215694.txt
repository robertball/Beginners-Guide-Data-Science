Description: 
I have been looking for and devising a lower-salt dried onion soup mix recipe for years now.  I think the flavor of this is very good, without being quite as salty as the brand-name ones out there. Beef bouillon gives a deeper, heartier flavor, while the chicken is lighter and a little more onion-ey. This works really well in those slow-cooker recipes that call for dried onion soup mix.
