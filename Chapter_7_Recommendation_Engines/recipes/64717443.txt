Ingredients:
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 medium onion, finely diced
2 celery stalks trimmed, quartered lengthwise, then sliced in 1/4 inch pieces
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
2 (10oz) cans of chopped clams in juice
1 cup heavy cream
2 bay leaves
1 lb Idaho potatoes, chopped into 1/2 inch cubes
1 egg
2 Tbsp bread flour

Directions:
Heat the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.
Add the onion and celery and saute until softened, mixing often.
Stir in the flour to distribute evenly.
Add the stock and juice from 2 cans of chopped clams (reserve clams), cream, bay leaves, and potatoes and stir to combine.
Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly (the mixture will thicken), then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook 20 minutes, stirring often, until the potatoes are nice and tender.
Halfway through the cook time, whisk together the egg and bread flour. Stir into the soup as it cooks.
Add clams and season to taste with salt and pepper, cook until clams are just firm, another 2 minutes.
