Ingredients:
5 c chicken broth
1 cooked chicken breast
1 (4.5 oz) pkg long grain wild rice with seasoning packet
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (opt)
1/4 c butter
1/3 c flour
2 c 2% milk

Directions:
Chop cooked chicken breast into small pieces.
Bring chicken broth, chicken, and rice (not the seasoning packet) to a boil in a large pan. Remove from fire and lid it.
In another smaller pan melt butter over medium heat. Add the seasoning packet, spices and flour to make a roux. You may need a bit more butter if flour doesn't stir in. Heat till bubbly, then add to the pan with the broth in it.
Wisk the roux into the broth completely. Stir the milk in, and cook over medium low heat til thickened. Rice should be cooked through also.
