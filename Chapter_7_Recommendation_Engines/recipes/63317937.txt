Description: 
I adapted this easy sandwich recipe after eating something similar at a local restaurant, relates Sara Schurtz Gonzalez of Phoenix, Arizona. Mayonnaise keeps the chicken so moist, and Parmesan cheese gives it delightful tang. TIP: Serve it with crispy chips for a satisfying yet not-too-heavy weekend lunch, Sarah advises.Modified from: Chicken Caesar Sandwiches
