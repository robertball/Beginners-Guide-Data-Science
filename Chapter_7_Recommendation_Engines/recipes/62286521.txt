Description: 
Originally, this recipe came from a Lipton Onion Soup Mix Package and it has evolved over the years.  My husband say's it's the best he's ever had and says that it makes him wanna slap his Mama.  What can I say, he's southern?!?  Honestly, though, it's never dry, it's full of flavor and always goes well with the typical mashed potatoes and corn side dish.  You don't even need gravy with this one!  I used to use Italian bread crumbs and then got the idea to use stuffing mix from Kraft foods.
