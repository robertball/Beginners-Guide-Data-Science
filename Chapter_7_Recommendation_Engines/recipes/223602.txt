Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
3 cups apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Prepare 2 loaf pans (8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pans) with cooking spray.
Mix flour, baking soda, salt, walnuts, and apples in a large bowl. Whisk oil, sugar, eggs, and cinnamon together in a small bowl; add to flour mixture and mix until just moistened. Evenly divide mixture between prepared loaf pans.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 90 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I am lucky enough to live in a small community whose school district still allows us to send home-baked goods with our children. My daughter is in 7th grade now, but her classmates still beg her to have her mom send this special treat. It's a beautiful quick bread your family, friends, and all the neighbor children will love.
