Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.  Roll each portion into a 16-in. x 8-in. rectangle.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over rectangles to within 1/2 in. of edges.  Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a short side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under.
Place seam side down in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans.  Cover and let rise for 30 minutes or until doubled.  Brush with butter.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Raisins give a delightful sweetness to this tender yeast bread, and cinnamon swirls beautifully through the slices. It makes terrific toast, too. -Ruth Crawford, Tucson, Arizona
