Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup minced onion
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) can salmon, drained and bones removed
2 cups cornflake crumbs, or more as needed
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced onion; cook and stir until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in flour and salt until combined. Add milk and stir until mixture is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat. Add salmon, 1 cup cornflake crumbs, and lemon juice. Stir until evenly mixed. Form mixture into crescents, pyramids, or any other shape you like. Roll patties in the remaining cornflake crumbs to coat. Transfer onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
