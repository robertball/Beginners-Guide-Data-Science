1/2 cup boiling water

Sift together the flours, cocoa and sugar in a large mixing bowl.
In a small bowl mix together oil, eggs, vanilla and milk.  Make sure the oil isn't hot when added as it will cook the eggs.

Allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Add the baking powder and mix well.
Add the hot water and mix well.
Pour into lined or greased cupcake moulds or  9" cake pan.

Description: 
I made this recipe after having tried many different gluten free and adapted versions of chocolate cake and not liking even one of them.  This uses coconut oil instead of butter or vegetable oils to give it a nice flavour.  Light and not too sweet this chocolate cake will fill that void since gluten left your diet!
