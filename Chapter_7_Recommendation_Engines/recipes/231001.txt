Ingredients:
4 pounds new red potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 large heads garlic, top third sliced off and discarded
1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
3 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Arrange potatoes in a large roasting pan; nestle garlic, cut sides up, between potatoes. Dot vegetables with butter and sprinkle with rosemary. Drizzle white wine and olive oil over vegetables; season with salt and black pepper.
Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are golden and crisp and garlic is soft when squeezed, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This wonderful dish is great for a cookout. I've even made it while camping, cooked over a charcoal grill. Squeeze the roasted cloves of garlic over your potatoes or on crusty buttered chunks of French bread. A taste sensation!
