Ingredients:
12 medium strawberries (about 1 3/4-2 cups roughly chopped berries)
2-3 Tbsp. sugar
1 (1 oz) box sugar-free instant vanilla pudding mix
6 oz. vanilla yogurt (strawberry is good too)
1 cup milk

Directions:
Remove stems from berries and pulse with 2 Tbsp. sugar in a food processor until completely smooth. Taste and add more sugar if needed. You should have just over a cup of puree. Set aside.
In a blender combine pudding mix, yogurt, and milk and blend until combined. Layer or swirl the pudding mixture with the strawberry mixture in popsicle molds and freeze until solid.
