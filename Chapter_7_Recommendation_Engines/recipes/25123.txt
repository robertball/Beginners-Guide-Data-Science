Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups white chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups chopped pistachio nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, shortening, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, oats, baking powder and baking soda; blend into the creamed mixture to form a dough. Fold in the white chocolate chips and pistachios. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
The usual goodness of chocolate chip cookies but made better by replacing the chips with white chocolate chips and adding chopped pistachios. These make a beautiful presentation.
