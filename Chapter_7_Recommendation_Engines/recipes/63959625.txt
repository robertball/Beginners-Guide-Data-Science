Ingredients:
•	4-5 slices of Bacon, cut into bite-sized pieces
•	1 ½ lbs. of Hamburger
•	1 onion, diced
•	6 small potatoes, peeled and cubed
•	1 cup of shredded or grated carrots
•	2 cloves of garlic, minced
•	1 4 oz. can of Green Chiles, diced
•	3 cups of water
•	Salt & Pepper, to taste
•	Lawry’s Seasoning Salt, to taste
•	1 ½ cups of Milk
•	Thickener:  ½ cup of Milk and 3 TB. Of Flour
•	1 ½ to 2 cups of Velveeta, cubed

Directions:
Cut up the bacon and put in a large soup pot to brown over medium heat. After it is half done, put in the hamburger. Break the burger up into little pieces while it cooks, blending it with the bacon. As the hamburger cooks, add the diced onion. Allow to cook together for a bit until the hamburger is brown. Add the potatoes, carrots, garlic, and green chiles. Stir together and cook for a few minutes. Add the water and seasonings. Allow to boil for a 15-20 minutes to allow the vegetables to soften. Add the milk and heat through. In the meantime, using a whisk mix up the thickener then slowly add it to the hot soup. Once mixed in, add the cubed Velveeta and allow to melt…stirring quite often. Once the cheese is melted, the soup is ready. Enjoy!

This is my husband's all-time favorite soup. It's hearty, very filling, and cowboy-approved. This is a great soup to make and serve on a cold winter day!
