Ingredients:
For the bean filling:
2 tsp. canola or vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. minced chipotle in adobo sauce
1 tsp. ground cumin
Â¼ tsp. kosher salt
Dash cayenne pepper
1/3 cup water, vegetable broth or chicken broth
1 (15 oz.) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 oz.) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
6 tbsp. fresh salsa
For serving:
6 (9- or 10-inch) flour tortillas, warmed
Shredded cheese
Diced tomatoes
Shredded romaine lettuce
Chopped green onions
Low-fat sour cream or Greek yogurt

Directions:
To make the bean filling:
heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the garlic, chili powder, chipotle, cumin, salt and cayenne; stir, cooking just until fragrant, 30-60 seconds.
Add the beans and the water or broth to the pan.
Bring the mixture to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the salsa and mash the mixture with a spoon or fork.
Spoon about a third of a cup of the bean mixture down the center of each tortilla.
Top each serving with a pinch of shredded cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, green onions and sour cream.
Roll the tortilla up tightly, burrito style, and serve immediately.
