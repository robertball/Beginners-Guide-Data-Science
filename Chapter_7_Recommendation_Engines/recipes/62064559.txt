Ingredients:
4-6 medium red potatoes, 6 to 8 medium sized carrots, 1 LB Hamburger, 1 medium onion, 2 cans vegatarian vegetable soup, salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Peal and dice potatoes, chop onion, brown hamburger and half of the onion, drain. place potatoes, carrots, other half of onion in pan with cold water to barely cover. Do not add salt to water and cook only until barely fork tender, save vegetable water. Over cooking vegetables will create mush. I say no long than 2 mn. on boil. combine vegetables, meat, vegetable soup, 1 1/2 to 2 cups water from the vegetables, salt and pepper to taste. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 mn. or until vegetables are done.
