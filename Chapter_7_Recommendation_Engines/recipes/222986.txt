Ingredients:
1/3 pound fresh linguine pasta
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 slices bacon
1 (3.5 ounce) link Italian sausage, casing removed
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 extra large eggs, beaten
6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided
2 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, divided (optional)
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fresh linguine and return to a boil. Cook until the pasta floats to the top, 2 to 3 minutes; drain and set aside.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook bacon, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble and set aside. Cook and stir sausage in the same skillet, until brown and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Return bacon to skillet and stir in garlic, 2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, green onions, garlic powder, oregano, seasoned salt, onion powder, salt, and black pepper; cook and stir just until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir cooked linguine into the bacon and sausage; toss lightly to combine. Stir eggs and 6 tablespoons Parmesan cheese into the pasta until eggs are set, about 2 minutes. Divide onto 2 serving plates and sprinkle each serving with 1 teaspoon parsley and 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese.
