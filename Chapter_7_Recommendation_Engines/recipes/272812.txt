Ingredients:
olive oil cooking spray
1 pound fresh asparagus
1/4 pound prosciutto
toothpicks
1 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
Bend asparagus spears and snap off tough ends. Wrap 3 to 4 spears with a slice of prosciutto and secure with a toothpick. Place bundles in the prepared baking dish. Drizzle some lemon juice and olive oil over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is crisp-tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil until prosciutto is crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle with more lemon juice after broiling.

Description: 
Asparagus doesn't need any help in my opinion, but a little prosciutto and lemon juice are wonderful little touches.
