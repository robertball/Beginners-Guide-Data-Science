1/3 cup canola oil (or a neutral flavor oil)
1/3 cup honey
1 teaspoon almond extract (vanilla works too)
1 cup dried fruit of your choice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300Â°F.
Mix oats, sugar, salt, nuts and cinnamon in a large bowl.
Heat honey and oil over med low heat until warm and combined- stir to help it along.
Remove from heat and add extract.
Pour over oats and mix to coat.
Pour onto a greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 40 miutes stirring halfway through- be sure not to over cook, granola will crisp while cooling.
Add dried fruit.

Description: 
I have tried many granola recipes and I keep coming back to my own version. I switch it up from time to time. I add different nuts and dried fruit combinations. This fills you up!! My family loves this with or without milk!
