Ingredients:
2 cup firm tofu (packaged in water)
2 tablespoons red wine or balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil (or peanut oil)
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 cup mixed vegetables of choice (frozen or fresh works. i used a frozen mix-pack of green beans, diced carrots, corn, soy beans)
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 clove peeled/chopped fresh garlic
1 teaspoon dried basil; other desired spices, to taste (suggestions: cayenne pepper, black pepper, thyme)

Directions:
1. Cut tofu into cubes, and place them evenly in non-stick pan over medium heat.
2. Add garlic, oil, and vinegar to gently fry.
3. Add vegetables and seasonings. Stir occasionally, careful not to break the tofu cubes.
4. If it starts to burn or stick to the pan, add more vinegar. A little bit of water can also be added at any time to keep from burning.
5. Stir in soy sauce. Top onto rice if desired. Enjoy!

Description: 
Who says vegan food has to be boring? This quick and easy recipe will have you drooling over this hearty [and healthy] dish of lightly fried tofu, rich spices, and yummy vegetables. Lightly frying the tofu and veggies in mostly red wine vinegar rather than all oil cuts the calories down tremendously. This dish is delicious! One of my favorites, and a crowd-pleaser. Goes great with rice.
