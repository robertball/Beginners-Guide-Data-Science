Ingredients:
1 gold pineapple, cored, peeled and cut lengthwise into 8 long spears
1/4 cup butter
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 cup coconut rum (optional)
1/3 cup heavy cream

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 400. Melt butter in a 9X13 pan. Place the pineapple spears in the pan, flat side down. Sprinkle with cloves.
2. Bake about ten minutes until butter become light golden. Remove the pan and sprinkle sugar over butter and stir until sugar melts. Bake an additional 15 minutes, or until a caramel sauce forms. Remove from oven again and add the coconut rum to pan and turn the pineapple spears over.
3. Return the pan to the oven for 15 minutes or until the pineapple is tender. Remove from oven and transfer  the pineapple to a plate. Add the cream to the sauce in the pan and stir over medium-high heat until the sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Pour the sauce over the pineapple and serve. Optional: Serve over vanilla ice cream.
