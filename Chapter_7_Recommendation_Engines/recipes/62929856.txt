Description: 
Inspired by Recipe#361967, I experimented and made up this cake for the two of us. I did try it with twice as much baking soda and baking powder, reduced them both to 1/8 as the cake touched the microwave ceiling and started to curve down-tasted fine but sure looked bizaar. Think it needs these ingredient so that you get a cake texture. I doubt that this recipe can be reduced and work out. Thank you especially to debbwl and diner524 for trying to help me improve this recipe for two.
