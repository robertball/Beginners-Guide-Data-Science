Ingredients:
½ cup milk
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to an even thickness
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
2 tablespoons dry white wine (optional)
1 ½ cups prepared chicken gravy
1 cup half-and-half
1 ½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour milk into a wide, shallow bowl. Spread flour into a separate wide, shallow bowl. Dip each chicken breast half into milk to coat; move to the dish with the flour and press chicken into flour to coat entirely.
Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Fry chicken in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a plate; drain fat from the skillet and return to medium-high heat.
Melt butter in the skillet. Saute mushrooms in hot butter until softened, about 2 minutes. Pour white wine over the mushrooms. Stir gravy, half-and-half, and mustard with the mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Bring the liquid to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.
Return chicken to the skillet and cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

This is a great easy recipe for last-minute guests or a busy weeknight when you want something a little special. You may want to double the sauce and serve it over rice.
