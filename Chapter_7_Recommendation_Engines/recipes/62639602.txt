Ingredients:
2 1/2 c all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 c turbinado, or raw sugar
1 c sugar
3/4 c unsalted butter, softened
1 large egg
1/4 c molasses

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a shallow bowl, place the turbinado sugar; set aside.
Beat butter and sugar until combined. Then beat in egg and molasses. Gradually mix in dry ingredients, just until a dough forms.
Pinch off and roll dough into balls, each equal to 1 tablespoon. Roll balls in turbinado sugar to coat.
Arrange balls on baking sheets, about 3 inches apart. Bake until edges of cookies are just firm, 12 to 17 minutes.
Cool 1 minute on baking sheets; transfer to racks to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container up to 4 days.
