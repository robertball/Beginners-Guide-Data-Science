Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
6 cups vegetable stock (I use Roasted Vegetable Stock from this site)
1 1/2 cups diced sweet potato
1 cup red lentils
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup diced carrots
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt & pepper
1/4 cup chopped cilantro

Directions:
In large pot saute the onions, garlic, and ginger in a little olive oil for about 5 minutes.
Add the vegetable stock, sweet potatoes, lentils, chick peas, diced tomatoes, carrots, celery, garam masala, cardamom, cayenne pepper and cumin. Bring to a boil for a few minutes then simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or longer, until the lentils are soft.
Puree half the soup in a food processor or blender. Return the pureed soup to the pot, stir and enjoy!  Season to taste with salt &amp; pepper and garnish with cilantro

Description: 
This original recipe is one of my favorites here.  Based on what I had on hand, I added sweet potatoes and omitted the white beans.  I also used Roasted Vegetable Stock from this site.  Black beans also go well with this, but I prefer not to puree them.Modified from: Moroccan Lentil Soup
