Ingredients:
2 or 1 lbs of beef tips (which ever you prefer)
2 family cans of cream of chicken
1 pack of Liption onion mix
1 1/2 cup of water
Box of Rice

Directions:
Cook the beef tips until brown, I usually cut them up in smaller pieces because it's usually not cut in small pieces.
Then in I mix the cream of chicken, liption onion package, and the beef tips together.
You can either put in a crock pot on Low all day while at work or you can put in a casserole dish, top with foil to keep the moisture in and bake in the oven @ 400 for about 4 hours; so the beef tips are tender.  To know when it's done the gravy will be a light brown color and will be thick, not watery.
Then cook the rice as directed.  I usually make 2 cups and whatever is left over I mix it together and put in the fridge for leftovers.  Easy to reheat in microwave.
Is also good with cresant rolls.
