Ingredients:
1/2 cup ground coffee beans
1 3/4 cups cold water
1/4 cup Kahlua (coffee-flavored liqueur), divided
1/2 cup mascarpone cheese
1 (8 ounce) package fat-free cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfingers
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa, divided

Directions:
Assemble drip coffeemaker according to manufacturer's directions. Place ground coffee in coffee filter or filter basket. Add cold water to coffeemaker; brew to make 11/2 cups. Combine brewed coffee and 2 tablespoons Kahlua in a shallow dish; cool.
Combine cheeses in a large bowl. Beat with a mixer at high speed until smooth. Add 2 tablespoons Kahlua and sugars; beat until well-blended.
Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise.
Quickly dip 24 ladyfinger halves, flat sides down, into coffee mixture. Place halves, dipped sides down, in the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish (halves will be slightly overlapping). Spread half of cheese mixture over ladyfingers; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon cocoa. Repeat procedure with remaining ladyfinger halves, coffee mixture, cheese mixture, and 1 teaspoon cocoa.
Place 1 toothpick in each corner of dish and 1 in the center of tiramisu (to prevent the plastic wrap from sticking to cheese mixture); cover with plastic wrap. Chill for 2 hours.
