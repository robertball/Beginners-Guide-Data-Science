Ingredients:
- 1 lb Italian pork sausage, in 1 inch pieces
- 1 small onion, chopped
- half a red pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon of flour
- 1 cup of water
- 1 package beef boullion powder

Directions:
Brown sausage in a pan over medium heat
Add onion and pepper to the pan. Fry until they are soft.
Stir in 1 tablespoon of flour, adding a little more if necessary to soak up the fat in the pan. Scrape the bottom of the pan to get the brown flavor mixed in.
Add boullion to 1 cup of water, stir. Mix in to the pan with the sausages.
Allow mixture to simmer for 10 minutes or until it reaches the desired consistency.
Serve over mashed potatoes.
