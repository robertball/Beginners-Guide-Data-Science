Ingredients:
8 ounces Genoa salami, cut into bite-size pieces
8 ounces sopressata or other hard salami, cut into bite-size pieces
8 ounces sharp provolone cheese, cut into bite-size pieces
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into bite-size pieces
2 large tomatoes, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (14 ounce) can artichokes, drained and cut into bite-size pieces
1/2 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
1/2 cup pitted and coarsely chopped Kalamata olives
1/4 cup pitted and chopped green olives
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
freshly-ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup shredded fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Combine the Genoa and sopressata salami, provolone, mozzarella, tomatoes, and artichokes in a bowl. Slice the roasted red peppers and add them to the bowl, along with about 3 tablespoons of their juice.
Mix in the chopped olives. Drizzle olive oil over the entire dish, followed by the red wine vinegar and black pepper. Salad can be made ahead of time and refrigerated until serving.
Tear the fresh basil leaves into bite-sized pieces and add them to the salad just before serving. Mix thoroughly and serve.

Description: 
After searching for a recipe for an antipasto salad that I had envisioned in my head, I gave up and just decided to create one myself. I made this dish for a party and everyone couldn't stop talking about it. The ratio of meat/cheese to veggies can be adjusted to taste.
