Ingredients:
2 cups Colby Cheese, finely grated
2 cups Monterey Jack Cheese, finely grated
8 oz   Cream Cheeese, softened
1 tsp  onion powder
1 tsp  garlic powder
4 tbsp mayo
8-10 dashes Worchestershire sauce
2 cups chopped pecans

Directions:
Before mixing ingredients, place pecans in a 11x8-inch shallow baking dish. Set aside.
In a large bowl, mix all cheeses, onion powder, garlic powder, mayo and worchestershire sauce together, thoroughly by hand.
Divide mixture in half. Taking each half and shaping into a log forms about 6-inches long. Then roll log into the pecans. Work into the pecans covering all areas, the log will be roughly 8-inches or longer when totally covered.
Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate over night. Serve with Ritz style crackers.

Description: 
Over the years I've found it easier to make this cheese ball recipe into a log for the slicing and puting on a Ritz cracker. You get the cheese and pecans with every bite. I always double this recipe when giving this as Christmas goodies for my neighbors. It's a recipe that's been past down to me by my mother and I believe her's as well.
