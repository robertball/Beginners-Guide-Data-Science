Ingredients:
1 whole Chicken
1/2  cup Pesto
1/2 cup Sun-dried tomatoes
1  cup Milk
Salt & Pepper to taste
Olive oil for sautéing
1 package Cooked pasta Penne, rotini, or bow-tie work well
Parmesan cheese freshly grated

Directions:
For Pesto (or use store-bought):
Toast a 1/2 cup of pine nuts and 2 whole garlic cloves in a dry pan over medium heat.
Add your toasted pine nuts and garlic to a food processor and add a large bunch of basil (stems removed), 2 tbs of olive oil,  2 tbs of parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste.
Process until combined. Freeze extra in a ziplock baggie for other recipes.
For Sun-Dried Tomatoes (or use store-bought):

For Chicken:
Heat your Instant pot on the normal setting for Sauté. Once hot, add olive oil to coat the bottom of the pot, about a tablespoon or so.
Salt and pepper both sides of a whole chicken and add it to the pot, breast side down. Brown the chicken for 5-7 minutes, then flip the chicken breast side up and continue browning for another 5 minutes and turn off the sauté function.
Add milk, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes. Rub some pesto over the chicken and mix the rest in with the milk and mix the sun-dried tomatoes up in the sauce as well.
Pressure cook on high for 25 minutes. Let rest 5-10 minutes when finished, then do a quick release.
Remove your chicken and take all the meat off of the bone and break it up into bite-sized pieces and discard the bones. Discard the bones and skin.
Put your chicken back into the sauce and stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste.
For Pasta:
Cook pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.
To Finish:
Add pasta to chicken and sauce and stir to combine. Serve in bowls with freshly grated parmesan cheese.
