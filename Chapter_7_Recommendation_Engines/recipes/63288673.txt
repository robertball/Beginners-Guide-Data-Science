Ingredients:
2 C vegetarian broth
2 T vegetarian oyster sauce (the kind made from mushrooms)
1 1/2 T sugar
2 T soy sauce
2 T corn starch
1/3 C cold water

Directions:
Stir all the ingredients EXCEPT the corn starch and water in a sauce pan and heat on medium high heat to boiling.  I prefer to use a wire whisk to make sure everything is blended nicely.
In a separate bowl combine the corn starch and water and use the whisk to completely disolve and combine them until they are smooth.
When the sauce comes to a boil, add the corn starch/water mixture to the sauce, stirring constantly.  Keep stirring and bubbling for one minute more, then remove from the heat.  The sauce should be quite a bit thicker than before.

Description: 
I use this brown sauce for Springfield style cashew chicken or Egg Foo Yung.  It tastes great with both.  It could easily be used as a sauce to top stir fried veggies and rice.  It's also very easy to make.
