Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped

1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn kernels
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG, or Accent flavor enhancer)

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and smoked sausage in the butter until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the corn and reduce heat to medium; cover and cook until the corn is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, monosodium glutamate, and pepper; toss to combine. Serve hot.
