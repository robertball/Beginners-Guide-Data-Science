1 medium red pepper, cut into strips
1 small onion, sliced
1 large sheet heavy-duty aluminum foil (20x12 inch)
1/2 cup A.1. Original Steak Sauce, divided

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium heat. Meanwhile, place peppers and onions in center of sheet of foil; drizzle with 1/4 cup of the steak sauce. Bring up foil sides, then double fold top and ends to seal packet, leaving room for air to circulate inside. Set packets aside. Mix meat and 2 tablespoons of the remaining steak sauce; shape into 4 patties.
Grill packets 2 minutes. Add meat patties; continue grilling 8 to 10 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender and burgers are cooked through, turning burgers over after 4 minutes and brushing with the remaining 2  tablespoons steak sauce.
