Ingredients:
•1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
•1/2 cup shortening or butter
•1 teaspoon vanilla extract
•2 Tablespoons milk
•3-4 cups powdered sugar
•14 Oreos, finely crushed in food processor

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream butter, shortening, vanilla, and milk.
Add powdered sugar until desired sweetness is achieved, anywhere between 3 and 4 cups. Mix in crushed Oreos until well combined.
If your frosting is too thick, add a tad more milk to thin. If it's too thin to pipe with, add more sugar until it's the texture you want.
This is enough buttercream to frost a layer cake or about 30 cupcakes
