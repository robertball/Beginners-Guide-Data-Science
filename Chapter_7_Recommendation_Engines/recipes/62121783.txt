Ingredients:
1 bag Ore-Ida Potatoes O'Brien
2 cans fat free chicken broth
1 package Pioneer Country Gravy

Directions:
Mix fat free chicken broth with Pioneer country gravy while it is still cold. Pour in the potatoes o'brien. Cook until potatoe are tender and the gravy thickens. I cook mine about 35-45 minutes. Be sure to stir often as to not scorch the potatoes. This also works in a crockpot.

Description: 
This is the best potato soup I've ever eaten. I thought it should definitely be shared with others.
