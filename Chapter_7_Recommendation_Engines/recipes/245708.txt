Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
2 teaspoons coconut oil
1/2 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup cooked red quinoa
1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable stock
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1/2 cup nutritional yeast
1/2 large lemon, juiced

Directions:
Fill a saucepan halfway with water; bring to a boil. Add asparagus and cook uncovered until tender but still crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.
Heat coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in cooked quinoa, vegetable stock, and turmeric; cook until flavors combine, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in blanched asparagus, nutritional yeast, and lemon juice; cook and stir, 3 to 4 minutes.
