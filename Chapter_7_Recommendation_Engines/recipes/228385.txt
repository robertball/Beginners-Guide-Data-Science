Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large onions, chopped
1 (12 ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1 (4 ounce) can roasted jalapeno peppers, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
4 cups diced tomatoes
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 (14.5 ounce) package tortilla chips
1 cup sour cream (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package shredded queso quesadilla (white Mexican cheese)

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in pressure cooker over medium heat; cook and stir onions until slightly softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add red peppers, jalapeno peppers, garlic, black pepper, and salt; cook until garlic is fragrant and onions are softened, about 5 more minutes. Stir tomatoes into onion mixture and cook until warmed, about 1 minute.
Transfer tomato mixture to a blender. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Transfer tomato puree back to pressure cooker.
Stir chicken stock into tomato puree; cook and stir over high heat until just boiling, about 5 minutes. Cover and lock pressure cooker. Cook over high heat until steam begins to build and steadily escapes. Lower heat to medium-low; cook for 20 more minutes. Remove from heat; allow all the steam to naturally release. Remove lid.
Bring soup to a boil; stir in cream and cilantro. Remove from heat. Let cool for 5 minutes.
Crush tortilla chips into serving bowls; pour soup over tortilla chips. Top with sour cream and queso quesadilla.
