Ingredients:
1 16oz. can of sauerkraut, preferably Bavarian style
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon brown or Dijon mustard
1/2 of a bottle of beer, about 6oz.
2 small tart apples, peeled and sliced
1 lb. smoked sausage like Kielbasa

Directions:
Drain sauerkraut.
In large saucepan, combine sauerkraut, brown sugar, mustard and beer.
Place sliced apples on top of sauerkraut mixture.
Layer sausage on  top of apples.
Cover pot and bring to a simmer over medium to low heat. Lower heat and continue to simmer for 20 to 30 minutes until apples are very tender and sausage is well heated. During simmer it will become easy to push sausage down into the liquid.
