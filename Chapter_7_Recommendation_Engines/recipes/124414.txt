Ingredients:
2 egg, beaten
1 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup shortening or bacon fat, melted
1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine eggs, milk and shortening. Sift together all remaining ingredients and add to egg mixture; stir only until blended. Pour into a greased 8-in. x 8-in. baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes, or until bread shrinks slightly from sides of the pan and begins to brown on the edges.

Description: 
'CORN BREAD just seems to go with chili, especially here in the Southwest, even though Mom's chili is considerably different than the kind that is normally served around here. Mom always made a fresh batch of corn bread when she'd cook up a pot of chili. It just didn't seem right to have one without the other.'
