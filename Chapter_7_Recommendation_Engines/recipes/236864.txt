Ingredients:
2 ounces golden trout roe
120 potato chips (such as PopChipsÂ®)
1/2 cup sour cream, or as needed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Spread potato chips on a flat surface. Spoon sour cream into a small resealable plastic bag. Press the sour cream into a corner and cut the corner of the bag off with scissors.
Pipe about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sour cream into the center of each chip. Top sour cream with about 1/2 gram trout caviar; garnish caviar with a few pieces of chopped chive.

Description: 
Of course this will work with any type of caviar. Having said that, when you consider value, it's hard to beat these golden beads. Trout roe has a fresh, clean, briny flavor, and an absolutely beautiful texture. The feeling of those little, subtly salty eggs popping on your tongue is one of life's great food experiences.
