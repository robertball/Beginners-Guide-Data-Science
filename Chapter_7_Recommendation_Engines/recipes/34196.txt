Ingredients:
1 ½ cups margarine
3 cups white sugar
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 cup rice flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
6  room-temperature eggs
2 cups lukewarm milk
2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
½ cup white sugar
¼ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a medium glass baking dish.
In a bowl, beat together margarine and 3 cups sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well. Combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, rice flour, and baking powder; add them alternately with the milk, stirring well between each addition. Slowly stir in Parmesan cheese. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
In a small bowl, mix the 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, and sesame seeds. Sprinkle evenly over the batter in the cake pan.
Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely, and cut into squares.
