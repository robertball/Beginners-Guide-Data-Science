Ingredients:
one round loaf of unsliced sourdough french bread.
2 bunches green onions, diced
1 cube butter, softened
3 cloves garlic, mined very well
1 package grated mozzarella cheese.

Directions:
Slice bread about 1 inch thick and then again cross ways, and only about 7/8 through to bottom (you should have nice little 1 inch squares that are held together at the bottom).  Lay two long pieces of foil in a cross pattern, and long enough to cover bread at top.  Place bread on foil and apply generous amount of butter between each cut, followed by green onions, garlic, and finish with mozzarella cheese.  Go ahead and use all the cheese!  Close up foil and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This should be called heart attack bread.  Sooo good, but probably not too good for you!
