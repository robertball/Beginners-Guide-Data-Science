Ingredients:
3/4 c. packed brown sugar
1/4 c. butter, melted
3 20 oz. cans sliced pineapple rings
1 jar maraschino cherries
2 packages yellow cake mix
6 eggs
2/3 c. vegetable oil
2 c. reserved pineapple juice in place of water

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and butter with a fork, until completely combined. Using the smallest Pampered Chef scoop, spoon mixture into 24 Texas muffin pans. (This larger size muffin pan fits the pineapple better.) Place one pineapple ring in each cup over the brown sugar mixture.  Place a cherry in the center.
In a large mixing bowl, combine cake mix, eggs, oil and reserved pineapple juice (if not enough pineapple juice to measure 2 cups, add water until 2 cups of liquid is attained). Mix according to package directions.  Fill each cup 2/3 full.  Bake at 350Â° for 20-24 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.
Immediately invert onto wire racks to cool.
