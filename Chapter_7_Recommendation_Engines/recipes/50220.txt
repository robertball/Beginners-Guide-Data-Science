Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dried black-eyed peas, soaked overnight
1/3 cup chopped celery, with leaves
1 1/2 cups shredded carrot
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped white onion
1/8 cup chopped fresh mint
Dressing:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 oranges, juiced
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 garlic clove, pressed
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon brown sugar

Directions:
Place the beans in a saucepan with enough water to cover them by one inch. Bring beans to a slow boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender but not mushy (about 35 minutes). Set aside to cool.
When the beans have cooled, place them in a large bowl. Add the celery, carrots, parsley, white onion, and mint; toss to blend.
For dressing, blend olive oil, orange and lemon juice, garlic, coriander, salt, pepper, and brown sugar in a blender for 6 seconds. Transfer to a small saucepan, and simmer over low heat for five minutes. Remove from heat, and cool. Pour dressing over the bean salad, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This recipe was actually a bit of a fluke, the result of what my sister had in her refrigerator when I went to visit. The bottom line is that the ingredients of this salad blended together into a heavenly combination that was devoured immediately! Hope you enjoy it!
