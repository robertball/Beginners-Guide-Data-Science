Ingredients:
Large Marshmallows
Snyder Pretzel Nuggets (or similar)
Wilton Candy Melts (or similar)

Directions:
Each marshmallow will make one fluffy bite.
Using a knife, cut a slit in each marshmallow to fit the pretzel nugget.
Press the pretzel nugget into the hole you've made.
Place 5 of the candy melts into a zip top bag and microwave on 50% for one minute. Squish the bag to mix the candy around, microwave another 30 seconds if needed.
Cut a corner of the bag off and drizzle the candy over the bites. (use a larger cut if you want a thicker drizzle).
Let cool and serve!
