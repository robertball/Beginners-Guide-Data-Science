1 (.4 ounce) packet vegetable soup mix

1/4 cup minced fresh parsley

Cook tortellini according to package directions. Meanwhile in a large skillet, saute garlic in oil until tender. In a small bowl, combine the soup mix and cream; stir into skillet.
Drain tortellini; add to cream mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 4-5 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally. Add the parsley, cheese and pepper. Cook 3-4 minutes longer or until cheese is melted.

Description: 
An envelope of vegetable soup mix lends flavor to the simple cream sauce that coats this rich pasta entree. I like to garnish it with additional mozzarella cheese and parsley.
