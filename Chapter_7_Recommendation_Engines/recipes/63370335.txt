Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped onion
3 tsp beef bouillon granules (or 3 cubes)
8 oz gluten-free lasagna noodles broken into one-inch pieces (about 8)
1 cup sour cream (about 8 oz)
2 Tbsp rice flour
1/4 tsp ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet with a lid, saute meat with garlic and onion over medium heat until the meat is brown and the onion is tender and translucent.
Add 5 cups of water and bouillon to the skillet. Bring to a boil.
Add the lasagna noodles; return to a boil. Reduce the heat and cover. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the noodles are tender and water is absorbed.
Meanwhile, combine the sour cream, rice flour, 2 Tbsp of water and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside.
When the noodles are done, add the sour cream mixture
to the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until bubbly. Continue for one more minute.
