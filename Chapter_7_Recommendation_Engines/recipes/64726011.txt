Ingredients:
•	1.5 pounds bosc pears, washed
•	2 tbsp lemon juice
•	1 egg
•	1/4 cup milk
•	1 cup whole wheat flour
•	3/4 tsp baking powder
•	2 tbsp cane sugar
•	2 tbsp brown sugar
•	3 tbsp cold butter, cut into cubes
•	2 tbsp corn starch
•	1/4c cane sugar

Directions:
1.	Preheat the oven to 400 F. Butter a round 9” x 2” 6-cup deep baking dish.
2.	Fill half-way a large bowl with water and add the lemon juice. Peel all but one of the pears. Core and cut all the pears into eighths. Add the slices to the water to keep them from browning.
3.	Mix together the egg and the milk. Set aside.
4.	In a mixing bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, cane sugar, and brown sugar. Cut in the butter with a fork until it resembles pebbles.
5.	Drain the pears. Sprinkle the corn starch and 1/4 cup cane sugar over the pears. Toss to coat.
6.	Pour the milk and egg into the flour/butter mixture. Mix until just combined. Add the pears to the prepared baking dish. Drop the batter by spoonful onto the top of the pears.
7.	Bake for 25 minutes or until browned on top. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A rustic batter is dropped onto fresh pears before being baked for a healthy dessert. Using less sugar than most recipes I’ve seen, the crisp flavor of the pears is highlighted. My family and I enjoy this at breakfast. I leave one or two of the pears unpeeled to add a bit or color.
