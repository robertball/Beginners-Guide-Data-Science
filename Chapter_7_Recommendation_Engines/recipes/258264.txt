Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and line a round cake pan with parchment paper.
Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir vanilla extract into creamed butter mixture.
Sift flour and baking powder into creamed butter mixture and stir until batter is well mixed. Spoon batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
Cool cake in the cake pan for 10 to 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
