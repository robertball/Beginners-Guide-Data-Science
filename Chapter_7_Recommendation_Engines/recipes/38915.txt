Description: 
Normally Chai has tea in it, but this beverage doesn't miss it at all. When I lived in Holland, this drink was a staple in the diet of a bunch of hippies who lived in and around a squatted building known as 'De Elf.'  Sadly, the building was closed a year after I left the country, but if you combine the taste of this drink with the smell of musky smoke and Nag Champa incense, you're halfway to recreating the atmosphere.  Enjoy...
