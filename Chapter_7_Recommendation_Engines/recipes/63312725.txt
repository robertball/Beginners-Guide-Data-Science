Ingredients:
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 tsp. minced fresh garlic
12 cups of kale- about the amount that is in a large bag of pre-washed spinach. Wash and then gently pat dry or use a salad spinner to get rid of excess water)
1/4 cup water
1/2 to 1 tsp. Better than Bouillon vegetable base
Splash or two of soy sauce ( can also use reduced sodium soy sauce)
Dash or two of ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil over med-high heat in large saute pan or non-stick frying pan. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add kale. You can tear into smaller pieces or leave whole as I do. Depending on the kind of kale you have, you may want to remove any thick stalks first. You may have to add kale in batches, adding more as the leave wilt down.
Saute the kale, stirring frequently. Just as it is beginning to wilt, add the 1/4 cup water with the vegetable base, stir into the kale. The water/base will cook down quite quickly. When it is reduced, in perhaps 1-2 minutes, reduce heat, and stir in 1-2 splashes of soy sauce and dash or two of black pepper. Serve immediately.

Description: 
An abundance of kale had me experimenting on ways to use this delicious, nutritious leafy green. I have yet to have any leftovers- no matter how much I make! If sodium is an issue you might want to substitute low-sodium soy sauce and vegetable base.
