Ingredients:
1 stick unsalted butter, softened
1 c. light brown sugar
2 T. whole milk
1 c. All-Purpose flour
1 t. baking powder

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar for 2 minutes. Add milk and baking powder. Slowly add flour to butter mixture. Form into a 2? diameter log and wrap in wax paper. Chill at least 2 hours. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°. While the oven is preheating, slice each cookie about 1/4? thick and place on a parchment lined baking pan. Leave space around each cookie as they will spread. Bake 7-9 minutes or until golden. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the pan. They get crispier as they cool.  Store in an airtight container.
