Ingredients:
275g all-purpose flour
150g white sugar
Pinch of salt
Teaspoon of vanilla
115g butter
50g vegetable shortening
Zest from 2 oranges
Juice from 1 orange, chilled
Tablespoon confectioners sugar
Good quality fruit mincemeat.

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350degrees F
Place flour in a bowl with the salt. Add the butter and shortening and cut into the flour. Sift through the mixture with cold fingers until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Add sugar and orange zest and mix thoroughly. Mix in vanilla. Add just enough chilled orange juice to form a dough: it should not be sticky. Knead quickly into a smooth ball. Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 1 hour.
When ready to make pies, roll approx half the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out 12 2.5" diameter circles (size depending upon tart tin) and 12 1" diameter circles for pie tops
Line tart tins using the 2.5" pastry circles. Fill each pastry cup with about 1 tablespoon of mincemeat filling and top with 1" pastry circles. The 1" topping allows the filling to be visible in the finished pies.
Bake pies in preheated oven until tops are pale golden brown, 17 to 21 minutes. Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with confectioners sugar just before serving.
