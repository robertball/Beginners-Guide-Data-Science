Ingredients:
5 large potatoes, washed and sliced thin, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, thyme (season according to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°.
Wash potatoes and cut into thin slices leaving skin on (similar to a potato chip).
On a large baking sheet, arrange potatoes into rows.  With a barbecue brush, brush butter on top of all potatoes until butter is gone.  Sprinkle garlic powder, salt, pepper, and thyme until all potatoes are covered.
Bake for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender.  Bake an additional 10 minutes if a more crisp potato is desired.
