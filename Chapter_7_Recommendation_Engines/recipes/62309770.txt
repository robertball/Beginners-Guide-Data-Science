Ingredients:
1 large head cauliflower, broken into florets
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tbsp. olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 stalk celery, chopped
2 small carrots, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
2 bay leaves
2 cups chicken stock
2 tbsp. fresh parsley, chopped
2 tbsp. butter (I use Smart Balance 50/50 Blend)
2 cups skim milk
1 tbsp. flour
Sour cream for serving (about 1/4 cup)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Toss together cauliflower, garlic and olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a baking dish and bake for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is just starting to brown. (Will be somewhat crisp-tender)
Meanwhile, heat the other tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven. Add celery, onion and carrot and saute until onion is translucent, about 15 minutes.
When cauliflower is ready, add to the skillet along with chicken stock and parsley; bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer another 15 minutes.
In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Whisk flour into the milk and add slowly to the butter, whisking constantly. Increase heat and bring to a boil, whisking until thick. Remove from heat and pour into the cauliflower mixture.
Simmer another 10 minutes, mashing cauliflower slightly if desired.
Ladle into serving dishes and stir in about 1 tbsp into each serving.

Description: 
I took Garlic Roasted Cauliflower from this site and used it as a base for soup.  I was inspired by Pioneer Woman's Mom's Cauliflower Soup recipe, but wanted to cut the fat and calories.  This came out really well, and is a great less guilt version of yummy cauliflower soup!
