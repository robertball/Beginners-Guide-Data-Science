Ingredients:
5 zucchini, sliced
5 cups water
7 cubes chicken bouillon
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened and cut into 4 sections

Directions:
Stir zucchini, water, and chicken bouillon cubes together in a stock pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, place a cover on the pot, and simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is tender, about 20 minutes.
Drop cream cheese into the soup; cook and stir until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
Blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth.

This is a fast and easy soup that I keep on hand at all times. Great for when an unexpected guest comes over.  Inexpensive and freezes well, too. Warms your belly on those chilly days of winter.
