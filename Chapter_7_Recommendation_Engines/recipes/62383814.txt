Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
4 slices thin deli ham
2 oz. shredded pepper jack cheese
taco seasoning
Foe the Sauce:
1/2 pint half and half or light cream
1 tbs. butter
1 tbs. flour
6 oz. shredded pepper jack cheese
1 tbs. chipotle adobo sauce or Chipotle Tabasco to taste
Garnish:
chili powder or paprika
chopped cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Cut a pocket in the breasts and stuff in the ham and 2 oz. cheese, place in baking pan. Sprinkle on dry taco seasoning. Cove and bake for 1/2 hour. Save the juices from the chicken. Make a roux: melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, gradually add the cream until thickened. Stir in the rest of the cheese. If it is too thick, add some of the juices. Sprinkle on some chili powder and top with cilantro.
