Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth, divided
4 cups crumbled cornbread
5 biscuits, crumbled
1/2 cup margarine, melted
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 small onion, finely chopped
3 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon sage
1 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large saucepan, bring the chicken broth to a boil.
In a large bowl combine the crumbled cornbread and biscuits.  Pour in 3 cups of boiling broth; cover and let stand.
Meanwhile, heat margarine in a medium skillet over medium heat.  Saute celery and onions until tender.  Stir into cornbread mixture.
To the cornbread mixture add the remaining broth, eggs, sage and black pepper.  Pour into a large iron skillet or roasting pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until set and well browned.
