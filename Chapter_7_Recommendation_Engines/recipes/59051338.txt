Description: 
This Mac and Cheese is FANTASTIC!! It stays rich and creamy with no fear of drying out.  I used store brand elbow macaroni and bought my cheese in a 5# block and grated it myself.  This recipe does not need the added price of the Parmesan cheese to make this the ultimate comfort food recipe.Modified from: Homemade Mac and Cheese
