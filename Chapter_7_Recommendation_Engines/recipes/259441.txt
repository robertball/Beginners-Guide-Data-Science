Ingredients:
1 cup fresh basil leaves, or more to taste
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons diced garlic
2 tablespoons pine nuts
1 pinch cayenne pepper
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti

Directions:
Place basil, creme fraiche, Parmesan cheese, garlic, pine nuts, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Puree until pesto is smooth.
Transfer pesto to a saucepan. Cook over low heat until heated through but not boiling, 15 to 20 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and mix spaghetti into the pesto.

Description: 
Not to be confused with actual pesto, this sauce is pesto in name only. Creme fraiche makes it something completely different and equally enjoyable. The extra garlic in the sauce ensures that there'll be no kissing tonight, but it's totally worth it! The pinch of cayenne can be omitted, but in doing so, you take away some of the zing. 

I suggest serving it on pasta mixed into the sauce, but this sauce would be equally at home on a chicken dish. Chicken and pasta? Even better. Delicious and simple, so your grocery store will have everything, but if you grow your own garlic and basil and make the creme fraiche and pasta yourself at home, you will have elevated the dish from fantastic to exquisite.
