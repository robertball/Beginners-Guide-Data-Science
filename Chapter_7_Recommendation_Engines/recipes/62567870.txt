Ingredients:
4-5 quarts water (about 18-20 cups)
2 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts with rib meat
1 can cream of chicken soup
2/3 can cream of celery soup
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
2 1/2 cups of peeled and sliced carrots (about 5 carrots)
1 1/2 cups chopped celery (about 3 ribs), leaves reserved and also chopped
1 small finely chopped yellow onion
5 cubes chicken bouillon cubes
2 cups hot water
6 oz. broad egg noodles
salt and pepper to taste
pinch of garlic salt

Directions:
1.In an 8 quart stock pot bring 4-5 quarts of water to a boil. Add the chicken breasts to water, boiling until cooked through.
2.Remove chicken breasts from water and set aside to cool. Skim fat and foam from the top of the water and discard.
3. Add both the cream of chicken and cream of celery to the water, stir until disolved. Add carrots, onion and parsley to the water.
4. Dissolve the bouillon cubes in 2 cups of hot water and add to the pot. Add salt, pepper, and garlic salt.
5. Remove skin from the chicken and pull the meat from the bones. Pull apart the meat and separate it in to strips or chunks of your preference. Add the meat, celery and chopped celery leaves to the soup.
6. Once carrots are most of the way cooked and soft, add the noodles to the soup. Cook until noodles are al dente and remove from heat. Noodles will soften up a little more after soup is removed from heat.
