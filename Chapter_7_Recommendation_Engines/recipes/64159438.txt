Ingredients:
1/2 pound sausage, browned
1/8 cup chopped onion
3 plain bagels
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
12 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place the sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and set aside. Slice each bagel into 4 thin slices.
Arrange 6 bagel slices in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with the bacon and onion mixture, followed by the Cheddar cheese. Top with remaining bagel slices.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, parsley, and pepper. Pour the egg mixture over the bagel layers. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Uncover the chilled bagel dish, and bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, or until eggs are firm. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and serve warm.
