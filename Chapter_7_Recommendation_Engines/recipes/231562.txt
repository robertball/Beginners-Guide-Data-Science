Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon milk
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 cup self-rising flour
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch square baking dish.
Combine butter and milk in a large saucepan over low heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until butter melts, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat. Stir brown sugar and egg into the butter mixture.
Sift flour into the butter mixture; stir. Add walnuts and vanilla extract; stir. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Cut into 2-inch squares to serve.
