Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free pancake mix
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
2 tablespoons white sugar
2/3 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup raspberry jam
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine the pancake mix, butter, and sugar; mix until crumbly. Stir in 2/3 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and mix until fully incorporated. The dough will be sticky.
Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the baking sheet, spacing the dough about 2 inches apart. With the back of a teaspoon, make a shallow indentation in the center of each dough ball. Fill the centers with a teaspoon of jam.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow the pastries to cool.
Combine the confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons of milk, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and mix until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the Danish.

Description: 
My husband says these are the closest thing to 'real' Danish he has had since going gluten-free five years ago. We like raspberry jam, but you could also try pie filling in the middles.
