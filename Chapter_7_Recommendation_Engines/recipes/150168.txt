Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup long-grain white rice
1 pound rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 dash ground nutmeg
2 eggs, separated

Directions:
Place the water into a saucepan, add the rice, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir once, cover, reduce heat to low; and simmer until all moisture is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the rutabaga into a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until the rutabaga are tender and can be pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish.
Drain the rutabaga, and place into a mixing bowl. Add the milk, butter, sugar, salt, pepper, and ground nutmeg. Beat or mash the rutabaga until smooth. Stir in the cooked rice, and beat in the egg yolks.
Beat the egg whites in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold gently into the rutabaga mixture. Spoon mixture into prepared casserole dish.
Bake in preheated oven until top is lightly browned, about 1 hour.
