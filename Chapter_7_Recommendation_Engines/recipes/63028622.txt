Ingredients:
1/2 lb. of steak, cubed (inexpensive cut suggested)
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
4 onions minced or juiced
4 29 oz cans tomato sauce
2 6 oz cans tomato paste
2 cups beef stock
4 tbsp sugar
4 bay leaves
1 tsp garlic, minced
1/2 tbsp dried Marjoram or Oregano
1/2 tbsp dried Thyme
1/2 tbsp dried Basil
1 tsp dried Sage
1/2 tsp dried Rosemary
1 tsp Paprika
1 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Pepper

Directions:
In a large pot place the olive oil and steak cubes then brown on medium high.
If the onions are minced add them and the salt then saute until the onions are soft.  If the onions are juiced then add it in the next step.
Add all the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer covered for four hours stirring occasionally.
If you will be serving meatballs and/or Italian sausage with the sauce then brown them and add to the pot some time during the first hour of the simmer.
Remove and discard the bay leaves before serving.
