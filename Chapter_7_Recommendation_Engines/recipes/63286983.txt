Ingredients:
2 green onions, sliced
1/4 c. diced yellow onions
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
6 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 cup cubed cooked corned beef
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese or swiss or provolone
Dash pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute the onions in butter. In a bowl, lightly beat eggs and milk; pour over the onions. Cook over medium heat; as the eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath.
When the eggs are nearly set, sprinkle with the corned beef, cheese and pepper. Remove from the heat; cover and let stand for 1-2 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Cut into wedges.

Description: 
'I was raised on a farm, where we had chickens as well as other farm animals, so ate a lot of egg dishes,' recalls Kitty Jones of Chicago, Illinois. 'We usually serve this simple omelet for breakfast with toast on the side.'Modified from: Corned Beef Omelet
