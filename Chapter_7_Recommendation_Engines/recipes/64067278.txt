Description: 
The problem with most homemade ice cream is a gritty texture from ice crystals.  Many recipes overcome this by using more cream, since the extra fat prevents this.  This recipe, however, uses milk powder to absorb excess liquid, which makes for smooth, professional ice cream without all the extra fat.
