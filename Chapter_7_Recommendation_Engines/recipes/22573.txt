Description: 
This recipe is truly a family favorite. I don't know any one else that makes this. I think my father-in-law invented it. When people had little money they used whatever was at hand. My father used to say 'one will never starve if they have potatoes, onions, and a loaf of bread.' This is a typical peasant recipe that was made when times were not as affluent as they are today. Really good on a cold snowy day.
