Ingredients:
2-10 ounch packages of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 package of Knorr Vegetable Soup mix
1-16 oz container of sour cream
1-cup of best foods mayonnaise
1-8oz bar of cream cheese, softened and cut into cubes
3 tbs dried dill

Directions:
In large mixing bowl combine all ingredients until smooth, and place in refrigerator for 2 hours.  Once vegetables from the soup mix are tender, serve in a bread bowl or with baguette slices.  This is my mother's recipe and the whole family adores it.  Best of all, it's about as easy as you can get.
