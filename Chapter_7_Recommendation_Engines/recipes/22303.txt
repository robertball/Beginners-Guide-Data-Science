Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 cup milk
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Mix in the butter, sugar and salt; stir until melted. Let cool until lukewarm.
In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture, milk mixture, whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour; stir well to combine. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
Deflate the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces and form into football-shaped oval. Place the rolls onto lightly greased baking sheets. Brush rolls with melted butter, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm.
