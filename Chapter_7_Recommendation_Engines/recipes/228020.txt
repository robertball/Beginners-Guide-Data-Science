Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup flax seed meal
1/2 cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 banana, mashed
1/4 cup rice milk
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x10-inch baking pan.
Mix oats, brown sugar, flax seed meal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Mix banana, rice milk, egg, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Pour banana mixture into flour mixture; stir to combine. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake brownies in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cover pan with a towel to hold in moisture and cool brownies for at least 5 minutes before serving.
