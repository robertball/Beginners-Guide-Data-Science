Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
2 teaspoons strawberry extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup milk
1/2 cup pureed fresh strawberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cover the bottoms of one 8-inch springform pan and one 9-inch spring form pan with parchment paper or grease and lightly flour.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a large measuring cup.
Beat butter, sugar, eggs, strawberry extract, and vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl until smooth.
Stir flour mixture, 1 cup at a time, and milk, 1/3 cup at a time, into butter mixture until a well-blended batter forms; stir strawberry puree into batter.
Pour batter into prepared springform pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes.
