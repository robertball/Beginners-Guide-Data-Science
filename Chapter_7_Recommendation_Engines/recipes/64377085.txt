Ingredients:
1/4c cornmeal
1/2c brown rice flour
1/8 tsp. salt (you can reduce or keep out)
a few grinds of black pepper
1/8 tsp. baking powder (no salt baking powder if you have)
1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper (you can leave this out too if you want)
1/2c water (start out with just under and add more if needed)
1/2 red bell pepper chopped fine
1 tsp. chopped garlic
1c frozen corn that is thawed. (I just put in a strainer and ran hot water on it for a minute)
2 stalks of green onion chopped

Directions:
Whisk first 7 ingredients together until smooth. Don't add extra water at this point.
Add into mix the last 4 ingredients. Mix it all together well.
Let sit for 5 minutes and mix again. If it is too thick, add a little more water.
Heat up a large, non-stick pan over medium/high heat while the mix is sitting. You want the pan to be hot. Scoop a couple of spoonfuls of the mixture into the hot pan and press down with the back of the spoon. I made mine about 4 inches in diameter. Cook on the first side for about 3 minutes, or until just golden. Turn and do the same for about 2 minutes. Mine got a slight brown crust on them.
Keep warm and serve with sweet ketchup.
