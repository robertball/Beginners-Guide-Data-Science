Ingredients:
- Self-raising flour; 225 gms (8 ounces)
- Baking powder; 2 teaspoons
- Butter; 100 gms (4 ounces)
- Sugar; 50 gms (2 ounces)
- Egg; 1, beaten
- Full milk; about 2 Tablespoons
- Sultanas; 75 gms (3 ounces)
- Currants; 75 gms (3 ounces)
- Demerara sugar (brown sugar, coarse grained) for finishing

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 200°C (400°F) and lightly grease two large baking sheets.
Mix the flour, baking powder, butter, sugar, egg and milk into a stiff mixture.
Add the sultanas and currants and mix well.
Spoon out (with 2 teaspoons) the mixture to make 12 cakes (you can do them smaller, but reduce the cooking time to accomodate if you do) on each baking sheet.
Sprinkle over the top with the brown sugar.
Put both baking trays into the oven, one above the other, and bake for about 8 minutes, before swapping the two trays round.
Another 8 minutes should complete the job, so you should cook until just beginning to brown at the edges.
Cool on a wire rack.
