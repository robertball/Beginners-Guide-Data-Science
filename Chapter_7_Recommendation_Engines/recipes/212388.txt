Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container cottage cheese
1/4 cup matzo meal
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
40 whole saltine crackers
2 eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Stir together the cottage cheese, matzo meal, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Place about 1 tablespoon of the cheese filling onto a cracker, top with another cracker, and press down. Set the filled crackers aside. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip both sides of each filled cracker in the beaten egg, then place into the hot oil. Pan-fry the cracker snacks on both sides until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve hot.

Description: 
My Jewish grandma used to make homemade cheese blintzes, which are crepes. I adapted this for my family as a snack. Making crepes can be tedious; these are wonderful.
