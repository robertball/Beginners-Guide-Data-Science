Ingredients:
2 lbs of Fresh Tuna steak or Tuna steak nuggets
1/2 cup lemon juice (fresh squeezed if you like)
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 teaspoons garlic salt
A sprinkle of True Lime powder
Fresh crack pepper to taste
A Large skillet

Directions:
1. Combine all the ingredients with Tuna in a ziplock bag, or you can use the plastic bag the fish came in (just be sure to it doesn't have any holes.) Massage the marinade into the fish for about a minute using the bag to keep you hands clean. Let stand at least 10 minutes. This is a good step to do before you cook all your sides.
2. Preheat a large skillet.  Make sure the pan is HOT before placing the tuna in it. Super important for good searing with a rare pink center.  Throw plastic bag away.
3.  Place tuna in pan.  Don't touch it, I mean it and I know you want to; once you've put it down for at least 1 minute 30 seconds (2 if your capable of being patient.)  You want a dark brown almost black edge on the meat before turning it.  A little bit of smoke is okay too so don't worry. Sear as many sides as you like.  (or just the 2 if you have steaks)
SERVE IMMEDIATELY - always best to save the searing for the very last step in your meal.

Description: 
I used this on some Tuna nuggets that were on sale and I was shocked at how good they came out.  I didn't use ginger my first time around but I think it would have gone well with this recipe.
