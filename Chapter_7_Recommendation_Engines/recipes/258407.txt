Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (15 ounce) can HORMEL® Mary Kitchen® Corned Beef Hash
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
Salsa for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Separate crescent rolls and arrange them on the parchment paper in a circle with the short sides of triangles forming a 4-inch circle; overlap the edges of the pieces. Press dough where it overlaps to flatten.
Whisk eggs, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl.
Melt butter on medium low heat in a nonstick pan. Add chopped red peppers and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs. Gently scramble, pushing and lifting eggs until just set, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat vegetable oil on medium heat in a nonstick pan.  Add Hormel Corned Beef Hash. Cook and stir until heated through and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
Spoon corned beef hash around the crescent roll ring. Top with 1/2 cup shredded cheese and scrambled eggs. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese.
Pull the points of each triangle over the hash, eggs, and cheese and carefully tuck under the center to form a ring. Some areas will have exposed filling.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, about 20 to 25 minutes.
Let cool 3 minutes before serving. Serve with salsa.
