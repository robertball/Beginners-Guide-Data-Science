Ingredients:
CRUST:
2 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1 1/2 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups butter or margarine, softened
FILLING:
1 jar Smucker's® Caramel Spoonable Ice Cream Topping
3 tablespoons Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour
1 (6 ounce) package semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13x9-inch pan. Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl, combine all crust ingredients; mix at low speed until crumbly. Reserve half of crumb mixture (about 3 cups) for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture in bottom of greased pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine caramel topping and 3 tablespoons flour; blend well.
Remove partially baked crust from oven. Sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts. Drizzle evenly with caramel mixture. Sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
Return to oven; bake an additional 18 to 22 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 1 hour or until completely cooled. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or until filling is set. Cut into bars.
