Ingredients:
1 egg
1/3 cup water
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
1.In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Mix in the water.
2.In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the center of the mixture and slowly pour in the egg and water. Mix well. If the mixture is too dry, increase the amount of water one teaspoon at a time until a pliable dough has formed.
3. Take your dough and feed it thru your pasta machine, just like you would Italian pasta noodles until you have the noodles to the desired thickness.
Cut pieces into desired sizes.
