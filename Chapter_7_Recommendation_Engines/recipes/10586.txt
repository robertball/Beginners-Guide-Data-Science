Description: 
My mother made these all year round, she would just change the color of sugar in which they were dipped.  Consider putting a small amount of powdered drink mix (e.g.. Kool-Aid crystals) in white sugar to get different colors, and a little flavor. (Don't omit the sugar or the flavor will be too strong. )
