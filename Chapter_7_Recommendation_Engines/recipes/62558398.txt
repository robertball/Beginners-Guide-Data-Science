Ingredients:
1 stick butter or margerine
1t. black pepper
1t. sea salt or kosher salt
4 Celery stalks- chopped (medium or fine)
4 Garlic Cloves- minced
1/2 Lg. white or yellow onion
1-12oz bag dried stuffing cubes (plain or herb seasoned)
1t. ground sage
1/4 C. dried parsley
1t. dried thyme
1t. dried basil
1/2 t. onion powder
1/2 t. garlic powder
2 eggs slightly beaten
2 C. Chicken or Vegetable broth (I have used boullion cubes/water before and works just as well)
non-stick cooking spray or 1 t. margering or butter

Directions:
In a skillet or flat bottom pan, saute onion, garlic and celery in 1 stick of butter or margerine. Add pepper and salt. Saute until onion and celery are tender. Add 2 C. of broth (or the boullion liquid) and simmer 10 minutes.  Mix dry ingredients in a Lg. mixing bowl, stir in slightly beaten eggs and sauted mixture and blend well.  Turn out stuffing mixture into a "greased" (ergo the cooking spray or magerine/butter) cassarole dish.  Bake covered at 350 degrees for 25 to 35 minutes. Bake uncovered for top to be "crunchier".  This reciepe can also be used to stuff the turkey and the remainder baked in a small cassarole dish or pie pan.
