Fill each mushroom cap w/about 1T sausage mixture. Place filled caps on foil-lined 15x10x1-in baking pan. In sm. bowl, stir together the panko, dried basil, salt and pepper. Add oil and toss to combine. Sprinkle some of the panko mixture over each stuffed mushroom. Bake in 400 oven for 18 to 20 min. or until topping is golden.
