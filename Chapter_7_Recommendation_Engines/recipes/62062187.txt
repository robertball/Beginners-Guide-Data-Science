2 lbs stewing beef cubed

Pressure cooker is king! Start by removing the internal base, and cook directly in the bottom of the pot. Add the oil and diced onions and add the beef, brown the beef. Once beef is browned add the 2 cups  of water and the boullion cubes and carrots. Slap on the lid and the bobbley thing and let is start to sizzle on high, once the sizzleing begins time the 20 mins and reduce heat to medium.
Peel and cut the potatoes and boil them separately. Should take also 20 mins.
When the 20 mins on the pressure cooker are up, carefully pick up the pot and put it in the sink and run cool water over the lid until the pressure releases you can then open the pot.
Place pot back in medium heat and bring to a boil, add the corn start to a bit of water in a glass to make a milky slurry, slowly pour into boiling stew. You can now add the potatoes or just pour the stew over the cooked potatoes on each plate.

Description: 
This beef stew was made for us when we were just infants, my mother used to put it in the blender for us as babies. To this day it reminds me of home. The pressure cooker makes the meat fall apart tender and cooks up in 20 mins.
