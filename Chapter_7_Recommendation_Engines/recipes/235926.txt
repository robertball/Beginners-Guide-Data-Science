Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
1 cup butter, softened
2 1/4 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup slivered almonds, chopped
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 (6 ounce) package cherry-flavored sweetened dried cranberries (such as cherry-flavor CraisinsÂ®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat sugar, shortening, and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixture until smooth. Beat eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract into butter mixture.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until dough just comes together. Stir almonds, white chocolate chips, and dried cranberries into the dough.
Drop rounded tablespoons of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies until bottom edges are light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool cookies for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
