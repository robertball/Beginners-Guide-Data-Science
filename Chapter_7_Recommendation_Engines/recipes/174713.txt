Ingredients:
4 thick cut pork chops
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Rinse the pork chops and pat dry. Combine graham cracker crumbs, cinnamon, curry powder, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag.  Dip the pork chops in the egg and place in plastic bag; shake to coat.
Place the pork chops in a prepared 9 x 13 inch baking dish.  Bake until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
