Ingredients:
3 cups cider vinegar
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup ketchup
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup kosher salt
2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the vinegar and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Off the heat, stir in the ketchup, honey, salt, red pepper, and black pepper.
Cook's Note: BBQ experts assert that the vinegary North Carolina sauces are the original American sauces. Within the state, you know which side of the Piedmonts you are on by what sauce douses your pulled pork. Along the coast, sauces are reduced to the basics-vinegar and red pepper. Up in the mountains, tomato makes an appearance, and the sauces are thicker.
Makes about 1 quart
