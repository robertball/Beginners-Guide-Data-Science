1/2 (12 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage
1 tablespoon butter
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
1 small green bell pepper, cut into thin strips
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups chicken broth
1 cup whipping cream
1 cup quick-cooking grits
3 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat; drain grease from the skillet. Set sausage onto a plate lined with paper towels. Melt the butter in the skillet. Cook the jalapeno pepper, bell pepper, and garlic in the melted butter until the peppers are tender.
Bring the chicken broth and cream to a boil in a large saucepan. Gradually add the grits to the broth mixture while whisking. Continue cooking and whisking until the grits are cooked and the mixture thickens. Add the bell pepper mixture, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese and stir until the cheese melts.

This is great with any main dish, as a main dish, or for breakfast. If you don't like bell peppers, leave them out; it still tastes great! Season with salt, pepper and hot sauce if you like it extra hot. Hope you enjoy!!
