Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 stick of butter
1/4 cups honey
4 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 cups coconut flakes
4 salmon fillets (about 2 Â½ inches wide)

Directions:
Preheat oven  to 375 degrees.
In a saucepan, melt butter.  Add in the honey, brown sugar and coconut to a boil.
Clean salmon and marinate the salmon in the sauce for at least 15 minutes.
Place a small amount of sauce in a baking dish and add the salmon.  Place a small amount of sauce over the salmon making sure there is also coconut on the top.
The rest of the sauce you will add towards the end of baking.  I always leave a little left over to pour over the salmon (mash potatoes or rice) once it is served.
To give the salmon a golden color, use the broil setting after the salmon has baked.  Keep an eye on the salmon while it broils to avoid it from burning.

Description: 
This salmon is my husband's favorite.    Don't let the total time fool you - very easy to make.  This recipe is great served with mash potatoes or rice.  You can taste the sauce before marinating to check the flavor.  This gives a nice sweet taste to the salmon.
