Quick and Easy Mashed Potato Pancakes Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 cups prepared mashed potatoes (seasoned to taste)
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
2 cups breadcrumbs
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
Canola oil

Directions:
Add prepared mashed potatoes to large mixing bowl. If not already done, season potatoes to taste.
Add eggs and flour, mixing thoroughly.
Pour milk into shallow plate.
Pour breadcrumbs into separate shallow plate. Season with salt and pepper.
Take about a handful of the potato mixture and shape into a disc, about a 1/2-3/4" thick. Dip into milk, coating both sides, and then the same with breadcrumbs. Set aside and repeat above steps with remaining potato mixture.
Pour enough oil into a skillet to 1/4" depth. Heat to medium.
Once oil is heated, carefully add potato pancakes. I recommend only cooking 2-3 at a time, so not to lower oil temp too much, which will cause pancakes to be greasier.
Cook 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown.
Remove from oil and allow to drain on wire rack.
Serve warm with marinara sauce (for an Italian flair) or with applesauce.
