Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cup finely crushed saltine crackers
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pound walleye fillets

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in a 9x13-inch baking dish and melt butter in the oven while it heats.
Mix crushed crackers, Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, salt, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Remove baking dish from oven and dip walleye fillets into butter; gently press fillets into crumb mixture to coat both sides of each fillet. Lay the breaded fillets into the baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy dinner solution that is a big hit at my table. You can use perch, walleye, tilapia, and probably any other kind of fish you'd like. I find that everyone likes certain tastes, so feel free to spice it up however you like. I will sometimes add more of the ingredients on top of the fish before putting in the oven for more flavor.
