Description: 
The hubby and I are trying to eat less meat, more veggies. These hold together very well, have good flavor and are very moist. After the first bite the hubby asked me to write down the recipe before anything was forgotten. I look forward to seeing the tweaks people will make to improve on a good base. Enjoy!
