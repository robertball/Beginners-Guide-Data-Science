Description: 
The two most important ingredients for this or any vinaigrette are the olive oil and the vinegar. For the oil try using cold pressed, extra virgin, and made from 100% Italian olives. For the vinegar, try using a 40 year old sherry vinegar from Spain. Also try adding a dash of Dijon mustard for a kick to this dressing.
