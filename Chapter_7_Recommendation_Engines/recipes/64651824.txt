Sides
4 pieces of light dry salame
6-7 small grape tomatoes

Directions:
Pasta Salad:
1. Prepare the tortellini according to package directions.  Tip: Add some olive oil to the pasta water so it won't clump together.  Drain entirely and let it completely cool. Drizzle on more olive oil and toss.
2.  Add vegetables to pasta.  Lightly salt and pepper.  Drizzle a small amount of  the salad dressing over the pasta, then stir and taste.  Add more until it suits your taste.
Banana Bread
1. Prepare according to recipe.  Let cool on racks before slicing
Salmon Quiche
1. Prepare according to recipe.  We substituted tuna fish for the salmon.
To prepare the Bento Box:
1. Spoon pasta salad into one of the top compartments.
2.  Slice a piece of banana bread, then slice it again into four smaller pieces. Layer in other compartment.
3. In the open bento box,  slice a small wedge of the quiche and set it in next to four slices of salame. Fill the remaining space with tomatoes.  Add a napkin and you are ready to pack up for the park!
