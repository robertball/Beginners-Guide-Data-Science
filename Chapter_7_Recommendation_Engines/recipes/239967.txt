Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3 tablespoons baking powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/4 cups milk
3 tablespoons melted butter
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Sift flour, baking powder, and sugar together in a bowl; pour in milk and butter and mix well. Stir eggs and vanilla extract into flour mixture until batter is smooth.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
