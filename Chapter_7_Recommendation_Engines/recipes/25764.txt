Ingredients:
10 cups flaked coconut
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 2/3 cups sweetened condensed milk
4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, stir together the coconut, flour and salt. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla until everything is well blended. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared pan.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until coconut is sufficiently toasted. Immediately remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate chips and milk, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Dip cooled cookies halfway into the chocolate and scrape off excess onto the side of the bowl. Place onto waxed paper until set.
