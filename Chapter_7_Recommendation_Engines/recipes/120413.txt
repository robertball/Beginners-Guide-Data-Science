Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
6 tablespoons cold butter (no substitutes)
1 egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
FILLING:
5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 3/4 cups sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
2 egg yolks
1/4 cup whipping cream

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pecans and lemon peel, cut in butter until crumbly. Combine egg yolk and vanilla; stir into flour mixture. Press onto the bottom of a greased 10-in. springform pan.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-11 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
Fill a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish with 8 cups water; place on lowest oven rack. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F.
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Gradually beat in sugar. Add the flour, vanilla and salt. Combine eggs and egg yolks; add to cream cheese mixture just until combined. Beat in cream just until combined. Pour over crust.
Bake on middle rack at 325 degrees F for 70-75 minutes or until center is almost set (top of cheesecake will crack). Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen.  Cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight. Remove sides of pan.

Description: 
This plain cheesecake is anything but ordinary! The marvelously rich filling is terrific with the pecan-laden crust. My brother game me the recipe.                                             --Donna Bucher, Tirane, Albania
