Description: 
After looking for a great banana bread recipe, I finally found this one on a website. I've made this countless times for family and friends, and was told (and I quote) I love banana bread, and this is the best I've ever had! It's amazing! Make this and you will be forever greatful. (Note: You can substitute sour cream for yogurt. Either one works great, whatever you have on hand!)
