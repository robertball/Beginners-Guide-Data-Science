Ingredients:
2 medium Hass or Fuerte avocados (very ripe)
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup Bailey's Irish Cream
2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
6 cups powdered sugar
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan.
Scoop out avocado into a medium mixing bowl.
Pour the melted butter over the avocado and use an immersion blender to mix until smooth and creamy.  There should be no lumps. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan over low heat.
Add the Bailey's Irish Cream.  Next add the cocoa powder and powdered sugar in batches until completely incorporated and smooth.
Pour the white and semi-sweet chocolate chips into a microwavable bowl and microwave until melted (about one minute).  Stir until smooth.
Pour the melted chocolate chips into the sauce pan and mix thoroughly.
Line a 9X11 pan with wax paper or foil sprayed with cooking spray.
Pour the fudge mixture into the pan and refrigerate for at least one hour.

Description: 
Although avocados seem like a strange ingredient for fudge, they give it a great creamy texture and add a smidgen of health to an otherwise decadent treat.  I often give it as a gift for the holidays and no one can ever believe it's made with avocados!
