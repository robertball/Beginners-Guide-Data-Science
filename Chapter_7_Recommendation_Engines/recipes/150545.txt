Ingredients:
1 cup juice from large POM Wonderful® Pomegranates,* or POM Wonderful 100% Pomegranate Juice
4 pork chops, about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch thick
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 Granny Smith apples
1 (1 pound) head red cabbage, shredded or grated
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon fennel or caraway seed
1/2 cup water, or more as needed
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

Peel potatoes and cut into cubes. Cover potatoes with water and bring to a boil; cook covered until soft, about 30 minutes.
