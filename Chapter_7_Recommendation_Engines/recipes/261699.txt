Ingredients:
6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
1 lemon, juiced
1/2 lemon, zested
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season spaghetti squash with salt and pepper and place cut side down on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork.
Heat 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook garlic until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and season with salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Saute shrimp until pink, tossing often to prevent burning, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add spaghetti squash strands. Mix in lemon juice and zest. Serve sprinkled with parsley.
