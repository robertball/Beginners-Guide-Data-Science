Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup blanched almond flour
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon stevia powder
Filling:
1 cup coconut butter, softened

6 drops liquid stevia

Directions:
Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Mix almond flour, butter, cocoa powder, and stevia powder together. Press mixture into the lined pan to form a crust. Freeze for 15 minutes while making the filling.
Combine coconut butter, avocados, stevia powder, matcha, peppermint extract, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Blend using an electric mixer until combined. Pour and spread filling onto the crust and freeze.
Mix coconut oil, cocoa powder, peppermint extract, and liquid stevia thoroughly. Spread topping over the chilled bars and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to overnight.

Description: 
These bars are reminiscent of Thin MintsÂ® in flavor. They're bright and refreshing and full of fats but low in carbs. They actually come together very quickly! Store in refrigerator; these will soften/melt at room temperature. Consume or freeze within 24 hours to avoid losing the bright green color.
