Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup red wine
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 pounds chuck roast

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil grate.
In a large, nonporous bowl, combine the oil, ketchup, wine, vinegar, garlic, salt, ground black pepper, mustard powder, celery salt and chili powder and mix well. Pierce the roast with a fork all over the meat. Place the meat in the bowl with the marinade and turn several times to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, turning occasionally.
Grill over medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes per side, or until internal temperature reaches at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).

Description: 
This marinated chuck roast earned its name from my kids, who named it after their Uncle Terry. He created this mouth watering dish years ago, and they loved it! Now neighborhood children return 15 years later to request 'Uncle Terry Meat'. I recommend a 2 inch thick roast.
