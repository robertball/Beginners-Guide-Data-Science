Ingredients:
1/4 cup salted butter
1 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 tsp instant coffee granules
1 tbsp hot water
2 tbsp milk
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup Nutella ® chocolate hazelnut spread

Directions:
Dissolve the coffee in the hot water and set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat and let it cook, stirring occasionally, until it turns a nice caramel colour (around 8 minutes).
Remove from heat and immediately whisk in sugar, coffee, milk and vanilla. When smooth, add the Nutella ® to the pot and stir until smooth and spreadable.
Spread on a prepared, cooled pan of brownies and enjoy!
