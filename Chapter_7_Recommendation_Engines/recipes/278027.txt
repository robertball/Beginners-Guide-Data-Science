Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
8 ounces plant-based hot Italian-style sausage (such as Beyond MeatÂ®), chopped
6 ounces cooked and crumbled ground meat substitute (such as BOCA)
1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
12 lasagna noodles
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced
6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese
cooking spray

Directions:
Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, 1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Meanwhile, stir together egg, ricotta, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.
To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into 12 equal servings.
