Ingredients:
4-6 large potatoes
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 tsp seasoning salt

Directions:
Cut potatoes into the same size strips and mix oil and seasoning with potatoes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F with a baking sheet in the middle of the oven.
Remove baking sheet from the oven and arrange the potatoes on the sheet leaving at least 1/2 inch between each.
Roast, turning the fries over and rotating the baking sheet once after 15 minutes and then again every 6 to 8 minutes, until the fries are nicely browned and crisp, a total of about 30 minutes.
Optional - Sprinkle parmesan cheese on the top of the french fries before cooking them.
