DINOMITE'S FLUFFY BITES Recipe

Ingredients:
3 cups of sugar
3/4 cup melted butter
1 1/4 cup milk
3 cups quick oats
1 cup of unsweetened coconut, plus extra for rolling
1.5 cups cocoa powder
small pinch of salt
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
1. Add sugar, butter and milk to a pot. Bring to a boil until it reaches soft ball on a candy thermometer. If you donâ€™t have a thermometer, about 4-5 minutes at a good simmer/gentle boil should do it.
2. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. I usually add the vanilla last, when the mixture has cooled a little. Allow mixture to cool completely.
3. Roll into little balls and then roll in the extra coconut. These are very sticky, so I like to roll them all, then roll in the coconut and place on a cookie sheet. I like to put them back into the fridge to firm up or even the freezer
