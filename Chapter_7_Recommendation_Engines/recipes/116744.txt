Ingredients:
6 chicken thighs
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons dried oregano

Directions:
Place the chicken in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the lemon juice, honey, oil, garlic and oregano; pour over chicken.
Bake, uncovered at 375 degrees F for 45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F and chicken juices run clear, basting occasionally with pan juices.

Description: 
I've been known to make this recipe twice a week--it's so delicious. I like to call it 'sticky chicken' since the slightly sweet sauce of honey, lemon juice and hers nicely coats the chicken thighs.
