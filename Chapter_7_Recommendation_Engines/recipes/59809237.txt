Ingredients:
1  pounds ground beef
1/2 pound bulk italian sausage
1 egg
1 onion, chopped (optional)
1 cup milk
1 cup dried bread crumbs
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1/3 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the beef, sausage, egg, onion, milk and bread crumbs. Combine well but do not overwork or it will become tough.  Season with salt and pepper to taste and place in a foil lined shallow baking pan that fits the toaster oven.  Flaten the loaf of meat to about 2 deep.
In a separate small bowl, combine the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup. Mix well and pour over the meatloaf.  You can also use a generous half cup of your favoirte BBQ sauce in place of the sugar/mustard/techup mixture.
Shape into a flat loaf, about 3 inches thick.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45- minutes to hour.

Description: 
I have found that meatloaf can dry out in the toaster oven.  A few changes to this delicious recipe made for a moist, tender and flavorful meatloaf my family frequently requests.  It is great for sandwiches!Modified from: Easy Meatloaf
