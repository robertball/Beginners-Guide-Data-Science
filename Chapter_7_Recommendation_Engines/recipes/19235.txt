Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
2 cups brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 tablespoons milk
1 cup chopped dates
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time them stir in the vanilla. Sift together the flour, baking soda and cream of tartar, gradually stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Using your hand or a large wooden spoon, stir in the dates and walnuts. If your dates have clumped together, you can toss them with a little bit of the flour.
Divide the batter into two pieces and roll them into logs about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap them in waxed paper or plastic wrap and chill for at least 8 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Remove the logs from the refrigerator and unwrap them. Using a sharp knife, cut each one crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Place the rounds onto the prepared cookie sheets 2 inches apart.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
