Ingredients:
1 chicken breast, rinsed and patted dry then cut into bite size pieces
2 Tbs Olive Oil
1 tsp butter
4 garlic cloves minced
depending on personal taste 1/4 to 1 tsp red pepper flakes (we love HOT)
1 medium fresh ripe tomato, peeled and chopped.
pinch of salt

Directions:
Place Olive Oil and butter in skillet to heat while cubing the chicken breast
and mincing the garlic.
Place chicken in skillet and sautee, add minced garlic and red peppers, turn heat down and add peeled chopped tomato and pinch of salt. Cover and continue cooking till chicken is fully cooked.
I'm sure canned tomatos would suffice, but being tomato season, why would one "go for the can"?
Very good served with Red Beans and Rice, alongside mashed potatoes or make more sauce and serve over pasta.

Description: 
Not being huge seafood lovers I changed shrimp or scallops to chicken and this is the end result.
Adjust the red pepper flakes to your own taste as well as the amount of garlic.
