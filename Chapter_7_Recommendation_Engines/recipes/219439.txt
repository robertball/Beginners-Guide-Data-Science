Ingredients:
2 kiwis, peeled and diced
2 Golden Delicious apples - peeled, cored and diced
8 ounces raspberries
1 pound strawberries, divided
3 tablespoons fruit preserves, any flavor
10 (10 inch) whole wheat flour tortillas
butter flavored cooking spray
1/3 cup cinnamon sugar

Directions:
Thoroughly mix kiwis, Golden Delicious apples, raspberries, strawberries, and fruit preserves in a large bowl. Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat one side of each flour tortilla with butter-flavored cooking spray. Cut into wedges and arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle wedges with cinnamon sugar. Spray again with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown and crispy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Repeat with any remaining tortilla wedges. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture.
