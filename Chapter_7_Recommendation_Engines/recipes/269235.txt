Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) butternut squash
1 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 medium onion, quartered
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 ripe pears - peeled, cored, and chopped into 1-inch chunks
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground sage
4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Cut butternut squash into 4 pieces and remove seeds. Pour water into the bottom of a multi-functional electric pressure cooker and place trivet inside. Place squash on trivet, close lid, and set seal valve. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain out the water and wipe the bottom of the pot dry. Remove squash skin and discard. Roughly chop any large pieces into smaller 1- to 2-inch chunks. Set aside.
Select the Saute function and heat olive oil. Saute onion and garlic for 1 to 2 minutes. Add pears, salt, and sage; cook for 1 to 2 minutes more. Turn pressure cooker off. Add the squash and chicken broth. Close lid and seal valve. Select high pressure; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure manually and remove lid. Blend soup until smooth using an immersion blender. Stir in heavy cream.

Description: 
Peeling and chopping butternut squash can be quite a chore, but not using this method! By precooking the squash in your Instant Pot®, the skin will slip right off, allowing you to make this quick and flavorful soup in just minutes! The pears add just the perfect amount of sweetness with no need to add in extra sugar. Garnish with a light drizzle of cream to serve.
