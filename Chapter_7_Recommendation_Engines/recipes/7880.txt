1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Beat egg.  Mix in milk.  Sift flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder; beat into egg mixture until smooth.
Pour oil into a heavy pan until it is 1 inch deep. Heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour batter through funnel into oil with a circular motion to form a spiral.  Fry until lightly brown; turn over to brown the other side.  Cook to golden brown, and remove to drain on paper towels.  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar while still warm.
