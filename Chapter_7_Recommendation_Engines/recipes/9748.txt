Ingredients:
3/4 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 egg yolk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cream the butter and 2 tablespoons of sugar until light and fluffy, then stir in the egg yolk. Add the flour and mix until well blended.
Combine the 1/2 cup sugar with the cinnamon.  Roll the dough into balls the size of small olives and roll in the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Place cookies on a cookie sheet and press criss-cross with a fork until cookies are 1/3 inch thick.
Bake for 10 minutes, or  until light brown.
