Ingredients:
12 EGG WHITES, room temperature
1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1-1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 tsp. almond extract, OPTIONAL
1-1/4 cups powdered sugar
1 cup sifted cake flour
1/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
1.HEAT oven to 375°F. BEAT egg whites and cream of tartar in mixer bowl with whisk attachment on high speed until foamy. Beating constantly, ADD granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time, beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved before adding the next. (Rub a bit of mixture between thumb and forefinger; it should feel completely smooth.) Continue beating until whites are glossy and stand in Soft Peaks. BEAT IN vanilla and almond extract, if desired.
2.SIFT powdered sugar, flour and salt together twice. SIFT about 1/2 cup of the flour mixture over egg whites. FOLD gently just until flour disappears. Do not stir. REPEAT sifting and folding in flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time.
3.POUR batter into ungreased 10 x 4-inch tube pan. Gently CUT THROUGH batter with metal spatula to release any air pockets. BAKE in center of 375°F oven until top springs back when lightly tapped with finger, 30 to 40 minutes. INVERT cake in pan, with tube resting on a bottle. COOL completely, about 1-1/2 hours.
