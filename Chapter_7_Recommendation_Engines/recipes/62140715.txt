Ingredients:
1 pound processed cheese (eg. velveta )
1 can rotel tomatos and green chili (undrained)
1 8 ounce can cream of mushroom soup
1 pound hamburger meat (browned and drained)
1 roll spicy pork sausage (browned and drained)
Milk if desired for a thinner consistancy
White corn tortilla chips

Directions:
Brown sausage and hamburger meat and drain thoroughly. Add to an 8 qaurt crock pot or larger.
Dice processed cheese into 1 inch cubes and add to the crock pot.
Add 1 can rotel with juices and all and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.
Turn crock pot on medium heat and cover, stir periodically to mix ingredients as the cheese melts.
Once the cheese is completely melted and there are no lumps, add a little milk if you desire a thinner consistancy, however, this dip is suppost to be very thick and chunky from the meats and rotel.
Serve with white corn tortilla chips on the side or poured over the top nacho style.

Description: 
This is a delicious thick and spicey cheese dip prepared in a crock pot and served with tortilla chips, given to me from my buddy Eric Pulliam. He serves this up on poker nights and it's a big hit. The kids love it too!
