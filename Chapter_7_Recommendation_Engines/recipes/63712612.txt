Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cups chopped red bell pepper
2 cups chopped zucchini
2 cups chopped yellow squash
3 tbsp unsalted butter, softened
2 tbsp all-purpose flour
2 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
1 tbsp minced garlic
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 tsp lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F.
Sear breasts in oil in a large oven-proof pan over high heat until browned on one side, about 5 minutes.  Flip breasts, transfer to the oven, and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165, 10-12 minutes.  Transfer breasts to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.  Return pan to stove top over high high and cook juices in the pan until dry.
Meanwhile, cook bell pepper in a large pot of boiling salted water for 1 minute.  Add zucchini and squash and cook until fork-tender, 5-7 minutes more.  Drain.
Combine butter, flour, thyme, and garlic into a paste.
Deglaze pan with wine, scraping up any browned bits; cook until wine is reduced by half.  Add broth, bring to a simmer, and whisk in butter mixture.  Bring sauce to a boil and cook one minute more.  Stir in lemon juice and season sauce with salt and black pepper.  Stir veggies into sauce, slice breasts, and serve over Lemon-Chive Farfalle.

Description: 
The searing gives the breasts more flavor, and leaves tasty bits in the pan to build a sauce from.
