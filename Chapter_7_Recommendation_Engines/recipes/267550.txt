2 tablespoons Lemon juice, raw
Â½ teaspoon Seaweed, agar, dried
4 cups Raspberries, raw

Directions:




Submitter: 
Buckwheat Queen
Description: 
I developed this recipe for a friend who has diabetes. She complained that most diabetic jams had sweeteners added leaving a strange aftertaste. Fresh fruit, when in season, is naturally sweet. To make jam, you don't need to add sugar. A little agar-agar and lemon will help the cooked fruit thicken to make a spreadable fruit for toast, sandwiches, or cheeses. It will last up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. This recipe will work with all forest fruits.
