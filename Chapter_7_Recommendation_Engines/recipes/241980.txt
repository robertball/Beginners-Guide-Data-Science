Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 tablespoon salt, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground thyme
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 zucchini, cut into long strands

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and black pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix tomato sauce, tomatoes, salt, basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and red pepper flakes into ground beef; cook and stir until sauce is warmed through, about 2 minutes. Stir tomato paste into sauce.
Mix zucchini "noodles" into sauce, pressing down to fully submerge them; simmer over medium-low heat until zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Fooled my husband into eating his vegetables. When fully cooked, the texture is like an al dente pasta. You can turn this vegetarian by omitting the ground beef.
