Ingredients:
1/2 pound fresh spinach -- cleaned, stemmed, and dried
2 large stalks of rhubarb, cut diagonally into thin slices (about 3/4 cup)
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoons sweet red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons olive oil
Optional: Blue Cheese, Real Bacon Bits, Walnuts

Directions:
Arrange the spinach leaves on a platter.
Place the rhubarb in a skillet with the water; add the sugar. Bring the rhubarb to a gentle boil over medium-low heat and simmer until the sugar has dissolved and the rhubarb is lightly cooked, about 2 minutes. Remove the rhubarb (leaving a few pieces behind) with a slotted spoon and distribute over the spinach.
Raise heat to medium, and bring liquid left in skillet to a boil. Return heat to medium-low and cook until the liquid has reduced to about 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Meanwhile, place the vinegar and olive oil in a container with a tight-fitting lid.  Pour in the reduced liquid, cover and shake vigorously.  Pour the hot dressing over the spinach and rhubarb to wilt the lettuce. Divide salad between 2 plates; serve warm.
To serve cold, chill cooked rhubarb and dressing.  Toss with spinach and blue cheese, bacon bits and walnuts.
