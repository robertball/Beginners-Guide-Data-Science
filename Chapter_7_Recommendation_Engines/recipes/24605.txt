Ingredients:
24 pickled jalapeno peppers
1 pound Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
4 cups corn oil for frying

Directions:
Cut a short slit into each jalapeno pepper. Remove as many seeds as possible. Slice Cheddar cheese into approximately 1/4 inch by 1 inch strips. Stuff each jalapeno with a Cheddar cheese strip.
Place beaten eggs in a small bowl.
In a small dish, mix yellow cornmeal, flour and salt.
One at a time, dip jalapenos in the eggs. Roll in the yellow cornmeal mixture until well coated. Arrange on a metal rack, and allow them to sit approximately 30 minutes.
Heat corn oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In small batches, using a slotted spoon, lower peppers into the heated oil, and fry until crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
