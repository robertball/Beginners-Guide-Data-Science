Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups maple syrup
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon rose water (optional)
3/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups rolled oats
1 cup puffed rice cereal
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1/2 cup chopped cashews
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried blueberries
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/2 cup packed brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 baking sheets with cooking spray or line with non-stick aluminum foil.
Whisk maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, rose water, and salt together in a bowl.
Mix oats, rice cereal, coconut, cashews, raisins, dried blueberries, pecans, almonds, dried cranberries, and brown sugar together in a separate bowl. Pour maple syrup mixture over oat mixture and stir until evenly coated. Spread oat mixture onto the prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; stir and continue baking until slightly crisp and lightly browned, 15 to 25 more minutes. Cool on baking sheets before serving, about 1 hour. Store in air-tight containers.

Description: 
This recipe is addictive and very easy. It tastes like the top crunchy part of cobbler desserts. It would be good as a cereal with milk or to put in yogurt or topped on fruit that has been fried in a little butter and brown sugar. A dollop of homemade whipped cream wouldn't hurt the latter!
