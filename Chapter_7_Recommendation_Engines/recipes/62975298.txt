Description: 
This is from the December, 1984 Southern Living Magazine, I guess that makes this a 'vintage' recipe! These are the best bourbon balls and if they're not included in the Christmas festivities, I'll hear about it! Be sure to make them at least a week ahead of time to allow the flavors to develop.
