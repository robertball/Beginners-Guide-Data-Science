Ingredients:
1 (19.5 ounce) package brownie mix
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
2 eggs
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1 (12 ounce) bag milk chocolate chips
1 cup peanut butter
3 cups crispy rice cereal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place brownie mix into a mixing bowl and stir in vegetable oil, water, and eggs; beat 50 strokes with a spoon. Spread the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake brownies in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Check after 25 minutes. Let the brownies cool while you complete remaining steps.
Spread marshmallow creme over the warm brownies. Place milk chocolate chips and peanut butter in a large saucepan over low heat and stir until the mixture is warm, completely melted, and smoothly combined. Stir in the crispy rice cereal until thoroughly coated and spread over the marshmallow creme layer, pressing and filling any voids. Refrigerate until set, 20 to 30 minutes. Cut into bars to serve.

Description: 
These are absolutely divine!! I am always asked to bring these for our school's bake sale and they are always the first to go! If there are any leftovers (which is doubtful) I prefer to keep the in the refrigerator.
