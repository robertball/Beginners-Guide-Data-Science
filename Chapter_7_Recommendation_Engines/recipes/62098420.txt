Ingredients:
1.5 lbs ground beef, browned and drained
2 pkgs beef stew seasoning
3 cans beef broth
2 cups water
2 - 32oz pkgs frozen stew veggies (potatoes, carrots, celery, pearl onions)
1 8oz pkg frozen pearl onions (optional)
1 can diced tomatoes (optional)
2 pkgs beef stew seasoning
2 pkgs mushroom gravy mix
3 Tbs corn starch, cold water

Directions:
Brown hamburger, drain, place in large stock pot.  Stir in stew seasoning mix. (I use the less expensive Kroger brand and it works great).  Add beef broth, water, frozen vegetables, and diced tomatoes, if used.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer.  Just prior to serving, add mushroom gravy mix.  Stir until blended.
If desired, use thickening agent. In small cup, add 3 TBS corn starch to 1/4 cup cold water, blend well, add to stew.  Bring stew to boil, stirring constantly for 2 minutes, reduce heat and serve.
