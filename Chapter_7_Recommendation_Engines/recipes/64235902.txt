Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup onion chopped
48 oz chicken broth
1 frozen package of california blend vegetables
1 container half and half
16 oz sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt the butter in stock pot and add the chopped onion.  Cook until onion is tender, approximately 10 minutes.  Gradually add flour to the mixture, whisking it together until it becomes a paste.  Slowly whisk in the chicken broth.  Allowing it to thicken without lumps.  Allow to simmer for approximately ten minutes.  Add the chopped vegetables and allow to cook another 10 minutes.  Slowly whisk in half and half.  Reduce heat and cover.  Simmer on low heat stirring occasionally so that there is no sticking.  Remove pot from heat and slowly whisk in the cheese.  Serve!
