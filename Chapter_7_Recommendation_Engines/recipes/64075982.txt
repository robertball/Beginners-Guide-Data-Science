Ingredients:
1 pkg. Crescent rolls (I used the flat kind that is not shaped like crescents)
1 (8 oz.) wheel Brie cheese
1/4 cup nuts (I used pecans but can use almonds also)
Raspberry preserves
1 egg white

Directions:
1. Slice the wheel of Brie in half, horizontally, so that the halves are two, flatter wheels of Brie. ( I cut off the rind, but you donâ€™t have to.)  Place half of the Brie (rind side down, if you keep the rind on) onto the flat pastry     dough.  Place a tablespoon or so of the preserves onto the Brie.  Sprinkle with nuts.  Place the other half of the Brie (rind side up) over the bottom half.  Bundle the pastry dough around the Brie and cut off excess from top.  Make sure it is sealed good (you can wet your finger and wet the seams to seal better). Wrap the ball in aluminum foil lightly sprayed with oil and freeze for 2 hours.
2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 9 inch pie pan.  Remove cheese ball from aluminum foil and brush the egg white over the top.  Place the cheese ball in the pie pan and bake for 15-20 minutes.
3.  Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.  Serve with crackers and apples.
