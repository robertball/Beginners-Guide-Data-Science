Ingredients:
Cotton Candy in multiple colors

Directions:
1. Using your hands, unroll and flatten cotton candy in thin layers.
2. Using scissors or a very sharp knife, cut cotton candy into 1" to 2" strips.
3. Roll up strips either individually or layering colors (use your imagination!).
Helpful Hint: a light misting of water will help the cotton candy stick to itself

Description: 
Kids love to roll the strips up - have an adult cut the strips for them. 
Also works well as a party group activity!
