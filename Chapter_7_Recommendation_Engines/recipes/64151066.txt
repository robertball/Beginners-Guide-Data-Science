Ingredients:
2	cups leftover prepared spaghetti with meat sauce
1/8	cup milk
2	large eggs
¼	cup grated Parmesan,  plus extra for garnish
¼	cup shredded cheddar cheese
1	pinch of red pepper flakes, optional
¼	cup olive oil

Directions:
In al large bowl, beat eggs, milk, red pepper flakes and cheese. Add spaghetti and stir well to combine.
In an 8” to 10” nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add half of the oil and let heat until hot.  Add spaghetti mixture, spreading evenly and pressing down into pan. (I use the back of a metal 1 cup dry measuring cup).  Cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes.
Lay plate over top of skillet face down.  Carefully flip the spaghetti pie onto the plate uncooked side down.  Set aside.
Add remaining oil to the pan, and carefully slide the back into the pan, pressing mixture down into pan.  Cook until golden.  Remove from pan and slide out onto a plate.  Serve with more cheese, and sauce.
