Ingredients:
3/4 pound (2 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour, plus a little extra for rolling the tortillas
5 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening, or a mixture of the two (lard works best)
3/4 teaspoon sour salt
about 3/4 cup very warm tap water

Directions:
In a food processor, pulse the flour and lard until well combined.  Dissolve the sour salt in the water,and pour salt-water mixture into the low speed food processor. Process until well blended.
Remove the dough from the food processor and divide the dough into 12 portions and roll each into a ball.  Set them on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let rest (room temperature) at least 30 minutes (to make the dough less springy, easier to roll).
Heat an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of dough into an even 7-inch circle. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle (you should hear a faint sizzle and see an almost immediate bubbling across the surface).  After 30 to 45 seconds, when there are browned splotches underneath, flip it over.  Griddle 30 to 45 seconds more, until the other side is browned; don't overbake the tortilla or it will become crisp.  Remove and wrap in a cloth napkin placed in a tortilla warmer.
Roll and griddle-bake the remaining tortillas in the same manner and add them to the pile.
