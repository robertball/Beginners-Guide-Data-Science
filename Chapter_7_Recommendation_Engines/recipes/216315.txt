Add the garlic and onions to the skillet and cook and stir for 1 minute.  Stir in the soup, pineapple juice and teriyaki sauce and heat to a boil.  Cook for 5 minutes or until the soup mixture is slightly reduced.
Return the pork to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low.  Stir in the pineapple.  Cook for 5 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.  Serve the pork and sauce with the rice.  Sprinkle with additional sliced green onion, if desired.
