Ingredients:
2 eggs
2 lg. cloves of garlic
1 can of anchovies, with oil
1 1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil
The juice of 1 lemon
2 1/2 t. hot sauce
2 T. red wine vinegar
2 T. worcestershire
3 1/2 T. Dijon mustard
1 T. salt
1/2 T. pepper
4 heads of romain lettuce
1 1/2 c. Caesar salad croutons
3/4 c. Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover with water.  Heat water to a boil over medium-high heat and boil for 1 minute.  Remove from heat immediately and transfer eggs to a bowl filled with ice water (this will stop the egg from cooking any more).  Meanwhile, in a food processor add the garlic and anchovies with anchovy oil and process until garlic and anchovies are finely minced.  Add the next 8 ingredients and process until smooth.  Add the yolks from the boiled eggs and pulse the processor until the yolks are well combined.  In a large salad bowl, tear the romain lettuce into bite-sized pieces.  Toss in the croutons.  Add dressing a little at a time until salad is dressed to your liking.  Refrigerate any remaining dressing.  Add the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
My father-in-law made this dressing up, and it is the best Caesar salad.  Everyone always asks him for the recipe but he never wrote it down.  I watched him and wrote it out, now I'm sharing it with all of you.
