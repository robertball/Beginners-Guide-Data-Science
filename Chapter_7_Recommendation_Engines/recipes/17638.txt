Ingredients:
1 (2.2 pound) wheel Brie cheese
2 teaspoons ground curry powder
1 (12 ounce) jar mango chutney
1 cup chopped cashews
1 French baguette, cut into 1/2 inch slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Sprinkle curry powder over top and sides of Brie; rub the curry powder into the rind to thoroughly coat the surface. Place the Brie wheel in a large pie plate or oven proof dish. Spread a generous layer of chutney over the top, and evenly sprinkle with cashews.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cashews are slightly golden and cheese inside the rind is melted. Serve with slices of baguette.
