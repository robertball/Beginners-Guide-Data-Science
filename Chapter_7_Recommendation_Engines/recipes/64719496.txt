Ingredients:
•1  3- or 4-pound beef chuck roast
•1/4 cup all-purpose flour
•1 tablespoon kosher salt
•1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
•3 tablespoons olive oil
•1 large yellow onion, diced
•3 garlic cloves, minced
•1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
•1 cup beef stock, divided
•3/4 cup medium-bodied red wine (such as merlot)
•2 tablespoons tomato paste
•1 bay leaf, whole
•2 cups baby carrots
•3 celery ribs, cut into 2-inch pieces
•2 cups frozen pearl onions
•Garnish: fresh rosemary sprigs

Directions:
Pat the beef dry with a paper towel. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle this mixture all over the beef, pressing lightly to ensure that it sticks. Add the oil to the pot in your pressure cooker and select the sauté setting, high heat. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, until browned on that side, about 3 minutes. Repeat to brown the remaining sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Add the onion, garlic, and chopped rosemary to the pot, and cook, stirring often, until the onions are translucent, about 6 minutes.
Add the beef stock, wine, and tomato paste, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return the browned roast to the pot along with the bay leaf.
Lock the lid into place. Select the meat/stew option and set the time for 40 minutes. When done, quick-release the pressure. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer the roast to a plate and tent with foil for 15 minutes.
Add the vegetables to the pot, then lock the lid in place. Select the manual option, high heat, and set the time for 4 minutes. When done, quick-release the pressure once more, then unlock and remove the lid.
Transfer the meat, vegetables, and sauce to a serving platter. Discard the bay leaf. Slice the meat against the grain, or use two forks to pull the beef into chunks. Arrange the beef and vege­tables on a platter. Spoon the sauce over the beef and vegetables alongside mashed potatoes, buttered egg noodles, or rice.

Description: 
This kind of pressure cooking turns complex weekend-only dishes into everyday fare. 
For this Instant Pot pot roast recipe, I adapted our recipe for classic Yankee pot roast, making it even quicker to prepare by using baby carrots and frozen pearl onions to cut down on prep time. Coating the roast with seasoned flour before browning adds flavor and helps thicken the sauce  an important step in a sealed system where water can’t evaporate
