Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped
Glaze:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 teaspoon caramel extract (such as Watkinsâ„¢)
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a parchment paper round into the bottom of the air fryer. Spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Mix flour, 1/4 cup sugar, milk, egg, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Stir until combined.
Mix 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon in another bowl and sprinkle over apples until coated. Mix apples into the flour mixture until combined.
Drop fritters using a cookie scoop onto the bottom of the air fryer basket.
Air-fry in the preheated fryer for 5 minutes. Flip fritters and cook until golden, about 5 minutes more.
Meanwhile, mix confectioners' sugar, milk, caramel extract, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Transfer fritters to a cooling rack and drizzle with glaze.
