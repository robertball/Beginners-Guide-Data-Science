cooking spray
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter
2 small ripe bananas, mashed

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
5 small strawberries, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Combine sugar and butter in a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and fluffy. Add bananas, egg, and vanilla extract; beat for 1 minute.
Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt over the banana mixture. Beat until just combined. Stir in chopped strawberries. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
