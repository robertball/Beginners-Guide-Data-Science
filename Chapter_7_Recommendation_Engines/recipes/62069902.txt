Image:

Ingredients:
6 medium/large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored and finely chopped (about 8 cups).
4 cups white sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 large/medium lemon zested and juiced
1/8 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cloves
SureJel (optional - see note below)

Directions:
Put the chopped apples, the two sugars, the lemon juice and zest, and spices in a pot and slowly bring to a boil. As it gets hot it will liquefy quite a bit. Bring to a full rolling boil. When ready to put in jars, some of the apples will become nearly clear. Test as per below.
Temperature test: While useful for some jams, it doesn't seem to work here. Use the refrigerator test.
Refrigerator test: Put a small amount of boiling jam on a cold plate and put it in the freezing compartment of a refrigerator for a several minutes. Once cool, if the mixture gels, it is ready to can. Over cooking it can make it very thick when cooled.
Can as you would most jams.
Note: as an act of desperation, you can use something like SureJel to make magic happen if nothing else works. It can also be used to save time.

Description: 
This is apple jam - something you can't seem to buy, spiced to resemble the taste of most apple pies. Usually there is enough pectin in the apples to make it jell without adding anything.
