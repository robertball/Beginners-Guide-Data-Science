Ingredients:
2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
2 cup sliced carrots
2 cup frozen green peas
1 cup sliced celery
1/3 cup butter
2/3 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup milk
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/2 teaspoon garlic pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Pillsbury unbaked pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery. Add water to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
In the saucepan over medium heat, cook onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, celery seed, garlic pepper and garlic. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat and set aside.
Spray 13 x 9 inch baking dish, roll one pie crust to fit and bake 5 minutes.
Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Roll second crust out and cut several shapes out to allow steam to escape and place on top of mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
