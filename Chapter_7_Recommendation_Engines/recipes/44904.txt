Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup flaked coconut
1/4 cup chocolate chips
1 (9 inch) deep dish pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, pour warm melted butter over 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Stir until smooth. Mix together flour, brown sugar, and white sugar, then stir into chocolate mixture. Stir in eggs and vanilla. Fold in pecans, coconut, and 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Pour into pie crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Top should be set, and may crack slightly, but the pie is best if under-baked.

Description: 
This pie is best if under-baked and a bit gooey like a brownie inside. This is a very rich pie, so small slices are advised.
