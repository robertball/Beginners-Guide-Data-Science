Ingredients:
29-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 c milk
25 leaves fresh basil, minced
3 small cloves garlic, crushed or minced
1 large cucumber, peeled and diced
12 medium tomatoes, gutted
salt
black pepper
sesame seed

Directions:
Place the tomatoes in a tin tray.  Fill each with water, then fill the tray about 1" with water.
Cover the tray with aluminum foil.  Place the tray on the grill on high for 10-20 minutes, or until the tomatoes are cooked but still firm - their skins should be just beginning to shrivel up and/or peel off.
Meanwhile, combine the chickpeas and milk.  Mash.
Add the garlic and basil.  Add olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste.  Stir.
Microwave on high until warm, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the cucumber.
Fill each tomato to the top with the chickpea mixture.  Serve.
