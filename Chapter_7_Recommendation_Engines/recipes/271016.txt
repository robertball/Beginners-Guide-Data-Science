Ingredients:
1 pound beef tenderloin, sliced across the grain
1/4 cup hoisin sauce, or to taste
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 green bell pepper, sliced into strips
1 medium onion, sliced into strips
1/2 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup beef stock, divided
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Paint beef strips with hoisin sauce; let marinate at least 1 hour, or overnight.
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil. Saute ginger and garlic for 5 seconds. Add bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. Cook and stir until vegetables are lightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside in a bowl.
Add beef strips to the hot wok. Saute to desired doneness; for rare, cook until browned on the outside and red in the center, about 2 minutes per side.
Mix cornstarch with 1/2 of the stock in a small bowl.
Add the vegetables to the steak in the wok; pour in remaining stock. Stir for a few minutes and add the cornstarch mixture. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top to serve.

Description: 
This pepper steak stir-fry is how I remember it was at a Chinese restaurant that I worked at while in college. Just onion and green pepper, but I've been known to add fresh mushrooms. Serve on a bed of rice.
