Ingredients:
2 pounds beef short ribs
1/3 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup red wine
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 pinch curry powder

Directions:
Place the ribs in a large pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until the meat is no longer pink, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the soy sauce, red wine, olive oil, flour, brown sugar, garlic and curry powder.
Drain the ribs, and coat generously with the sauce. Arrange them on a baking sheet.
Roast for about 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fork tender. Pour the remainder of the sauce over the ribs about halfway through.
