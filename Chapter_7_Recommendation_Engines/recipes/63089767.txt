Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) can pitted tart red cherries, drained
1 (8 ounce) can cherry filling goop
1 tablespoon Marsala wine
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 cup crushed vanilla wafer cookies
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
Pinch salt
Whipped cream, vanilla or ginger ice cream (optional)

Directions:
Stir together the cherries, filling goop, vanilla, and wine. Spread over the bottom of a square glass baking dish. Combine the crushed cookies, brown sugar, salt, and baking powder. Use a pastry tool to cut in the cold butter until the cookie mixture resembles small pea-sized morsels. Cover the cherry mixture with the cookie mixture and bake at 325 for 30 minutes until bubbly. Serve cold with whipped cream or warm with ice cream if desired.

Description: 
I found this original recipe to be a little bland, and the boiled filling to be too watery, so here's how I jazzed it up.Modified from: Cherry Grunt
