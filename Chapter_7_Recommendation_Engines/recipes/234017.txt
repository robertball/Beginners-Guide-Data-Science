Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups yellow split peas
1 ham bone with some meat
4 carrots, diced
1/2 large Spanish onion, diced
5 stalks celery, diced
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 bay leaf (optional)
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
8 cups water, or as needed

Directions:
Place split peas, ham bone, carrots, onion, celery, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper into a large pot; pour in water. Bring mixture to a boil and skim off any foam with a spoon. Reduce heat; place a lid on the pot slightly ajar to allow some evaporation. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until peas are tender and soup is thick, about 3 hours.
Remove ham bone from soup; strip meat from ham bone, chop meat, and return it to the pot.

Description: 
Creamy yellow pea soup studded with bits of ham, carrots, celery, and thyme. There is nothing like this one on a cold day! I am a Canadian now living in the US. and cannot get HabitantÂ® soup anymore, so I came up with this version. I think it is as good as the real thing, if not better, because it is homemade.
