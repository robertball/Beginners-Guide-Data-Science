Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Line 2 cookie sheets with aluminum foil. In small mixing bowl, sift the flour.  Add the pecans and oats.  Mix well.
In saucepan over medium heat, combine the corn syrup, brown sugar, and butter.  Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla and flour mixture.  Stir until  well blended.  Mixture will turn opaque. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheets about 3 inches apart.
Bake for 9 minutes or until set and golden.  When done, slide foil onto wire racks and allow cookies to cool.  Re-line cookie sheets with new foil for next batch.   Peel cookies off of foil when cool.

Description: 
These cookies should be very brittle.  Test one or two to get the correct baking time before baking the entire batch.
