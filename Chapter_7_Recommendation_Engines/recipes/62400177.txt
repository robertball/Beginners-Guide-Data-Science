Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
8 ounces white sugar
2 envelopes Knox gelatin
Boiling water to cover the gelatin
2 cups heavy cream
1 bar chocolate, finely grated

Directions:
Beat the egg yolks with the sugar until fluffy and a pale yellow. Dissolve the gelatin in the boiling water, and allow it to come to just warmer than room temperature. If it starts to set up, just whisk it with a fork.
In a clean, cold bowl, with clean, cold beater (in order to get maximum volume), begin whipping the cream. When it start to thicken, pour the gelatin in a very thin stream into the cream as you whip in order to avoid lumps. Stop whipping before it's quite done and add the cream to the egg/sugar mixture. Resume mixing once again until the pudding is smooth and well combined.
In a serving bowl, mound half of the pudding, then add a layer of chocolate, and then another layer of pudding. End with a layer of chocolate. Refrigerate overnight to allow it to fully set up.

Description: 
This pudding was developed by a Norwegian chef in Haugesund and was originally called Haugesundsdessert. In 1906, after succeeding from Sweden, Norwayâ€™s Queen Maud (Dronning Maud) and King Haakon (Kong Haakon) traveled the country and were served Haugesunsdessert while overnighting there. Dronning Maud loved it so much that the pudding was renamed for her and saw its popularity blossom throughout Norway as a result.
