Ingredients:
- Red Bell peppers; 2, large, sliced into long strips
- Olive Oil; around 4 Tablespoons in all
- Quinoa; 150 gms (5 ounces)
- Onion; 1, medium, finely chopped
- Garlic; 2 cloves, sliced
- Bay leaf; 1
- Oregano; dried, 2 teaspoons (Marjoram can be used instead)
- Fresh Parsley; 2 Tablespoons, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the grill (broiler)
In a broiler pan, place the pepper strips, drizzle with about 2 Tablespoons of Olive oil, then cook under the heat for about 5 minutes each side, turning once, until sweet, very tender and just blackening at the edges.
Pour the Quinoa into a large fine-meshed sieve and rinse under running water (cold).
In a high-sided frying pan, warm the remaining oil, and then, on a medium heat, fry the onion and garlic until soft. (8-10 minutes)
Add the bay leaf and oregano (Marjoram) and the quinoa. Pour over 450 ml (3/4 pint) water and simmer for 8 minutes. Almost all the water needs to be absorbed by then.
Finish by stirring in the red pepper strips and the parsley.
