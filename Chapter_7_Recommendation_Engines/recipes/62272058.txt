Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium green pepper, chopped
1 large jalapeno, seeded and diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1-28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, with juice
1-4 oz can of chopped green chilis, with juice
3 cups kidney beans
1/2 cup beer (dark works well)
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin
2 teaspoons oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
sour cream, chopped onions, cilantro, and shredded cheddar cheese for garnish

Directions:
Put the olive oil in a pan over medium high heat.  Add the onion and green pepper and cook until translucent, about 8 minutes.  Add the turkey to the pan and cook until the meat is done and the veggies are soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the jalapeno and garlic and cook another 2 minutes.
Add all of the dry spices and the beer and let simmer, covered, for about 5-10 minutes.
Add the cans of crushed tomatoes and green chili peppers and the kidney beans, and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes.
Put in serving bowls and garnish with sour cream, chopped onions, cilantro, and shredded cheddar cheese, to taste.
