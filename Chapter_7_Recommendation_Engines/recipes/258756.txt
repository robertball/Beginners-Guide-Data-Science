Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons almond extract
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
3 ounces pistachio nuts, crushed
2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 (16 ounce) can white frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans.
Mix milk, almond extract, salt, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Mix in pistachio nuts. Add flour to the creamed butter mixture alternately with the milk mixture, stirring batter well after each addition.
Mix vinegar and baking soda together in a small bowl. Fold into the batter. Divide batter between the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
Spread white frosting between cake layers. Stack layers; frost top and sides of cake.

Description: 
My cousin wanted a pistachio cake for her wedding, so rather than use boxed yellow cake mix and pistachio pudding mix, I opted for fresh pistachio nuts and came up with this delicious recipe!
