Ingredients:
2 liters of 7up or Sprite (chilled)
1 quart of flavored Sherbert

Directions:
Place sherbert in a punch bowl.  Add the chilled 7up or Sprite.  You may want to do this a few minutes before guests arrive so the sherbert can mix with the liquid.  You can use any flavor of sherbert or the rainbow sherbert.  You may want to have enough to double the recipe.  This goes very quickly!
