Description: 
'This colorful confetti salad was served at my youngest son's summer wedding reception,' writes Linda Dow of Bradford, Pennsylvania. 'The hearty blend soaks up refreshing flavor from easy bottled dressing and tastes even better when it's made ahead of time and chilled overnight.'Modified from: Crisscross Salad
