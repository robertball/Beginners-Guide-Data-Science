Ingredients:
6 tablespoons peanut butter
6 tablespoons mixed berry jam
12 slices challah bread
1 cup milk
4 eggs
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons raspberry-flavored liqueur
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed

Directions:
Spread 1 tablespoon peanut butter and 1 tablespoon jam onto one side of each of six bread slices; top each with another bread slice to make 6 sandwiches.
Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, raspberry-flavored liqueur, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth. Dip each sandwich into egg mixture, turning to coat both sides.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook sandwiches, working in batches, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
