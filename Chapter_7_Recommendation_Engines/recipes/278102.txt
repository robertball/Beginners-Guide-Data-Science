Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 pinch ground cloves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 large egg
1 1/2 cups finely chopped raw pecans
4 bone-in pork chops, 3/4-inch thick
cooking spray
chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C), about 5 minutes, if directed by the manufacturer.
Combine cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Add egg and whisk until all ingredients are well combined. Place pecans on a plate.
Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, then set on the plate with the pecans, pressing pecans firmly onto both sides until coated. Spray the chops on both sides with cooking spray and place in the air fryer basket.
Cook in the air fryer for 6 minutes. Turn chops carefully with tongs, and air fry until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes longer. Serve warm, garnished with fresh parsley.
