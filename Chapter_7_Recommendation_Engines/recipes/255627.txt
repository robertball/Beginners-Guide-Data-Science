Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
1 cup applesauce
1 cup loosely packed brown sugar
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup almond milk
2 cups pumpkin puree
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 dash ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans with cooking spray.
Combine water and flaxseed meal in a small bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Stir flaxseed mixture, applesauce, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and almond milk together in a bowl. Add pumpkin puree.
Mix whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, cardamom, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Blend in applesauce mixture. Divide batter between loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack.

Description: 
This bread is soooo moist and just sweet enough. Delicious with coffee. These would taste amazing with a streusel top or cream cheese frosting, if you wanted it even sweeter, but I think it stands alone amazingly well.
