Ingredients:
3 cups diced rhubarb
3 cups diced peeled apples
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 (2 ounce) package dry pectin

Directions:
In a large saucepan mix together the rhubarb, apples, sugar, water and cinnamon.  Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat for 20 minutes or until the fruit is soft.  Stir in the pectin and boil for 5 minutes.
Ladle into sterile jars, wipe rims with a clean cloth or paper towel, and seal with new lids. Process in a bath of simmering water for at least 10 minutes, or as recommended by your local extension if you are at a high altitude. Store unopened jars in a cool dark place. Refrigerate jam after opening.

Description: 
Although apple rhubarb jam may sound weird, it is amazingly delicious! You can substitute strawberries for the apples to make strawberry rhubarb jam.
