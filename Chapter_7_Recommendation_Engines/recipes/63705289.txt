Ingredients:
1/2 lb chinese wheat or egg noodles (rice noodles)
4 tbs fish sauce
2 tbs freshly squeezed lime juice
8 oz skinless boneless chicken breast thinly sliced (about 1 cup)
3 tbs canola oil
2 tbs finely minced garlic
1 tsp - 1 tbs chili garlic sauce, to taste
3 tbs light brown sugar
2 tsp cornstarch
2 tsp chinese rice wine or dry sherry
1 sm onion, diced
8 oz mushrooms
1 c thai basil

Directions:
In a large pot of boiling water, cook the noodles until al dente and set aside to drain.
In a small bowl, mix together the fish sauce, lime juice, garlic chili sauce and sugar.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.
In another bowl, whisk the cornstarch and wine together.  Add the chicken and mix well.
Pour the oil into the wok and place over medium high heat.  Add the garlic and stir until the oil is hot and the garlic sizzles.  Add the onion and the mushrooms.  Add the chicken and stir until the chicken is partially cooked and the onion is translucent.  Add the basil.
Sprinkle the noodles with a little tap water to loosen them.  Drain them and add them to the pan pouring the fish sauce mixture over them.  Cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes or until all the ingredients are well blended and the noodles are heated through.  Serve immediately.
