Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground sausage
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (15 ounce) can light red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (8 ounce) jar mild salsa
1/4 cup chili seasoning mix
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, sausage, and onion in the hot skillet until beef and sausage are completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, light red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans, mild salsa, chili seasoning mix, and garlic powder into the beef mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the flavors meld, 90 minutes to 2 hours.

Description: 
This mild chili gets its flavor from ground sausage, chunky tomatoes, and kidney beans. For a spicier chili, substitute the mild salsa for a medium to high heat salsa.
