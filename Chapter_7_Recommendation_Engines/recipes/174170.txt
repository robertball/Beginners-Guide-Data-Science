Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups sweet rice flour (mochiko)
2 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
5 eggs
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups milk
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Whisk the rice flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.
Beat the eggs, coconut extract, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl until the eggs are smooth. Whisk in the milk, coconut milk, and melted butter until incorporated. Stir in the flour mixture a little at a time until no lumps remain; scrape into the prepared baking dish, and smooth the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the mochi is golden brown, about 1 hour. Cool to room temperature before cutting into 24 pieces to serve.
