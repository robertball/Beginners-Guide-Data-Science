Ingredients:
3-1/2 C Flour
2 tsp yeast
2 tsp sugar
1-1/2 tsp Salt
1 Egg + 1 Egg White ----------- \
enough water to 300ml line ---- | 1-1/2 C
+ small bit of milk ------------- /
3/4 stick unsalted butter (warmed 30 sec)
1 egg for glaze

Directions:
Place the flour in a bowl, creating a small hole in the center, sprinkle the salt around the edge, and put the yeast and sugar in the hole.
Mix the egg/egg white, milk & water together, add the melted butter, and then pour into the center of the flour as well.
Mix thoroughly. After dough is formed, cover with a damp cloth and allow it to rise in bowl for 30 minutes.
Cut the dough in half. Form each half to a long roll. Then lay the rolls out in front of you in a “x”. Braid the bread by constantly switching the ends. (North goes South and vice versa, then East goes West and vice versa, etc).
Place the bread onto a baking sheet, cover again with a damp cloth, and let it rise one more time (15 minutes).
Glaze the bread with an egg. Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes on middle rack.
