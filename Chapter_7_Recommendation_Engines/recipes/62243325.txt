Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken (herbed)
1 Tablespoon olive oil
2 Tablespoons butter
1 russet potato, peeled & diced
2 Cups carrots (crinkle cut or chopped)
1 medium onion, chopped
1 Tablespoon celery flakes
1 Tablespoon garlic salt
Pepper to season
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
½ bag frozen corn
½ bag frozen green beans
2 Tablespoons flour
2 quarts (64 oz.) chicken broth or stock
2 Cups Bisquick
2/3 Cup milk

Directions:
I buy a store bought rotisserie chicken for ease. Rip chicken into small chunks.
Place a large pot on stove over medium high heat.  Add oil, butter, & vegetables and cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season mixture with garlic salt, poultry seasoning, celery flakes, & pepper.  Add flour to the pan (stir) & cook 2 minutes.  Stir broth into the pot and bring to a boil.  Add chicken (and any juice from chicken) to broth & stir.  Cook for 10-15 minutes before adding dumplings.
Place biscuit mix in a bowl, add milk, & stir.  Drop tablespoons (approximately) of prepared mix into the pot, spacing dumplings evenly.  Cover to tightly & reduce heat to medium low.  Steam dumplings 15 minutes.  Remove cover & stir chicken & dumplings to thicken sauce a bit.  Remove from heat & serve in bowls.

Description: 
I took a little from Rachael Ray's recipe & changed it around to meet my needs.  I love it because it's a delish comfort food that my husband adores and it's healthy for us!
