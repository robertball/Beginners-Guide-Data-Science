Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1 cup mashed, cooked butternut squash
1/3 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 egg
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour
GLAZE:
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. In a mixing bowl, combine squash, milk, butter, egg, brown sugar and salt; mix well. Add yeast mixture and 1-1/2 cups flour; mix well. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Divide into thirds; roll each third into a 18-in. rope. Place on a greased baking sheet. Braid ropes together; pinch ends. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Combine glaze ingredients; brush over braid. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
THIS should be called 'You Can't Have Just One Slice Bread.'    My friend gave me this recipe when I first started making bread. It's golden on the outside and the inside - beautiful and colorful besides being so delicious.    I love to bake it in the fall. It blends in with every menu that includes the produce of that season. -Amy Martin, Waddell, Arizona
