Ingredients:
1 rack baby back pork ribs, fat trimmed and membrane removed
1/4 cup pork rub
Mop:
3/4 cup apple juice
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Sauce:
5 tablespoons ketchup
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons honey
1 1/2 tablespoons cracked black peppercorns
1 1/2 tablespoons dried minced garlic
2 teaspoons whole fennel seeds
2 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or more to taste
3 (1.5 fluid ounce) jiggers Tennessee whiskey, or as needed (optional)
apple wood chips, soaked

Directions:
Let the ribs come to room temperature. Work in the rub and let stand 30 minutes more.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix apple juice and oil together in a bowl to make the mop, or basting liquid.
Mix ketchup, oil, vinegar, soy sauce, honey, peppercorns, dried garlic, fennel seeds, and hot sauce together in a bowl to make the sauce.
Place ribs directly on the grill and cook over high heat until browned, 5 to 10 minutes per side; be careful not to let the meat burn.
Place ribs onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions. Smoke the ribs low and slow. Baste every 15 to 30 minutes with the mop mixture, until meat begins pulling from the bone, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Baste liberally with the sauce mixture. Offer all the cooks a shot of whiskey. Wrap the sauce-covered ribs in a double layer of aluminum foil and return them to the smoker over low to medium heat. Cook 45 minutes more. Remove foil, cut ribs into portions, and serve.
