Ingredients:
3 eggs
white sugar (75g)
ground almonds(125g)
icing sugar(175g)
fillings (peach jam, strawberry preserves...)
food colorings
flavorings (vanilla, mint, lemon)

Directions:
separate the egg whites from the yolks and in a clean, dry bowl whisk the whites until thick and glossy.
add the castor sugar and whisk again until stiff.
sieve the almonds and icing sugar into the bowl and carefully fold in, retaining as much air as possible.
divide the mixture between three bowls and add the coloring and flavorings to each:-
- raspberry flavor & pink food coloring
- lemon flavor & yellow food coloring
- vanilla flavor & blue food coloring.
put each one into a separate piping bag.
line a baking tray with baking paper or a silicon mat and pipe small circles (3cm across) onto the tray, leaving a small gap between each macaroon.
put the tray to one side to rest for 15 minutes to allow a slight skin to form.
preheat the oven to 320 degrees farenheight.
pick the tray up and drop it onto a flat surface from a small height… this forms the ‘feet’ that is associated with macaroons.
bake for 15 minutes, then remove and allow to chill at room temperature until completely cold.
sandwich the macaroons with a filling of choice… raspberry jam (pink), lemon curd (yellow) & nutella (blue).
serve and eat within 28 when at their freshest.
