Ingredients:
3 cups warm water
1 (.25 ounce) package yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
8 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat flour, or more if needed
2 cups olive oil
1 cup corn oil
2 cups fresh za'atar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix water, yeast, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Add all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, olive oil, and corn oil; mix using your hands, adding more whole wheat flour if needed, until dough holds together. Mix za'atar into dough until evenly incorporated (see notes).
Shape dough, about 1/4 cup per piece, into rounds on a floured work surface. Arrange rounds on baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
