Ingredients:
2 sticks butter, room temperature
2 cups granulated sugar
5 grade A large eggs
2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon either lemon or almond extract

Directions:
Cream room temperature butter and sugar until light and creamy. Add flour "a little at a time" and eggs, alternately, beginning and ending with flour. Add extracts. Pour batter into an angel food cake pan, greased and floured, then bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Cool. Store in an airtight container.
I have made this recipe for years. I have never had any luck with it if I changed it or used a different kind of pan. I don't use the lemon extract very often, I really like the almond better.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe that my Grammie used. It was her grandmother's recipe, she didn't know how far it went back. Her grandmother was from eastern Tennessee.
