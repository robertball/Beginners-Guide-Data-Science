Description: 
'As a parent of two teens with completely different tastes in food, I find it's a challenge to cook something that they'll both enjoy,' relates Donald Courtney of Farmington Hills, Michigan. 'I created this casserole to use up leftovers, and it turned out to be one of their favorites.'
