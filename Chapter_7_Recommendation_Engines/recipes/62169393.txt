Ingredients:
1 shallot
2 T. butter
2 T. flour
1  cup light cream
1  cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
1-2  cups chicken broth
1 pinch of salt
dash of cinnamon
T. sage
1/2 T. thyme

Directions:
Heat a small amount of oil in a pan over medium heat. Cook chopped shallots until soft (about 10 minutes).  Add the butter and melt. When the butter has melted, add the flour and whisk.  Once the flour has incorporated, add the cream, salt, and cinnamon. Continue to whisk for about 2 minutes until that is incorporated. Add the pumpkin and 1/2 cup chicken broth. If it is still not as thin as you would like, add more chicken broth 1/4 cup at a time. I used closer to 2 cups of chicken broth because I didn't want the sauce too thick.  You can thicken the sauce by simmering until the desired consistency is achieved. Add finely chopped sage and thyme at the very end.  Serve over pumpkin or cheese ravioli immediately.
