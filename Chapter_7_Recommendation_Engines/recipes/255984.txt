Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (16 ounce) package cinnamon bun frosting
2 cups white baking chips
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups coarsely broken cinnamon graham crackers

Directions:
Line a 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on both sides. Grease aluminum foil with cooking spray.
Combine cinnamon bun frosting, white baking chips, and butter in a large microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high in the microwave for 2 minutes. Stir until chips are completely melted and smooth.
Stir in vanilla extract and salt into the frosting mixture. Fold in graham crackers. Spread mixture evenly in the prepared baking pan.
Chill until firm, about 1 hour. Remove from pan by lifting edges of aluminum foil; cut into squares.
