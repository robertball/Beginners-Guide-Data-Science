Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves. 2 cups buttermilk. 2 cloves garlic. 1 cup fine bread crumbs. 1 cup parmesan cheese. 1 tsp Cavender's Greek Seasoning (optional). 1/2 to 3/4 cups olive oil.

Directions:
Cut chicken into strips and place in glass bowl. Dice garlic (the smaller the pieces the more garlicy it will taste) and sprinkle over chicken. Pour in buttermilk and stir. Cover and marinate overnight in fridge.
Combine breadcrumbs, parmesan and Cavender's. Pour olive oil into a frying pan and turn to med. to heat the oil. Roll chicken in the bread mixture and place into hot oil. Chicken is done when both sides are browned and the meat has turned white, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on how thick your strips are. Turn the heat down slightly if the chicken browns too fast to prevent burning.

Description: 
One night I thought I'd try something new and I came up with this recipe. A simple way to make the best chicken strips you'll ever have. My kids loved it so much it was hard to get them to eat the rest of the dinner. You do need to start it the night before to properly marinate the chicken though.
