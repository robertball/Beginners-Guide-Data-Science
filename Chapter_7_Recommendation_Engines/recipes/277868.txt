Ingredients:
Filling:
1 1/2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 cloves garlic, chopped, divided
1 1/4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, divided
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup chopped tomato
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 lemon, juiced
Assembly:
1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough
8 leaves fresh basil, chopped
1 bunch fresh spinach
6 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Combine chicken strips, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine tomato and onion with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cook chicken in a hot skillet until juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. Use 2 forks to shred the chicken in the skillet. Add lemon juice to finish cooking.
Divide pizza dough into 6 sections. Roll each section into a 6-inch circle on a floured surface, working fresh basil into the dough as you roll.
Layer spinach, chicken, mozzarella, and tomato mixture on one half of each circle. Fold over to cover the filling and press the curved edge to seal.
Lightly coat a baking sheet with olive oil. Lightly brush the tops of the empanadas with olive oil and transfer to the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
