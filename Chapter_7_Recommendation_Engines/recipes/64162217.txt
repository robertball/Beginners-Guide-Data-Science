Confetti Cornbread Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup white whole wheat flour (or your favorite gluten-free blend)
1 cup yellow corn meal
1/8 cup natural sugar (optional)
1 tablespoon EnerG egg replacer powder
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup low-fat plain soymilk (soymilk works best, but other non-dairy milks will do)
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup plain soy yogurt (may substitute apple sauce)
1/2 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeño pepper, seeds removed and minced OR 1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (omit for non-spicy cornbread)
1/2 C fresh or frozen corn kernels

Directions:
Spray or wipe a medium-sized cast iron skillet with oil. Place it in the oven and preheat to 400F. (If cast iron is not available, spray a 8×8-inch baking dish with oil, but do not put it in the oven to preheat.)
In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients well. In a smaller bowl, mix the soymilk, water, and yogurt (or apple sauce). Add wet to the dry and stir gently until evenly distributed, but don’t over-mix. Fold in the diced peppers and corn. Pour into the hot skillet or prepared pan and bake for 15 – 25 minutes. (A preheated skillet will take less time than a glass baking dish.) When a knife blade comes out clean, it’s done. Serve immediately.
