Ingredients:
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1 tablespoon Asian sweet chili sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 green onion, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
3 cups vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup Asian sweet chili sauce, for dipping

Directions:
Beat the egg white and water together in a small bowl; set aside. Lightly mix the ground beef, sausage, 1 tablespoon sweet chile sauce, five-spice powder, garlic powder, green onion, and salt and pepper. Place about 1 teaspoonful of the meat mixture onto a wonton wrapper with one corner facing you.  Fold in the left and right corners of the wrapper to slightly overlap the filling, then tightly roll the lower corner up to create a pocket around the filling. Continue rolling until just the tip of the remaining corner is visible; brush the corner with the egg white mixture to seal.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry the egg rolls in the hot oil in batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Serve with 1/2 cup of sweet chili sauce.
