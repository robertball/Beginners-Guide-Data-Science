Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and shredded
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cloves
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
cooking spray

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a colander. Place a cheesecloth over the potatoes, and squeeze the potatoes to release as much liquid as possible. Let the potatoes sit to release more liquid, then squeeze again.
In a large bowl, combine sweet potatoes, eggs, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, salt, cloves, and cinnamon; mix well.
Spray a non-stick pan with cooking spray. Set over medium heat.
Form mixture into pancake size cakes, and fry in hot pan. Flip cakes after 2 to 3 minutes (when bottom is browned), and brown other side. Serve piping hot!
