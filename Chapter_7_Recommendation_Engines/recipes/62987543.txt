Description: 
This is a great side dish to take to a potluck or a party.  
The Chili flavored Fritos will make a great addition to your football party.  
Remember to start one day in advance, as it needs to sit in refrigerator overnight before finishing it and serving.  
It can also be served as a dip instead of a sidedish by using Frito Scoops to dip it with.
