Ingredients:
12 hardboiled eggs, peeled
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons yellow mustard
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Tabasco
freshly ground black pepper (optional)
paprika (for garnish)

Directions:
Cut eggs in half and arrange the halves with the cut side facing up on a large plate or serving platter.
Scoop out the yolks into a medium size bowl.
Mash yolks with a fork and then stir in mayo, mustards, and Tabasco.
Mash and mix the yolk mixture until blended and smooth.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Evenly spoon mixture into egg whites. (If you want to make them look extra pretty, put the mixture into a plastic baggie, cut the corner of the baggie and pipe mixture through the hole into the whites.)
Finish off your eggs by sprinkling paprika over the top and serve immediately.
