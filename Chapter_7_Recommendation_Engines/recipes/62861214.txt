Ingredients:
For the butter beer
Cream Soda - measure about 3/4 of your preferred glass (I just buy the big 2 liter bottle at safeway)
4 Tablespoon water
3 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoon salted/unsalted butter
pinch of salt
1/4 teaspoon of  rum extract or amaretto (optional)
For the Froth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoon sugar
3  drops  butter extract
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1.5 tablespoon butterscotch topping or caramel syrup
pinch of salt
(add more sugar or syrup to your own liking)

Directions:
To make the syrup. First boil the water and brown sugar in a saucepan, stirring constantly. Turn down the heat and add butter, salt and rum extract. Let it simmer for 3 mins. Set aside and let it cool at room temp
To make the froth, whip the cream with a whisk or a stand alone mixer for 3-5 minutes until it starts to form. Slowly add the sugar, salt, butter extract, vanilla and butterscotch/caramel syrup. Beat until soft peaks form. Store in the refrigerator.
To assemble drink Pour 2 tablespoon of syrup into your preferred glass. (optional) Add ice, Add cream soda about 3/4 full (you can also freeze this first). Add a dollop of the butterscotch whipped cream. Stir and enjoy!
