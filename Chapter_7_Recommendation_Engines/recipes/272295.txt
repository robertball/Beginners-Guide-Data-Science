Ingredients:
1 cup marinara sauce, warmed
6 frozen fully cooked Italian meatballs, thawed and halved
1 (8 ounce) package crescent dough sheet (such as PillsburyÂ®)
6 tablespoons finely shredded Italian-style cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place marinara sauce in a medium bowl and add meatballs halves; toss to coat in the sauce.
Remove crescent dough sheet from the can and place on a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a well defined rectangle and cut into 4 equal rectangles.
Place 6 meatball halves cut-side down onto one of the rectangles, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Spoon a bit of the sauce over the meatballs and top with 3 tablespoons Italian cheese. Repeat with another rectangle.
Brush the border of each rectangle with beaten egg. Cover fillings with remaining rectangles, pinching edges with your fingers and straightening them as you go. Crimp the edges with a fork. Transfer both pockets to the baking sheet using a spatula. Brush with some beaten egg and sprinkle with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve with remaining marinara sauce for dipping.
