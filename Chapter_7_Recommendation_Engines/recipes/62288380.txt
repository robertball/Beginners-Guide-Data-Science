8 oz pkg cream cheese, softened
1/2 c finely shredded Monterey Jack or Muenster cheese
1/8 t cayenne pepper
2-3 oz smoked Gouda cheese
Garnish:  Dried parsley, paprika, poppy seeds, chopped pecans, chopped Craisins.
Small stick pretzels for serving.

Directions:
Blend cream cheese, shredded cheese and cayene in a small bowl.  Cover and chill for at least one hour.  Cut Gouda cheese into 30 small cubes.  For each cheese ball, form a scant 2 tsp of cream cheese mixture into a ball around a cheese cube.  If mixture becomes too soft to handle, return mixture to the refrigerator.  Roll cheese balls in garnish, chill until serving time.  Stick small straight pretzel in each ball for easy serving, or place next to tray.
