Ingredients:
1 loaf SARA LEE® Soft & Smooth™ Whole Grain White Bread
1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, diced
1 cup blueberries
2 cups liquid egg substitute
1 cup fat-free milk
1 cup fat free half-and-half
1/3 cup maple syrup
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup water
1 cup blueberries
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Place half of the bread cubes in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle cheese on top of bread cubes. Top with 1 cup blueberries and remaining bread. In a large bowl, beat together egg substitute, milk, half-and-half, and maple syrup. Pour egg mixture over bread. Cover pan, and refrigerate overnight.
The next morning, remove pan from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cover pan with aluminum foil, and bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover pan, and bake for an additional 30 minutes, until golden brown and center is set.
Meanwhile, prepare the blueberry sauce. In a saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, and water. Boil over medium heat for 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Stir in blueberries, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer 8 to 10 minutes, or until the berries have burst.  Stir in butter, and serve the sauce over squares of strata.
