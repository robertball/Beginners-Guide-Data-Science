1/2 cup chunky homestyle applesauce
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1-2 small (4 ounce) boxes vanilla instant pudding
1 cup nuts, chopped

Cream Cheese Frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add ingredients as listed except for coconut.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with cinnamon-sugar mixture of 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar.
Pour the batter evenly into loaf or cake pans and sprinkle the remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture on the top.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
Spread cream cheese frosting on cooled cake. Sprinkle with toasted coconut.
ENJOY!
