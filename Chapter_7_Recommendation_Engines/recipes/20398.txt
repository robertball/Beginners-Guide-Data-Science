Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
4 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
3/4 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
16 large marshmallows, halved
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
On top of a double boiler, beat together the egg yolks, vinegar, sugar, mustard and salt.  Cook over medium heat until mixture becomes thick.  Remove from heat.  Add the marshmallows to the mixture and stir until dissolved.
Whip 1/2 pint of the whipping cream until soft peaks form, and then fold it into the cooked ingredients.  If mixture is too thick, thin it by adding a little cream or fruit juice.  Add to your favorite fruit salad and use enough dressing to make it the consistency you desire.
Store dressing, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for a week or so.
