Ingredients:
1 cup butter unsalted (or 1/2 cup)
1 1/4 cups sugar (brown or white)
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoons corn syrup
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup chocolate chips

Directions:
Grease a 10x15 jelly roll pan.
In a medium-sized, heavy bottomed saucepan (10 cup) (2.4 liter) combine the sugar, water, butter, and corn syrup.
Have the baking soda and vanilla extract ready.
Bring the sugar mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar then cover the pan with a lid for about one minute to allow the sides of the pan to wash themselves down and dissolve any sugar crystals.
Remove lid after one minute. Clamp a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pan, and cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 285 degrees F (140 degrees C) (soft-crack stage) on a candy thermometer.
Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat as the temperature will continue to rise to 290 degrees F (145 degrees C). Add the baking soda and vanilla extract and stir to combine.
Immediately pour this mixture onto your baking sheet. Sprinkle the chopped chocolate over the hot toffee. After a few minutes the chocolate will be soft enough to spread with an offset spatula (or back of a spoon) in an even layer over the toffee.
