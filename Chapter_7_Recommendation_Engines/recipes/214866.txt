Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sea salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon lemon pepper
4 (6 ounce) grouper fillets
3 tablespoons clarified butter
3 1/2 tablespoons chilled butter
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 cups hot milk

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, pepper, and lemon pepper in bowl until well blended. Reserve 4 1/2 tablespoons of seasoned flour in a small bowl, and set aside. Rinse grouper fillets, and pat dry. Dredge grouper in the seasoned flour.
Melt the clarified butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place the grouper in the skillet and cook until lightly browned and the fish is easily flaked with a fork, 2 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove from skillet, and set aside. Drain any remaining clarified butter in the skillet, and wipe clean. Add the chilled butter and lemon juice to the skillet. Cook and stir until the butter is melted. Gradually whisk in the reserved seasoned flour; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Stir in the hot milk, whisking constantly until the sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes more. Serve sauce over the grouper.
