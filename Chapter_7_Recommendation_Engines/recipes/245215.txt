Ingredients:
1 (7 pound) bone-in ham
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup molasses
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham in a roasting pan and cover pan with aluminum foil.
Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until butter is softened and slightly melted, about 30 seconds. Mix honey and molasses into butter until evenly combined. Add maple syrup and ginger; mix well. Heat mixture in the microwave until glaze is smooth, about 30 seconds.
Bake ham in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Baste ham and continue baking, basting every 20 to 30 minutes, for 1 hour more. Remove foil and bake until ham is cooked through, about 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
