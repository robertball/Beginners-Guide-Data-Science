4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
Garlic powder
egg
6 slices Swiss or Provolone cheese

Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. Dip chicken in egg wash.  Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder.  Place 1 cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick.  Coat chicken evenly with bread crumbs. Add small pat of butter on top of each roll.
Bake for 25 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink. Remove from oven, and place 1/2 cheese slice on top of each breast.  Return to oven for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese has melted. Remove toothpicks, and serve immediately.
