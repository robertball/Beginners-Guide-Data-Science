Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top each breast with 1 slice of cheese.

Description: 
Here's one of our favorite chicken dishes that is VERY quick to put together! (Note: You can use regular stuffing mix instead of low sodium, but in this case use only 1/2 of the seasoning packet; otherwise, the dish will be too salty.)
