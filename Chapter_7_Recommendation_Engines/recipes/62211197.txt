Ingredients:
4 pkgs bread cube stuffing
4 cups chopped celery
4 cups chopped onions
2 lbs butter
1 sm. can sage
1 sm. can poultry seasoning

Directions:
"Melt 1/2 of butter in large pan, add celery and onion, saute 'til brown. Add 1/2 of stuffing to absorb melted butter (rest of butter to now be melted in saucepan). Mix seasonings in while adding remainder of stuffing and melted butter. Stir it all up real good and stuff the bird with 1/2 of the stuff and put the rest in a small pan so people can nibble on it while dinner's cookin', and if any is left you can heat it up and baste it with drippings." ~Betty
