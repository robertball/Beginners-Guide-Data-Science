Ingredients:
3 large russet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into wedges
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning

1 teaspoon paprika
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place potato wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Sprinkle potato wedges with Parmesan cheese and toss again.
Mix Italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, and salt together in a small bowl. Sprinkle over the wedges and toss to coat. Arrange wedges skin-side down on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until fork-tender and golden, about 40 minutes.
