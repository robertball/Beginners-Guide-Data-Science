Ingredients:
3 Italian-style turkey sausages, casings removed
4 ounces portobello mushrooms, coarsely chopped
2 shallots, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi
1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon Italian herbs (such as cantanzaro herbs from Savory Spice ShopÂ®)
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a heavy skillet over medium high heat and cook sausage until no longer pink, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon as it cooks, about 7 minutes. Continue to brown the meat and add mushrooms, shallots, butter, and oil. Cook until mushrooms and onions are soft and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Add white wine to the sausage mixture and simmer, uncovered, until wine has reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add gnocchi, cream, Italian herbs, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook over medium-low heat until sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a comforting dish and is indulgent with ingredients like wine, cream, and shallots. I do not recommend adding salt because I find the sausage to have enough salt in it. Although cheese is optional, I find it gets lost in the sauce.
