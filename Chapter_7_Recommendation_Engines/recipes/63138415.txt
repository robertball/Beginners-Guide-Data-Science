Ingredients:
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tsp table salt, divided
1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground, divided (or less to taste)
1 pound(s) uncooked lean pork tenderloin, trimmed, cut into 16 thin slices
2 1/2 tsp olive oil, divided
3/4 cup(s) canned chicken broth, reduced-sodium
1/4 cup(s) fresh lemon juice
2 tsp cornstarch
2 tsp salted butter
1 Tbsp capers, drained
12 oz fresh spinach, baby-variety

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; sprinkle over both sides of pork, shaking off excess.
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork (in 2 batches if necessary) and cook until just cooked through and golden, about 1 1/2 minutes per side; set aside on a serving plate and cover to keep warm.
In a cup, whisk together broth, lemon juice, cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until blended. Pour into same skillet and whisk to combine with pan drippings; simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat; stir in butter until melted. Stir in capers and spoon over pork; cover to keep warm.
Heat remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spinach to skillet in batches, tossing mixture and adding more spinach as some of it cooks down; cook, tossing, until wilted and tender, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, a pinch of pepper and serve with pork. Yields 4 slices pork, about 3 tablespoons sauce and 1/2 cup spinach per serving.
