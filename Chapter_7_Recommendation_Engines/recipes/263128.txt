Ingredients:
1 large jicama

Directions:
Wash jicama thoroughly with cool water and remove all dirt using a vegetable brush. Trim both ends of the jicama and peel with a vegetable peeler, removing all skin and tough flesh.
Cut jicama first in half crosswise, then cut each half into paper thin slices using a sharp knife or the thinnest blade of a mandoline.
Use them immediately as crisp tortillas, or store for up to a week in a resealable plastic bag in the fridge.

Submitter: 
Crema
Description: 
Delicious low-carb tortillas for tacos and enchiladas made with jicama. You can eat them raw for a crispy texture or steam them if you like a softer tortilla. These are grain-free tortillas that are keto and vegan friendly.
