Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) 3-inch thick beef top sirloin steak
2 cups white sugar

Directions:
Place steak in a large bowl. Knead sugar into meat to form a thick crust. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature; 3 to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Cook steak on preheated grill until each side is caramelized, about 10 minutes per side.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place steak on prepared baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until steak is starting to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 20 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Remove from oven and let rest for 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This steak is a real showstopper! So easy and, despite the copious sugar rub, quite savory and juicy! My family's favorite way to grill steak. This steak comes out perfectly mid-rare every time. Always a winner. Very impressive way to cook steak. The sugar forms a crust sealing in the juices. There is no sugar taste!
