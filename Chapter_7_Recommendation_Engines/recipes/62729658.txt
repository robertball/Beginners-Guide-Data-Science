Ingredients:
1 package refrigerated crescent roll dough (8 count)
1/2 cup miniature chocolate chips
1 egg white, beaten until frothy
1 Tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Divide dough into 8 triangles along perforations
Sprinkle 2 tsp mini chocolate chips onto each triangle.
Roll up each triangle, beginning at the wide end. Curve the crescent slightly, and place on the baking sheet, point down. Lightly pinch dough together to keep chips from falling out during baking.
Brush tops of crescents with eggwhites and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake in preheated oven 11-13 minutes or until light, golden brown.
Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
I developed this recipe one evening to use up some refrigerated crescent roll dough I had on hand. I recalled having delicious chocolate chip crescent rolls one time years earlier and decided to try to duplicate them. These come pretty close. Skip the sugar if you like. These are great with a hot cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk.
