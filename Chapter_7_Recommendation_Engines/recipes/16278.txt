Ingredients:
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
2 1/2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt to taste
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 pounds round steak, pounded to about 1/2 inch thickness
4 cups vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine the milk, hot pepper sauce and salt in a medium bowl. Measure one cup of flour into a second medium bowl. In a third medium bowl, combine the remaining flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt and ground black pepper.
First coat the steak in the unseasoned flour, then dip in the milk mixture, and finally coat meat in the seasoned flour. Repeat as necessary if there's more than one piece of meat.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Fry the coated meat in the oil for 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Drain meat on paper towels. (Note: Make sure the oil is fully heated before deep frying.)
