Ingredients:
4 ripe Haas avocados*
1 medium yellow (Spanish) onion, diced
2 ripe tomatoes, medium, diced, with juice and seeds
juice of 1 fresh lemon
5-6 drops Tobasco sauce (to taste)
1 tsp. salt (to taste)
*The best guacamole is made with ripe avocado's. To test for ripeness before buying: the skin of the avocado will be dark brown (or black). When you press on it, it should "give", but only just a bit. If it feels very soft, it's overripe. If it's hard to the touch it's not ripe yet.

Directions:
Peel an avocado by cutting it in half lengthwise (around the seed). Then slice each half lengthwise again. You'll now have 4 wedges. Remove the seed by hand. Using your hands, peel the skin off. (If the skin doesn't peel readily, the avocado isn't ripe.)
Place the peeled avocados in a bowl and mash well with a fork (don't use any kind of electric beater or blender... do all the mashing and mixing by hand).
Add the onion, tomatoes (with juice and seeds) and mix well.
Add the lemon, Tobasco sauce, and salt. Mix well with a wooden spoon.
Taste and adjust Tobasco and salt to your liking.
Mix further with wooden spoon until the consistency is almost smooth.
Serve immediately or store.*
*To store: place a sheet of plastic wrap directly on top of the guacamole, pushing down on it to block any air from getting onto the guacamole (this will keep it from turning brown). Set in the refrigerator until about half an hour before serving. Guacamole is most flavorful at room temperature.

Description: 
This recipe is as close to what you'll find in a good Mexican restaurant along the southwest US border. It's so good, it's addictive.
