Ingredients:
1 cup cottage cheese
3 eggs
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
1/4 cup blueberries, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Strain cottage cheese in a sieve fitted over a bowl, pressing down occasionally, until cottage cheese has dried out, about 1 hour.
Beat eggs in a medium bowl; add cottage cheese, flour, melted butter, and salt. Mix until just blended.
Heat butter in a frying pan over medium-high heat; drop large spoonfuls of batter into the melted butter. Sprinkle blueberries into batter. Cook until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.

Description: 
These are an old favorite of mine. I use small-curd, low-fat cottage cheese. They come out thin and delicate, somewhere between a classic pancake and a crepe. A nice addition to a reduced-carb diet.
