Ingredients:
1/4 cup Asian fish sauce
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons honey
2 1/4 pounds fresh tuna steaks, cubed
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
4 fresh tomatoes, chopped
1 bunch green onion, finely chopped
1 small fresh red chile pepper, seeded and chopped
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1/2 cup fresh basil

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together fish sauce, lime juice, and honey. Place tuna in a large, plastic, resealable bag, and pour fish sauce mixture over the tuna. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wok over high heat. When the oil is very hot, almost smoking, place 1/2 tuna in pan; cook and stir for 1 minute, or until desired doneness. Transfer cooked fish to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining oil and tuna.
Toss warm fish with tomatoes, green onion, red chile pepper, cilantro, and basil. Serve.
