Ingredients:
1 /2 small spaghetti squash cut in halves and seeds removed (you can cook both halves and save the other for another meal).
1 carrot shredded or spiralized
1 small cucumber thinly sliced and cut julliene
1 cup cabbage shredded
1 cup broccoli chopped
2 scallions minced
1 sprig mint shredded
1/4 cup roasted salted peanuts
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/3 cup peanut butter
2 Tbs tamari sauce
1/4 tsp minced ginger
1/4 tsp minced garlic
1/2 lime juice
1/2 tsp agave syrup
splash of sriracha sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Baked half/halves of spaghetti sauce cut side down on sheet pans for 30 minutes. While squash is cooking and cooling, make the sauce and prep the vegetables.
Peanut Sauce: Combine peanut butter, tamari, salt, ginger, garlic, syrup and heat in a ceramic or glass bowl in the microwave on high 1 minute until very soft.  Add lime juice and sriracha and stir until well mixed.
When the spaghetti squash has cooled sufficiently to work, separate strands (noodles) with fingers or a fork into a large bowl.
Combine all the vegetables, mint, and sauce when ready to serve.  Top with peanuts.
