Ingredients:
6 large tomatoes
3 serrano chile peppers, stemmed, or to taste
3 cloves garlic, peeled
3 dried California chile peppers, stemmed and seeded
1/3 cup water
1/4 onion
3 tablespoons chicken bouillon
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 pinches ground black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place tomatoes, serrano chile peppers, garlic, and California chile peppers in a large saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; simmer until tomatoes are fairly soft but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Transfer tomato mixture to a blender. Add 1/3 cup water, onion, chicken bouillon, cumin, cloves, and black pepper. Puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add flour and blend until combined, about 10 seconds.
Pour blended mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Description: 
This is my personal enchilada sauce that my kids love. I came up with this recipe by mixing my grandmother's and mother-in-law's recipes together... it is muy rico and worth the work.
