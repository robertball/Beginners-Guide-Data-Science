Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package wide egg noodles
3 tablespoons butter (plus extra to grease dish)
5 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 (15.5 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1 (40 ounce) can Bruce'sÂ® Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in Syrup, drained
Pumpkin pie spice for sprinkling over pudding

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Butter a large 13x10-inch (4 quart) baking dish; set aside.
Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and return to saucepan along with butter; mix well to coat the noodles.
In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, cream, sugar, salt, sour cream and pineapple.
Cut the sweet potatoes into small chunks then add to the egg mixture.
Stir sweet potatoes into the noodle mixture, mix well then transfer to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with pumpkin pie spice.
Bake for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden brown and the pudding is set.
Allow pudding to cool for at least 40 minutes before cutting into squares.
This side dish can be served warm or, even better, at room temperature.
