Ingredients:
39 regular Oreo cookies
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
16 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
1 tablespoon coconut oil or vegetable oil
2 regular-size candy canes, finely crushed

Directions:
Place the Oreo cookies in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Add the cream cheese and peppermint extract and pulse until the mixture is well combined and smooth.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the mixture into balls about 1-inch in diameter. I like to use this cookie scoop.
Place the cookie balls in the freezer until well chilled, at least 1 hour or up to 1 day.
When cookie balls are chilled, combine the chopped chocolate and oil in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring between bursts, until just melted and smooth. Do not overheat.
Drop each cookie ball into melted chocolate, coating evenly. Remove with a fork, gently tapping off excess chocolate. Place back on cookie sheet and immediately sprinkle with the crushed candy canes. Repeat with the remaining cookie balls.
Refrigerate until set before serving. Store the truffles in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Description: 
While I prefer a smoother texture, you can add some crushed candy canes into the cookie mixture for more peppermint taste and crunch.
