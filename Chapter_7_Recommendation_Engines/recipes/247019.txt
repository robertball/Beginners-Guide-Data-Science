Ingredients:
Tuna:
1 teaspoon finely chopped red onion
1 teaspoon minced red bell pepper
1 tablespoon frozen green peas, thawed
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 teaspoon grated carrot
Salt and pepper to taste
1 (5 ounce) can Bumble BeeÂ® Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, drained and chunked
Dressing:
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice
1/4 teaspoon sriracha chili garlic sauce
1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 large fresh eggs
1 English muffin, split and toasted
Garnish:
Chopped cilantro
Black sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Place the red onion, red bell pepper, peas, ginger, carrots, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Stir together, and then fold in the tuna.
In a small bowl, whisk the sesame oil, rice vinegar, lime juice, and Sriracha(R).  Pour over the tuna mixture and toss gently, trying not to break up the tuna.
Add a tablespoon of vinegar to a pan of lightly-salted water and bring it to a gentle simmer, not a hard boil (you'll see little bubbles in the pan).  Crack each egg into a ramekin.  Stir the water in a wide circle (like a whirlpool), and then slide in the egg; repeat for the second egg.  Poach the eggs at a simmer for 4-5 minutes for soft yolks.  Remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to a paper towel and allow to drain.
To serve, top half of an English muffin with half of the tuna mixture, place a poached egg on top, and then sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and black sesame seeds.
