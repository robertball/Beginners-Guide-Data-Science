Ingredients:
5 Pound bag red potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
2 Teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 Cups chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) Container sour cream
1 (8 ounce) Package cream cheese
1/2 Cup melted butter
Salt to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot of water.  Boil and cook until tender.  Drain in strainer.
In a large bowl, mash potatoes with sour cream and cream cheese, slowly adding the chicken broth.  Add garlic powder and salt to taste.  Mash until all ingredients are blended.
After mashing, use an electric mixer on the highest speed and whip the potatoes for 2 minutes.
Transfer the potatoes into a slow cooker. Cover, and cook on low for 3 hours. (You can stir the potatoes a few times while cooking, but it is not necessary.)
Just before serving, melt butter in the microwave and stir in to potatoes until well blended.
Note:  Can easily be made ahead.  Just cool, cover and store in refrigerator overnight.
