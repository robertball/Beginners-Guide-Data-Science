Ingredients:
1 Egg
1 tsp Salt
1 TB Sugar
1-2 tsp Baking Powder
Milk & Flour (See Directions for amount)

Directions:
Use a whisk or egg-beater to mix up the 4 first ingredients. Pour in the amount of milk for how much you want to make. Add Flour 1/2 cup at a time until it is the consistency you want. I usually like the consistency to be pourable, but somewhat thick. You will know what consistency you desire after you have made this batter a couple of times. Heat up the griddle and grease it. With a ladle, pour desired size of pancake onto griddle and cook until brown. I flip the pancakes when the bubbles that have developed start to pop (this usually means that they are golden brown).

Description: 
I call these Cowboy Pancakes because that is what my nephew termed them. They are very easy to make and are wonderful. I am asked to make these whenever we have overnight guests.
