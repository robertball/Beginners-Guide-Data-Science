Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup finely shredded Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons cold butter
1/3 cup cold water

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sage and salt; stir in cheese. Cut in butter until crumbly. Gradually add water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Cut in half lengthwise; cut each half widthwise into 1-in strips. Twist each strip two to three times. Place 1 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 425 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
