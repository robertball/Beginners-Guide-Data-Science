Ingredients:
A splash of Olive Oil
20 ml Worcester Sauce (1 1/2 Tablespoons)
A few drops Tabasco
A pinch of Salt and Pepper
1 slug of Tomato Ketchup
1 Tablespoon of Dijon Mustard
1 Knife-tip Curry powder
4 Anchovy fillets
2 Tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 Tablespoon finely chopped Gherkins
1/2 Tablespoon Capers squashed and chopped lightly to release the beautiful aroma
300 gms (10 1/2 Ounces) freshly chopped (finely) Beef Fillet - so much better when done by hand.
2 Egg yolks (freeze the egg whites if you like, or make meringues, souffl√©s or chocolate fondants with them)
2 glugs of a light-coloured beer

Directions:
In a soup bowl, drop some olive oil, 2 teaspoons or so.
Add the Worcester sauce and a few dashes of Tabasco, then a pinch of salt and pepper, the glug of Ketchup, the French Mustard and the curry powder.
Mix thoroughly.
On a flat plate, crush and tear the anchovies with 2 forks until they are finely separated.
Add the onion, gherkins and capers and stir together before scraping into the soup bowl and mixing thoroughly.
Now add the meat to the rest and again mix throroughly.
Finally, add the egg yolks and the glugs of beer and give it a last thorough mixing.
Serve with (thin) toast, buttered.

Description: 
Tartare is a word that the French give to something with (mostly) raw ingredients, and that are minced and/or chopped. This is a world-famous award-winning recipe given to my father by the barman at a deluxe hotel, who would knock this up on demand in record time. And boy, was it in demand!
