https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup sukiyaki sauce
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (1 1/2) pound beef sirloin steak, sliced thinly across the grain
2 heads red leaf lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces
1 onion, sliced thin
1 bunch radishes, sliced into thin rounds
1 English cucumber, thinly sliced
2 tomatoes, sliced
1 jicama, peeled and julienned
6 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
1 cup peanut oil

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce, sukiyaki sauce, water, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl.
Arrange the sliced steak in the bottom of a shallow baking dish. Pour about 1/2 of the soy sauce mixture over the steak. Allow to marinate 30 minutes.
Build the salad by layering onto a platter the lettuce, onion, radish, cucumber, tomato, jicama, and eggs in that order.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the marinated steak strips in the hot oil to desired doneness, 3 minutes each side for medium-well.
