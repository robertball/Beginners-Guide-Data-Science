Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped pecans, divided
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 (4 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
2 cups cold milk
1 (16 ounce) container whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®)
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup (such as Hershey's®), or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix flour, 1/2 cup pecans, and melted butter together in a bowl; pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and press to form a crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely.
Whisk cream cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl until smooth; spread evenly over crust.
Beat vanilla pudding mix, chocolate pudding mix, and milk together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened; pour over cream cheese layer. Spoon whipped topping evenly over pudding layer.
Drizzle chocolate syrup over whipped topping layer making abstract designs; sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup pecans. Refrigerate until chilled and set, about 2 hours.
