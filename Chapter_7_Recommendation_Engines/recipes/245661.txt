Ingredients:
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce
1 (14 ounce) can jellied cranberry sauce
1/2 (14.4 ounce) package graham crackers
8 ounces heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Chill a large metal bowl in the refrigerator or freezer, about 15 minutes.
Mix whole berry cranberry sauce and jellied cranberry sauce together in a bowl.
Place graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin into crumbs.
Pour heavy cream into the chilled bowl and whip with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Add sugar and vanilla extract; whip until medium peaks form, about 2 minutes more.
Place half of the graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of a trifle bowl. Top with half of the cranberry mixture and whipped cream. Repeat layers, ending with whipped cream. Chill until set, at least 3 hours.

Description: 
My grandmother used to make this, but she used saltines and straight cranberry. I've adapted it to fit our family's taste.
