Ingredients:
2 pounds apples, peeled, thinly sliced
4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup maple syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup white sugar
2/3 cup cornstarch
1 dash salt
3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 dash ground nutmeg

Directions:
Toss apple slices with lemon juice and set aside. Combine water, maple syrup, vanilla, sugar, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large saucepan, stirring until well mixed.
Bring maple syrup mixture to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves, and the mixture thickens and turns clear. Fold in apple slices and return to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to stand for 15 minutes before spooning into a prepared pie crust or freezing.
