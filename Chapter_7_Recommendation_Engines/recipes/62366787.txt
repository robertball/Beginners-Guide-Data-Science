Ingredients:
1/2 c. mayonnaise
2 Tbsp. mustard
2 Tbsp. honey
1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
1/2 Tbsp. lemon juice
3 c. red cabbage, chopped
2 c. carrots, sliced
2 c. cauliflower, cut small

Directions:
Combine first five ingredients. The flavor is better when prepared in advance. I keep some sauce made up and in the fridge in one of those honey bear bottles.
Steam your vegetables just til they are soft. About 8-10 minutes.
In large bowl, combine the honey mustard sauce with the veggies.
Mix well to coat.
Serve hot. Though, it's also good cold.
