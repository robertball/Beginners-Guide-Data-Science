Pressure Cooker Pot Roast Recipe

Ingredients:
Beef chuck, 2 lb, cubed
2 T Peanut or other frying oil
Large Onion (white or red), diced
Large Carrot, chopped or in 1/2" pieces
2 C water
3 to 4 T flour
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
In fry pan, brown each side of beef cube.
Remove beef from fry pan as cubes are done and place on plate or in a bowl to collect drippings.
Brown onion in frying pan used for beef. When almost done, brown carrots.
Add 2 cups of water to the frying pan, plus the beef drippings, then place the contents of the frying pan into the pressure cooker.
If your PC has a steamer pan, place beef in it. If not, place the beef in the liquid.
Bring to high pressure and cook for 15 minutes. Release steam at the end of that time. If you don't have a steamer pan, remove the beef from the broth.
Put a quarter cup of juice (or more) in a cup that can bear heat, let the juice cool, then whip flour into the juice.
Return the juice with flour to the juice in the PC. Heat until thick for gravy. Salt and pepper to taste.
NOTE: Ideally, this should be served with potatoes or rice. I make either one separately. Placing potatoes in a PC simply adds to the cooking time.
