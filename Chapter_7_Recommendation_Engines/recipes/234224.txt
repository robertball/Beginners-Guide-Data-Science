Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 egg, beaten
1 clove garlic, minced
2 grinds fresh black pepper
1/2 cup chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour, or as needed
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
2 slices Swiss cheese

Directions:
Mix quinoa, mustard, egg, garlic, and black pepper together in a bowl; add enough chickpea flour to hold mixture together to form 2 patties.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook patties in the hot oil until browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Add a Swiss cheese slice to each patty and warm until cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.
