Ingredients:
1 pinch saffron, ground fine
1 Cup warm milk
pinch salt
2 Cups heavy cream
1 TB pure vanilla extract
1/2 - 11/2tablespoons rose syrup to taste (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 cup chopped pistachio nuts slightly roasted
1 cup whipped cream spread on sheet then frozen in freezer until frozen.  (do this before making Ice cream-also optional)

Directions:
Add the saffron to the warm milk and set aside for 15 minutes.
Combine the cream, saffron with milk, rose syrup, cardamom, and pistachios in an automatic Ice Cream maker.  I use the Cusinart IC Maker.   Stir until the ice cream is smooth and yellow in color. Scoop the ice cream into a freezer container and freeze 2 hours, or until ready to eat.  Remove 15 min. before serving and let soften. Enjoy!
