Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup milk, scalded and cooled
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
4 tablespoons melted butter
3 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Mix flour,  sugar and salt.  Cut in butter, as for pastry.
Soften yeast in water.  Combine milk, egg yolk and softened  yeast. Add to flour mixture and mix well.
Cover dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Place dough on a lightly floured cutting board and knead lightly.  Cover with a cloth and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
Roll dough into a rectangle, 10x18 inches, and brush with soft    butter.    Mix 1/2 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon and sprinkle    evenly over dough.  Roll as for jelly roll, sealing the edge.  The    roll should be 18 inches long.
Cut dough into 1-inch slices.
Mix remaining sugar and cinnamon on a large square of waxed paper or  aluminum foil.  Place slices, one at a time, on sugar mixture and roll   into 5-inch balls.
Sprinkle nuts on top and press gently.
Place dough on ungreased cookie sheets, brush with melted butter and    sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of the sugar-cinnamon mixture.
Bake immediately in a preheated 400 degree oven about 12 minutes.  Cool  on wire racks.
