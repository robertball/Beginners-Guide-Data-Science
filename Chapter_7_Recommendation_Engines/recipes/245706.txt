Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) whole red snapper
sea salt to taste
1/4 cup vegetable oil, divided
6 tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
2 bird's eye chiles, seeded and finely sliced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
6 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon palm sugar
2 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Directions:
Cut heads off each snapper and score skin on each side; sprinkle with sea salt.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add snapper and pan-fry until skin is brown and crispy and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Place snapper on a serving platter and return skillet to stove top.
Cook remaining oil, tomatoes, chiles, and garlic over high heat in a skillet until tomatoes soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water, fish sauce, and palm sugar; simmer until mixture is reduced slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in green onions, cilantro, and cornstarch; simmer until mixture is reduced to a sticky-sauce consistency, about 1 minute more. Pour sauce over fish to serve.

Description: 
Sweet and spicy, snapper holds up really well to this cooking, but feel free to use a fish of your liking. Also you can just use fillets instead of whole fish, but for wow factor whole fish is the way. Serve with rice.
