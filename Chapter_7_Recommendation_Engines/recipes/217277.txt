Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch Swiss chard, cut into thin strips
10 cremini mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
12 grape tomatoes, quartered
2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic in the oil until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the Swiss chard to the garlic and cook until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes; transfer the chard and garlic to a bowl, reserving any liquid in the skillet and returning it to the heat.
Cook the mushrooms and onion to the reserved liquid in the skillet until warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the balsamic vinegar over the mushroom and onion mixture; cook and stir another 2 to 3 minutes; add to the bowl with the chard mixture along with the tomatoes. Gently mix to incorporate. Toss with the blue cheese. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
