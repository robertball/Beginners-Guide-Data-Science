Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 cups water
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda together in a bowl; add water, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan before slicing.

Description: 
This is my mother-in-law's grandmother's recipe from the Depression era. When eggs and milk were in very short supply she created this recipe out of need. It is our favorite cake AND it is easy to make! No mixer is needed. Just a light whisking gets it all mixed. Don't let the fact that it is vegan fool you - you'd never guess it by the taste! Enjoy!
