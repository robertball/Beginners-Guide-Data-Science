Ingredients:
1 8-10 lb. turkey
1 small apple, peeled
1 small onion, peeled
1 small potato, peeled
1 lemon, cut in half
3 oz. butter
6 oz. thick honey

Directions:
Pat turkey dry place in roasting pan.  Put apple, onion, and potato inside the turkey; season lightly with salt and pepper (omit seasonings if brining first).  Rub skin lightly with the lemon halves, and add the lemon halves to the inside of the turkey.
Pre-heat oven to 400.  Melt the butter and honey together in a small saucepan, stirring constantly to combine, and pour the mixture over the turkey, making sure to cover the skin.  Allow to stand for about 30-40 minutes, frequently spooning the butter/honey mixture over the turkey.
Roast turkey for 30 minutes, basting two or three times with butter/honey.  Reduce oven to 350, and roast for a further 30 minutes, basting frequently.  If needed, add a cup of chicken stock to pan to keep juices from drying out.  Cover turkey with foil, and continue roasting, until juices run clear when thickest part of the leg is pierced.
For the last 15 minutes of cooking, remove the foil to crisp the skin and baste one last time.
Let rest 15 minutes before carving.   While resting, make gravy using the pan juices.

Description: 
Because I usually have very herb- and chestnut-filled stuffing, I wanted a roast turkey that is simple and traditional. I picked up this recipe in England, and absolutely love it.  The gravy made from the pan drippings is heavenly!
