Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup cold butter, sliced
1 1/4 cups sourdough starter

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly coat with butter. Set aside.
Place flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a food processor. Add butter; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Pour flour-butter mixture into a bowl. Stir in sourdough starter until flour is moistened.
Turn dough onto a sheet of waxed paper. Cover with another sheet of waxed paper and roll out to 1-inch thickness. Peel off the top layer of waxed paper and cut into 8 biscuits. Arrange biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Gather scraps, roll out, and cut again. Let biscuits rise at room temperature until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake biscuits in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
Easy biscuits made with sourdough starter. The dough is very easy to use and between waxed paper, does not get too dry or too full of flour. You may put a little butter on the tops after removing from the oven. I double the recipe to make 16 biscuits. I freeze and take out what I need.
