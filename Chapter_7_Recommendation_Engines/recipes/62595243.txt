Ingredients:
1 lb. package ground chicken
1 small to medium sized onion (diced)
3 cloves of garlic (or to taste)(minced)
2 teaspoons of fresh ginger (minced)
3 tbs. Canola oil (or other neutral-tasting oil)
1 can sliced water chestnuts (cut into small pieces)
1 package of fresh baby corn (diced)
1 cup sugar snap pea pods (diced)
1 cup mushrooms (any variety-diced)
5 tbs. soy sauce (gluten-free, if needed)
1 tbs. rice vinegar
1 tsp. sesame oil
2 heads of Boston lettuce (leaves separated, washed and dried)

Directions:
Add canola oil to large wok or frying pan and turn stove on to medium. Add onions, garlic, ginger, and mushrooms to pan and cook for 2 minutes over medium heat. Add ground chicken and allow to cook for 5 minutes, breaking up into small pieces. At this point, add the soy sauce and rice vinegar to the pan while you chop your corn, water chestnuts, and pea pods into small bite-sized pieces. Add the corn and water chestnuts to the pan and cover to let cook for another 4 minutes. Add pea pods to the mix and cover. Add sesame oil and toss the mixture together. At this point, if it needs more soy sauce or vinegar, add to taste.
Use the biggest leaves of the lettuce to scoop about 4 large tablespoons of the mixture into. Fold the lettuce around the chicken mixture and enjoy!

Description: 
These are even better (and, I'm convinced, WAY healthier) than the popular restaurant chain best-known for their lettuce wraps. These wraps are gluten free, as long as you use GF/wheat-free soy sauce/tamari.
