Description: 
MU HUSBAND is a typical 'meat and potatoes' man. Tired of the usual mashed or baked potato treatment, I began to experiment in the kitchen, and this recipe is the result.    Potatoes prepared this way go well with an omelet for breakfast or a steak for dinner. -Mary Favatella Becker, Mohnton, Pennsylvania
