Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 Tbs wheat germ
4 Tbs ground flax meal
1 Tbs onion powder
1 Tbs garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp white granulated sugar
1/3 cup olive oil
1 cup COLD chicken broth
4 Tbs any combination of flax, sesame, sunflower, and/or poppy seeds
Koser salt for sprinkling

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, wheat germ, flax meal, onion powder, garlic powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and sugar. Pour in the olive oil and broth; mix until just blended.
Gently knead seeds into dough.
Divide dough in half and, on a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough as thin as possible.  Cut dough into strips 2 inches wide. Place dough strips on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat and mark squares out with a knife, but don't cut through. Prick each cracker with a fork a few times, and sprinkle with Kosher salt.  Repeat with the second half of the dough.
Bake for 20-25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until crisp and light brown. Thicker crackers may take a few more minutes of baking to get crispy. When cool, remove from baking sheet and separate into individual crackers.  Store in an air-tight container.
