Ingredients:
1 (24 ounce) loaf Wonder® Classic White Sandwich Bread
1 cup butter
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sage
1 1/2 cups boiling water
Turkey giblets, cooked and chopped (optional)

Directions:
At least 6 hours before you are ready to bake, tear each slice of Wonder Bread into bite-size pieces and let stand on an open table or countertop.
Once the bread has dried out, mix it in a large baking dish with the boiling water, butter, onion, salt and sage. For added flavor, cook and chop up the turkey giblets and add to the stuffing.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes in a covered dish.

Submitter: 
Wonder® bread
Description: 
You can feel good about serving this dinner. Because now, just two slices of Wonder Classic White Sandwich Bread have as much calcium as an eight ounce glass of milk. And that means, Wonder Turkey Stuffing will not only taste good, it'll help your family feel good, too.
