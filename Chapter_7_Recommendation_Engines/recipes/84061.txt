Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained and liquid reserved
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons orange juice

Directions:
Drain the juice from the can of mandarin oranges into a microwave-safe bowl. Eat the oranges, or reserve for other uses. Stir in the brown sugar and orange juice. Cook in the microwave for 5 minutes on full power, then stir and cook for another 5 minutes. Glaze will be runny.
Use to glaze a whole ham every 10 minutes during the last hour of cooking. Also baste a few times after you take the ham out of the oven.
