Title:
Judy's Little Pizza Things, the best Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound Owens Hot breakfast sausage tube
1 onion, chop small
1 can diced tomatoes
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 large can of mushrooms, drain and chop
2 pounds cheddar cheese (I used one pound of mild cheddar and one pound of medium cheddar)
2 baguettes of bread, sliced thin on an angle

Directions:
In a large pot, brown the beef, sausage and onion, breaking it up into tiny pieces.  Drain.
Place meat back into the pot with the can of tomatoes, mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup.
Stir well, heat and add cheese until cheese is melted.
Place a small spoonful of the mixture onto the slice baguette slices; place on a cookie sheet & put in oven to heat.
(you can also add a tiny bit of extra grated cheese on the top of each baguette & meat mixture before placing in oven and heating so the extra cheese on top will melt.)
OR, serve this meat mixture in a small crockpot to dip onto bread pieces/squares.

Description: 
You can serve this as a dip with baguette bread slices -or- toast in the oven serving as a finger food.  It's called 'little pizza things'  but it doesn't taste anything like pizza.  It makes a lot and the mixture freezes well!  Thanks Judy!
