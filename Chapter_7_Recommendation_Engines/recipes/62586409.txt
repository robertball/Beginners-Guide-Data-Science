Ingredients:
Salmon fillet (large... approx 1-1/2 to 2 lbs) fresh from the seafood dept. at your local grocer or seafood shop
1 T. Olive Oil
1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning or equivilent
1 tsp. ground black pepper
1 small fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
6 cloves garlic minced
1 fresh whole lime sliced thin

Directions:
Place Salmon skin-side down on a foil covered baking sheet large enough to accommodate whole Salmon. Rub pink side with olive oil, sprinkle Old Bay or fish seasoning of choice over whole fish, sprinkle pepper on as well. Lay ginger slices over surface of Salmon, sprinkle on minced garlic, then top prepared Salmon with lime slices randomly or create a pattern or design. Set Oven Broiler to "LO" and place Salmon still on baking sheet onto oven rack that is approx. 6-8 inches from broiler element (in most ovens this will be about the middle or a little above.)Broil on "LO" for approx. 10 minutes.  Turn broiler to "HI" and continue to broil Salmon until it is pale and flakes easily. The limes might brown up, and that is okay, they are tasty just the same.

Description: 
JW and I decided to make 2010 the summer of ginger and lime. We used a ton of fresh ginger and limes from Memorial Day thru Labor Day, and by far, this was our favorite creation.  Grill it or broil it, either way, this Salmon is FANTASTIC!!! We serve this with a tossed green salad and steamed Jasmine rice.
