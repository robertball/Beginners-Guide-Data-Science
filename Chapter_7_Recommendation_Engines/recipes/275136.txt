Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
1 ripe peach - peeled, pitted, and diced
2 tablespoons minced fresh tarragon leaves
3 teaspoons cornstarch
3 teaspoons water

Directions:
Bring 1 cup water, sugar, and peach to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved and peach is cooked, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tarragon.
Whisk cornstarch and 3 teaspoons water together in a small bowl; add to peach mixture, stirring constantly until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool, about 15 minutes.
Pour peach mixture into an electric blender or use an immersion blender to process until smooth. Reheat in the microwave, if desired.
