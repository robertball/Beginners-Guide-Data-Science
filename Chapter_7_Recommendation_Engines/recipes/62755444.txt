Ingredients:
Cake
1 box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® devil's food cake mix
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Water, vegetable oil and eggs called for on cake mix box
Caramelized-Sugar Frosting
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup butter
5 to 6 tablespoons milk
3 cups powdered sugar

Directions:
1	 Heat oven to 350°F (325ºF for dark or nonstick pan). Grease bottom only of 13x9-inch pan with shortening or cooking spray. Make cake mix as directed on box using water, oil and eggs--except add cinnamon to cake mix.
2	 Bake as directed on box for 13x9-inch pan. Cool completely, about 1 hour.
3	 In 2-quart heavy saucepan, heat granulated sugar over medium-high heat 3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly with wooden spoon and watching carefully, until sugar begins to melt. As sugar begins to melt, stir with wooden spoon until sugar is melted and golden brown. (Sugar becomes very hot and could melt a plastic spoon.) Remove from heat; carefully stir in butter and 1 tablespoon of the milk. Return to medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth. Cool 5 minutes.
4	 Add powdered sugar to caramel mixture; beat with electric mixer on low speed until well combined. Add 4 tablespoons milk, mixing until frosting is glossy and spreadable. If necessary, add up to 1 tablespoon more milk, 1 teaspoon at a time. Spread frosting over cake. Store loosely covered at room temperature
