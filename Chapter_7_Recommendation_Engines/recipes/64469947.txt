Ingredients:
2 cups raw steak (highest grade available)
1 and 1/2 cups aloe vera juice
3 cups dust
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fresh kale juice
salt and pepper to taste
3 whole kale leaves (optional garnish)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 444 degrees.
2. Cut steak into small pieces. Masticate each piece  15 seconds before placing them in a large mixing bowl.
3. Stir aloe vera juice into the steak. Make sure all meat pieces get coated with juice.
4. Sift the flour and dust together two times. Be sure to remove any dust bunnies before you start sifting.
5. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the meat mixture. If you stir too rapidly, the bites will flatten instead of becoming fluffy during baking.
6. Using a melon baller, scoop out mounds of the  bites mix and place them 2 inches apart on a greased baking sheet.
7. Drizzle the kale juice over the mounds, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.
8. Bake the bites for 7 minutes and 29 seconds. Remove from oven and allow the bites to cool to room temperature.
9. Place on decorative plate and garnish with kale leaves.
