Ingredients:
2.5 pounds boneless chicken breast, cooked and diced
3 (15.5 oz) cans of Great Northern beans, undrained
1 (16 oz) jar of salsa (medium)
1 lb Monterey Jack cheese, cubed

Directions:
Combine chicken, beans, and salsa in a large pot and heat thoroughly through on low heat (about 30 minutes), stirring occasionally.  Remove pot from stove and slowly stir in the cheese.  Once the cheese has melted completely, the chili is ready to eat.  If you need to reheat the chili to further melt the cheese, stir very frequently to keep cheese from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
