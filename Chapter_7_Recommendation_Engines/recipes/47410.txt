Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 cup egg substitute
2 (4 ounce) fillets catfish, cut into 1 inch pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix dry bread crumbs and lemon pepper. Place egg substitute in a separate small bowl. Dip catfish pieces in the egg substitute, then into the bread crumb mixture to coat.
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Place coated catfish pieces in the hot oil. Fry on both sides until lightly browned and fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
Crunchy catfish nuggets that can be served as hors d'oeuvres. These were a special hit with my 3 year old who loved the fact that she could eat them like finger food. You may want to adjust the seasoning - my daughter is used to spicy stuff! These have the great taste of fried fish without the grease.
