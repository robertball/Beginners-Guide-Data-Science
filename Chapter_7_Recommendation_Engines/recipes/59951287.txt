Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
4 pounds pork butt, roast, boston butt or pork rips
1 1/2  bottles barbeque sauce (27 oz total) recommended: Sweet Baby Ray's

Directions:
Pour can of beef broth into slow cooker, and add pork. Cook on low 10 hours. Remove meat, and shred with two forks. It will seem that it's not working right away, but it will.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Transfer the shredded pork to a Dutch oven or iron skillet, and stir in barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through.
