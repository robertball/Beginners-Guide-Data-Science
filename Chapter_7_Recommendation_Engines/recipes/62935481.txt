Description: 
This is a wonderfully easy soup to cook while at work or on a busy day! This can be 'soupy' with more broth; or sometimes I like to thicken the juice with a little water and cornstarch mixture and let cook till thick.  Then it is good served over mashed potatoes!  Enjoy!!Modified from: Slow Cooker Chicken and Noodles
