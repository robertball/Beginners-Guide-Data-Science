Description: 
This soup is full of Thai and Indian goodness. Lots of fiber and greens. It's great on a cold, fall evening. The key is to slowly add each ingredient and let each flavor develop before going on to the next addition. That will help distribute the flavors and ensure that the tofu has a nice taste.
