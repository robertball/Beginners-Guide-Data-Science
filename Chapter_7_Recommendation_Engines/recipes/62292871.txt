Ingredients:
6 cups confectioner's sugar
2 sticks (1 cup) salted butter, softened (not melted)
1/2 cup plus 4-8  tablespoons cream of coconut
2 teaspoons coconut extract

Directions:
Cream butter and slowly add sugar and cream of coconut, alternating between the two ingredients.
Add coconut extract.
On the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat until smooth and creamy, about 3-5 minutes or until the icing is thick enough to be of good spreading/piping consistency. Add more sugar or cream of coconut if necessary. If desired, add a few drops of food coloring and mix thoroughly.
