Ingredients:
18 Pretzel rods
½ cup Mini chocolate chips
½ cup Marshmallow crème
¼ cup small candies (mini white chocolate chips, mini M&Ms;, sprinkles, etc.)
Wax paper

Directions:
Take your pretzel rods and lay them out on wax paper. Put little dots of the marshmallow crème (about the size of the bottom of the chocolate chips) on one side of the pretzel. Put about three dots up close to each other. Do this one or two time on your pretzel. The dots close to each other will form the ant. Put three mini chocolate chips on the dots next to each other. It should look like an ant. On the other dots put your small candies on so that it will look like an ant coming to pick up the food. Wait a little while and then eat your picnic stick. Enjoy.
