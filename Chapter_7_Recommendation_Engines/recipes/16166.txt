Ingredients:
5 pounds chuck roast
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/2 tablespoon chili powder
1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
4 fluid ounces beer
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
4 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
1 large onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 jalapeno chile peppers, chopped

Directions:
Using a sharp knife, poke several 1 inch deep holes in the roast. Insert the garlic slivers into the holes.
In a small bowl, combine the paprika, celery salt, garlic powder, parsley, ground black pepper, chili powder, cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, mustard powder, and dried tarragon; mix together well and rub over the meat.
In a separate small bowl, combine the beer OR cola, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce and liquid smoke and mix well. Place the roast in a slow cooker and pour this mixture over the meat.
Add the onion, green bell pepper and jalapeno chile peppers to the slow cooker.
Cook on low setting for 10 hours, or more, if desired.

Description: 
This makes an incredibly tender shredded beef with a Mexican flair. It takes quite a bit of time to make, but the slow cooker does all the work, and it's well worth the wait. It's great on tortillas, in sandwiches, and even in soup. Go easy on the hot pepper sauce if you don't like spicy food.
