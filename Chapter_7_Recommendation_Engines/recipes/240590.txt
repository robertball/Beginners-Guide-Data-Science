Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons malted milk powder
2 tablespoons corn meal
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/4 tablespoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray the inside of the waffle iron with cooking spray.
Stir flour, milk powder, corn meal, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into flour mixture and stir just until batter is combined.
Pour batter, working in batches, into the preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
