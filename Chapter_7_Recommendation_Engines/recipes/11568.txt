Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon orange extract
4 teaspoons orange zest
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups dried cherries
1/2 cup chopped pistachio nuts
4 ounces vanilla flavored confectioners' coating, melted

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and confectioners' sugar. Add egg, orange extract, and orange zest; mix until smooth. Sift together the flour and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture. Then, stir in the dried cherries and chopped pistachios. Roll dough into a 10 inch long log about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, wrap in plastic or wax paper, and freeze for 2 hours. If dough is too difficult to form a log, refrigerate for 1 hour first.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.
Cut roll into 1/2 inch slices and place onto the cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the cookie sheet 1 to 2 minutes before removing to cool on a wire rack. Use melted candy coating to drizzle a striped pattern on the cookies when they are completely cool.

Description: 
These cookies are very pretty, and tasty.  Look great on gift trays during the holidays, with the green and red. If you don't like cherries used sweetened dried cranberries.
