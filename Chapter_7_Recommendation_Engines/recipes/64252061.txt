Ingredients:
8 ounces rotini twists or spiral pasta, whole-wheat if possible
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 cup fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 small zucchini, sliced
2 small yellow squash, sliced
1 cup carrots, thinly sliced
1 medium red onion, cut into eighths
1/4 cup chicken broth (go for broth in cardboard containers instead of cans)
1/4 cup fresh basil, lightly packed, chopped
1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Prepare pasta according to package directions; drain.
In medium skillet, heat oil and garlic. Stir in red pepper flakes. Add green beans, zucchini, squash, carrots, and onion and stir-fry until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth and simmer 1 minute. In a large serving bowl, toss together pasta, vegetables, basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and parsley and serve.
