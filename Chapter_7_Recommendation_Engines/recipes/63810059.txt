Table salt
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1 T distilled white vinegar plus 2 additional teaspoons
ground black pepper
8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), trimmed of excess skin and fat
2 T olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
1 small green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped fine (about 3/4 cup)
1/4 tsp hot red pepper flakes
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce
1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup water
3 cups medium-grain rice (see note)
1/2 cup green olives (manzanilla), pitted and halved
1 T capers
1/2 cup jarred pimentos, cut into 1/4 by 2-inch strips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Place garlic and 1 teaspoon salt in bowl and mix to make smooth paste. Add oregano, 1 T vinegar, and 1/2 tsp black pepper to mix & stir. Place chicken in bowl & coat chicken evenly with marinade; set aside for 15 minutes
Heat 1 T oil in Dutch oven over med heat until shimmering. Add onion, green pepper, & pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 4-8 minutes. Add 2 T cilantro; stir to combine. Push vegetables to sides of pot and increase heat to medium-high. Add chicken to clearing in center of pot, skin side down, in even layer. Cook, without moving, until outer layer of meat becomes opaque, 2-4 min. If chicken begins to brown, reduce heat to medium. Using tongs, flip chicken and cook on second side 2-4 minutes more. Add tomato sauce, broth, and water stir to combine. Bring to simmer; cover, reduce heat to med-low, and simmer for 20 minutes
Add rice, olives, capers, and 3/4 tsp salt; stir well. Bring to simmer, cover, and place in oven. After 10 minutes, remove pot from oven and stir chicken & rice once from bottom up. Return pot to oven for another 10 minutes, stir once more, adding 1/4 cup water if rice appears dry and bottom of pot is beginning to burn. Cover and return pot to oven; cook until rice has absorbed all liquid and is tender but still holds its shape and temperature of chicken registers 175 degrees, about 10 min.
Remove chicken, replace lid & set pot aside. Remove & discard chicken skin & pull meat off bones into large chunks. Place chicken in & toss with remaining T olive oil, 2 t vinegar, 2 T cilantro, & pimentos. Place chicken on top of rice, cover, and let stand until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.
