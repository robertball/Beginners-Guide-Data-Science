Ingredients:
1 can crescent rolls (reduced fat works too)
2 T. butter, softened
sugar
cinnamon
cream cheese canned frosting

Directions:
Roll out crescent rolls, pinching seams to seal.
Spread softened butter over top.
Sprinkle sugar over butter.
Sprinkle cinnamon over all.
Roll up long side as tightly as possible.
Cut into 12 rolls.
Place in 8" round or square pan.
Bake according to crescent roll package directions.
When done, allow to cool 5 minutes and top with canned frosting.  The frosting will melt a little.  If you don't want it to melt into the roll, allow a longer cool time.

Description: 
When my picky 7 year old grandson spent the night, I had to quickly fix his breakfast the next morning.  I came up with these cheater cinnamon rolls.  He named them and told me they were 5 stars.  While they certainly don't compare to homemade cinnamon rolls, they are easy and fast and appeal to kids.
