Ingredients:
3 slices bacon

2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp ground black pep
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onion
1/2 cup low fat sour cream

Directions:
(You can use frozen lima beans too. If you opt for frozen, do not add the extra cup of water.)
Cook bacon in large saucepan over med heat until crisp. Remove bacon from pan reserving one tbsp drippings in pan. Crumble bacon and set aside.
Add leek to drippings and cook about 7-8 minutes until tender stirring frequently. Stir in lima beans, broth, and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 10 min or until beans are super tender. Place 1/2 bean mixture in blender (remove center lid of blender to allow steam to exit) and blend until smooth. Pour mixture in bowl and repeat with remaining mixture. Stir in lemon juice, salt, pepper and then ladle into bowls. Top with dollop of sour cream and garnish with bacon crumbles and green onions
