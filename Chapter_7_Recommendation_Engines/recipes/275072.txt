Ingredients:
3 ears fresh sweet corn, husked and silks removed
1/2 red onion, diced
1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, diced
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place corn on the preheated grill and cook, turning often, until charred all over, about 10 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool.
Meanwhile, place red onion, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, lime juice, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Cut corn kernels from the cobs and add to the onion mixture. Mix well, gently breaking up any large corn chunks with the spoon. Discard cobs.
Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

Description: 
This dish is inspired by my favorite salsa at ChipotleÂ®. 
You can use it to top tacos or burritos, or just scoop it up with tortilla chips.
