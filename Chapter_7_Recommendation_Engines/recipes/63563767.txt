Ingredients:
1 cup + 2 Tbsp water
1 package dry active yeast or 2 1/4 tsp
1 Tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
italian seasoning
garlic powder
2 3/4 to 3 1/4 cups unsifted flour
1 tsp cornmeal

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, stir yeast into warm water, add sugar, salt, italian seasoning, garlic powder & oil. Stir until mixed and ingredients are dissolved.
Stir in 1 cup flour. Gradually stir in more flour, gently mixing until no longer sticky.
Turn dough out onto counter or bread board & knead in one piece, 8 to 10 minutes.
Cover dough with a clean towel & let it rest for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Lightly grease a cookie sheet or pizza pan, sprinkle with cornmeal.
Roll out dough to shape of pan, pinch the edges around the perimeter of the dough & using a fork poke holes throughout the center to prevent any air pockets from rising when baking.
Bake for 10 minutes or until edges are a golden brown.
Top as desired.
Bake 1-2 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
To prepare this ahead of time: After dough rests, put dough in a large ziploc bag & freeze overnight. When ready to use, remove from freezer & thaw completely, allowing dough to rise again (2-3 hours)
