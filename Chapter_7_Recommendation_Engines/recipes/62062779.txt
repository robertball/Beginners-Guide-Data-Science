Ingredients:
1 flour tortilla
1 teaspoon butter
2 tablespoons of peanut butter
1 teaspoon of grape jelly or other jellies you like with peanut butter

Directions:
Spread the peanut butter all over one side of the tortilla.  Then fold it over so the edges meet and it looks like a quesadeilla.  Melt the butter in a skillet, over medium fire, once it melts and the skillet is hot add the tortilla and brown on each side for a bout 1-2 mins.  After both sides are brown, blot with paper towel to remove excess butter.  Cut into either 2-4 slices and dip it in the jelly. ENJOY!
