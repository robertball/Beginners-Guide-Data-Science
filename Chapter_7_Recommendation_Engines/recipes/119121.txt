Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling

1 cup whipping cream, whipped

Directions:
Set aside 1 tablespoon graham cracker crumbs for topping. Place the remaining crumbs in a bowl; stir in butter until combined. Press into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool completely.
Spread pie filling over crust. Fold marshmallows into the whipped cream; spread over filling. Sprinkle with the reserved crumbs. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours.
