Ingredients:
Smoked Paprika Dressing
Ingredients
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon white organic miso
1 tablespoon Nayonaise (or other vegan mayo) OR silken tofu
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 clove garlic
1 teaspoon ground flax seeds
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
small amount of sweetener to taste, just enough to offset the lemon juice (I used a tiny scoop of calorie-free stevia.)

Directions:
Put all ingredients into a small blender and puree until smooth. Let rest for at least a half hour to allow flavors to develop. Makes about 4 servings (enough for 4 standard-sized salads).
