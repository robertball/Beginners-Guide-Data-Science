Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 large zucchini halved then quartered
3 garlic cloves minced
1/2 c. cilantro chopped
1 small bunch of green onions thinly sliced
3 tbsp butter
1/2 lb linguine
1/4 c. white wine
1/4 c. + 2 tbsp lime juice
1/4 c. chicken or vegetable broth
1/2 c. heavy cream
1/4 c. parmesan
A handful of cherry tomatoes quartered
Olive oil
Salt and pepper (about 1/8 tsp each)
1/8 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp cumin

Directions:
Marinade the chicken with 1/4 c. lime juice, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper for 1-2 hours, turning the chicken several times.
Preheat oven to 425°.
Cook pasta according to directions.
Sauté chicken with 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat, turning occasionally, until chicken is done and lightly browned-about 20 minutes.
Place zucchini on a cookie sheet and use a pastry brush to coast zucchini with 1 tbsp olive oil.
Place zucchini on middle rack in the oven.
Turn zucchini every 5 minutes until done about 15-20 minutes (should be nicely browned).
In a medium sauce pan melt the butter over medium heat.
Add cilantro and garlic and simmer 1 minute.
Stir in wine, broth, and remaining lime juice.
Process mixture in a blender until smooth.
Return mixture to saucepan, and stir in cream and green onions.
Heat until mixture boils, remove from heat.
Once pasta is done and drained, add tomatoes, cheese, and about 2 tbsp olive oil and toss to coat.
To plate:
Place 4 pieces of zucchini in a row.
Place chicken on top of zucchini and top with cilantro cream sauce.
Pasta on the side.
