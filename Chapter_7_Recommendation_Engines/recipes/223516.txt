Ingredients:
5 cups iced water, or as needed
1 pound small red potatoes
1/2 pound fresh green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
4 slices bacon
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon stone-ground mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 ounces crumbled blue cheese
4 green onions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with iced water. Line a baking sheet with a dish towel.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 18 to 20 minutes. Add green beans to the boiling water; blanch for just 1 minute. Drain potatoes and green beans; transfer to bowl of iced water to stop cooking process, about 5 minutes. Remove from iced water with a slotted spoon and place on prepared baking sheet to dry. Cut potatoes into quarters.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
Whisk vinegar, olive oil, mayonnaise, and mustard together in a large bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Add potatoes and green beans; stir to coat. Top with bacon, blue cheese, and green onions; stir once to incorporate.

Description: 
This is a scrumptious combination of a favorite Southern restaurant's green bean side dish and potato salad. It's fabulous and your family will thank you. You can serve it right away, but it does well for a few hours in the fridge. Eat cold or at room temperature.
