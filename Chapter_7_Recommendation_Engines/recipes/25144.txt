Description: 
A mixture of ground meat, egg, onion, tomato sauce and cracker crumbs baked with a tangy 'sauce' of vinegar, mustard and brown sugar. Recipe lists ground lamb, but can be made with any ground meat. This is the best meatloaf recipe.  People who hate meatloaf love this one! No ketchup needed!!
