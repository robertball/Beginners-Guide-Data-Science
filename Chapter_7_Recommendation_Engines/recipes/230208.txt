Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2) pound leg of lamb, butterflied
olive oil, or as needed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
1 (12 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1 (6 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lay out the leg of lamb on cutting board with the inside of the lamb facing you. Drizzle olive oil evenly over the lamb. Sprinkle oregano and basil over the lamb. Top lamb with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic; season with salt and pepper.
Roll the lamb around the stuffing. Bundle the lamb with kitchen twine to keep from unrolling. Wrap lamb in aluminum foil and place in a baking dish.
Roast in preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 150 degrees F (70 degrees C) for medium, about 90 minutes. Set aside to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing. Reserve pan juices for serving.
