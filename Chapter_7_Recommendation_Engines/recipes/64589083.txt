Ingredients:
1 pound boneless chicken breast
1/2 pound chicken thighs, boneless
2 Italian sausages (hot or sweet)
1 ½ teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 red peppers, cut into chunks
2-3 hot cherry peppers, drained, patted dry and chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup chicken broth/stock
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, chopped

Directions:
Heat a large sauté pan over medium high heat.
Cut the chicken into large pieces (or bite size) then add to a small bowl and season with salt, pepper, chicken, thyme, parsley and onion powder then toss around to coat.
Slice the Italian sausage into 1 1/2 pieces.
Add olive oil into the pan and once hot add in seasoned chicken.  Let cook for about 5-7 minutes browning all sides.  Add in sausage and continue cooking for another 10 minutes or so.
Add in red peppers, cherry peppers and garlic.  Move around the chicken and sausages to fit in the peppers and garlic.  Let cook for another 15 minutes lowering the temperature to medium.
Add in chicken broth and bring to a simmer.  Let reduce by 1/4 over a medium temperature and taste the broth for any additional seasonings.

Description: 
My Chicken Scarpiello was a request from my husband.  He had it in the past with roasted potatoes but I wanted to make it Paleo.  I sauteéd up fresh baby spinach with garlic for our side.  This dish was very yummy and very hot!  I used hot Italian sausage but next time I will go with the sweet!  The flavors were amazing. Give this recipe a try!
