Description: 
I wanted to make some apple jam in my bread machine since my local supermarkets don't sell it, but I found surprisingly few recipes online, so I winged it using an amalgam of a couple of generic fruit jam recipes I found. I was very pleased with the result, especially considering that I've never made anything like this before!

The finished product had small chunks of apple in it, so it's more accurately called preserves than jam; I guess it really depends on how small your food processor can chop the apples.
