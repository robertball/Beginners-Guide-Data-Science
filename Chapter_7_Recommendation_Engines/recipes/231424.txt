Ingredients:
1 (32 ounce) package frozen bite-sized potato nuggets (such as Tater Tots®)
cooking spray
1 pound ground sausage
1/2 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 cloves garlic, minced
12 eggs
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Arrange Tater Tots® in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until potato nuggets are partially cooked, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
While the potatoes bake, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, chili powder, basil, and garlic in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and crumbly and onion is soft, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Whisk eggs and cream together in a bowl until evenly blended; season with pepper.
Arrange partially-cooked potato nuggets in the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Spread sausage mixture over cheese layer. Pour egg mixture over sausage layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until set in the middle and lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
