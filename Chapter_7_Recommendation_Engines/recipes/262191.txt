Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/2 red onion, chopped
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound ground turkey
1 tablespoon gluten-free teriyaki sauce (such as KikkomanÂ®)
1 tablespoon tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
1 peach, halved, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 head endive, chopped
1 (5 ounce) bag spring mix lettuce
1 firm ripe avocado, cubed
1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
4 bacon strips, cooked and chopped

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a skillet over medium heat; add onion, jalapeno, and garlic. Cook until onions are translucent, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
Mix the onion mixture, ground turkey, teriyaki sauce, and soy sauce together in a bowl using a fork. Chop half the peach and mix gently into the bowl with the turkey mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Form into 4 patties.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook turkey burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Combine endive and spring mix in a bowl. Top with avocado, Gorgonzola cheese, and bacon. Serve alongside turkey burgers.

Description: 
A delicious bun-less grilled turkey burger infused with summer peaches, jalapeno, and onions and served over mixed greens with endive, bacon, avocado, gorgonzola, and some more peaches. I created this recipe for my blog, Celiac and Allergy Friendly Epicurean by Jackie Ourman, however, it is a fantastic meal for all and does not need to be made gluten free. You can just use regular soy and teriyaki sauces. Toss salad with mustard vinaigrette if you like.
