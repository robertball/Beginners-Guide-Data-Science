Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup plain dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (16 ounce) jar PaceÂ® Picante Sauce
1/3 cup grape jelly
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

Directions:
Heat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Thoroughly mix the beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic and 1/4 cup picante sauce in a large bowl.  Shape the mixture firmly into 40 (1-inch) meatballs.  Place the meatballs onto the baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through, turning them over once halfway through the bake time.
Heat the remaining picante sauce and jelly in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cook for 15 minutes or until the mixture is reduced to 1 cup.  Stir in the thyme, if desired. Add the meatballs to the skillet and cook until the meatballs are hot, stirring occasionally.  Serve the meatballs on toothpicks.
