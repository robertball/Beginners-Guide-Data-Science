Ingredients:
1 c almond milk, well chilled
1/4 c agave
1/4 c xylitol
2 c almond milk heavy cream
1-2 t pure vanilla extract to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, use a whisk, to combine the milk and sweeteners until the sweetener is dissolved, about 1-2 minutes.  Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla to taste.  Turn machine on, pour mixture into freezer bowl through ingredient spout and let machine run until thickened, about 25-30 minutes.  VARIATIONS:  Mint Chip:  Omit the vanilla and replac e with 1-2 drops of peppermint extract (to taste).  Chop your favorite 4 oz bittersweet or semi sweet chocolate bar into tiny uneven pieces.  Add the chopped chocolate during the last 5 minutes of mixing.  BUTEER PECAN:  Melt 1 stick unsalted butter in a 10 inch skillet.  Add 1 c roughly chopped pecans and 1 t kosher salt.  Cook over medium low heat, stirring frequently until the pecans are lightly browned.  Remove from the heat, strain (the butter will have a pecan flavor and may be reserved for another use).  Allow the pecans to cool completely.  Add the toasted buttered pecans during the last 5 miutes of mixing.  COOKIES & CREAM:  Add 3/4 c coarsely chopped cookies or your favorite candy (chocolate chip, oreos, mint oreos, etc) during the last 5 minutes of mixing.
