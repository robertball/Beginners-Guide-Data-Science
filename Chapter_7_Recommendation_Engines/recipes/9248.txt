salt to taste
1 (1.75 ounce) package red and green sprinkles (jimmies)

Directions:
Blend confectioners sugar, cream cheese, vanilla, melted chocolate, and salt together with an electric mixer until smooth.  (You can also put all the ingredients together in a heavy plastic bag, and squish with your hands until well combined.)
