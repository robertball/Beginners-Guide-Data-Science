Ingredients:
10 fresh mint leaves
1 lime, but into four wedges (or 8 tbsps of lime juice)
2 tbsps of sugar
2 1/2 oz mango rum
3 oz sprite or lemon lime soda
3 oz club soda or tonic water
handful of ice (3 to 4 cubes)

Directions:
Pluck mint leaves from any stem and wash, and place mint leaves in a large cup (one you plan on drinking your mojito out of). Add 1 lime wedge (or 2 tbsps of lime juice) and with a muddler mix the two, pressing down hard to release the juices from both the lime and the mint leaves. Next add 1 more lime wedge (2 more tbsps of lime juice) and the two tbsps of sugar and continue your motions with the muddler. In an oz measuring cup, add together the club soda, rum, and sprite, stirring them together.Remove any necessary lime peels from your mint concoction. Add your ice and add your liquid mixture. Garnish with a lime wedge if you desire and drink.

Description: 
Was a total accident. Never thought when I asked for light rum that I would be given mango flavored rum, but it turned out wonderfully. Nice and tropical, yet has that cool, minty flavor.
