Ingredients:
1 (18 oz) pouch al fresco Caramelized Onion Meatballs (16 meatballs)

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Spread the frozen meatballs onto a baking sheet that has been prepared with cooking spray.
Bring 3 quarts of water in a large sauce pot to a boil, blanch the broccolini for 3 - 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon or spider, set aside.
Meanwhile, coat a large non-stick skillet with the cooking spray and cook the turkey bacon until nicely browned on both sides. Remove and chop. Use this skillet for the final preparation.
Simultaneously, cook the gemelli pasta in the same boiling water as the broccolini. Cook according to package instructions.
Place the meatballs in the pre-heated oven, bake 10 - 12 minutes. Return the large skillet over medium-high heat, pour in the olive oil and saute the blanched broccolini for 2 minutes. Add the garlic to the pan, stir well and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Add the sun-dry tomatoes, chilli pepper flakes, chopped turkey bacon, salt, pepper, and roman beans. Stir ingredients to incorporate.
Drain the gemelli, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Add the gemelli to the skillet immediately, toss ingredients to become well incorporated. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta liquid.
When meatballs are thoroughly heated, add to the skillet toss and serve immediately. Optional: Top with a tsp grated Parmesan or Romano cheese.
