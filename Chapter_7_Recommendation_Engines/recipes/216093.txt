Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken and mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
3 large turkey legs
2 potatoes, cut into chunks
salt to taste
1 pinch seasoned meat tenderizer
ground black pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste
2 cups uncooked long grain white rice
4 cups water

Directions:
Stir the water, cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and cream of mushroom soup into a large slow cooker until smoothly combined, and mix in the onion and the green and red bell pepper. Place the turkey legs into the slow cooker and cover with the sauce.
Set the slow cooker to High, and cook for 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
After 3 hours, stir in the potatoes and season with salt, meat tenderizer, black pepper, and garlic powder. Cook for 2 more hours on High, stirring occasionally. Remove turkey legs and cut the meat off the bones; chop the meat, and return to the cooker. Cook for 1 more hour on High.
About 25 minutes before serving time, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve the turkey and sauce over the hot cooked rice.

Description: 
A very comforting and hearty slow cooker meal over rice. This was a big hit with my husband, and of course very easy since it is made in that trusty slow cooker! :)
