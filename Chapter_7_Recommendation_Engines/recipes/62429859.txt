4 large onions, chopped
1/3 cup chopped garlic, minced (18 cloves)
3 Tablespoons Olive Oil
2 102 ounce cans diced tomatoes, completely drained
1 106 ounce can tomato sauce
2/3 cup dried basil
6 tablespoons dried oregano
6 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
3/4 cup red wine

Directions:
In a large stockpot (minimum 11 Quarts) heat olive oil. Saute onions and garlic until tender, 2-3 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and simmer over low heat, uncovered for 3 hours. It will thicken as it cooks. Remove bay leaves before serving.  Serve over hot cooked noodles, and freeze remainder for later use!

Description: 
Full of flavor and spices, but with low cost ingredients and minimal prep work. Uses warehouse size cans, for easy measurements, and even greater savings! I use this sauce for vegetarian spaghetti, baked ziti, lasagna, stuffed peppers. I never buy canned sauce now! Simple as can be, but requires a very large pot!Modified from: Spaghetti Sauce II
