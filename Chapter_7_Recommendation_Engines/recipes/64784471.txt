Ingredients:
1 large Yukon Gold potato
1 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 tbsp light vegetable oil
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Peel the potato. Cut it lengthwise into 1/2 inch sticks. Rinse them under running water for a few seconds. Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Add the vinegar and then add water just enough to cover the potatoes. Let rest 30 minutes.
Preheat the air fryer to 160°C.
Drain and pat dry the potatoes. Toss with 1/2 tbsp light vegetable oil , salt and pepper. Cook in the preheated air fryer until soft but not browned, about 16 minutes. Shake the basket and raise the temperature to 180°. After 6 minutes, shake and check doneness. Cook another 6 minutes if necessary. Remove fries from basket when the outsides are crispy and browned. Adjust salt and serve.
