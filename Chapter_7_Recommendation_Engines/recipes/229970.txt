Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package spice cake mix
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 (10 ounce) package cinnamon baking chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin cups.
Place cake mix, pumpkin puree, applesauce, and pumpkin pie spice into a large blender or food processor and blend until batter is smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer batter to a bowl and mix cinnamon chips into batter. Scoop into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a co-worker. I absolutely love it and they are very easy to make. I tend to like my pumpkin muffins with extra spices, so I always throw in a little extra.
