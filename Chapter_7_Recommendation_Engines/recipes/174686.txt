Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups huckleberries
1/2 cup sliced almonds for garnish (optional)
1 1/2 cups whipped cream for garnish (optional)
TOPPING
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Mix together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
Combine the egg, vanilla, 1/2 cup melted butter, buttermilk, and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar in a bowl. Add the flour mixture and stir until combined. Gently fold in the huckleberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.
To make the topping, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, the white sugar, oats, and cinnamon. Toss with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the cake batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Cool completely before serving. Serve garnished with whipped cream and sliced almonds, if desired.

Description: 
I came across this Huckleberry Cake recipe a few years ago and changed it a little. The cake is wonderful even without the topping! Garnish with sliced almonds and serve with a dollop of whipped cream.
