Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
4 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Combine flours, baking powder, salt, garlic, onion, italian seasoning and parmesan cheese.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles crumbs.
Mix together brown sugar and milk; stir into flour mixture with a fork, until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl.
On a floured surface, knead 20 times, sprinkling more flour on surface as necessary to keep dough from sticking.  Pat dough into a large circle.  Lift circle onto round ungreased pizza pan; keep patting dough to the edges of the pan.
Bake crust for 8 minutes at 425 degrees.  Spread hot crust with desired toppings (sauce, meat, veggies, cheese) and bake for 15-20 minutes longer, or until cheese is bubbly and browned.  Cut into slices and serve.

Description: 
I created this recipe for my daughter who is sensitive to yeast.  It is quick, easy, and flavorful, making a thin yet hearty crust.  If you are sensitive to yeast or would like something a little different, give it a try!
