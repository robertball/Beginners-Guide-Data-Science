Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
3 TB granulated no-calorie sweetener, such as Splenda
1 TB baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 cups skim milk
1/4 cup canola oil
1 egg, whisked
3 TB egg whites (or another whole egg)
1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
1/4 tsp. butter extract
2 bananas, mashed

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk dry ingredients (flour, cornmeal, Splenda, baking powder, and salt).
In a smaller bowl, mix liquid ingredients (milk, oil, eggs, and extracts).
Combine wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until combined.
Fold mashed bananas into your batter at this point.
Cook in a hot, oiled skillet as you normally would.
