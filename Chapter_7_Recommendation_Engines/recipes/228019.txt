Ingredients:
1 cup oat flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup oat bran
1 cup multi-grain hot cereal with flaxseed (such as Hodgson Mill Multi Grain with Flaxseed Hot CerealÂ®)
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup vanilla fat-free yogurt
1 cup skim milk
2 egg whites, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup pecan halves (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
Mix oat flour, whole wheat flour, oat bran, hot cereal, cinnamon, allspice, and baking powder together in a bowl. Combine yogurt, milk, egg whites, canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Add yogurt mixture to flour mixture; stir to combine. Fold blueberries and pecans into batter. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
