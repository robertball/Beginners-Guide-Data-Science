Description: 
This is what Elvis would drink if he were alive and on a health kick! It's based off his love for the peanut butter and banana, but this has some substitutions and additions.  Freeze the bananas the night before so that they take the place of the ice. If you add enough almond butter, this can taste exactly like banana bread. Or if you add chocolate or espresso, it tastes like bananas dipped in chocolate fondue. This can easily be a dessert smoothie!!
