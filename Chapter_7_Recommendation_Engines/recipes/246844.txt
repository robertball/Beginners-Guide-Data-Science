Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup cold butter, cubed
3 tablespoons water
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Filling:
1/2 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
5 small apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
Topping:
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine 1 1/2 cup flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter using 2 knives or a pastry cutter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Mix water and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Stir into flour mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until dough comes together. Gently roll into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.
Toss apples with 1/2 cup sugar and 3 tablespoons flour in a large bowl.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Roll dough out to a 12-inch circle on a floured work surface. Transfer to the baking sheet. Arrange apple slices in the center of the circle, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Fold up border over apples, pinching together slightly.
Combine 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle over apples.
Bake crostata in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes.
