Ingredients:
1lb ground turkey
½ red bell pepper, finely diced
½ onion, finely diced
½ C grated cheese (I prefer cheddar)
4 T fresh basil, chopped
Salt and pepper
Emeril's Chicken Rub (optional)

Directions:
Combine all ingredients together and stir.  The mixture is very wet at first, but the cheese seems to help the mixture thicken. Note that as the burgers cook they dry out a lot so don't add flour etc to thicken them before you cook them!
Form into 6 patties.
Season with salt and pepper or a seasoning of your choice (I like Emeril’s Chicken Rub).
Grill or broil 6 or 7 minutes per side until inside is cooked thoroughly.
Serve with or without buns.
