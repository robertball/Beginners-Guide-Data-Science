Ingredients:
4 - 6 chicken breasts, boiled and chopped
1 stick butter
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup milk
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 cans cream of chicken soup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325°.
Melt butter in a 9 X 13-inch baking dish.  Place cut up chicken on top of butter.  Whisk together the flour and milk.  Pour evenly over chicken; DO NOT stir!
Mix together the broth and chicken soup.  Pour very gently over the milk/flour mixture; DO NOT stir!
Bake for 35 minutes.  It will look juicy, but that’s the way it’s supposed to be.  Scoop into bowls and ladle "gravy" over top.

Description: 
This is a favorite of our entire family, but especially our youngest daughter, Caroline. It's an easy casserole that's close in taste to chicken and dumplings.
