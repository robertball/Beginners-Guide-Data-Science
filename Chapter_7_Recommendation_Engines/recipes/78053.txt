Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
2 cups white sugar
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
any color food coloring
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, stir together the water and sugar. Bring to a boil, and heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Remove from the heat, and stir in the marshmallow creme, vanilla, food coloring and pecans. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes until slightly cooled and thickened. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. Chill until firm before storing in an airtight container.

Description: 
This recipe is fast and easy and taste better than from the bakery. I struggled for years trying to make divinity and had almost given up when I found this recipe from an old family cookbook. I like to make it pink, but use any color you like.
