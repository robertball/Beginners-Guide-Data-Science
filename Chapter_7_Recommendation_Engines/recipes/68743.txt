Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 egg white
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup boiling water

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the white sugar, egg white, vanilla, cream of tartar, and boiling water. Beat using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. If you have a stand mixer, use the whisk attachment.

Description: 
Light and fluffy icing. Perfect for an angel food cake. You would swear it was a boiled frosting, all the taste, very little effort! I like to change it up a bit and use maple or peppermint extract instead of the vanilla.
