Put 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the middle of each square of tin foil.  Put the peppered chops on top of the butter and oil.  Put 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil on top of each chop.  Add 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce over the top of each chop.  Wrap each chop tightly and place on middle rack of oven.  Bake for 35 minutes.
