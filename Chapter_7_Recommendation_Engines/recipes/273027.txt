Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup almond flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
1 egg, beaten, at room temperature
cooking spray
Topping:
2 ounces Mexican chorizo, crumbled
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
1/4 cup salsa
1 tablespoon diced onion
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves for garnish

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese and cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until melted, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir well. Add almond flour, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and black pepper. Use your hands to combine dough. Once combined, add beaten egg and stir until well incorporated.
Spray 2 large pieces of parchment paper with non-stick spray. Place dough on one piece of parchment paper and cover with the second piece. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten pizza dough to a 10-inch round. Remove top parchment paper and place bottom piece of parchment paper with flattened pizza dough onto a baking sheet. Pierce all of the pizza dough with a fork to prevent the dough from rising.
Bake in the preheated oven until bottom starts to brown, 12 to 17 minutes.
Meanwhile place chorizo in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with a paper towel. Microwave in three 1-minute increments, uncovering and stirring meat well after each.
Remove pizza crust from oven and top with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, chorizo, salsa, and onion. Bake until cheese is melted, 4 to 6 minutes more. Garnish with cilantro leaves.
