Ingredients:
2 tablespoons psyllium husk
3/4 cup tapioca flour
1/4 cup arrowroot
2 1/2 tablespoons coconut flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 cup hot water, or more as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine psyllium husk, tapioca flour, arrowroot, coconut flour, baking powder, salt, and onion powder in the bowl of a food processor; blend until well combined. Add hot water and olive oil; blend until a soft dough is formed. Divide dough into 6 equal parts. Roll out each ball to a 5-inch disc between two sheets of parchment paper.
Heat a 6-inch iron skillet over medium-high heat and grease with cooking spray. Place wrap on the hot skillet for just 5 seconds; flip it immediately with a spatula, and cook until lightly golden, about 40 seconds. Flip and cook for another 40 seconds.
