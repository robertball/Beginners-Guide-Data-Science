Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh green beans, rinsed and trimmed
4 cloves garlic, peeled
8 sprigs fresh dill weed
4 teaspoons salt
2 1/2 cups white vinegar
2 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Cut green beans to fit inside pint canning jars.
Place green beans in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. Cook until tender but still firm, for 3 minutes.  Plunge beans into ice water.  Drain well.
Pack the beans into four hot, sterilized pint jars.  Place 1 clove garlic and 2 sprigs dill weed in each jar, against the glass.  Add 1 teaspoon of salt to each jar.
In a large saucepan over high heat, bring vinegar and water to a boil.  Pour over beans.
Fit the jars with lids and rings and process for 10 minutes in a boiling water bath.
