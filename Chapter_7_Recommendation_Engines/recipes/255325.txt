Ingredients:
cooking spray
Cake:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1 cup butter
1/4 cup cocoa powder (such as Hershey's速)
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon baking soda
Icing:
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup cocoa powder (such as Hershey's速)
1 1/2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
6 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Topping:
1 (14 ounce) package chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo速)
16 rectangular chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Snackwell's速)
1 cup yogurt covered raisins
1 (3 ounce) package gummi worms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C)). Spray a 9x9-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Sift flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl.
Pour water into a saucepan; bring to a boil.
Melt 1 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat; whisk in 1/4 cup cocoa powder. Pour in boiling water; simmer until cocoa powder is thinned, about 30 seconds. Pour butter mixture into the flour mixture; stir batter gently to cool.
Combine buttermilk, eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and baking soda in a measuring cup. Pour the buttermilk mixture into the batter; whisk until thoroughly blended. Pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning the pan half way through, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes in the conventional oven and 22 minutes in the countertop induction oven. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a saucepan over low heat; whisk in 1/4 cup cocoa powder. Turn off heat. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until smooth; pour over cake.
Blend chocolate sandwich cookies in a blender to make fine crumbs; sprinkle over icing. Cool until frosting is set, about 20 minutes.
Press 4 rectangular cookies into the cake to create a row of tombstones; repeat with remaining cookies to create 4 rows of 4 cookies each. Add yogurt covered raisins to represent rocks. Press gummy worms into the cake until partially submerged.
