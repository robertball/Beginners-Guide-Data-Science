Description: 
This is my most requested recipe to bring to get-togethers, and there's always someone who hasn't had them who asks for the recipe.  You can make it days ahead of time and have it out of the oven in just a few minutes when you need it.  Add more chipotle peppers if you like it spicier.  This recipe makes a lot, but it actually freezes well, so I usually freeze half of it and have it another time.  If you're making it for a party, though, bring it all because it will be gone!
