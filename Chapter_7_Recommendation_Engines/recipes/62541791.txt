Ingredients:
1 bag of mini pretzels
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 package dry fiesta ranch dressing mix
1 tsp. cayenne pepper
1 tsp. lemon pepper seasoning
1 1/2 tsp. garlic salt
gallon sized zip lock bag

Directions:
Open the bag of mini pretzels and dump them into a gallon size baggie.
Mix, vegetable oil, fiesta ranch dressing, cayenne pepper, lemon pepper seasoning, and garlic salt together in a bowl.
Pour over pretzels in the baggie. Zip baggie shut and shake to mix and coat pretzels.
Let the pretzels sit in the baggie for an hour or two so they can absorbe the oil and seasoning. Then mix again and serve. (I usually let the baggie sit on one side and then like every 30 minutes I shake the bag up again and turn it to the other side to sit for a while. Just so they coat evenly.)
