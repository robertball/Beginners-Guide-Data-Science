Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package frozen prepared pie crusts, thawed
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
2 eggs
1/4 cup Irish Mist liqueur
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 tablespoon Irish Mist liqueur
3 drops green food coloring

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Prepare pie crust according to package directions for a filled one crust pie. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate chips until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar, and flour.  Mix with an electric mixer at medium speed until well blended.  Add melted chocolate, eggs, and 1/4 cup liqueur.  Mix well.  Fold in 1 cup whipped topping.  Pour filling into the pie shell.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool.
Combine remaining whipped topping, 1 tablespoon liqueur, and the food coloring.  Spread over pie.
