Ingredients:
BISCUITS:
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup shortening
1 cup mashed sweet potatoes
1/2 cup half-and-half cream
HONEY BUTTER:
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first six ingredients. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine sweet potatoes and cream; stir into crumb mixture just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; gently knead 8-10 times.
Pat or roll out to 1/2-inch thickness; cut with a floured 2-1/2-inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits 1-inch apart on a greased baking sheet.
Bake at 400Â° for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the butter, honey and cinnamon until blended. Serve with warm biscuits.
