Description: 
With all the fancy grilled summer meats flying around, it's easy to forget about the side dishes. Nobody wants to spend hours in the kitchen when they could be outside playing volleyball in jhorts. With this easy bok choy rice, you can have something much more interesting in the same time as it takes to make plain rice.
