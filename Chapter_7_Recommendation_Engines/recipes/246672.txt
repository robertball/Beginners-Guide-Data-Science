Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
2 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
water to cover
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Combine edamame, garlic, and salt in a saucepan; add enough water to cover edamame. Bring to a low boil and cook for 30 minutes.
Drain liquid from edamame and transfer edamame and garlic to a food processor; season with black pepper. Process mixture on high, adding olive oil while continuing to mix, until smooth.

Description: 
My fiance and I have started eating healthier, and have added edamame to our regular diet. While they taste fine, I found the texture unappealing. After some experimentation, I've come up with a delicious and healthy way to prepare it. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over mashed edamame to serve.
