Ingredients:
1 package pita pockets
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Brush one side of each piece pita pocket with olive oil. Sprinkle the garlic powder, salt, and garlic salt over the pita pockets. Slice each pocket into 4 even triangles.
Bake in preheated oven until the triangles turn a light brown color, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
I searched for months for a recipe that tastes the same if not better than the store-bought pita chips. After many attempts, I found what everyone seems to think are perfect pita chips! They take barely any time to prepare and go great with spinach artichoke dip! Add Italian seasoning, herbs, or Parmesan cheese for a twist!
