Description: 
My father's side of the family is Sicilian, and has been making these pork chops for at least 3 generations. My husband frequently requests these over my marinated and grilled pork chops when I give him a choice. If you do not have an oven-proof skillet, you may cook the chops on the stove at medium-low.
