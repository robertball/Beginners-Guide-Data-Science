Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup baking cocoa
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 cup light sour cream
1/2 cup expresso
1/2 cup low fat buttermilk
1/2 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the eggs, sour cream, water, milk, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.

Description: 
This recipe originally called for applesauce, but one time in a pinch, I substituted sour cream... it worked! Chocolate lovers can't resist these rich cake-like muffins.Modified from: Chocolate Muffins
