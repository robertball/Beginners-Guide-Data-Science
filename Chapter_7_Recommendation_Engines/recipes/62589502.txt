Ingredients:
6 oz. cremini mushrooms
3 garlic cloves
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/4 lbs. chicken thighs, cut into pieces
1 small onion, chopped
3/4 tsp. rosemary
3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1 28oz. can whole tomatoes in juice
1/2 lb. dried pappardelle
8 cups baby arugula
Grated Parigiano-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Pulse mushrooms and garlic in food processor until finely chopped.  Heat oil in large skillet.  Season chicken with 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper, add to pan, and cook until just golden, about 3 min.  Remove chicken from pan and add onion, cooking until just softened, about 3 min.
Add mushroom mixture, rosemary, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Cook, stirring constantly, until just beginning to brown, about 4 min.
Add vinegar and cook until evaporated.  Add chicken and tomatoes, then simmer, breaking up tomatoes until sauce is just thickened, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta to al dente.
Add arugula to sauce and stir until wilted.  Stir in drained pasta and cook 1 minute.  Serve garnished with Parmesan if desired.
