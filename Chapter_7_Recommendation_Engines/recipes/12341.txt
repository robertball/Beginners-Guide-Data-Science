Ingredients:
2 cups pitted cherries
2 cups blueberries, rinsed and drained
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon butter
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie

Directions:
Mix sugar, flour, and cinnamon in large bowl. Add fruit. Add lemon juice, and stir well.
Pour into a 9 inch unbaked pie shell. Dot with the butter or margarine. Cover with top crust and flute edges. Cut small slits in the top.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour. I put a baking sheet under mine to catch any liquid that might bubble over.
