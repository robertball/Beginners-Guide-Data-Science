Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown rice
3 cups water
2 large potatoes, grated
4 large carrots, grated
2 large celery stalks, chopped
6 pounds ground beef
8 eggs
1 dash salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/2 cups regular rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease 36 cups of 3 large muffin tins.
In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, uncovered, and cook 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool several minutes, then fluff with a fork and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, celery, ground beef, and eggs. Mix ingredients together using your hands or a sturdy spoon. Add salt, olive oil, rolled oats, and rice; mix well.
Fill each muffin cup with some of the meat mixture, and pat down the to make it firm. Bake 45 minutes, or until surface feels set. Cool on a rack 10 minutes or longer.
Remove the meat cakes by turning the muffin tin upside down over a sheet of aluminum foil. Tap each muffin cup to release the cake. Refrigerate or freeze in sealed plastic bags. NOTE: Do not feed to dogs while still hot.

Description: 
I have 4 dogs, ranging from 5 yrs - 17 yrs old (Terriers of all sizes).  After the big dog food scare, I didn't want to take chances so I tried to figure out a healthy recipe for them, something that had all the nutrients and fat they needed. This is what I came up with and my dogs absolutely loved it! The nice thing about this recipe is that it can be eaten by the humans as well.
