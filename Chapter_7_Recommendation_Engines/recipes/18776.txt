Ingredients:
3/4 cup New Mexico red chile powder
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 cups water
4 pounds beef roast, cut into cubes

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the chili powder, cornstarch, lemon juice and water. Mix together well. Place the meat in a resealable plastic bag with the marinade and turn to coat thoroughly. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 16 hours.
Place in a slow cooker and cook on high setting for about 4 hours, or until the meat is completely cooked and shreds easily.

Description: 
I learned to make this spicy red chile dish by experimenting in my kitchen after enjoying it at a friend's place. It takes a while to make, but it is well worth it. Serve hot with tortillas, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa and sour cream. This also works well with a pork roast.
