Ingredients:
1 c chana dal
2 c water
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/4 tsp turmeric
1/4 tsp cumin powder
1/4 tsp coriander powder
1/2 T Tamarind paste (comes in a jar with a red cap and yellow label)
1 T oil
1/2 tsp black mustard seeds
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Soak the chana dal in 4 c water for about 2 hours.  Drain and rinse.
Bring 3 c of water to a boil and add the soaked chana dal.
Cover and simmer for about 30 mins, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.
Remove the lid, add the tamarind paste and the spices EXCEPT the mustard seeds.  Stir well and return to a simmer.
In a small frying pan, heat the oil over a medium to medium high heat - add the mustard seeds.  When they start to pop, reduce the heat and add the minced garlic, stirring for about 30 seconds to a minute.
Add to the simmering dal and stir in.  Cover and simmer for about 5 to 10 mins longer, stirring occasionally.
Drizzle liberally with ghee, if you have it.
Serve with rice.

Description: 
Chana dal is split chick peas - this is a different variety of chickpea, not like the garbanzos we often see in the US.  It's probably less than half the size of a typical garbanzo.
