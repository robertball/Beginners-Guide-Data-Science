Directions:
Crush vanilla wafers into crumbs. Add melted butter, powdered sugar, pecans (chopped fine) and orange juice. Blend well. Chill for 1 hour. Form into 1-inch balls. Roll in powdered sugar. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. You may want to roll them again in powdered sugar before serving. This yields 2 dozen. May be frozen.
