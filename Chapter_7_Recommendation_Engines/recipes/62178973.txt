Ingredients:
Bars:
3 eggs
1 2/3 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
1 (30 ounce) can Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large bowl, mix the eggs, sugar, oil, and pumpkin.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, pie seasoning, and salt; slowly add to the liquid ingredients until thoroughly combined.
Spread the batter evenly into a lightly greased 12x18 inch cookie sheet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in preheated oven. Cool before frosting.
To make the frosting, cream together the cream cheese and butter. Stir in vanilla. Mix confectioners' sugar a little at a time, beating until mixture is smooth. Spread evenly on top of the cooled bars. Cut into squares and serve.
