Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup white sugar
Cheesecake:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 eggs
2 cups sour cream
1 (12 ounce) can strawberry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan.
Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup melted butter, and 1/3 cup white sugar in a bowl until well mixed; press into the prepared springform pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and ricotta cheese together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 3 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cup white sugar; beat on low speed until well blended, about 2 minutes.
Stir 1/2 cup melted butter, cornstarch, flour, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until combined. Gently stir eggs, 1 at a time, into mixture; fold in sour cream just until batter is mixed. Pour batter over the crust. Pour strawberry pie filling over the batter. Gently swirl strawberry pie filling into batter using a butter knife just enough to form a swirl pattern on the top.
Bake in the preheated oven without opening the door for 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more.
Remove cheesecake form oven and cool on a wire rack for 2 hours. Cover and refrigerate cheesecake, 6 hours to overnight. Remove springform and slice.

Description: 
I thought of making this cheesecake when I wanted to combine strawberry with a classic lemon ricotta cheesecake recipe a friend gave me, the result was a light, lemon-flavored cheesecake with a swirl of strawberry in every bite! You may also use reduced fat ingredients when making this cheesecake, if you desire. Garnish with lemon slices if desired.
