Ingredients:
1 cup almond meal
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup blueberries
1 cup applesauce
1/2 cup almond milk
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup coconut oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Whisk almond meal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add blueberries and stir to coat. Make a well in the center of the blueberry mixture; pour applesauce, almond milk, honey, and coconut oil into well and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
