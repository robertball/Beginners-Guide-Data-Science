Description: 
I recently came across a recipe similar to this in a magazine and couldn't resist changing it up to suit my taste. The panko bread crumbs give these a crispy crunch on the outside but when you take a bite...the surprise inside is creamy red beans and rice. I served them up country-style for the rice cooking contest at the 2011 Texas Rice Festival and they won a 1st place medal in the adult appetizer division! Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.
