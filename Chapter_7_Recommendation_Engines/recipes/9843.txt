Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup ground pecans
1/2 cup German sweet chocolate, grated
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup German sweet chocolate, grated

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream the butter and 1/3 cup confectioner's sugar until light and fluffy.   Add the vanilla extract.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, ground pecans, 1/2 cup ground chocolate, cinnamon and salt; mix well.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture.
Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill 1 to 2 hours, or until firm.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Shape the dough into 1-inch balls. Place balls 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch. Cool 1 minute on the baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack.
For the coating, sift 1/2 cup of the confectioner's sugar and 1/4 cup of the ground cocoa into a shallow bowl. While cookies are still warm, roll them in the coating.
