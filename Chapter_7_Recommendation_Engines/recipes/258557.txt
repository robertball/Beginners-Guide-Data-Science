Description: 
A tangy fresh Colombian-style salsa which can be made delicious either mild or XXX hot! Goes great with grilled meats, empanadas, and tostones, but I put it on everything... even my eggs! There seem to be several variations of this; some watery, some oily, some saucy, some chunky, but my mom is from Barranquilla, Colombia and this is how she makes it.
