Ingredients:
2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger root
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons miso paste
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 pound kangaroo fillet
1 cup snow peas
1 cup broccoli, chopped
1 cup bok choy, chopped
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup bean sprouts
1 cup chopped zucchini

Directions:
Whisk together the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, fish sauce, miso paste, and sesame oil in a bowl.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the kangaroo fillet; cook to medium doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Move to a cutting board to rest.
While the meat is resting, return the skillet to medium heat and add the snow peas, broccoli, bok choy, bell pepper, bean sprouts and zucchini; cook and stir until the vegetables are softened. Pour the sauce into the pan and allow to simmer 5 minutes.
While the vegetables simmer, thinly slice the kangaroo. Stir into the vegetables; serve hot.

Description: 
Kangaroo is a good rich meat that works perfectly in stir-fry dishes, but any game meat would do such as deer or camel.
