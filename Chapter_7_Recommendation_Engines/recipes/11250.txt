Ingredients:
1 cup hazelnuts
1 cup walnuts
1/3 cup honey
1 egg white
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pinch salt
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar for decoration
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 egg white, beaten
1/2 tablespoon orange liqueur

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275F. Grease baking sheet.
Finely grind nuts in food processor. Add honey, egg white, cocoa, spices and salt. Blend to paste. Add flour and mix using on/off turns until just incorporated.  (NOTE: Dough will be sticky.)
Place dough on work surface heavily dusted with sifted confectioners' sugar. Sift more powdered sugar over dough. Gently roll dough out to thickness of 3/8". Cut into 1x1 1/2  inch bars using knife that has been dusted with powdered sugar. Arrange on greased sheet, spacing 1inch apart.
Bake cookies at 275 F (135 degrees C) until firm and tops appear dry, about 25-30 minutes. Cool cookies completely on racks.
To Make Icing: Blend 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 teaspoons egg white. Mix in enough liqueur to make thick but pourable icing. Set racks on waxes paper; arrange cooled cookies on racks with edges touching. Drizzle icing over cookies in irregular lines. Separate cookies. Let stand until icing is dry. Store in airtight container.
