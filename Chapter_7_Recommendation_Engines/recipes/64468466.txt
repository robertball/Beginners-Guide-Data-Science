Ingredients:
1/4 cup     granulated sugar
2 tbsp     all-purpose flour
1 tsp	     cinnamon, ground
2 cans (8 oz each)     refrigerated crescent dinner rolls

Directions:
Heat oven to 375Â°F. Spray 16 medium muffin cups with No-Stick Cooking Spray. In small bowl, mix granulated sugar, flour and cinnamon.
Separate dough into 16 triangles. For each roll, dip 1 marshmallow into melted butter; roll in sugar mixture. Place marshmallow on shortest side of triangle. Roll up, starting at shortest side and rolling to opposite point. Completely cover marshmallow with dough; firmly pinch edges to seal. Dip 1 end in remaining butter; place butter side down in muffin cup.
Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pan 1 minute. Remove rolls from muffin cups; place on cooling racks set over waxed paper.
In small bowl, mix powdered sugar, vanilla and enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Drizzle glaze over warm rolls. Serve warm.
