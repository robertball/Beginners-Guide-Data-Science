Bake about 15 minutes or until pastry is set. Remove the aluminum foil. Bake about 10 minutes more or until pastry is light golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.
Place sliced banana in baked pastry shell. Top with pecans. In a small bowl combine eggs, the 1/2 cup sugar, melted butter, and vanilla. Carefully pour over banana and pecans.
