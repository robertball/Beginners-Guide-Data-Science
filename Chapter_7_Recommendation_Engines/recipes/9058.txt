Ingredients:
½ cup chunky salsa
¼ cup Dijon-style prepared mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
6  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons butter
6 tablespoons plain yogurt
1  lime, sliced into segments

Directions:
In a shallow nonporous dish or bowl combine the salsa, mustard and lime juice. Mix well. Add chicken, cover dish and refrigerate. Marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove chicken from marinade and add to skillet. Saute, turning frequently, until browned on all sides. Meanwhile, boil remaining marinade in a saucepan for 4 to 5 minutes.
Add boiled marinade to chicken, and saute another 3 to 5 minutes or until chicken juices run clear and marinade is starting to glaze. Remove chicken to serving platter; raise heat to high and boil marinade for 1 minute. Spoon marinade over chicken and top each breast with 1 tablespoon yogurt and 1 lime wedge. Serve.
