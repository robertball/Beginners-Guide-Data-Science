Description: 
Chicken chunks with Alfredo noodles, asparagus, tomatoes and mushrooms (sprinkled, of course, with some grated Parmesan cheese). Why the name? One time my husband came home late from work without calling me, so instead of the dinner I was going to prepare he got this recipe. When he asked me 'What's for dinner?', I said 'Chicken I hate you!' - and a new dish was born! It's great.
