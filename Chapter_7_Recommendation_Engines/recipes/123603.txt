Ingredients:
3 eggs
3/4 cup sugar, divided
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cups crushed vanilla wafers
1 cup chopped dates
1 cup chopped nuts
2 tablespoons grated orange peel
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
TOPPING:
1/4 cup sour cream
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat eggs and 1/2 cup sugar until thickened. Combine baking powder and remaining sugar; beat into egg mixture. Add crumbs, dates, nuts, orange peel and vanilla; stir well. Pour into a well-greased 10-in. pie plate or 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Combine topping ingredients; let stand at room temperature until pie has cooled for 30 minutes (topping will thicken). Spread over pie. Cool completely. Store in the refrigerator.
