Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups wheat bran
1/3 cup dark brown sugar
3/4 cup whole milk
2/3 cup grapeseed oil
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon molasses
1 orange, zested
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Combine bran and brown sugar in a large bowl.
Pour milk into a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Heat until almost boiling, about 1 minute. Pour over the bran mixture. Beat with an electric mixer until combined. Let stand until milk is mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes.
Beat oil, eggs, molasses, and orange zest into the bran mixture.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Mix into the batter until just combined. Sprinkle cranberries on top; fold in with a spatula. Divide batter among the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I love how filling bran muffins are, but sometimes find they're lacking in flavor. That's not the case with these ones, made with fresh cranberries and orange zest. They're the perfect fall breakfast treat!
