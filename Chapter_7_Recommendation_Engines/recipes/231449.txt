Ingredients:
2  large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon garlic, minced
½ teaspoon coarse sea salt
½ teaspoon cracked black pepper
¼ teaspoon dried rosemary
¼ teaspoon dried basil

Directions:
Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish and refrigerate at least 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
