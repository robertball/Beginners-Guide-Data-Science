Ingredients:
3 cups leftover mashed potatoes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 (2.8 ounce) package French fried onions, divided
1 1/2 cups diced leftover cooked ham
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots, thawed and drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and 1/2 of the onions into the mashed potatoes. Spread potato mixture over the bottom and up the sides of a 2-quart casserole dish to form a shell.
Combine ham, frozen peas and carrots, mushroom soup, mustard, garlic, and pepper in a bowl; mix well. Spoon mixture into the mashed potato shell. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese and onions over the top. Bake uncovered until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is something I did one night when I had a bunch of leftovers that turned into one of my favorite comfort foods. You could switch out just about anything for anything of a similar type, chicken for the ham, different soups, etc. Make it as is or use your imagination.
