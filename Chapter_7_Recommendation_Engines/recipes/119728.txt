Ingredients:
2 medium navel oranges, peeled and sliced
1 medium cucumber, sliced
4 cups torn romaine
4 cups torn leaf lettuce
1 small red onion, sliced and separated into rings
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup seasoned salad croutons

Directions:
Place orange and cucumber slices around the bottom sides of a straight-sided glass salad bowl. Cut any remaining orange and cucumber slices in half; place in another bowl. Add the lettuce and onion. In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine the orange juice, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper and oil; shake well. Pour over lettuce mixture and toss gently to coat; carefully spoon into salad bowl. Sprinkle with croutons. Serve immediately.

Description: 
'This salad has been a family favorite for as long as I can remember,' Betty Tobias writes from Nashua, New Hampshire. 'It's prettiest when it's served in a glass bowl, with orange and cucumber slices lining the sides. Often, I'll double the dressing recipe so I have some on hand for the next time I make it.'
