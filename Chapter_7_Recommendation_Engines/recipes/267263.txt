Description: 
Tired of your old meatloaf glaze? This zingier glaze makes an amount suitable not only for meatloaves baked in any of the customary loaf pan sizes (such as 9x5, and thereabouts), but also in larger 9x9-inch pans and 2 1/2-quart dishes. But go ahead and use all of the glaze even on your 9x5-inch meatloaves. It's that good!
