Ingredients:
2 (16 oz) bags of frozen peaches, or canned peaches drained
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup fine cornmeal
1/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable shortening, chilled and cut into small pieces
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and cornstarch. Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until juices begin to bubble.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, white sugar, baking powder, and salt. Blend in vegetable shortening with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in milk until just combined.
Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them.  Bake until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
