Ingredients:
Ingredients A (Crust):
1 box of Betty Crocker Pie Crust Mix (Net Wt 11 Oz)
3 tablespoons cold butter, cubed
1/3 cup ice cold water
Ingredients B (Filling):
4 egg yolks
1/3 cup of sugar (or slightly less if you donâ€™t like your Portuguese egg tarts too sweet)
1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream
1/3 cup of milk
3 drops of vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F. Coat the muffin pan with butter/Pam baking spray.
Rub the pie crust mix with cold water and butter until pastry forms a ball.
On a floured surface, roll the dough and cut it into 12 balls. Set aside.
Use an electronic hand beater to blend Ingredients B. Beat for about 3 minutes and strain the filling through a strainer. Set aside.
Flatten the balls into small round doughs and fit them well into the muffin pan by pressing firmly on bottom and side (do not over stretch).
Fill the pie crust dough with the egg mixture (about 80% full).
Bake the egg tarts at 400F for about 15-20 minutes or until the filling turn brown.
