Ingredients:
6 strips frozen chicken tenders
1/4 cup tequila
1/3 cup lime juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp oregano
2 tsp cumin
1/4 cup cilantro
1 head red lettuce
1 package shredded cheddar cheese
2 avocados, chopped
2 tomatoes or 1 package cherry tomatoes
1 can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 can shoepeg corn
1/2 can Rotel, more or less to taste
Southwestern salad dressing

Directions:
Mix tequila, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, cumin, black pepper and oregano. Pour in ziplock bag, add chicken and marinade several hours in the fridge. Grill when ready and chop chicken up.
Next, drain and rinse a can of black beans. Dump into a bowl with shoepeg corn (the white corn that looks like teeth) and about half (or more to taste) of a can of Rotel. Mix well.
Rinse and chop red lettuce and distribute on plates. Add chopped chicken, corn/bean mixture, shredded cheddar, chopped avocados and tomatoes or cherry tomatoes. Drizzle with a good southwestern dressing. Enjoy!
If you have leftover bean/corn mixture, add some chopped chicken and use later for a great chunky salsa.

Description: 
A zippy salad with lime chicken, providing about 2/3 of your required daily veggie intake! I used Brianna's Homestyle Chipotle Cheddar salad dressing for a great flavor.
