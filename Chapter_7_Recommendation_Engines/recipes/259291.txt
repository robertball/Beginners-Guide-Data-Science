Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
8 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (13 ounce) package FarmlandÂ® Hickory Smoked Sausage
2 tablespoons butter
1 large sweet onion, halved and sliced
6 English muffins, split and toasted
1/4 cup prepared horseradish
6 slices provolone cheese
1 cup fresh baby spinach leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper. Pour into prepared dish. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until set.
Meanwhile, cut smoked sausage into 6 pieces. Halve each piece lengthwise, cutting to but not through the other side to keep the pieces together. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add sausage pieces to skillet, opening each like a book. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes or until browned, turning once. Remove and keep warm.
In the same skillet, heat butter until melted. Add onion. Cook and stir over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes or until just browned and tender.
To assemble, spread cut sides of muffins or biscuits with horseradish. Cut baked egg mixture into 6 squares. On muffin bottoms, layer cheese, spinach, egg, sausage, and onion. Add muffin or biscuit tops.
