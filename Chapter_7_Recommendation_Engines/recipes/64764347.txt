Ingredients:
1 medium head of cauliflower (about 2 1/2 pounds), cut into florets
3 Tbsp olive oil
Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
Pinch of red-pepper flakes (optional)
1/4 cup roughly chopped almonds
1/3 heaping cup/about 2 ounces crumbled feta
1/2 cup capers
2 Tbsp finely chopped Italian parsley
1/2 lemon, to taste

Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a microwave safe bowl, heat cauliflower for a minute on high to soften. In a large cast iron skillet, toss the cauliflower with the olive oil. Season well with the salt, pepper and red-pepper flakes, if using, and toss again. Spread the mixture evenly, cover and roast for 10 minutes. Uncover and roast until crisp and golden, about 15 to 20 minutes more, tossing halfway through to ensure even browning.
Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently to ensure they donâ€™t burn, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Once the cauliflower is roasted, toss it in a large bowl with the feta cheese, olives, half the almonds and 1 tablespoon parsley until combined. Top with remaining almonds and parsley, and lemon. Season with flaky salt, if desired.

Description: 
Roasted cauliflower is a pure delight, but tossing it with feta, toasted almonds and capers makes it even better. If almonds aren't available, walnuts or hazelnuts are good substitutions. This dish works well served warm, but it's equally good at room temperature if you want to make it ahead. You can also fold it into cooked grains, such farro or orzo, for a hearty grain salad.
