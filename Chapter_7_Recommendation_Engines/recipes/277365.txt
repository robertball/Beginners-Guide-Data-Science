Ingredients:
aluminum foil
2 pounds party chicken wings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup spicy harissa sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a cooling rack on top.
Place wings in a large bowl. Add olive oil, lemon pepper seasoning, and salt and stir until wings are evenly coated. Place wings on top of the cooling rack.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip and cook until chicken wings are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes.
Meanwhile, whisk harissa sauce, honey, and apple cider vinegar together in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until sauce begins to thicken, about 4 minutes. Turn heat off and let sauce cool while chicken wings finish cooking.
Transfer wings to a large bowl and set the oven broiler to high. Pour harissa mixture over the wings and stir to coat. Place wings back on the cooling rack and broil for 4 minutes.
