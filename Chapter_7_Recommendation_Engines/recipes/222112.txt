1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with seasoned salt and pepper. Place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine onion, mushrooms, and soup in a separate small bowl. Mix together and spoon over chops.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note:  Time could be less or more depending on thickness of chops.)  Pork chops are done with their internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
