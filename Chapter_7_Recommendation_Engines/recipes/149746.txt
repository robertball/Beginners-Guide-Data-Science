Ingredients:
1 cup chopped almonds
1 ⅓ cups cream cheese
½ cup milk
½ cup vegetable oil
1 pinch salt
⅝ cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups all-purpose flour
¼ cup baking powder
⅞ cup plum butter
1 ¾ pounds plums, pitted and diced
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch springform pan.
Place a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast the almonds in the hot skillet until they turn brown; set aside to cool.
Combine the cream cheese, milk, oil, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix in the flour and baking powder; knead together until smooth. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface, and roll the dough into a 20-inch square. Spread the plum butter, plums, and toasted almonds over the dough. Roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll. Cut into 12 even slices. Arrange rolls in prepared pan. Brush butter over top of the rolls.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 55 minutes.

Description: 
In Germany, cakes made with plum are very popular. This variation can be made as either a whole cake or as individual 'tarts.' I call them 'rolls' due to their appearance.  They are very delicious on a Sunday fall afternoon with a hot cup of tea! They're best when still warm and served with whipped cream!
