Ingredients:
1/2   cup vegetable oil
1/2   cup lime juice
2   Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried basil leaves
2   Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried oregano leaves
2   Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried thyme leaves
1   tsp granulated onion powder
1/4   teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
2 lb   chicken thighs & legs

Directions:
In shallow glass or plastic dish or heavy-duty reseal-able food-storage plastic bag, mix all ingredients except chicken. Add chicken thighs and drumsticks; turn to coat with marinade. Cover dish or seal bag; refrigerate, turning chicken occasionally, at least 30 minutes but no longer than 24 hours.
Heat gas or charcoal grill. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Place chicken, skin sides down, on grill over medium heat. Cover grill; cook 15 minutes. Turn chicken; brush with marinade. Cover grill; cook 15 minutes. Brush with marinade; cook 5 to 15 minutes longer or until juice of chicken is clear when thickest part is cut to bone (180Â°F). Discard any remaining marinade. (If mad in oven, bake in pre-heated oven @ degrees for 45-55 minutes checking on temp of meat, then broil for 5 minuted to crisp the skin).
