Ingredients:
2 pounds of hamburger
Â½ cup of lard (or canola oil )
8 ounces of water
1 small 8 oz. can tomato sauce
1 large onion, finely minced
4 cloves of garlic, finely minced
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon of cumin
1 tablespoon of sweet paprika
1 tablespoon of celery salt
1 tablespoon of chili powder
1 tablespoon of allspice
2 teaspoons of dry mustard
1 teaspoon of Tabasco*
1 teaspoon of salt*

Directions:
Render the lard in a large pan over medium heat, and saute the onions and garlic over low heat until they are translucent. Add all the spices except the salt and the Tabasco. Add the hamburger, breaking it up and stirring it continually until crumbly and cooked. Remove from heat. Place in food processor, pulse to further break down meat.  DO NOT OVER PROCESS. Return to pan. Add the water and tomato sauce cook as long as it takes to evaporate the water. By this time the hamburger should be blended into the sauce and take on the consistency that you are familiar with. If this does not happen, then add four more ounces of water and reduce. Once you've attained the proper consistency, taste the sauce. Add salt and Tabasco in proportions that suit your taste. These items are reserved until the end because the salt content in the celery salt is variable, as is the degree of heat provided by the various brands of dry mustard.
Enjoy!

Description: 
A firefighter friend of my dads shared this recipe for Authentic Coney Island Wiener Sauce with me many years ago. In Rhode Island we enjoy them with chopped onions, yellow mustard and celery salt, all the way. Beware, they are addicting!
