Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 lemons, zested and juiced
2 tablespoons poppy seeds
2 2/3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup sour cream
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper muffin liners.
Whisk flour, white sugar, lemon zest, poppy seeds, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat buttermilk, sour cream, vegetable oil, and egg together in another bowl. Pour buttermilk mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
While muffins are cooling, whisk confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until glaze is smooth. Drizzle glaze over muffins.
