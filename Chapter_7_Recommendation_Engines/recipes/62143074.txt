Ingredients:
2 C all purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 C sugar
1 C mashed overripe banana
2/3 C mayonnaise (name brand only; store brands don't work well in this recipe)
1/4 C water
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1/2 C chopped nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Lightly grease one a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Combine first 3 (dry) ingredients in a large bowl. Set aside. Mix banana, sugar and mayo together. Add water and vanilla. Add dry ingredients to wet mixture and mix until blended. Fold in nuts. Pour into prepared pan and bake for approximately 70 minutes (batter thickness depends on the ripeness of the bananas) or until toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool loaf on wire rack.

Description: 
No oil or eggs on hand? No problem! 
This recipe, given to me by my brother, is the perfect solution. The substitution of mayonnaise for the eggs and oil makes for a moist, dense bread that is best enjoyed the next day; if you can wait that long!
