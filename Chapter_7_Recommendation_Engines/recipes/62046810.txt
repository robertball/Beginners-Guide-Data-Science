Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
3 cups crushed Captain Crunch cereal
2 cups crushed corn flakes
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/8 tsp. seasoned salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees ( 175 degrees C).  Cut fat off of chicken breasts, if necessary.  Mix garlic and seasoned salt into crushed cereal and place mixture into a large bowl.  Coat each breast with egg mixture (both sides), then press into cereal mixture until the entire breast is covered.  Repeat with all of the chicken.  Place coated chicken in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour -- or until juices run clear.

Description: 
This chicken is served at a famous celebrity restaurant.  Very good and sweet -- pair it with a crisp white wine and a saltier side dish, like rice pilaf, salted french fries or flavored noodles.
