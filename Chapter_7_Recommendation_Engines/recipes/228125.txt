coarse sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

Description: 
Everyone knows there's no salad like a Caprese salad on a hot summer day. Fresh-picked basil and tomatoes with just a hint of seasoning. I always use a whole spelt loaf when I make this recipe. The notes of the spelt combine perfectly with the light/summery flavors of the other ingredients. Very earthy. Also, fresh ground pepper and chunky sea salt make this dish pop even more. Muah!
