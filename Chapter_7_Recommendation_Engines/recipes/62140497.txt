Once cooked, place in a warm oven until the mash and gravy is done.
For the Mash:

2. Add the stock and wine, and cook at a boil or simmer, until reduced by half.
Plating:

Description: 
Bangers and mash gets its name because sausages used to burst (or bang) while cooking, due to rusk being added to the meat. Mash meanwhile, refers to the mashed potatoes.  This recipe was a staple at our home in Dublin at Halloween.  It is a very cheap, very traditional supper, and one that truly requires good sausage.  Try to use a good quality sausage, such as a cumberland or perhaps even a bratwurst. Please note that this is a very thin gravy, as is traditional.  It will still be very liquidy.
