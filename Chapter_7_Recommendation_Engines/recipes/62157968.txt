Pat's Perfected Make-Ahead Potato Salad Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
5 pounds russet potatoes
1 dozen boiled eggs, chopped
12 radishes, diced medium
4 stalks celery, diced medium
1 small yellow onion, diced medium
40 oz. jar mayonnaise
1 tsp. salt, or to taste
1 tsp. pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Rinse potatoes well, leave whole in jackets and place them in a large pot; cover with water.  Boil until fork tender and drain.  Allow to cool enough to handle comfortably.  Peel jackets off and cut potatoes into desired chunks the size you like.  I recommend quartering the potatoes and then slicing about 1/4" thick.  Place the potatoes into a very large bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients to the potatoes.  Carefully mix together as to not break up the potatoes.  We just use our hands as it gently incorporates everything nicely.  Cover and refrigerate at least 12 hours so the flavors meld nicely.

Description: 
This is my Mom's potato salad recipe.  She put this together for years just by memory and finally wrote it down for me to take over the duty preparing.  It's too good not to share.  People who don't normally care for potato salad actually like this recipe!  It's creamy and has just thre right amount of everything.  Our family loves it and I know yours will too.  I'm submitting this as a tribute to my Mom, since it's Mother's Day today!  Here's to you, Mom!
