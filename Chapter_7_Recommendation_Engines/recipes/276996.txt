Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) pie pumpkin, peeled and coarsely chopped
3 pears - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 slices bacon, diced
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 bulb fennel, diced
3 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place pumpkin chunks on one side of a rimmed baking sheet. Place sliced pears on the other side. Drizzle with olive oil and mix around to coat.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until pumpkin is easily pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, fry bacon in a large pot over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add onion and fennel; cook until onion is soft and clear, about 5 minutes. Add butter and garlic; season with cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Add pumpkin and pears. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
Pour in chicken broth to cover all the vegetables. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Serve hot, with crumbled goat cheese on top.

Description: 
Fresh pumpkin and succulent pears are roasted together before being blended into a creamy bisque. From the caramelization that results with roasting veggies, these two perfect fall flavors deepen dramatically and make a savory soup with a sweet undertone.
