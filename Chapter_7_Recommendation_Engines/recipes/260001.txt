Ingredients:
8 ounces dried hibiscus flowers
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
Salsa Verde:
10 fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/4 onion, chopped
2 serrano peppers
1 clove garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt to taste
18 corn tortillas
Garnish:
2 slices fresh pineapple, chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped
2 limes, cut into wedges

Directions:
Rinse hibiscus very well to make sure all dust is removed. Place clean hibiscus in a pot over medium heat, cover with water, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove hibiscus from heat and allow to steep for at least 2 hours, until hibiscus is very soft. Drain well.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook 1 onion and 2 cloves garlic until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in drained hibiscus and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until hibiscus turns a deep red color.
Combine tomatillos, avocado, 1/4 onion, serrano peppers, 1 clove garlic, and 2 tablespoons cilantro; blend until smooth. Season salsa verde with salt.
Warm corn tortillas in a skillet. Divide hibiscus mixture amongst tortillas and top with pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Serve with salsa verde and lime.
