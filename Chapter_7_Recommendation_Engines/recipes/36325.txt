Ingredients:
1 (1.25 ounce) package McCormick® Grill Mates® Southwest Marinade
1/4 cup olive oil
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 pounds flank steak
1 bell pepper, cut in strips

Directions:
Combine Southwest Marinade, oil, lime juice and water in a self-closing plastic bag.  Pierce steak with fork.  Add steak, pepper and onion strips to marinade.  Close bag.  Turn bag to coat meat and vegetables.  Refrigerate 30 minutes or longer for extra flavor.
Remove meat from marinade.  Grill or broil to desired doneness.  Lift vegetables from marinade; place in heated skillet or grill pan.  Saute vegetables over medium-high heat until tender.  Discard any leftover marinade.
Cut meat into thin slices.  Serve in warmed tortillas with vegetables; garnish with salsa, sour cream or shredded cheese, if desired.  Fold over edges of tortilla.
