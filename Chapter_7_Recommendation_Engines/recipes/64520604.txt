Ingredients:
1 medium potato per person
Canola or sunflower oil
Kosher salt
Freshly ground pepper
Garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to *400
Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with tin foil, preferably heavy duty foil, and generously greasing with oil.
Scrub each potato well and dry.
Slice each potato through its thickest part, trying to make each half as even as possible.
Score the flesh of the potato with a knife, about 1/4" deep and 1/2" apart making a crosshatch pattern.
Grease each potato with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on foil.
Roast for 40 - 50 minutes or until well cooked and browned. They do not need to be turned or flipped.
Carefully peel the tin foil off of the potatoes.
Lightly Sprinkle with garlic powder, and any other seasonings you desire!
Careful, these are addictive.

Description: 
These potatoes are unbelievably tasty and simple to prepare. My mom, Debbie has been making these for several decades. It's best to season these after they are finished cooking, to avoid having the herbs and spices burn. These potatoes can also be made with parchment paper instead of foil.
