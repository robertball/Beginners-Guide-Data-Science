Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tsp. paprika, if desired
1 tsp. salt
freshly ground black pepper
3 to 3 1/2 lb. chicken pieces
vegetable oil
1 cup water
3 Tbsp. all purpose flour

.........................
3 Tbsp. shortening
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 cup milk
1/2 tsp. dried herbs(such as sage,
celery seed or thyme leaves)

Directions:
Mix 1 cup of flour, paprika, salt, and pepper. Coat chicken with flour mixture. Heat thin layer of oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven. Brown chicken on all sides. Drain fat from skillet; reserve. Add water. Cover and cook over low heat about 45 minutes, adding water if necessary, until juices run clear.
Remove chicken from skillet; keep warm. Drain liquid from skillet; reserve. Heat 3 Tbsp. reserved fat in skillet; stir in 3 Tbsp. flour. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth and bubbly. Remove from heat. Add enough milk to reserved liquid to measure 3 cups. Pour into skillet. Heat to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir 1 minute. Return chicken to gravy.
Prepare herb dumplings: cut shortening into dry ingredients until consistency of fine crumbs. Drop by spoonfuls onto hot chicken(do not drop directly into liquid). Cook uncovered 10 minutes. Cover and cook for another 20 minutes.
