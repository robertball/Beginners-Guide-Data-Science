One of my favorite breads for potato soup is beer bread: 3 cups self-rising flour, 3 T white sugar, and 12 oz room teperature beer. Mix it together and spread into a greased loaf pan. Bake at 350 for 45-55 minutes. When you take it our of the oven, pour 6 Tablespoons melted butter over it. Remove from the pan and let it cool on a rack for a few minutes before you slice it.
