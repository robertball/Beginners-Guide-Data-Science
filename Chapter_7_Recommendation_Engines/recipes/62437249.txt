Ingredients:
Kernels from 2 fresh ears of corn (include cut parts and liquid)
4 to 5 fine diced fresh tomatoes- farmer's market or straight from the market
4 chopped scallions
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 minced jalapenos (seeded and stemmed)
juice from 1 lime
1 large garlic clove minced
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp coriander
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbs corn syrup

Directions:
Separate corn kernels by hand until loose.  Place them and the tomatoes in a saucepan.  Simmer on medium-high heat until the mixture is reduced by half.
Add all remaining ingredients and allow to mellow together  before use.
Canning:
Place in hot sterilized jars with new or good condition seals and lids. Process for 30 minutes in a hot water bath.  Make sure seals are not popped before storing.  Should make 2 1/2 pints.

Description: 
This is a surprising favorite at my barbeques, which works as a salsa, a condiment to barbeque, or on wraps or sandwiches.  But our favorite way to eat it is plain with tortilla chips.  Can or freeze while ingredients are in peak season, so you can have a fresh salsa all winter long.
