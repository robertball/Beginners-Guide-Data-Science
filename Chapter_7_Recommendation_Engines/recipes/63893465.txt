Basalmic Glaze
Pour vinegar into a small sauce pan and bring to a boil.  Once you've got a boil, reduce the heat and allow the vinegar to simmer for about 20-30 minutes or until the vingar has become thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (you should have about 1/2 cup of glaze when it's done).
Remove from heat and allow to cool.  then just pour it into a container with a lid and pop it in the fridge.  It should last you a few weeks.
