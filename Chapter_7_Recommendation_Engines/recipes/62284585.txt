Title:
Rack of Lamb Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 rack of lamb, Frenched (fat and gristle removed from the bone ends, thin layer of fat left on the rest) - best is 7 or 8 ribs
Salt and freshly milled black pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 425°F (220°C)
Pat dry the rack.
Heat a large, heavy, ovenproof skillet without fat over high heat.
Turn on the extractor fan and/or open the window.
Season the meat side of the rack with salt and pepper.
Add the lamb meat side down and sear well, about 2 minutes. (Searing the lamb like this can make you cough as the salt and pepper break down in the heat - hence the fan and/or window)
Season lightly the bone (upper) side while searing the meat side.
After the 2 minutes are up, flip over the rack to sear the bone side also for 2 minutes - so 4 minutes in total.
Take the rack out of the pan and pour off any fat, wipe the pan out with kitchen paper (try not to burn yourself!). See the footnotes for variations that can be applied at this point.
Replace the rack in the pan, bone side down, then slide the pan into the oven.
If you have a meat thermometer, then cook until the middle of the thickest part registers 125°F (51°C) for rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium rare.
This takes around 15 or 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven, cover loosely with alu foil, and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes before carving into chops by cutting down between the bones. Serve 2 or 3 chops per person (10 or 20 for growing teenage boys).
