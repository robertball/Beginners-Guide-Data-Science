Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
Filling:
1 (12 ounce) jar black cherry jam
Topping:
1 pint heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®), or to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (6 ounce) jar maraschino cherries
1/2 cup grated milk chocolate, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line two muffin tins with cupcake liners.
Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time. Mix in milk. Add flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda; beat until batter is smooth.
Pour batter into prepared muffin tins, filling each liner about half-full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 25 minutes.
Cut tops off the cooled cupcakes. Remove a small amount of the center of each cupcake. Fill the centers with a small dab of black cherry jam. Put the tops back on, covering the jam.
Combine heavy cream, sucralose sweetener, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Whip until soft peaks form. Place in the refrigerator until chilled.
Place whipped cream in a piping bag fitted with a round or star tip. Frost each cupcake with a swirl of whipped cream. Top each one with a maraschino cherry and grated chocolate.
