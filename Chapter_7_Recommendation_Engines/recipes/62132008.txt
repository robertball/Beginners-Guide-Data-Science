Ingredients:
4 pieces chickens thighs (or if you prefer you can use a whole roasted chicken - can find them already roasted in your grocery store deli)
3 cans of garbanzos/chick peas
1 stalk of celery
1/4 chunk salt pork (can find it by the bacon)
1 Pkg Fideos nest or vermicelli

Directions:
In pressure cooker cook 4 thighs of chicken without the skin, 1/4 of chunk salt pork(they are normally near the bacon section at the store)and one stalk of celery. Cover with water up to half the pressure cooker. Cook for 20 minutes under pressure. Start counting the minutes when the whistle starts rotating.
After the 20 minutes, remove the pressure cook from the heat and put in under cool running water until depressurization.
Remove chicken and cut into pieces and remove the bones. Add the chicken back to the pressure cook in the broth. Add 2 cans of garbanzos drained and 1 or 2 nest of fideos nest or vermicelli about half or one cup. Cook until fideos/noodles are tender (with lid of pressure cooker off)
Que aproveche!
