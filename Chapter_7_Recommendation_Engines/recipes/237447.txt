Ingredients:
1/2 cup popcorn kernels
1/4 cup canola oil
1 lime, zested and juiced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1 tablespoon sriracha sauce

Directions:
Combine popcorn kernels and oil in a deep pot over high heat and place a cover on the pot. Cook the popcorn, frequently shaking the pot to move the kernels, until the sound of kernels popping slows to nearly a stop, about 7 minutes. Carefully pour popcorn into a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle lime zest and salt over the popcorn.
Whisk lime juice, melted butter, and sriracha sauce together in a bowl; drizzle over popcorn and toss to coat.
