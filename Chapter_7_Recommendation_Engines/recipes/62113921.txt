Ingredients:
2 medium baked potatoes, cooled, peeled and cut into cubes
2 links sausage, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons butter
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons milk or water
Light sprinkling of onion powder
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
Flour tortillas (optional)

Directions:
Cook sausage (while stirring occasionally) in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat until evenly browned; drain on paper towels, blotting to remove excess fat and set aside.
Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat and cook potatoes until they are lightly browned.
Gently turn potatoes while they are cooking so that they donâ€™t break apart.
Remove potatoes from pan and set aside along with sausage.
Mix together eggs, milk, onion powder, salt and pepper with a fork.
Pour eggs into skillet and cook until eggs are almost done.
Return sausage and potatoes to pan and gently turn with spatula to combine.
Sprinkle with shredded cheese and serve with warmed flour tortillas.

Description: 
This hearty breakfast comes together quickly because the potatoes are slready baked.  You're just browning them.  When you are making baked potatoes for dinner, plan ahead for this breakfast and bake a few extra.
