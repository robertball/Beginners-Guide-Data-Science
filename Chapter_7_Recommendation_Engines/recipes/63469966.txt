Ingredients:
16oz can chickpeas, drained
8oz frozen okra
16oz frozen chopped cauliflower
1 26-oz box Pomi chopped tomatoes
2 scallions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, crushed or minced
2 cups prepared brown rice
3 large drops Tabasco sauce
all-purpose flour if needed
salt
nutmeg
chili powder
ginger
old bay seasoning
curry (conservatively)
savory
thyme

Directions:
Combine chickpeas, okra, cauliflower, Pomi, scallions, and garlic in a large pot.  Season to taste using all seasonings.  Cover and bring to a boil.
Bring back to a simmer.  For a shorter cooking time, let simmer for at least 30 minutes and add a sprinkle of flour if needed to thicken the stew.  For a more flavorful and flour-less dish, let simmer for at least an hour or until the okra has brought the stew to the desired thickness.
Serve over the rice.

Description: 
A warm dish for a winter day - but just as enjoyable as a New Orleans-esque dish in the summer!  This dish can be made quickly or take all day depending on the depth of flavor & thickness you want to achieve and of course the time you have to spend.
