Ingredients:
canola oil for frying
2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
3 large eggs, beaten
1 eggplant, peeled and sliced
1 (13.5 ounce) jar roasted garlic flavored spaghetti sauce (such as RaguÂ® Roasted Garlic Pasta Sauce)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Heat canola oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Mix bread crumbs, flour, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese together in a bowl. Place eggs in a small bowl.
Dip eggplant slices in the eggs, then the bread crumb mixture. Drop into oil a few slices at a time until breading turns golden brown, about 2 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Heat spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until heated through, about 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.

Description: 
My dad made me eggplant parm one night and I thought, Hmm, I wonder if this would be good as a fried dish. Take this as a State Fair-style spin on a classically iconic Italian staple. This dish is quick and easy, and something anyone can do. You may think teens are lazy, but they'll come to life making this dish.
