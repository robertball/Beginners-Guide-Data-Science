Spaetzle Recipe

Ingredients:
3 cups Flour
2 large beaten eggs
1 tsp salt
2 Tbsp cold water
1 tsp virgin olive oil
1 cup grated Gruyere
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F
Mound the flour on a work board and dig a well in the middle.  Add the beaten eggs to the well, the salt and the water.  Mix the flour slowly into the ingredients being careful not to break down the sides of the well.  Add water if necessary.  The dough should be farely soft.
Divide the dough in 4 pieces and roll out to about 1/4 inch thick (will look like a long sausage).  Cut into little pieces about 1/2 inch long.  Boil for about 5-6 minutes (like you would pasta) in water containing a few drops of oil.
Drain the noodles and add half the cheese to them.  Pepper generously and put into a buttered oven safe pot.  Cover with the rest of the cheese.  Cook for 15 minutes in the oven till cheese is melted and golden brown.
