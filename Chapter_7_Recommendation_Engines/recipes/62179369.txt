Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup cranberries
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon-style prepared mustard
1 cup vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
10 cups mixed salad greens, rinsed and dried
2 Red Delicious apples, cored and thinly sliced
1/2 cup craisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread the walnuts out on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly toasted.
In a food processor, combine the cranberries, vinegar, onion, sugar, and mustard. Puree until smooth; gradually add oil, and season with salt and pepper.
In a salad bowl, toss together the greens, apples, and enough of the cranberry mixture to coat. Sprinkle with candied walnuts and craisins, and serve.

Description: 
This salad contains lots of greens and sliced Red Delicious apples with a sprinkling of toasted almonds. But the dressing is a bit fancier. Cranberries, onions, sugar, and mustard are pureed in the blender with balsamic vinegar and oil, then added to the salad so that it perfectly coats every leaf of lettuce and slice of apple.Modified from: Apple Walnut Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette
