Ingredients:
2 quarts fresh strawberries – cleaned and halved
1 pint heavy cream or whipping cream
2 cups all-purpose flour - sifted
1 tablespoon baking powder
4 tablespoons butter
¾ cups light cream or buttermilk
4 – 5 tablespoons sugar
1 tbs powdered Sugar

Directions:
Preheat Oven 350 degrees:
Sift flour, baking powder and sugar into a bowl. Cut in the butter. Work the batter with your fingers. Add the cream or buttermilk and stir gently and quickly until dough is formed.
Flour a surface and knead the dough gently until no creases are left.
Roll out the dough to about ½ inch thickness. Place on parchment paper or a buttered cookie sheet.
Bake about 20-25 minutes - until slightly golden.
Let cool, then cut the biscuits in half through the center; making a top and bottom half.
Whip the cream with a tablespoon of powdered sugar.
Sandwich the strawberries and whip cream between the layers of biscuit to build your cake.
