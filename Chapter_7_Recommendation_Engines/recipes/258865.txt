Description: 
This is a smoky, rich change from ordinary mac 'n cheese. I make this recipe and my family of 4 can eat on it for dinner for a few days.... Just change up your veggies every day and top your mac with bacon one day and fresh chopped parsley the next. Try it and you won't be disappointed!
