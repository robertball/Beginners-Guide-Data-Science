Ingredients:
1 fryer, cut into pieces
1 cup all purpose flour, seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper, to taste
½ cup vegetable oil
2 tsp. sugar
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup bell pepper, chopped
1 large clove of garlic, minced
2 - heaping tsps.  prepared roux
1 – 2 cups water
1 chicken bouillon cube
1 tbsp. dried parsley flakes
Salt & cayenne pepper, to taste
If gravy needs thickening, use 1 – 2 tsp. cornstarch mixed with a little water.

Directions:
Season fryer with salt and pepper and dredge in flour.  Heat up oil in Dutch oven, add sugar, when sugar starts to caramelize, add chicken, browning pieces well.  When browned, remove from pot then add onion, bell pepper, and garlic.  When vegetables are browned and tender, add roux and a little water to dissolve roux, stirring constantly.   Cook on medium low heat for about 30 minutes.  Put chicken back into pot; adding just enough water so that chicken is not completely covered with water.  Add bouillon cube, parsley and salt and cayenne pepper, to taste.  Cover and let simmer on a low/medium heat for 2 hours.  Serve with rice.

Description: 
Down in South Louisiana, in the heart of Cajun Country, we either smother a chicken (which is chicken just browned with onions and bell peppers) or make a fricassee (which is somewhat like a thick Gumbo), both served over hot steamed rice; here's my take on a combination of the two recipes.
