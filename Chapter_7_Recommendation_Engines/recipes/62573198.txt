Description: 
This recipe can be served with fresh or canned green beans. To me, part of the deal with this sauce is that you can use the canned green beans,  Jones said. It can also be served with broccoli or asparagus, and it would even make an excellent light dip for celery and carrot sticks.

At large gatherings, serve the sauce on the side so children can have their veggies plain, if they prefer.
