Description: 
THIS WAS my children's favorite salad when they were growing up. Whenever we would go on a picnic, they requested the 'tuna fish special'.    The variety of flavors gives it a special taste everyone loves. No matter how many different tuna salad recipes I've tried, this one still tops our list! -Gerry Tressler, St. Petersburg, Florida
