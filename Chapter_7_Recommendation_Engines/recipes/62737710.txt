Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/4 cup mayonnaise
3 Tbsp sour cream
1/4 tsp dry mustard
1/4 tsp salt and pepper
1/4 tsp paprika

Directions:
Arrange eggs in a single layer in a large deep saucepan; pour in enough cold water to come at least 1 inch above eggs. Cover and bring to boil over high heat. Immediately remove from heat; let stand, covered, for 20 minutes. Drain and run cold water over eggs until cooled. (Make-ahead: Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 2 days.)
Gently tap eggs on counter to crack shells all over; peel off shells. Cut eggs in half lengthwise; scoop yolks into bowl. Set whites on serving platter; cover and set aside.
Using fork, mash together egg yolks, mayonnaise, sour cream, mustard, salt and pepper. Using pastry bag fitted with 1-inch star tip or using spoon, squeeze egg mixture into whites.
