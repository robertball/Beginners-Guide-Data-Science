Ingredients:
1 (16 oz) loaf of cinnamon-raisin bread, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored (and diced, but don't dice until next morning to keep it from turning brown)
6 eggs, beaten
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together cinnamon, brown sugar and melted butter.  Toss sliced apples in mixture to coat.
Grease a 9x13 baking dish.  Arrange sliced apples on the bottom of the baking dish in a single layer.
In another large bowl combine eggs, nutmeg, milk, heavy cream and vanilla.  Whisk to combine.  Stir in bread cubes to coat with egg mixture.  Let bread and egg mixture sit for 5 minutes for the bread to soak up the eggs.  Pour over the sliced apples, cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees (F).  Remove dish from refrigerator, dice the final appled and sprinkle the apple over the top of the bread pudding.
Bake at 375 for 40 minutes.  Remove foil, turn on broiler and broil for 5 minutes.  Let stand 5-10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
You might call this baked French Toast ... you might call it Breakfast Bread Pudding ... but everyone will agree it is simple, sweet and delicious.  I have found kids and adults enjoy it and it is wonderful for brunch and/or a potluck.
