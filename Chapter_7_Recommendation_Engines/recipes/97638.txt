Ingredients:
1 cup pearl barley
2 1/2 cups water
8 ounces broken dried mushrooms
1/2 cup water
1 (3 pound) boneless chuck roast
5 quarts water
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Combine barley and 2 1/2 cups water in a bowl; cover and let soak overnight. Combine dried mushrooms and 1/2 cup water in a bowl; cover and let soak overnight.
Place the chuck roast in a large stockpot over medium heat; cover the roast with 5 quarts water. Bring the water to a boil, skimming any foam off the surface. Boil the roast until the foam no longer forms on the water, about 15 minutes. Pour the barley, mushrooms, and the water from both bowls into the stockpot; stir in the parsley, dill, broth, salt, and pepper. Return the mixture to a boil; reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring every hour, until soup has reduced to desired thickness, 4 to 6 hours.
Remove large pieces of beef from the soup; trim and discard fat. Cut remaining meat into bite-sized pieces and return them to the soup.

Description: 
I miss my Grandparents dearly. Grandpa loved to cook while Grandma knitted on the sofa.  This helps brings them back to me. This recipe was one of my favorites growing up. It's an old-fashioned, slow-cooking, lick-the-bowl, stick-to-your-ribs type of soup.   The family loves it. It's traditional at holiday time with a nice slice of rye bread to dip in it.
