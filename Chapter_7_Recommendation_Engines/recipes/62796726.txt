Description: 
I enjoyed this salad at a well-known restaurant and when they wouldn't divulge the recipe, I created my own.  Although a bit time consuming, everything can be prepared at least a day ahead, covered and refrigerated.  I took this salad to the 2011 AR Buckeye Bash and am posting for those who requested the recipe.
