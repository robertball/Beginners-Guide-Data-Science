Ingredients:
1 pint cherry tomatoes
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and black pepper to taste
1 (9 ounce) package refrigerated fresh tortellini
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons spicy pesto
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
6 leaves fresh basil, torn, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the cherry tomatoes on a baking sheet, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle on the oregano, salt, and pepper, and roll the cherry tomatoes around a few times to coat with the seasoned oil. Bake in the preheated oven until the tomatoes begin to burst, about 15 minutes.
Cook and drain the tortellini according to package directions, and set aside in a serving dish.
In a skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the garlic until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the pesto and roasted tomatoes. Smash the tomatoes with a fork to break open, stir to combine, and pour the sauce over the tortellini. Sprinkle with shredded Parmesan cheese and torn basil leaves.
