Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 cup sliced shiitake mushrooms
1/2 cup sliced yellow onion
1 pound cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup sun-dried tomato pesto
1/2 cup white wine
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; add butter and olive oil. Cook and stir garlic in the hot butter-oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
Mix shrimp, diced tomatoes, pesto, wine, and lemon juice into mushroom-onion mixture; simmer for 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; add half-and-half, Parmesan cheese, parsley, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt and mix until sauce is well combined.
Place pasta in a serving bowl. Spoon sauce over pasta and top with extra Parmesan cheese.
