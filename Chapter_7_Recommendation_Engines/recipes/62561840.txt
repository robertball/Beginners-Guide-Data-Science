Ingredients:
1-2 lbs shrimp or crawfish (I use the medium shrimp, and cut them in half, so they are more bite sized)
1 small onion, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1/4 bunch green onions
1 stick of butter
2 cans cream style corn
4 cans cream of potato soup
2 soup cans of milk
8 oz Velveeta cheese, shredded or cut into small cubes

Directions:
Saute shrimp, peppers, and onions in butter until cooked through.  Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 20 minutes or until cheese is melted.  Stir occasionally so it doesn't stick.
