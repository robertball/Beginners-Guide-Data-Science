Ingredients:
1/3 cup oyster sauce
2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
3/4 pound beef round steak, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips
1/4 tsp minced ginger root
1 clove garlic
1 pound broccoli
2 carrots
1/2 onion
brown rice

Directions:
Prepare brown rice.
Whisk together the oyster sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Place the steak pieces into a shallow bowl, pour the oyster sauce mixture over the meat, stir to coat well, and marinate for at least 30 minutes in refrigerator.
Cut broccoli into florets; mince garlic; thinly slice/shave carrot; cut onion into thin wedges.
Heat 1/4 cup water in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the broccoli,carrots, onions, garlic, ginger and toss and stir until bright green and almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the wok, and set aside.
Stir and toss the beef with the marinade until the sauce forms a glaze on the beef, and the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Return the cooked broccoli to the wok, and stir until the meat and broccoli are heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve over brown rice.

Very easy and delicious. Substituting chicken for the beef works great too. Serve over rice.Modified from: Restaurant Style Beef and Broccoli
