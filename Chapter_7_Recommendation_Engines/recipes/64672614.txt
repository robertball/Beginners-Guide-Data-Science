Ingredients:
2 avocados, cut in half, seed and skin removed
1 cup salad greens
1 cup cherry tomatos, diced
1/2 cup fresh mozzarella, diced (I prefer cherry sized cut in halves)
2 tablespoons basil pesto
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to taste
2 tablespoons balsamic reduction glaze (I use Bertolli Glaze Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - store bought for convenience)*

Directions:
Plate the avocado halves on the salad greens
Mix in bowl tomato, mozzarella, pesto and salt let marinate for a few minutes
Top avocados with the mixture of the tomato, mozzarella and pesto followed by drizzle of  balsamic reduction glaze.
* Note if you wish to make your own balsamic reduction glaze, there are several online sites to walk you through the process. I just choose to use store product for quickness and ease of putting everything together.
