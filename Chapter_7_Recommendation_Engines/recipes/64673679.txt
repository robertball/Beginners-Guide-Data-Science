Ingredients:
8 oz spaghetti
10 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; drain well.
In a medium saucepan, combine butter, and garlic over medium heat until the butter has melted. Cook, whisking constantly, until the foam subsides and the butter begins to turn a golden brown, about 4-5 minutes, skimming foam as necessary.
Remove from heat. Stir in pasta and Parmesan until well combined, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve immediately.
