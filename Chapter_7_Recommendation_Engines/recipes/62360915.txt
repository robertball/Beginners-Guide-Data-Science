Ingredients:
2/3 cup Orange juice
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoon white vinegar
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
2 teaspoon grated orange peel
2 tablespoons Peanut Oil
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed
Steamed Broccoli
1 cup water
1 cup uncooked sticky rice
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
4 tablespoons cold water
chopped green onions for garnish

Directions:
In a bowl, stir together OJ, brown sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, white vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, five-spice powder, and orange peel until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat, and cook and stir the chicken until the outside is golden brown and the inside is no longer pink, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken, bring to a boil.  Mix cornstarch with water in small bowl, whisk in boiling sauce.   Let the chicken and sauce cook for about 2 minutes to thicken, then serve over hot cooked rice, sprinkled with green onion.
