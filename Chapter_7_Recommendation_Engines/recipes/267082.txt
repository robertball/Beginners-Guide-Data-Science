Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped carrot
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons milk, or as needed
Topping:
1 cup beef broth
1 cup tomato sauce
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 dash hot pepper sauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine beef, onion, green pepper, celery, carrot, bread crumbs, egg, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add enough milk to moisten the mixture. Shape mixture into small patties.
Arrange patties in the prepared pan.
Mix beef broth, tomato sauce, mushroom soup, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce in another bowl. Pour sauce over patties.
Bake in the preheated oven until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Evidently when my mom made this, she snuck lots of veggies in! I don't see any other recipe like it on this site, but it's the only way I know to make it.
