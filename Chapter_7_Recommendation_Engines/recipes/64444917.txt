Ingredients:
2 cups dry salad macaroni, cooked
1/4 cup sweet yellow onion, chopped fine
1 cup chopped tomatoes or halved grape tomatoes
1/2 cup English cucumber, seeded, peeled, chopped
2-3 stalks celery, chopped
a few sliced radishes, if available
Dressing:
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 tablespoon sugar
Optional Additions & Substitutions:
substitute green onions for sweet onions
tuna or shrimp
chopped boiled eggs (I like it better without...)
macaroni: elbow, shell, orzo, anything small

Directions:
Boil the 2 cups macaroni 11 minutes in salted water. Drain, rinse, drain again, and refrigerate. Can be speeded up by adding ice cubes to the rinse water.
When pasta is cold, add vegetables and dressing, mix thoroughly and refrigerate, covered.

Description: 
This is the way Mom always made her macaroni salad, with a few tweaks of my own. My family is crazy for it! Very popular at a potluck.
