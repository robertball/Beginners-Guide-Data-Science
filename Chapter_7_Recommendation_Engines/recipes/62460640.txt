Ingredients:
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed (we use 6 new potatoes)
2 cups chicken broth
1 small can corn
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped carrots
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
Bacon (optional)

Directions:
In a large saucepan over high heat, add the potatoes, chicken broth, onions, celery, carrots and corn. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Mash slightly.
In a small bowl, mix together the milk powder and the flour. Gradually add the milk, stirring until smooth. Add the milk/flour mixture to the potato mixture, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until soup is thick and bubbly. Add chopped ham/bacon if using.
