Description: 
Tastes just like the expensive BoursinÂ® cheese spread you buy at the store. Reduced-fat cream cheese works well in this recipe. Delicious spread on crackers or as a fill on celery sticks. Good shelf life in the refrigerator. This can be eaten right way, but it's best if refrigerated for at least one day before serving.
