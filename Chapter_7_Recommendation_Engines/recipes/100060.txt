Ingredients:
2 cups cooked shredded chicken
1 1/2 quarts chicken broth
3/4 cup orzo pasta
1/2 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
3 eggs
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
Salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken and broth to a boil in a small soup kettle or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add orzo; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, reduce the heat and simmer 8 to 10 minutes.
While soup simmers, beat eggs and lemon juice until frothy in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk several ladles full of the hot soup into the eggs, being careful not to curdle the eggs.
Turn off the soup kettle; return egg and soup mixture to the pot and stir well. Season with salt and pepper and serve at once.
