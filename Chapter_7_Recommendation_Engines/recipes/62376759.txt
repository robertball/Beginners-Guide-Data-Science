Ingredients:
1/2 C. Sweet chili powder (California or ancho)
1/2 C. Instant espresso
1/4 C Hot smoked Spanish Paprika
3 TBSP Brown Sugar
1 TBSP Dry Mustard
1 TBSP Salt
2 TBSP Ground black pepper
1 TBSP Powdered ginger

Directions:
Mix all together and store in a jar. If you are doing a tenderloin or a nice roast, coat, allow to sit and then pan sear on the stove top to caramelize. Finish it in the oven. Steaks and chops can be done like this also or can go right on the grill.

Description: 
Generously coat a roast or steaks with this rub and allow to sit for at least 4 hours or overnight before cooking so that the flavor penetrates the meat.
