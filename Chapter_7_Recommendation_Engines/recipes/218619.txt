Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed and chopped
8 heads baby bok choy, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat, and cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Mix in the bok choy, and cook and stir until the green parts of the leaves turn bright green and the stalks become slightly translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with salt to serve.

Description: 
There's no better way to enjoy the crisp delicate taste of bok choy. This basic stir-fry can be served as is, or you can add meat or tofu to make it more substantial. Quick and easy, this is one of my favorite ways to load up on leafy greens. Serve with fluffy white rice, or over noodles in soup.
