Ingredients:
1 (18.25-ounce) package carrot cake mix
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 large eggs
1 cup raisins,sweetened dried cranberries,cherries or combination
OPTIONAL:
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 cup chopped nuts
1 cup grated peeled carrot
1/2 cup crushed pineapple
1/2 cup shredded coconut flakes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper for best results. (Alternatively lightly spray cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray.)
In a large bowl beat half the dry cake mix, oil, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice (if using) with an electric mixer on medium speed until well-blended and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Stir in remaining cake mix and any optional additions you are using with a wooden spoon, just until combined.
Drop the dough by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets.
Flatten the cookie dough balls slightly with the back of a fork or the bottom of a glass.
Bake for 10 to 14 minutes, or just until the edges are set but the centers are still soft.
Remove from the oven and cool the cookies on the cookie sheet for 1 to 2 minutes and then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
If desired, swirl or drizzle with cream cheese frosting, either prepared or homemade.
Makes about 4 dozen Carrot Cake Mix Cookies.
