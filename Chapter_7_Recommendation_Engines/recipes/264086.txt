Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1/2 cup diced onion
5 green onions, chopped, white and green parts separated
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce (such as sriracha)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) package coleslaw mix
3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced onion, white parts of the green onions, and garlic. Saute until onions are translucent and garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, sriracha, ginger, salt, and black pepper. Saute until beef is browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes.
Stir coleslaw mix, soy sauce, and cider vinegar into the beef mixture. Saute until coleslaw is tender, about 4 minutes more. Top with the rest of the green onions.
