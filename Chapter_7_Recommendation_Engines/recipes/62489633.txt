Ingredients:
6 potatoes, peeled and shredded
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
salt and black pepper to taste
Filling:
1/2 pound pork breakfast sausage

Directions:
Mix together the potatoes, flour, baking powder, 3 eggs, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Divide sausage into 4 servings and shape into patties. Cook patties until almost done.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-low heat, and drop a rounded tablespoon of potato mixture into the hot skillet. Spread and flatten the pancake out a little, and place one sausage patty on the pancake. Drop another rounded tablespoon of potato mixture on top of the sausage patty, and spread it out to completely cover the sausage. Fry until the bottom of the pancake is golden brown, about 5 minutes, then flip and fry the other side until golden, 1 to 2 more minutes.
