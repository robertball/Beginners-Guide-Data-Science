Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey
1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
2 green bell peppers, diced
2 red bell peppers, diced
4 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (15 ounce) cans chili beans
2 (15 ounce) cans red beans in chili sauce
1 (15 ounce) can yellow and white corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chile peppers
2 cups califlower tops, finely diced
1/2 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup ground cumin, or to taste
1/4 cup chili powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Brown turkey and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, cooking and stirring until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add green and red bell peppers to meat; cook and stir until peppers are soft and excess liquid has evaporated, about 10 more minutes.
Mix diced tomatoes, chili beans, red beans in chili sauce, yellow and white corn, black beans, chopped green chiles, barbeque sauce, cumin, chili powder, parsley, and red pepper flakes in a large soup pot. Place over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer chili for 20 minutes. Stir turkey mixture into chili and simmer 15 more minutes to blend flavors.
