Ingredients:
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts cut into small pieces
EVOO
Zest of 1 lemon
1 TBSP lemon juice
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
6 cloves of garlic
Pinch of paprika
1 TBSP chopped, fresh oregano leaves
Pita or flatbread wraps
Tzatziki sauce, bottled *
Slices cucumbers
Sliced Tomatoes
Sliced red onion
Feta cheese, if desired
Extra oregano leaves, mint or dill for garnish if desired

Directions:
Marinate chicken in a couple of tablespoons of the EVOO, plus the rest of the ingredients up to and including the chopped oregano leaves and allow to marinate for about 20 minutes or even overnight.
Heat skillet or wok to high heat, lower heat to medium hot, saute chicken until golden brown, juicy and cooked through. Allow to rest for several minutes.
Assemble your wrap by spreading a generous amount of tzatziki sauce over pita, then add some sliced cucumber, red onion and tomato, followed by chicken; sprinkle with feta cheese and a light sprinkle of fresh herbs.
*I use Litehouse OPA, tzatkiki ranch.
