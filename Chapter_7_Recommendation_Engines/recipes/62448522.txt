Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups quick oats
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup AP flour
1/2 cup oat bran
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 cup prune puree
2 tablespoons water
5 egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup chocolate chips
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1/3 cup chopped raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir together the brown sugar, oats, flour, oat bran, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the canola oil, prune puree, water, egg whites and vanilla. Mix until well blended. Stir in the chips, nuts and raisins. Scoop cookies using an ice cream scoop, or roll into golf ball sized balls. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets and flatten to 1/2 tall with wet hands. These cookies do not flatten very much while baking.
In the preheated oven, bake 8 minutes for chewy cookies 10 to 12 minutes for dry cookies. Cookies will not get crisp. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
