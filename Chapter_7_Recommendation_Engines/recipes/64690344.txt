Ingredients:
18 cups milk - note reserve 2 cups to make a slurry
11 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream
6 cups sugar
2 1/4 tsp salt
1 cup + 2 TBSP honey or inverted sugar
1 1/2 cups + 3 TBSP cream cheese or 15.3 ounces
3/4 cup cornstarch for slurry

Directions:
Whisk 16 cups milk + 11 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream + 6 cups sugar +
2 1/4 salt + 1 cup 2 TBSP honey
Bring these ingredients to a rolling boil for 4 minutes, whisk often so it doesn't scorch on the bottom of the pan.
Make the slurry in a separate blow by mixing 2 cups milk + 3/4 cup cornstarch. Once the cornstarch is dissolved pour slurry into the pot.
Bring mixture back to a boil for 2 more minutes, whisking often.
Remove from heat
Cut the 1 1/2 cups 3 TBSP (or 15.3 ounces) cream cheese into small bits, then stir it into the mixture.
Whisk mixture (or use the handheld blender thing) to blend the cream cheese until it melts.
Now put the pot into an ice bath for 20 minutes. Stir often to help remove the heat.
Once cooled pour thru a strainer directly into 2 one gallon jugs. The strainer will help remove little bits of cream cheese.
FInally, refrigerate for at least 2 hours before making ice cream.
Note this is 9 times the single base recipe.
