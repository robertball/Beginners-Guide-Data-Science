Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice
1 zucchini, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
1 cucumber, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 tomatoes, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup finely chopped green onions, white and light green parts
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
3 to 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Sea salt

Directions:
Rinse the rice, and place it in a saucepan with 2 cups water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, about 45 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes.
Transfer the rice to a large bowl, and let it cool for a few minutes until no longer steaming.
Add the zucchini, cucumber, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, pepper, and salt to taste. Mix well. Taste and add more lemon juice if desired.
Cover and chill, or let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, to allow the flavors to meld.
Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve cold or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
