Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoons dry white wine
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 boneless center-cut pork chops, sliced thin
1 cup Italian style panko bread crumbs (progresso)
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1/4 cup grated Pecorino romano cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the milk, garlic, white wine, red pepper, paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt and stir well. Add the pork chops and soak at room temperature at least 30 minutes or up to and hour.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a lightly greased wire rack on top of the baking sheet and set aside.
In a large sealable plastic bag, add the bread crumbs, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, the black pepper, italian seasoning and cheese and shake to combine. Drain the pork chops from the milk mixture, one at a time, and add to the bread crumb mixture. Shake to coat thoroughly. (You may need to press the mixture into the chops with your hands.)
Arrange the pork chops on the baking rack and drizzle with the olive oil. Bake for 25 minutes, or until cooked through and the breading is crisp and golden.
