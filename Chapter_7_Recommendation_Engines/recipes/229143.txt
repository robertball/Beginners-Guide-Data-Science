Ingredients:
5 quarts popped popcorn
2 cups unsalted cashews
2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Mix popcorn and cashews together in a large roasting pan.
Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, salt, and cream of tartar in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until a candy thermometer inserted into the middle of the syrup, not touching the bottom, reads 260 degrees F (127 degrees C), 6 to 8 minutes.
Remove syrup from heat; stir in baking soda. Pour over popcorn and cashews; stir to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 20 minutes, until sugar mixture has baked and caramelized onto popcorn and cashews, about 1 hour. Spread cashew caramel corn onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet to cool. If desired, form into balls while still warm.

My grandma used to make this long ago, usually around Halloween, and we would roll it into balls.
