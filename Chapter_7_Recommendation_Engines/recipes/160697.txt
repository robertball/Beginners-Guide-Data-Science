Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 potatoes, peeled and cut into strips
1 (16 ounce) jar sliced nopalitos, drained and rinsed
1 onion, diced
1 small tomato, diced
1 minced jalapeno pepper (optional)
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the potatoes, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally until they begin to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in the nopalitos, onion, tomato, and jalapeno. Season to taste with salt, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion has softened and turned translucent, and the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes more.
