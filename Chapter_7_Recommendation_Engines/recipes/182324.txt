Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes including juice
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch white sugar, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, chopped

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; stir in the green beans and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, and cook the green beans until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, 1 clove of garlic, and parsley in the hot oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, wine vinegar, and cumin; bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. Transfer the sauce to a bowl.
In a clean skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat; cook and stir 1 clove of chopped garlic in the hot oil until fragrant beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Return the cooked green beans to the skillet; cook and stir to reheat the beans and coat them with oil. Pour the sauce over the beans and stir to coat. Serve hot.

I had these beans at a dinner party. I'm so glad the hostess was willing to share the recipe. A very unique and different way to serve fresh green beans.
