Ingredients:
2 bunches radishes, trimmed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon ground thyme
salt to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Cut radishes into halves; cut any large radishes into quarters. Stir olive oil and thyme together in a bowl and toss radishes in mixture to coat. Spread radishes onto prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with salt.
Roast in the preheated oven until tender but firm in the centers, tossing every 5 minutes, 15 to 20 minutes. Drizzle with lemon juice.

Description: 
I saw a recipe for baked radishes in a magazine long, long ago and the thought so intrigued me I just had to give it a try. This is my personalized version of the original. I often switch out the thyme with either rosemary, basil, or crushed garlic, depending on my mood and what main dish these will be served with.
