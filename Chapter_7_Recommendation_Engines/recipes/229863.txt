Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups buttermilk
12 ounces dried Calimyrna figs, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 cups white whole-wheat flour (such as King Arthur®)
1 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 (2.45 ounce) package sliced almonds
3 tablespoons orange marmalade
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon orange-vanilla flavoring (such as Fiori di Sicilia® (optional)

Directions:
Gently heat buttermilk and figs in a saucepan over medium-low heat until softened, 10 to 15 minutes; set aside until cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer on high for 1 minute. Add fig-and-buttermilk mixture, bread crumbs, butter, almonds, orange marmalade, orange zest, and orange-vanilla flavoring to the beaten eggs; beat on low speed until blended. Gradually add flour mixture while beating until just incorporated into a batter. Spoon batter into prepared pan. Grease a sheet of aluminum foil; use to cover pan.
Bake in preheated oven until firm and pulling away from sides of the pan, about 2 hours. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan.

Description: 
Dense, moist cake reminiscent of the Victorian dessert, this figgy pudding was the perfect finale to a chestnut-stuffed, Christmas goose dinner. Serve warm with whipped cream flavored with liqueur.
