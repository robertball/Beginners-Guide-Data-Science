Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium orange pepper, diced
1/2 cup chopped onion or shallots
2 cups uncooked Arborio rice
1/2 cup dry white wine
6 cups Swanson® Chicken Broth (Regular, Natural Goodness™ or Certified Organic), heated
1/2 pound asparagus or green beans
1/2 pound refrigerated pasteurized crabmeat
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the pepper and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Add the rice and cook and stir for 2 minutes or until the rice is opaque. Add the wine and cook and stir until it's absorbed.  Stir 2 cups of the hot broth into the rice mixture.  Cook and stir until the broth is absorbed, maintaining the rice at a gentle simmer.  Continue cooking and adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until it's absorbed after each addition before adding more. Add the asparagus and crabmeat with the last broth addition. Stir the cheese into the risotto. Remove the pan from the heat. Cover and let it stand for 5 minutes. Serve the risotto with additional cheese.
