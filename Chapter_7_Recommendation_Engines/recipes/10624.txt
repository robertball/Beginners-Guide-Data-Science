Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup molasses
2 egg whites
1 egg
1/2 cup raisins
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium sized bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and allspice. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium, cream the sugar and butter until light yellow and fluffy.  Add the molasses, egg whites, and egg; beat well.
Using a wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until flour disappears.  Fold in raisins and nuts.
Drop by tablespoons, 2 inches apart, onto lightly greased cookie sheets.  Bake 8-9 minutes.  Lightly sift confectioners' sugar over if you like.
