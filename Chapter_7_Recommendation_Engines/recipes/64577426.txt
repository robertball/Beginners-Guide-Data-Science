Ingredients:
3/4 c Mayonnaise (Hellman's is our family's go-to)
1/3 c Sugar
1/4 c Milk
1/4 c Buttermilk (scant 1/4 c then fill to 1/4 mark with lemon juice or vinegar)
2-12/ tbs Lemon Juice
1-1/2 tbs White Vinegar (can use apple cider vinegar, just reduce sugar by 1 tbs)
3/4 tsp Salt (or to taste)
1/4 tsp Pepper - white or black (or to taste)
1/2 tsp celery seed (Optional) *If using celery salt, reduce regular salt by 1/4 tsp, add last and adjust seasoning to taste
2 tbs finely minced Onion or 1/4 tsp onion powder (Optional)
8 c Finely Chopped or Shredded Cabbage
1/4 c Shredded Carrot

Directions:
Place shredded veggies in large mixing bowl.
Blend all other ingredients together with a whisk in medium mixing bowl (or blend together in your blender), pour over shredded veggies and chill for several hours.
Chilling overnight is preferable.
Mix well before serving.
Refrigerate any leftovers.
*** This recipe works well with broccoli slaw, replacing the shredded cabbage with shredded broccoli ***
