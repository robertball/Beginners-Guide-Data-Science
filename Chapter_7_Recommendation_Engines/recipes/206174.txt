Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 cup mashed, ripe plantains
2 large eggs
1/3 cup corn oil
3 tablespoons melted butter

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir the flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk the milk, plantains, eggs, oil, and butter together in a separate bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the milk mixture until just combined; do not over mix. Allow the mixture sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into prepared muffin cups to about 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes.
