1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

Combine 1 can of white kidney beans and 2 cups broth in a blender. Blend to a smooth puree and pour into a large saucepan. Add remaining beans, remaining broth, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, thyme, and black pepper.  Bring soup to a boil over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
When I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, all I could think of was getting off all of the dangerous prescriptions they put me on. I started on a clean-eating kick and I am now in remission. This is one of my favorite recipes that got me through it.
