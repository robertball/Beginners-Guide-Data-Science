Ingredients:
1 cup mayonaise
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup minced dill pickles
2-3 tablespoons pickle juice
salt, pepper and a dash of celery salt to taste

Directions:
Use a food chopper to dice the onion and pickles small enough to stick to the food but not pureed, approximately shelled sunflower seed size?  Add the minced pickle and onion to the mayo, add the pickle juice (not too much or it will overwhelm the sauce) and add salt, pepper and celery salt to taste.
The amounts given are very flexible, if you like more onions then pickles feel free to add as you go.
Refrigerate for an hour before serving.

Description: 
This the tartar sauce my mom made growing up, no sweet relish here!  The pickle juice replaces lemon juice for acidity and tang.  So simple and worth the little bit of time.  (I don't like sweet pickles in my potato salad either!)
