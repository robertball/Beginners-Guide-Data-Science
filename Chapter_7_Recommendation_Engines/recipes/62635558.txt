Description: 
These were delicious!! The flavor was wonderful and my family wolfed these right down!! The only change I made was to add a little extra honey and onion. They were perfectly browned, didn't stick and just plain good! This recipe is going right into my favorites cookbook. Thanks kittencal!!
