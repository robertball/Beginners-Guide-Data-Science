Ingredients:
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, divided
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
1 pound boneless beef sirloin steak, fat trimmed
1 medium sweet red pepper, julienned
1 medium sweet yellow pepper, julienned
1 medium onion, julienned
6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Rub mixture over both sides of steak; set aside.
In a large nonstick skillet, saute the peppers, onion and garlic in oil until vegetables are crisp-tender. Stir in the tomatoes and remaining Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in vinegar; keep warm.
Place steak on a broiler pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 4-8 minutes on each side or until the meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing; serve with vegetable mixture.
