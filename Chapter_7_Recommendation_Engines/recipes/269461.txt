Ingredients:
1 cup soy milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine soy milk, oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Let sit until milk starts to curdle, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the soy milk mixture. Whisk together until smooth.
Heat a greased frying pan over medium heat. Fry pancakes until edges are brown and bubbles form in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook about 3 minutes more.
