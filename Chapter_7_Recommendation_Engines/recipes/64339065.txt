Clean Eating Coffee Creamer Recipe

Ingredients:
Clean Eating Coffee Creamer
makes 5 generous (1/4 cup servings)
Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup almond milk (or soy milk, coconut milk, cashew milk, or cow's milk-your coffee so it's your preference)
3 tsp of pure vanilla extract
1/2 tsp of extract of your choice
*Flavor options:  extra vanilla extract, almond extract, orange extract or any other extract as long as it's clean.
2 tbsp of honey
1/2 tsp of xanthan gum (I actually left this out, it's to thicken it)

Directions:
1) in a blender mix all ingredients until well blended.
2) Pour into  a container of choice (I used a small mason jar, though you may find something with a pour spout more useful) and keep it in the fridge. I find it helpful to label it in the refrigerator with the expiration date of the almond/soy/dairy milk printed on it.
