Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 large eggs, at room temperature
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp cardamom
2 tbsps instant espresso powder
1 tbsp vanilla extract
12 oz dark chocolate chips (such as Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Chocolate Chips)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cardamom.
3. In a large bowl, cream together butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until fluffy. Beat in eggs 1 at a time until thoroughly combined. Mix in vanilla extract and espresso powder.
4. In 3 additions, mix the dry ingredients into the butter/sugar mixture until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold in chocolate chips.
5. Drop 1 tbsp sized balls of dough on the prepared cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake in preheated oven until edges of cookies set, about 10-15 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on pan for 2-3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
Note: These cookies spread a lot while baking. If they spread too much, however, you can refrigerate the dough for 30-60 minutes before baking.
