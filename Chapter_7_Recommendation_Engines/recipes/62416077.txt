Ingredients:
2 cups white whole wheat flour (such as King Arthur's)
1 1/2 cups spelt flour (white spelt will make the muffins lighter and "cakier" in texture but you can also use whole spelt)
2/3 cup Sucanat (short for "Sugar Cane Natural", a brand of non-refined dehydrated cane juice that retains its full molasses content)
2 tsps baking soda
1/8 tsp sea salt
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla
1 cup skim milk or buttermilk
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Spray muffin tins with nonstick spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, then whisk in the Sucanat, vanilla, melted coconut oil, milk or buttermilk, and honey.
Pour wet mixture into the dry and stir just until blended.
Gently fold in the blueberries.
Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling about 3/4 full.
Bake for 18-20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack to cool.
