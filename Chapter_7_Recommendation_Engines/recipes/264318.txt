Description: 
Was wanting to find a recipe that used lemon pudding and just couldn't find the right one that suited me, so I came up with this one on a whim. It smelled so yummy and the texture is tender and chewy. It is not overly sweet and the coconut adds a bit of crunch. Please try them and let me know what you think. Store in an airtight container.
