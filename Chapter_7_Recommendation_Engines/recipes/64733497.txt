Ingredients:
1/2 package of bacon

Directions:
Set air fryer to 390 degrees F.
Lay bacon on a single layer inside the air fryer basket (it's ok if there is some overlapping or folding).
Cook for 15 minutes, but flip the bacon about half way through.
Transfer cooked bacon on a paper towel-lined plate to soak up excess grease.
