Ingredients:
4 ripe bananas, mashed
4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
1 cup mixed frozen fruit
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix mashed bananas, oats, frozen fruit, applesauce, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl until well-combined.
Spread mixture evenly on a nonstick jelly roll pan or rimmed baking sheet. Use a thick rolled piece of aluminum foil to block off edges if mixture does not reach all the way across.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 15 minutes. Cut into bars.
