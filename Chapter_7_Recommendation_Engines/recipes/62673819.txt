Ingredients:
1, 10 Lb pork tenderloin.
The Rub:
2 tablespoons ancho chile powder,
2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce or 2 tablespoons chipotle chile powder,
3 tablespoons brown sugar,
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon,
1/4 teaspoon allspice,
1 teaspoon ground red pepper,
3 tablespoons salt,
2 tablespoons garlic powder,
1 tablespoons onion powder,
1 tablespoons ground black pepper,
1/4-1/2 cup oil.
The Brine:
1 cup salt,
1/2 cup light brown sugar,
1 tablespoon black peppercorns,
1.5 teaspoons allspice berries,
1 gallon heavily iced water.

Directions:
Note: I call for a large tenderloin, but you can use on smaller (1 lb) tenderloins.  The only difference being, you don't have to brine the smaller tenderloins (skip steps #2 and #3).
1. Clean loin of silver skin, and other excess fat or connective tissue.
2. Mix brine until salt and suger have desolved (I used a cooler), and insert meat.  If its in a cooler, set aside somewhere cool for 6-12 hours. You may have to add extra ice to keep it cold.  If you are doing this in your refrigerator, and your fridge is huge, you can forgo using the ice.
3. Remove meat from brine liquid, and dry with a towel.
4. Mix dry rub ingredients in a small bowl.  Then slowly mix in oil. You may not need all of the oil, or you may need a little more...just depending on the conditions. You want the rub to be a pasty consistency.
5. Thoroughly cover the meat with rub, and set aside somewhere cool for at least an 1 hr, though longer is better (up to 3 hrs).
6. Preheat oven to 350 F, then preheat grill to scorching hot (500 F).
7. Grill meat on all side until nicely browned.   Remove tenderloin from grill, and transfer to oven. (Note: smaller tenderloins may be fisnished cooking at this point.)
8. Cook in oven to a medium doneness, with an internal temprature of 140-145 F.  Allow meat to rest 10-15 minutes before serving.
FYI, This meal goes especially good with scalloped carrots...but a sweet potatoe dishs work like a charm too.
