Ingredients:
1 sheet Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1 1/2 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese
1 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn, drained
1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 cup Pace® Picante Sauce
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 (5 ounce) package mixed salad greens
Sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Stir the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
Stir the chicken, cheese, corn, bread crumbs and picante sauce in a medium bowl.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 16x12-inch rectangle. With the short side facing you, spoon the chicken mixture onto the bottom half of the pastry sheet to within 1-inch of the edges. Starting at the short side, roll up like a jellyroll. Place the pastry roll seam-side down on a baking sheet.  Tuck the ends under to seal.  Brush with the egg mixture and sprinkle with the parsley. Cut 2-inch slits 2 inches apart on the top.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden. Slice and serve warm on the salad greens with the sour cream, if desired.
