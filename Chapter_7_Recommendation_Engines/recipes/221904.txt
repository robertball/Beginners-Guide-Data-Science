Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package whipped cream cheese with chives
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)
1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 (1 pound) loaf thinly sliced white bread
1 cucumber, thinly sliced
1/4 cup snipped fresh dill leaves, or as needed

Directions:
Mix cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, ranch dressing mix, and dried dill in a bowl until creamy and smooth.
Cut crusts from bread slices; cut sliced bread into decorative shapes (such as rounds or flowers) with cookie cutters. Spread each piece of bread with cream cheese mixture and top with a cucumber slice. Top each canape with a few fresh dill leaves.

Description: 
These easy, beautiful, yummy sandwiches are perfect for brunches, tea parties or spring and summer lunches. Can be prepared ahead of time and assembled just before serving. This is an easy appetizer to prepare the day before, except for the assembly. The cream cheese mixture is actually better after about 8 hours. Feel free to experiment with the dressing; we prefer the buttermilk dressing but ranch or Italian works great, too. Also, cocktail bread can be substituted for the hand-cut bread, which will save 10 to 15 minutes.
