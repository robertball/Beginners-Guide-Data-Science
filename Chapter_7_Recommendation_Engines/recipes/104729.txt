Ingredients:
18 slices Sara Lee® Soft n Smooth™ made with Whole Grain White Bread
3 ounces low-fat cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup shredded Sara Lee® American Cheese
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon light mayonnaise
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup Sara Lee® Honey Ham, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped green onions
Paprika and chives, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly spray 1 3/4x 1-inch miniature muffin pans with vegetable cooking spray.
Press each slice of bread with palm of hand or rolling pin to flatten.  Cut star-shape with a 3-inch star cookie cutter from the center of each bread slice.  Place each star in muffin pan, pressing in center to form a cup.  Bake for 6 to 8 minutes or until lightly browned.
Combine cheeses, mayonnaise, and Worcestershire together in a medium bowl.  Add ham and onions stirring until mixed.  Spoon 1 heaping teaspoonful of ham mixture into each cup.  Bake an additional 4 to 6 minutes or until bread is crisp.  Sprinkle with paprika and garnish with chives, if desired.
