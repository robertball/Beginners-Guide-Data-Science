Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut butter
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 box powder sugar
1 cup melted butter
2 cups dipping chocolate

Directions:
Melt butter and mix with peanut butter, graham cracker crumbs, and powder sugar in a large bowl. Roll into small balls. Put on a cookie sheet lined with foil and put in the freezer for 1 hour. Dip into melted dipping chocolate with a slotted spoon.  When they are hard put in an air tight container, coffee cans works well. Will last a long time in freezer.
