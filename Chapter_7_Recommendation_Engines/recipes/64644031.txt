1 Bunch of Flat Leaf Parsley (rinsed & stems removed)
1 Bunch of Cilantro (rinced & stems removed

1 Shallot (chopped)
5-6 Garlic Cloves (chopped)

1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin
1 1/2 Tsp Sea Salt
1/2 Tsp Fresh Ground Pepper
3/4 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Directions:
To a food processor:
Add lime juice, vinegar, serrano, garlic and shallot pulse until components are fine mince
Add oregano, cumin, salt, pepper
Add parsley and pulse until integrated
Add cilantro and pulse until integrated
While the food processor is running, add olive oil slowly until you reach the consistency you want (I prefer shorter time so you still see pieces of cilantro and parsley)
