Description: 
My grandmother made this pie every year for Thanksgiving. She would make it with a homemade pie crust, but I love it with a graham cracker crust. Either way is great! It's good with any type of pie crust. It's perfect for a very sweet and light dessert. It just melts in your mouth! Enjoy! It does not freeze well.
