Ingredients:
3 links SmithfieldÂ® breakfast sausage
1/4 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 eggs, beaten
2 pita bread rounds
1/2 tomato, chopped
1/2 cup chopped spinach
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place Smithfield(R) breakfast sausage in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, chopping sausage and turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
Cook and stir onion in the same skillet until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Heat olive oil in the skillet. Pour in eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until set, 3 to 5 minutes.
Place pita breads on lined baking sheet. Top with sausage, scrambled eggs, tomato, and spinach. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over toppings.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Serve garnished with avocado slices.
