Title:

Image:

Ingredients:
8oz (250gr) good quality feta cheese
8oz (250gr) Greek full or low fat yoghurt
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1/3 cup good quality olive oil
3-4 hot green peppers
pinch of cayenne
1 mashed clove garlic (optional)
2 tablespoons red sweet pepper paste (optional)

Directions:
Crumble the feta cheese with a fork in a large glass bowl until no large parts remain.
Remove the stems and blitz the hot green peppers in a food processor until a paste is formed.  Add half the paste in the bowl - better safe than sorry.
Add remaining ingredients in the bowl and stir well.
Depending on your taste, add more of the hot pepper paste or the other ingredients.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Normally feta cheese is quite salty so no added salt is needed.  It may need some more olive oil for instance.
If adding the red pepper paste it will have a nice pinkish colour.
Enjoy and tell us how it worked out.

Description: 
This is called tyrokafteri in Greek, a cheesy and spicy spread that is served as an appetizer, similarly to tzatziki.  Very easy to make and you can't go wrong.  Enjoy on toasted bread.
