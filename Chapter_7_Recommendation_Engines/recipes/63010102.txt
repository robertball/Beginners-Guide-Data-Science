Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 cup sour cream
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup white or yellow sweet corn (frozen and defrosted, fresh or canned and drained)
3 green onions, snipped
2 oz chopped pimentos (1/2 a 4 oz jar), drained

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
In a medium bowl, combine the egg, sour cream, milk and butter. Stir in the corn, onions and pimentos.
Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients just until moistened.
Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. (May take 5 minutes longer if your pimentos and corn weren't well drained.)
Serve warm.

Description: 
The original corn bread recipe was wonderful and my family and friends have been enjoying it for a few years now. One day I opted to throw in some left overs I had and a new hit was born. Without adding additional sugar (as some comments have suggested) the result is very sweet and still moist and tender.Modified from: Sweet Corn Bread
