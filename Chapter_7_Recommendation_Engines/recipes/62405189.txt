Ingredients:
4 yukon gold potatoes (one per person)
3-4 garlic cloves (about 1 per potato)
1/8 C olive oil
1/2 T salt
1/2 t pepper
1/2 T fresh or dried rosemary

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425Â°. Slice potatoes from top to bottom without cutting all the way through and slicing as thin as possible. Slice garlic into thin slices and stick between a couple wedges on each potato. Place potatoes on a baking sheet lined in aluminum foil. Liberally brush all over each potato with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, pepper and dried rosemary. If using fresh rosemary, chop and sprinkle over before serving. Pop potatoes in the oven for 45 min. Stick fork into the middle of a wedge of the fattest potato. Potato should give just a little resistance. If not does leave them in another 5-10 min.
