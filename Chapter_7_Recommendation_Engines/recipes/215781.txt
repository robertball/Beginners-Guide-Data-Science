Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
6 bone-in pork chops
1/2 cup apple juice
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon meat tenderizer
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), sliced
1/4 head cabbage, shredded (optional)

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and brown outsides of the pork chops thoroughly, about 5 minutes per side.
Mix together the apple juice, cider vinegar, chicken broth, brown sugar, meat tenderizer, garlic powder, nutmeg, ginger, and black pepper in a slow cooker, stirring until the brown sugar has dissolved. Place the pork chops into the liquid. Top the chops with apple, onion, and cabbage. Set the cooker on Low; cook 4 to 5 hours, turning the chops over in the sauce once or twice. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
A sweet and tangy, affordable and easy recipe. Simple and loaded with veggies. Does not have an overpowering flavor, kid approved. Browning pork chops is an important step, don't skip! I add meat tenderizer to any slow cooker meat, you do not need to add salt, the tenderizer and broth add plenty. Use fresh ground nutmeg! Great with boiled potatoes alongside.
