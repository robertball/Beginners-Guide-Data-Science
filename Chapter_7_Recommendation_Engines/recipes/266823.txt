Ingredients:
2 pounds seedless green grapes, halved
1/2 cup blanched almonds
3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
2 cucumbers, peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), plus more for drizzling
1 pound frozen, peeled cooked shrimp, thawed

Directions:
Combine grapes, almonds, sherry vinegar, lime juice, cilantro, garlic, and salt in batches in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until roughly blended. Add cucumbers and briefly process, leaving some small pieces. Mix in olive oil using a spatula.
Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Taste soup and season with more salt if necessary. Fill small glasses with soup and drizzle with a bit of olive oil. Place 1 cooked shrimp into each glass.

Description: 
This is my go-to appetizer for parties or guests in the summer. I prefer to serve the soup in small shot glasses. If you want it to be vegetarian, just omit the shrimp. It's a mixture between gazpacho and ajoblanco.
