Description: 
The show-stopping recipe will wow holiday guests with two layers of cheesecake, a mirror-like glazed topping, and a crunchy chocolate crust. Pro tip: For the creamiest cheesecake, don't overmix the batter, especially after adding the eggs. Over-beating the eggs can cause the cheesecake to souffle, fall, and crack. Garnish with seasonal fruit such as sugared cranberries, strawberries, etc.
