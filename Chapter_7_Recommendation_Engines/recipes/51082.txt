Ingredients:
1 medium eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
Cooking spray
1/3 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
2 teaspoons olive or vegetable oil
1 cup spaghetti sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Set oven control to broil.  Generously spray both sides of each eggplant slice with cooking spray.  Place on rack in broiler pan.  Broil with tops 4 to 5 inches from heat about 10 minutes, turning once, until tender.
While eggplant is broiling, mix Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs; toss with oil.
Heat spaghetti sauce in 1-quart saucepan over medium heat about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until heated through.  Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.
Sprinkle 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese over eggplant slices.  Spoon bread crumb mixture over cheese.  Broil about 1 minute or until cheese is melted and crumbs are brown.  Top eggplant with spaghetti sauce and remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
