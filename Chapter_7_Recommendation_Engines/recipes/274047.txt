Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package confectioners' coating (such as Wilton® Candy Melts®)
12 marshmallows
1 (7 ounce) package sweetened flaked coconut
1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
12 mint sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)
12 whole cashews

Directions:
Place white confectioners' coating in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
Insert a toothpick into the marshmallows and dip them into the melted white chocolate. Then roll in coconut and place on the mint sandwich cookie. Using kitchen shears, cut a slit and place a cashew where the beak should go. Melt the chocolate chips. Using a toothpick, draw a dot with a line over it on each side of the eagle's head for the eyes.
