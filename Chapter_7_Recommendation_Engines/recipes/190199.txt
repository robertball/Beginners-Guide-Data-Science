Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) packages ziti
1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
1 (6 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
1 pound ready-peeled baby carrots
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 small zucchini, diced
1 (6 ounce) package portobello mushroom caps, diced
1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend
3 (16 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Transfer to a large roasting pan.
Whisk together 1 jar of spaghetti sauce and the ricotta cheese in a large bowl. Add to the pasta and stir.
Place the spinach in the bowl of a food processor; blend until finely chopped; remove and set aside. Then place the carrots in the food processor and process until finely chopped.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chopped carrots in the hot oil until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, portobello mushrooms, button mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until the zucchini is soft, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped spinach, tomatoes, and 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning; drain. Add to the ziti and mix. Sprinkle about 1/2 the bag of the Italian cheese blend over the pasta and stir through. Pour in the 3 remaining jars of spaghetti sauce; stir until the pasta and vegetables are evenly coated. Season with 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix. Cover the pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until completely heated through, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining cheese over the dish. Return dish to oven and bake until the cheese melts and begins to brown, about 10 minutes more.
