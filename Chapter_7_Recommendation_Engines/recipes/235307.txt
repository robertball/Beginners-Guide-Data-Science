Ingredients:
Stock:
1 turkey carcass
1 large onion, halved and skin left on
1 large carrot, roughly chopped
1 stalk celery, roughly chopped
1 head garlic, halved
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 bay leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
water to cover
Soup:
2 large onions, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Combine turkey carcass, halved onion, roughly chopped carrot, roughly chopped celery, halved garlic head, 1 teaspoon rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in a stockpot; pour in enough water to cover. Bring mixture to a boil, cover pot, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors have blended, about 1 hour.
Remove turkey carcass and pull remaining meat from bones; reserve meat and discard carcass. Remove vegetables and bay leaves from stock using a slotted spoon and discard.
Stir diced onions, diced carrots, diced celery, minced garlic, poultry seasoning, 1 teaspoon rosemary, and onion powder into stock; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until vegetables are very tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Add cooked rice and turkey meat to soup; season with salt and pepper. Cook until rice and turkey meat are warmed, about 5 minutes.
