Ingredients:
1/4 cup boiling water
1 chicken bouillon cube
1 egg
1/2 cup pumpkin puree (not the pie filling)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour (plus more for kneading)
1/2 cup nonfat powdered milk
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Dissolve chicken boullion cube in boiling water. Allow to cool slightly.
In a large bowl, beat egg slightly. Mix in pumpkin puree and vegetable oil. Stir in boullion mixture.
Add whole wheat flour, powdered milk, and cinnamon. Mix until well combined. Turn onto floured surface and knead well, about 2 minutes. Add extra flour if dough seems sticky. Dough should be pliable.
Pinch off pieces of dough (about a heaping Tablespoon). Roll each piece of dough into a pencil-thin rope, 12-14 inches long. Form into a pretzel and place on cookie sheet.
Bake 35-45 minutes until very firm. Allow to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. These treats may be frozen  for longer storage.
