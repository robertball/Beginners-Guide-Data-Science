Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, softened
4 hot dog buns or kaiser rolls, split
4 lettuce leaves
1 1/2 pounds cooked and cubed lobster meat
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabascoâ„¢)
2 green onions, chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch dried basil, parsley or tarragon

Directions:
Lightly butter the insides of the buns or rolls and line with lettuce leaves. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lime juice, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper until well blended. Mix in the green onion and celery, then lightly mix in the lobster so it just gets coated without falling apart.
Stuff the lobster filling into the buns and sprinkle parsley, basil or tarragon lightly over the filling.

Description: 
I grew up in Nova Scotia where seafood was cheap.  My Mom and grandmothers had some pretty inventive ways of making lobster 'not-boring!'  Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune.  I've paid over ten dollars for one of these lobster rolls in Cape Cod and it wasn't half as good or half as big as the ones my Mom taught me to make.  This is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy luncheon to impress your friends.  (And no, I don't eat the green stuff in the lobster!)
