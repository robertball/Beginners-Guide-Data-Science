Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 yellow onion, diced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
2 teaspoons za'atar
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1 cup carrot juice
4 cups water
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 cube tomato-flavored bouillon
1 cup red lentils
1/4 cup bulgur
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro (optional)
6 tablespoons sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a stockpot over low heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Cook and stir tomatoes, za'atar, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into onion mixture; stir to coat. Add carrot juice, water, chicken bouillon cube, tomato-flavored bouillon cube, lentils, and bulgur; cook over low heat until lentils are tender and bulgur has absorbed liquid, 30 to 40 minutes.
Ladle about 2/3 the lentil mixture into a blender and puree until smooth. Return puree to stockpot and stir. Simmer over low heat for about 5 more minutes to blend flavors. Remove from heat; stir lemon juice and cilantro into soup. Top individual servings with a dollop of sour cream.

Description: 
This fantastic one-pot recipe is easy and filling. Don't skip the blender step - adding the puree back to the pot with the remaining lentils and bulgur creates a to-die-for combination texture that's both al dente and creamy smooth. Great for a casual home cooked meal but good enough to serve to guests! It's even a hit with kids and people sensitive to spicy foods - just be sure to leave out the cayenne.
