Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup butter
1 egg
3/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Beat egg, orange juice and peel; stir into dry ingredients just until blended. Add the cranberries and walnuts.
Spoon batter into a greased and floured 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 65-70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I created this recipe 14 years ago by combing a couple of recipes from my collection. A friends suggested I add even more cranberries. Now there's a big burst of tart cranberry and lots of crunchy nuts in every piece.                                    --Dawn Lowenstein, Hatboro, Pennsylvania
