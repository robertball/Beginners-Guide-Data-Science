Description: 
Next, she prepares the Speedy Salmon Casserole, which bakes at the same oven temperature as the cake.    'Living here on the Kenai Peninsula, we have plenty of fresh salmon. Bat this creamy, comforting casserole tastes just as good with canned salmon,' she assures.    'It's also a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes--or dress up instant ones.
