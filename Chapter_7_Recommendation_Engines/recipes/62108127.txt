Ingredients:
Peppridge Farm puff pastry sheets, thawed at room temp for about 20 minutes
1/2 lb smoked ham
1/2 lb hard salami
1/2 lb provalone cheese, sliced
1 can tomato paste
1 pinch each oregano, basil, and garlic powder

Directions:
Mix spices into tomato paste and set aside
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Unfold pastry sheets, one at a time, onto a lightly flour sureface and repair any cracks that may form. Gently roll out the sheet to increase its size by about 1/2 an inch on all sides.
Measuring in 1/2 an inch from one side and 1/2 an inch at top and bottom, spread a thin layer of tomato paste on one half of the sheet.
Then layer(2 layers each) alternating between ham, hard salami, and provalone.
Then fold the sheet over, ling up the edges. Press edges gently but firmly to seal. At an angle sheets (three slices evenly spaced is good) to vent.
Bake on a non-stick or very lightly greased baking sheet at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until pastry is golden.
Allow to cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
