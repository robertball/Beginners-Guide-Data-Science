1 Cup halved red  grapes

1+Tbsp. Sugar (to your liking)
1 Cup halved strawberries

Cook pasta according to directions. Rinse and drain well. In medium bowl combine pasta and all of the fruit. Add yogurt and mix gently. refrigerate for one hour. If you plan to serve the salad the next day leave out the strawberries until serving since they tend to break down the yogurt.

This is a great take along recipe, I bring it every year to family cookouts. It is totally different from all the other salads and is very simple to make. You can vary the yogurt flavor and fruit combinations to your liking.
