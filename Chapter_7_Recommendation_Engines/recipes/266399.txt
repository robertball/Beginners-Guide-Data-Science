Ingredients:
⅓ cup vegetable oil, plus more for grill
¼ cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 tablespoon honey
½  lime, juiced
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
4 small heads broccoli, cut into broccoli steaks

Directions:
Whisk together vegetable oil, soy sauce, gochujang, honey, lime juice, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes in a bowl for the sauce.
Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place broccoli steaks onto hot grill, cover, and cook for 2 minutes. Flip and cook for another 2 minutes.
Flip broccoli steaks again and generously brush on sauce, making sure to coat the stems very well. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and brush generously with sauce and cook until stems are still firm, but cooked through, an additional 5 to 7 minutes.
