Ingredients:
Chicken:
4 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 tablespoon cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon adobo seasoning
1/2 lime, juiced
Salsa Verde:
6 tomatillos, husked and chopped, or to taste
3 serrano chiles, stemmed, or to taste
1 onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, peeled, or to taste
1 bunch cilantro
1 tablespoon kosher salt
Soup:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
1 (15.5 ounce) can white hominy, drained

Directions:
Place chicken breasts in a slow cooker; cook on Low until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Shred chicken in a large pot; add cumin, black pepper, adobo seasoning, and lime juice and mix well.
Place tomatillos and serrano peppers in a clear microwave-safe bag. Seal bag and pierce a few times with a knife to vent. Microwave until soft, 4 to 5 minutes.
Put softened tomatillos, serrano peppers, onion, garlic, cilantro, and salt in a blender and blend until salsa verde is smooth.
Mix chicken stock and hominy with shredded chicken in the large pot. Add half of the salsa verde to the shredded chicken.
Simmer over medium heat until flavors are well-mixed, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
One of my favorite casual restaurants in Las Vegas is Chino Latino in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. They have the best Chicken Posole Verde that I tried to duplicate at home. Serve garnished with cilantro, avocado, and lime wedges.
