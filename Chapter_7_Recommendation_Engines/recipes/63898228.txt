Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
8 ounces sour cream
1/2 package (2 Tbs) taco seasoning mix
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt (optional)
1 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup lettuce, finely chopped
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 small tomato, diced
1 can (3 oz) sliced black olives
1 small green bell pepper, finely chopped
2 packages tortilla chips

Directions:
Mix together cream cheese, sour cream and seasonings. Spread on large platter. Top with toppings. Serve on chips.
Note: the original recipe had 1  teaspoon salt and  it was WAY too salty with the garlic salt too. I normally omit the garlic salt.
