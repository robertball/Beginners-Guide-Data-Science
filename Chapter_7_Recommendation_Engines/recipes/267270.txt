Ingredients:
6 ounces bacon, roughly chopped
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
2 cups chicken stock
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 cup water
1 green onion, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper

Directions:
Place bacon in a 2-quart pot. Cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove some bacon grease, as needed, to keep from boiling the bacon. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Add onion to the pot; saute in the remaining bacon grease until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chopped jalapeno; saute until starting to soften, about 2 minutes.
Add the bacon, pinto beans, tomatoes, water, green onion, cilantro, salt, garlic powder, and chipotle to the onion mixture. Bring to a slow boil; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is hot and flavors meld, about 15 minutes.

I got this recipe from a coworker whose wife made borracho beans for a work function. They are easy to make and go great as a side dish with BBQ or Mexican food.
