Ingredients:
4 tsp. Paprika
3 tsp. Rosemary leaves, crushed
2 tsp. Minced garlic
1 tsp. Freshly ground pepper
1 tsp. Salt
4 Tbsp. Olive Oil
4 Chicken Breasts
2 lbs. small red potatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Mix together first six ingredients in a large bowl.  Dip the chicken breasts into the mixture (I leave the bone and skin on the breast) and place onto a large foil lined baking sheet.
Wash and cut the potatoes into approximately 1" cubes (if using the small potatoes, I cut them in half).  Add to the remaining oil/spice mixture and stir to coat.  Add in a single layer onto the same baking sheet as your chicken.
Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until juices run clear.
