Ingredients:
5 large tomatoes diced.  (Can substitute Roma tomatoes, or really any variety for the quantity desired.  When it is tomato season, we like to use a variety of tomatoes.)
1/8 cup red onion, chopped fine (optional)
1 bell pepper (yellow, orange or red), chopped fine
Handful of fresh basil leaves chopped. If you don't have fresh basil on hand, you can use dry...just add it to taste
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
olive oil dizzle (optional)
mozzarella cheese (optional)
French bread

Directions:
Slice french bread into 1/4 inch thing slices.
Toast both sides under broiler, being careful not to burn.  (Optional: drizzle with olive oil before toasting)
Combine the tomatoes, onion, pepper, basil, vinegar and olive oil and blend.  Let sit for 15-30 minutes to let tomatoes marinate.
Top bread with tomato mixture using a slotted spoon so liquid drains away.
Sprinkle cheese on tomato mixture.
Place under broiler (on low) again until cheese melts.
Alternative serving option:
Top toasted french bread with mixture, dip in juices and eat immediately (omit cheese and second broil).

Description: 
This recipe has been modified slightly over time, but is always a winner...whether for an appetizer or main dish.  It even works with winter store bought tomatoes...the vinegar and basil bring out the flavors.
