Description: 
Dessert hummus is a thing, and it is absolutely decadent without all the guilt! Serve with pretzels, strawberries, or graham crackers. Also makes a delicious filling for crepes topped with bananas. You can trick anyone into eating chickpeas when they taste this good! For a deeper color and flavor, use Dutch process cocoa powder.
