Description: 
This recipe was acquired by myself from a friend in 1986.  It is originally from Naples, Italy.  Italian Rice Pie is a tradition for my family on Easter.  When I was young, the week prior to Easter was one full of activity in the kitchen.  My mother and her sisters would prepare all the food in advance which was then laid out on the table Saturday morning.  The local parish priest would come and bless the food for all to enjoy on Easter Sunday after mass!
