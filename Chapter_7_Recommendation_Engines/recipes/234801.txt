Ingredients:
1 small head cabbage
2 cups diced potatoes
1 (16 ounce) package smoked kielbasa sausage, sliced
1 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 slices bread, cut into cubes
1/2 cup butter, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Remove and wash outer leaves from cabbage; line a 13x9-inch baking dish with the leaves to cover the bottom entirely. Shred remaining cabbage.
Mix shredded cabbage, potatoes, and smoked sausage in a bowl; spread atop the cabbage leaves in the baking dish.
Whisk milk, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add bread cubes. Set aside until bread absorbs some liquid, 1 to 2 minutes; pour over the cabbage mixture. Top with butter slices.
Bake in preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes.
