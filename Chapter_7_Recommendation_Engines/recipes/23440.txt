Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked wild rice
1 cup water
1 cup water
3 tablespoons butter
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
1  onion, diced
½ cup chopped celery
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup
2 ⅔ cups milk
1 (14.5 ounce) can sliced carrots
3 tablespoons sliced almonds
5 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons dried parsley

Directions:
Soak rice in 1 cup water for 6 to 8 hours.  Drain.
Bring 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan.  Stir in drained rice.  Boil until water level dips below rice, 10 minutes.  Set aside.
In a medium saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat.  Cook chicken, onion and celery in butter until browned and slightly crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.  Set aside.
In a large pot, combine cream of chicken soup, milk, chicken mixture, carrots, almonds, 5 tablespoons butter and parsley.  Bring to a boil, stirring, then reduce heat to low and stir in rice.  Simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water or milk to thin if needed.  Serve at once.

Description: 
A thick chicken soup that draws raves every time I serve it.  Because of the thickness, it goes great in bread bowls.
