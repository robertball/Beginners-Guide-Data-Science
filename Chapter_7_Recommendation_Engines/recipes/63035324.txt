Ingredients:
1 Quart (946 mL) Heavy Whipping Cream
1/4 Cup powdered sugar
1 tsp- 1 tbsp of Vanilla (to your liking)
1/4-1/2 tsp All Spice (to your liking)
1/4-1/2 tsp Nutmeg (to your liking)
1 Cup of cooked and chilled rice.
1/4-1/2 lb. of Slivered Almonds
1 Whole Almond (cracked from shell)
Maraschino cherries to garnish.

Directions:
Cook rice and set aside in fridge or freezer to chill completely. Be careful not to let it freeze.
In a large bowl or mixer, combine whipping cream, nutmeg, all spice, and vanilla.  Whip until stiff peaks form. Be sure to stop before you see yellow... That is when the mixture is beginning to form butter.  When whipped, set in fridge to chill.
Remove rice when completely chilled and run a fork through it to make sure it is as fluffy as possible with no lumps.  When ready, fold rice and almonds into whipped mixture being sure not to break down the whipping cream.
Serve and eat immediately with a small bowl of cherries for guests to garnish as they like.

Description: 
Even those who hate rice and rice pudding will think twice about this one.  It also makes for an easy game for Christmas and New Year's parties.  The person who finds the whole almond receives a treat/present or simply good luck for the whole year!
