Ingredients:
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon minced shallot
1 small clove garlic, chopped
1 ¾ tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 ⅓ tablespoons toasted pine nuts
¼ cup chopped fresh basil, or more to taste
1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream, divided
1 tablespoon olive oil
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
1 (8 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet and cook and stir shallot and garlic until shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir 1 3/4 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and basil into the hot olive oil, cooking until basil is tender and wilted, about 10 more minutes.
Stir 1 cup cream into basil mixture and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce until it has reduced by 1/3, about 15 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 cup cream into sauce and simmer until thickened again, 15 to 30 more minutes. Stir occasionally.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat and cook chicken until lightly browned outside and no longer pink inside, 10 to 12 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Gently fold cooked pasta and chicken into basil sauce. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This is a pesto cream sauce where you make the pesto ahead and freeze in portions to use for another night. I got this recipe from a restaurant in Green Bay called St. Brenden's. I usually make this on a Saturday afternoon when I have some free time (and freeze it all), but I have made it on a week night and only froze two portions. Triple the pesto ingredients and use one portion tonight; freeze the rest for later.
