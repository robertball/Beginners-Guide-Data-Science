Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup fresh Asian pear juice or puree (optional)*
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2-3 cloves garlic, crushed
1-2 scallions, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
Dash of freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Use sauce to marinate beef short ribs (see Korean Barbecued Short-Ribs for details) or slabs of extra firm tofu (drained and pressed) or tempeh. Place the protein in a shallow dish or zip-top bag and coat evenly with marinade. Marinate for at least 2 hours and up to a day, turning at least once.
*Note: Asian pear juice helps to tenderize meat and also gives the marinade a sweeter flavor. Making 1/4 cup of juice requires about 1/4 to 1/2 of an Asian pear. Use a juicer or blender or finely grate the pear and squeeze to extract the juice.
