Ingredients:
4 cloves Garlic
1/2 Onion, fine dice
1 Lbs Ground Turkey
3 Tbls Blue Cheese
1/2 C Bread Crumbs
3 egg whites
3 tsp Olive Oil
1 1/2 Tbls Soy Sauce
1 Tbls Dried Parsley
1 tsp ground Black Pepper
1 tsp Chili Powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.
Pulse garlic cloves in a food processor until minced. Add onion and jalapeno, and pulse until minced again. Scrape the onion mixture into a large bowl along with the turkey, blue cheese, bread crumbs, egg whites, and olive oil. Season with soy sauce, dried parsley, pepper, and chili powder. Mix well.
Roll the mixture into 2 inch balls, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, and no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes.
