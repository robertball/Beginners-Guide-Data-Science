Ingredients:
18 large fresh mushrooms
1 small onion, chopped
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
dash cayenne pepper

Directions:
Remove stems from mushrooms; set caps aside. Finely chop stems; place in a paper towel and squeeze to remove any liquid. In a skillet, saute chopped mushrooms and onion in butter for 5 minutes or until tender.  Remove from the heat; set aside.
In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pecans, Parmesan cheese, salt, basil and cayenne; add mushroom mixture. Stuff firmly into mushroom caps. Place in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake, uncovered, at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until tender. Serve warm.

Basil, Parmesan cheese and mushroom blend together well, while buttery pecans give these treats a surprising crunch. Our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren always ask for them!
