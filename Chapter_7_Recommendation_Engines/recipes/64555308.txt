Ingredients:
5 medium Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds)
Kosher salt
6 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided
4 green onions, sliced in half lengthwise, thinly sliced crosswise, divided
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
2 cups (packed) shredded savoy cabbage (from about 1/4 large head), divided
1 1/4 cups milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
Freshly ground black pepper
1 scallion, thinly sliced

Directions:
Cover potatoes with water in a small pot; season with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until a paring knife slides easily through the flesh, 30–40 minutes. Drain, let cool slightly, and peel.
Meanwhile, melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add all but 1 Tbsp of onions and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is fragrant and leeks are just beginning to brown around the edges, about 3 minutes longer. Add 1 cup cabbage and cook, stirring constantly, until wilted. Add milk and cream and bring to a simmer.
Add potatoes and remaining 1 cup cabbage, then coarsely mash with a potato masher. Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer colcannon to a large serving bowl. Top with remaining 2 Tbsp. butter and sprinkle with remaining onions.

Description: 
Colcannon traditionally combines mashed potato and cabbage, but there are as many versions as there are cooks in Ireland. This one uses softened and crunchy savoy cabbage, as well as garlic and onions for extra depth
