Ingredients:
4 pork tenderloin cutlets
1 cup sparkling apple cider, or more as needed
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (18 ounce) bottle honey barbecue sauce, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place pork into the bottom of a slow cooker and pour cider over the meat until it is covered. Add brown sugar and cinnamon, making sure they're in the cider and not on the sides of the slow cooker.
Cover and cook on Low until pork shreds easily, 7 to 12 hours.
Transfer pork carefully to a plate or bowl, being careful it doesn't fall apart in the cider. Shred using 2 forks. Stir in barbecue sauce.
