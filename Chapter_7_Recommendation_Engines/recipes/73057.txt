Ingredients:
1/3 cup sesame seeds
1/3 cup raw sunflower seeds
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup chopped almonds
1/3 cup unsweetened flaked coconut
3 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal
1 cup dried cranberries
3 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
7 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium heat, stir together the sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans and almonds. Cook until the sesame seeds are starting to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Add coconut, and stir until sesame seeds are golden. Watch carefully, as they burn easily. Stir in the cranberries and cereal, and remove from heat.
In a large saucepan, combine the peanut butter, butter and marshmallows. Cook and stir over low heat until marshmallows are melted. Pour in the cereal and nut mixture, and stir until evenly coated. Press lightly into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Let stand until cool, then cut into bars. Store in an airtight container, or wrap individually in plastic wrap.
