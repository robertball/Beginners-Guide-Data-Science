Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
1 cup hot water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease two 9 inch round cake pans.
Measure flour, sugar, cocoa, oil, eggs, buttermilk, baking powder, soda, and salt into a mixing bowl.  Dissolve instant coffee in hot water, and add to mixing bowl.  Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes until smooth; batter will be thin.  Pour into prepared pans.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until an inserted wooden pick comes out clean.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes, and  then turn out onto racks to cool completely.
Frost cooled cake with Coffee Icing.  After frosting, melt some semisweet chocolate baking squares or chips in a double boiler.  Drizzle chocolate around top outside edges letting it run down sides, or over top of cake.
