Ingredients:
4 center cut pork chops
1 cup dill pickle juice
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Arrange pork chops in a shallow dish. Cover with pickle juice. Marinate in refrigerator at least one hour, but I recommend from 8 to 24 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Drain pork chops and discard marinade. Cook the pork chops on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Marinate center-cut pork chops in the pickling liquid of store-bought dill pickles: sounds strange, but it's a winner!
