Directions:
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, mustard, dill weed, garlic, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Add tomatoes, kidney beans, tuna, quinoa, basil, and onion; gently stir with a large spoon to coat evenly. Spoon salad into serving bowls; top each with about 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This main dish salad is perfect for lunch or a light dinner. Dill, quinoa, and Parmesan cheese are optional. I make the salad without these, then add them to change things up a bit when we eat the leftovers. Serve by itself or over lettuce.
