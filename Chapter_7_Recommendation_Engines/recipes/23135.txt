Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup quick cooking oats
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the flour, oats, baking soda, cinnamon and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla then stir in the pumpkin puree. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients until well blended. Mix in raisins. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
This recipe looks like it has a lot of ingredients, but it is all stuff a kitchen normally has. It has a nice cinnamony flavor that I adore. You can substitute chocolate chips or nuts for the raisins.
