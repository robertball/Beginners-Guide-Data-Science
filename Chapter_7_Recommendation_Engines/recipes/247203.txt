Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup cold water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
oil for frying

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Stir in cold water and vegetable oil until dough comes together into a ball.
Set dough on a floured surface. Pinch off ten pieces the size of golf balls, roll into balls, and flatten each into a round. Make a small hole in the center of each round.
Fill a deep skillet with oil to 3/4 inch; heat over medium-high heat. Add dough rounds in batches and fry until golden brown, about 20 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels.

Description: 
This crisp and bubbly bread is wonderful for Indian tacos or served as a dessert with powdered sugar or sugar and cinnamon. We put refried beans, Mexican-seasoned ground beef, grated cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, salsa, and sour cream on top to make a great main dish for dinner.
