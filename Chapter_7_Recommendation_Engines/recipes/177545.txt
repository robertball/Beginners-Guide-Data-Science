Ingredients:
1 sheet Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 (7 ounce) bag dried mixed fruit, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup port wine
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
1/3 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it's tender. Stir the fruit and wine in the skillet. Cook for 5 minutes or until all the liquid is evaporated. Let cool completely.
Coat the pork with the flour.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 14-inch square. Cut the pastry sheet into 2 (14x7-inch) rectangles. Spread half of the onion mixture lengthwise on each rectangle. Top each with a pork tenderloin. Brush the edges of the pastry with the egg mixture. Fold the pastry over the filling and press the edges together to seal.  Place seam-side down on the baking sheet. Tuck the ends the pastry rolls under.  Brush the pastry rolls with the egg mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden. Remove the pastry rolls from the baking sheet and let cool for 10 minutes.  Slice and serve warm.
