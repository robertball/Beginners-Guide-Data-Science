Ingredients:
1/2 yellow onion, diced
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 lb of bulk Italian Sausage
1 14.5 oz can of Italian Stewed Tomatoes
6 cups of vegetable stock (I use a homemade mushroom stock for this.)
2 large Russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 14.5 oz can of Cannellini Beans
1 bunch of Kale, torn into bite-size pieces and rinsed
3/4 cup half and half
Kosher Salt
Black Pepper
Freshly grated parmigiano cheese for serving

Directions:
In a heavy, large stock pot over medium high heat, saute the onions for a few minutes.  Add the garlic and saute for 60 seconds.  Add a sprinkling of kosher salt.  Add the sausage and brown it, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula.
Once the sausage is browned, add the tomatoes.  "Cut" them into smaller pieces with the spoon or spatula in the pot.  Add the potatoes and enough stock to cover everything in the pot.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn the heat to medium low and simmer, partially covered, for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.
Add the Beans (undrained, or drained if you prefer) and the Kale.  Simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the Kale has reached your desired texture.  Stir in the half and half, and season with extra salt and pepper if necessary.
Serve with the grated cheese.  Mangia!

Description: 
I couldn't make up my mind, so I combined elements of some of the most famous Italian Sausage soups into one great combination!  I think the Kale makes it.
