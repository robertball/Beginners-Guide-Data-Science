Description: 
My father in law is known for his Sunday Breakfasts.  Homemade sausage, fuffy eggs and tender fried potatoes and onions...yum.  My kids loved spending time at Gramma's and Grampa's farm with the horses and other animals and always came home talking about breakfast- which was normally served well after 11 am!
(I have mixed all the ingredients together and fried right away- tastes great, but don't tell Grampa!)
