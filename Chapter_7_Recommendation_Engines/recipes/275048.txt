Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/8 cup water
1 large egg, separated
1 1/2 teaspoons melted butter
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C). Spray a silicone egg-bite mold with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk flour, sugar, water, egg yolk, butter, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir to combine.
Beat egg white in a small bowl using an electric hand mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Fold into batter. Add batter to the prepared mold using a small hinged ice cream scoop.
Place filled silicone mold into the basket of the air fryer.
Fry in the preheated air fryer for 10 minutes. Remove mold from the basket carefully; pop beignets out and flip over onto a parchment paper round.
Place parchment round with beignets back into the air fryer basket. Cook for an additional 4 minutes. Remove beignets from the air fryer basket and dust with confectioners' sugar.
