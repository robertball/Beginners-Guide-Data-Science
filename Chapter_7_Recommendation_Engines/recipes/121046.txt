Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup oat bran
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
2 eggs
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. In another bowl, beat the eggs, juice, sugars and oil. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in bananas and nuts. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.
