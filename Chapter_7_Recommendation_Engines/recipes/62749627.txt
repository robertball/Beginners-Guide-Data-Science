Ingredients:
1 bottle (4/5 quart) red, dry wine
1 C sugar
1 C Barcardi Gold (dark Puerto Rican rum)
1 C orange juice
1/2 C lime juice
1 can (16 oz) sliced peaches in heavy syrup

Directions:
In a large pot, over low heat, mix thoroughly red, dry wine and sugar until sugar dissolves.  Use any dark, red wine but do not use sangria wine.  Turn off heat.
Add rum, orange juice, and lime juice.  Stir.  Pour into a glass pitcher, first peaches, then wine. Set in refrigerator for a few hours.  Mix and serve over ice. Garnish with orange or lime wedges.
Use 1/2 C rum if this is your first batch as this recipe is as strong as it is sweet!

Description: 
This recipe from Puerto Rican Cookery, Carmen Aboy Valldejuli, is one I've used for twenty years.  It's full-proof and has impressed all my friends and neighbors.  I've traveled around the world (savoring sangria)... this is by far the tastiest recipe.
