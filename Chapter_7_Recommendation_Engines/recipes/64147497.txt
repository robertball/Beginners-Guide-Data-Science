Ingredients:
8 cups chopped seeded peeled zucchini (from about 3 pounds)
2/3 cup lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
CRUST:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/3 cups sugar
1 cup cold butter, cubed
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
2/3 cup oatmeal

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, cook and stir zucchini and lemon juice for 20-25 minutes or until zucchini is tender. Add the sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg; cook 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat; set aside.
For crust, combine the flour and sugar in a bowl; cut in butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Press 2/3 of crust mixture into a greased 13 x 9 baking pan. Spread zucchini over top; mix oatmeal with remaining crust mixture and crumble over zucchini. Sprinkle with cinnamon and ginger.
Bake at 375Â° for 40-45 minutes or until golden and bubbly.
