Ingredients:
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 teaspoons olive oil
6 slices white American cheese
6 slices white bread

Directions:
Preheat the oven's broiler. In a medium bowl, toss together the tomatoes, onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper.
Place the slices of bread on a baking sheet, and place under the broiler. Broil for about 2 minutes, just until lightly toasted. Remove from the oven, and turn the bread untoasted side up. Place a handful of the vegetable mixture on top of each slice. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil, then top with a slice of cheese.
Return the bread slices to the broiler, and cook until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately.

Open faced cheese sandwiches with peppers, tomato and onion. This is a favorite at our Campground. We used to call them Gay Headers! My kids ask for it at home as well.
