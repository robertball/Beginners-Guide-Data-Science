1 (8 ounce) package grated Parmesan cheese
2 large egg yolks

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg yolks, jalapeno peppers, hot sauce, and garlic powder in a bowl. Mix to form a paste. Shape into balls and roll in bread crumbs until breading is about 1/4 inch thick. Place balls on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm or freeze in a resealable plastic bag for later.
