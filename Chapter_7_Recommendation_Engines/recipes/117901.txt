Ingredients:
2 tablespoons paprika
2 teaspoons onion salt
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme
6 (6 ounce) beef tenderloin steaks (1 1/2 inches thick)

Directions:
Combine the seasonings; rub over steaks. Grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 9-11 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).

Description: 
I adapted this recipe from a seasoning I saw for blackened catfish. Because these steaks have a lot of kick, I make a more mellow side dish, like buttered potatoes or grilled fresh vegetables.       --Vera Kobiako, Jupiter, Florida
