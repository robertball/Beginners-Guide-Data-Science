Ingredients:
1/2 pound diced peeled potatoes
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/3 cup milk

Directions:
Place potatoes and garlic cloves in a saucepan. Add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer until tender. Drain well. Mash potatoes and garlic with butter, salt and pepper. In a bowl, combine flour and baking powder; stir in potato mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk and stir well. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-in. biscuit cutter. Place 1 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

Description: 
We grow our own potatoes and garlic, so these delectable biscuits are on our table often. I make biscuits a lot because they're quicker and easier than rolls.
