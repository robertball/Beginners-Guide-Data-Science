Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut cream, chilled
1 (14.5 ounce) package frozen ube (purple yam)

1 tablespoon light agave syrup

Directions:
Pour coconut cream into a high-speed blender (such as Vitamix(R)). Add ube, blueberries, and agave syrup. Cover and blend for about 1 minute, starting at Variable 1 and slowly increasing to the highest speed. Use the tamper to press the ingredients toward the blades.
Serve immediately for a soft-serve consistency. Store in the freezer for a firmer consistency.
