Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, minced
¼ cup finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
¼ cup vodka
1 tablespoon tomato paste
¾ cup chicken broth
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley
1 ½ cups sour cream
¼ cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, and cook until browned on both sides and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes; place into a 9x13 inch baking dish and set aside.
Reduce the heat to medium, and melt the remaining butter in the pan. Stir in the garlic, and onion, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly until the onion has begun to soften. Stir in the flour, and continue cooking 5 minutes more. Add the vodka, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring constantly. Allow to simmer for 2 minutes, then stir in the tomato paste, chicken broth, salt, pepper, parsley, sour cream, and feta cheese. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 20 to 30 minutes stirring frequently.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the hot sauce over the chicken breasts, and bake in preheated oven until the top has browned, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for anytime-but it's especially great for those of us who like to cook several meals on the weekend in preparation for a busy week. You can make this half way and then thaw and finish mid week... it's great.
