Ingredients:
1 pound mild or hot sausage, removed from casings
1 medium onion, chopped fairly small
6 cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 32oz. carton chicken broth
1 14oz. can chicken broth
1 pound frozen cheese tortellini
1 14oz. can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 10oz. bag fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
10 fresh basil leaves, chopped, or 3/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste, optional
Salt and pepper to taste, optional
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a large pot, saute sausage and onion over medium low heat until onion is soft, breaking up the sausage as it cooks.
Add garlic and saute 1 to 2 more minutes. Pour in carton and can of chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add frozen tortellini and cook for 5 minutes.
Add tomatoes (with the juice). Bring to a boil again, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir in spinach (it will look like too much, but it will wilt quickly), basil and pepper flakes, if using. Simmer 5 minutes more. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.
Pass the Parmesan at the table.

I got a similar recipe to this out of my local newspaper a long time ago. I've tweaked the recipe quite a bit over the years to suit our tastes. I hope it suits yours as well. Enjoy!
