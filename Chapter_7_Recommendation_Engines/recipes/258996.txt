Ingredients:
1 cup salted butter, softened
1/4 cup honey
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Combine butter, honey, and vanilla extract in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Mix in flour 1/2 cup at a time. Stir walnuts into the dough.
Form dough into 1-inch balls. Arrange on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until very light golden, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool briefly, about 5 minutes.
Pour confectioner's sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll warm cookies in confectioners' sugar to coat.

Description: 
This is a recipe my mother got from her mother. It's a family favorite at Christmas, and very easy to make. It has few ingredients, so the flavor of the honey really comes through.
