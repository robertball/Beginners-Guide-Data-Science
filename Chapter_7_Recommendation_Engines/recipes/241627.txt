Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ranch dressing mix
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 1/2 cups fat-free milk
cooking spray
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook uncovered until tender but still firm to the bite, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk flour, ranch dressing mix, and white pepper into butter until a paste-like consistency is reached. Pour milk into butter mixture; cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is thick and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes.
Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot skillet until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer 1/2 of the onion mixture to a plate and return skillet to heat.
Stir mushrooms into skillet with remaining onion mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir mushroom mixture, green beans, and sauce together in a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Stir reserved onion mixture and bread crumbs together in a bowl; sprinkle over green bean mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe calls for fresh green beans and mushrooms. Although a little more work than traditional green bean casseroles it is well worth the extra effort. It is also lower in fats and sodium as the fried onion rings are replaced by whole wheat topper. It is also great for people on diabetic diets. You can substitute wheat bread crumbs for the panko bread crumbs, if desired.
