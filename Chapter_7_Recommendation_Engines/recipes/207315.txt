Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup quick cooking oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
3/4 cup canned pumpkin
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Stir together flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate large bowl, lightly beat together the milk, egg, pumpkin, and oil. Stir flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture, blending just until moistened.
Heat a lightly greased griddle over medium high heat.
Pour batter, 1/3 cup at a time, onto the prepared griddle. Make a jack-o-lantern face in each pancake with the chocolate chips. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
These make a special breakfast on cool fall mornings.  My boys loved to help me cook a batch up for a 'breakfast for supper' night around Halloween.  Use any and all decorations you like to make jack-o-lantern faces on the pancakes. Try broken candy bar pieces, banana slices, raisins, crasins, or chopped nuts.
