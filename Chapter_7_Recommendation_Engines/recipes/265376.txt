Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 Vidalia onions, sliced, or more as needed
1 stick butter, sliced into pats

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Slice potatoes carefully through a long side, almost to the bottom but not through, to create even, fan-like cuts.
Pull slices apart gently and sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper. Place onion and butter slices between potato slices. Wrap each potato in heavy-duty aluminum foil and seal well.
Bake on the preheated grill until soft, turning occasionally, about 1 hour. Remove from grill and let sit 10 minutes before unwrapping.
