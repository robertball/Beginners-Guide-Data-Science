Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds extra lean ground beef
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break up ground beef in a medium bowl. Sprinkle salt and pepper over meat and toss lightly to distribute seasoning. Divide meat into 4 portions and press into 1-inch thick patties.
Place burgers in hot pan; cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Turn burgers and continue to cook 3 minutes for medium and 4 minutes for medium well. Transfer to a plate and cover and keep warm.
Combine vinegar and broth; pour into empty skillet; simmer until reduced by half. Set burgers on each plate, and spoon a portion of sauce over each and serve immediately.
