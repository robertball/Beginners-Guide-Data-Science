Ingredients:
2 chicken breast halves (about 4-5 oz. each)
1 Tbsp. honey
2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar
2 cloves smashed garlic
1/4 cup breadcrumbs
1/4 cup chopped pecans
salt and pepper

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the honey, balsamic vinegar and garlic together. Add the chicken and rub in the marinade. Allow to marinate for about 20-30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375. On a plate, combine the bread crumbs and pecans. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and then dredge in the breadcrumb/pecan mixture.
Place a wire rack on a cooking sheet and spray with oil. Place the chicken on top and spray the top with a little cooking oil. Bake for about 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
