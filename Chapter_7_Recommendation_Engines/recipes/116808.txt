Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 1/3 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
ICING:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons milk

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, butter, eggs, sugar, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down; turn onto a floured surface. Divide into four portions. Roll each portion into a 12-in. x 8-in. rectangle. In a mixing bowl, cream the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread over each rectangle to within 1/2 in. of edges. Sprinkle with pecans. Roll up each jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal.
Place each roll seam side down in a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan; pinch ends together to form a ring. With scissors, cut from an outside edge two-thirds of the way toward center of ring at 1-in. intervals. Separate strips slightly; twist to allow filling to show, slightly overlapping previous strip.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over coffee cakes. May be frozen for up to 2 months.
