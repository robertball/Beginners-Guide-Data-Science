Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground lamb
1 egg
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 hamburger buns

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix the lamb, egg, oregano, sherry, vinegar, red pepper flakes, garlic, green onions, mint, cilantro, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper together in a mixing bowl with your hands until evenly blended. Form into five patties.
Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve on buns.
