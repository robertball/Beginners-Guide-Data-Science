Ingredients:
7 cups whole milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place milk, cream, and vinegar in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil; simmer until curds form, about 2 minutes. Stir in salt and pour mixture through a cheesecloth over a bowl. Let it sit between 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how thick you want your ricotta to be.
