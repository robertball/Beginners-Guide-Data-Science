Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 cup sliced green onion
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
6 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
2 pounds fresh medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
3 cups hot cooked rice
9 sprigs fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Combine vegetable oil and flour in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook, stirring often, until roux is dark brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir onion, celery, green onion, parsley, and garlic carefully into the hot roux; it may splatter. Cook and stir until onion mixture is tender, about 5 minutes. Pour in broth. Season with salt and red chile pepper. Simmer gumbo, covered, until flavors combine, about 15 minutes.
Stir shrimp into the stockpot; cook until pink and opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.
Place 1/3 cup rice into each serving bowl. Ladle shrimp gumbo on top. Garnish with fresh parsley.
