Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 1/3 cups rainbow rotini pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 bell pepper, diced
1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (24 ounce) jar low-sodium spaghetti sauce
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 small eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 zucchini, cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 7x11-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until cooked but not quite all the way done, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add bell pepper, onion, celery, and garlic and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until all of the vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in spaghetti sauce, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning; remove from heat.
Combine drained rotini, sauce mixture, eggplant, and zucchini in the prepared baking pan. Mix well and top with shredded cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and cheese is melted, 30 to 45 minutes.
