Ingredients:
1 lb cultured butter
1 cup icing sugar
1 cup cornstarch
4 cups flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp vanilla
red and green glazed cherries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F.
Whip the softened butter until light and fluffy. Add the icing sugar, cornstarch and vanilla and whip until well incorporated. If using a stand up mixer, switch to a paddle blade and knead in the flour, one cup at a time at very slow speed until the mixture comes together into a very soft dough. The dough should feel moist but not sticky.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into 1/4" thickness. Use a cookie cutter to cut out desired shapes. Use a butter knife to lift the cookies from the counter onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake for 7 minutes.
Cut up each cherry into small pieces for decoration - one cherry should yield at least 10 pieces.
Remove the cookies from the oven and place a piece of cherry in the middle of each cookie - more cherries if the cookies are larger.  Return the cookies to the oven and bake for an additional 5 minutes. The cookies will be much lighter and tender if you don't allow them to brown.
Cool the cookies on the trays for 10 minutes. Enjoy!
