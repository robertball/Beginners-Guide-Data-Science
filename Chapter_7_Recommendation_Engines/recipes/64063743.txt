Ingredients:
3/4 cups sugar
1 cup butter at room temperature
2 eggs
3 cups flour
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. grated lemon rind
Raspberry jam
Powdered sugar

Directions:
Cream sugar and butter until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Add to egg mixture with lemon rind, mixing until dough holds together. (If dough appears too sticky, wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate until easy to handle.)
Roll out dough 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick on lightly floured cloth-covered board or waxed paper. Cut in 3 inch heart shapes. With a smaller heart-shape cutter, cut centers out of half of the heart.
Bake in preheated 375 degree oven 12 to 15 minutes or until light brown around edges. Cut-out hearts will bake faster.)Cool.
Spread each uncut heart with jam. Generously sprinkle cut out hearts with powdered sugar. Place on top of uncut hearts, lightly pressing together.
