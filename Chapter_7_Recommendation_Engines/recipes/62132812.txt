Ingredients:
1 pkg. Boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins (cubed)
1 tsp. olive oil
1 16 oz. box fettucini pasta
1 pt. heavy whipping cream
1 8 oz. container grated parmesan cheese
3-4 garlic cloves (minced)
salt to taste

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package instructions.
Drain and set aside.
Season the chicken with salt to taste.
Brown the chicken in a heated skillet with olive oil on medium heat till cooked through.
Add minced garlic during the last two minutes of the chicken's cooking time.
Once cooked, add chicken to drained pasta.
While the chicken is cooking, in a small sauce pan, heat the whipping cream and parmesan cheese on medium low heat till heated through.  You can add more or less cheese according to taste.
You may want to use a whisk to add the cheese in the cream, as it may remain lumpy.
Mix cheese sauce in with the pasta and chicken.
Enjoy.

Description: 
This is a delicious and incredibly fast recipe to make when you don't have much time to prepare dinner.  I like to make my own cheese sauce because, in my opinion, it tastes much better than the ones you buy in a jar from the grocery store. Serve this with some garlic rolls and salad and it just completes this wonderful dish.
