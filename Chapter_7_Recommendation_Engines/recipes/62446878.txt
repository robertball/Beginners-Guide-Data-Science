Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
6 ounces semi-cured Greek pork sausages
or sweet Italian sausages, cut into 1" pieces
Kosher salt, to taste
8 ounces pasta, preferably garganelli or penne
1/2 cup white wine
1/2 ounce blue cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup loosely packed fresh oregano leaves
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
1. Heat oil in a 12" skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 7 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, bring a 4-qt. pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes. Strain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta cooking liquid; set aside.
3. Add wine to sausages and cook until reduced by one quarter, about 2 minutes. Add the blue cheese, cream, and oregano and cook until the mixture is thick and the cheese has melted, about 2 minutes. Stir in reserved pasta and season with salt. (If sauce seems too thick, stir in some of the reserved pasta cooking liquid.) Transfer pasta to a small platter; garnish with grated cheese and season with black pepper.

In this dish from Epirus, pork sausage, blue cheese, and fresh oregano are a gorgeous counterpoint to pasta.
