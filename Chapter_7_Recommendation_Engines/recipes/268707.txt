Ingredients:
1 (40 ounce) can Bruce's Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in Syrup, drained
1/4 cup salted butter, melted
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple (optional)
1 cup crushed cornflake crumbs
2 tablespoons salted butter, melted
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 cup mini marshmallows

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Use an electric mixer to whip the sweet potatoes with 1/4 cup butter, eggs, and egg yolk until smooth and creamy. Add in the pineapple if using, then transfer the mixture into a 6-cup casserole dish.
Stir together the cornflake crumbs with 2 tablespoons of butter and brown sugar. Alternating in rows, spoon the cornflake crumbs across the top of casserole at a diagonal, followed by a row of marshmallows. Repeat until you have 5 rows of the cornflakes and 4 rows of the marshmallows.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until marshmallows have turned golden brown.
