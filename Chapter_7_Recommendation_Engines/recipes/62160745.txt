Ingredients:
7 1/2 cups rolled oats (preferably extra thick cut)
1 c. sweetened shredded coconut
1 c. pumpkin seeds
1 c. broken walnuts
1 c. broken pecans
1 c. sunflower seeds
1 c. slivered almonds
1 1/2 cups oat bran
1 1/2 cups wheat germ
2 tsp. kosher salt
2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup coconut oil
1/2 c. maple syrup
1/2 c. honey
2 tsp. vanilla
2 cups dried fruit (craisins and/or raisins)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment or aluminum foil. In a large bowl combine oats, and next eight ingredients.  Put salt and cinnamon into a sauce pan. Stir in the oils until blended. Then add the maple syrup and honey. Heat over medium high heat until well blended and hot. Do not let mixture boil. Remove from heat and pour over dry ingredients in bowl. Stir well to thoroughly coat the dry ingredients. Spread mixture on the prepared baking sheets (do not pack down). Place in preheated oven. After 15 minutes remove from oven, stir and return to oven. After another 15 minutes, again remove from oven, stir and return to oven. Time for an additional 15 minutes then remove from oven and allow to cool without stirring. Once granola is cooled to room temperature, return to large bowl and stir in the dried fruit of your choice.

Description: 
I've been making this granola for more than a year. I often get requests for the recipe. It's loaded with a variety of nuts and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. An excellent choice for topping yogurt or ice cream.
