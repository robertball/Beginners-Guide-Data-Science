Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
6oz can of tomato paste
13.5oz can of coconut milk
1 small onion, chopped (about one cup)
2 cups of frozen peas
14.5oz can of tomato sauce (about 1 3/4 cup)
2 large cloves of garlic, minced
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Directions:
In a bowl, combine tomato sauce, garlic, honey, and seasonings. Set aside.
Add the rest of the ingredients to your slow cooker. Cover with the tomato sauce/seasoning mixture.
Cook on low 8 hours.
To Freeze and Cook Later
Combine all of the ingredients in a gallon-sized freezer bag and freeze for up to three months. When ready to cook, thaw overnight in your refrigerator and cook in your slow cooker for 8 hours on low. Since the Slow Cooker Chicken Curry cooks for the first time in your slow cooker, it wonâ€™t taste like leftovers!
Top with fresh cilantro and serve with pita bread, naan, or rice.
