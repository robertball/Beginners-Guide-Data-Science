Ingredients:
8 Tomatillos
1 Serrano Pepper (Omit to make less spicy)
1 Jalapeno Pepper
½ Medium Yellow Onion
3 Garlic Cloves
½ Cup Cilantro
1 Fresh Squeezed Lime Juice
1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt (or fresh cracked Salt)
1/2 Tablespoon fresh cracked Pepper
1 Cup Water

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to broil on high.
Spray baking sheet with non fat cooking spray.
Remove husk from tomatillos and rinse to clean.
Cut tomatillos in half and place cut side down on the baking sheet.
Rinse jalapeno & serrano pepper and put on baking sheet.
Cut onion into ¼ pieces and put on baking sheet.
Put garlic on baking sheet. Do not remove the shell.
Broil for about 20 minutes, turning the peppers once.
Once tomatoes and peppers are charred, remove from oven and let cool.
Once cooled, remove stems from peppers and peel garlic. Remove the seeds of the serrano to make less spicy.
Add peppers, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and onions to a food processor and pulse.
Store in airtight container in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. The longer the salsa is stored in the refrigerator the better.
Note:  Salsa can last up to 7 days in the refrigerator.
