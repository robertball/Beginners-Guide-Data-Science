Ingredients:
1 (23 ounce) Smithfield® Garlic & Herb Seasoned Pork Sirloin
1 cup shredded provolone cheese, or as needed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
4 bakery sub rolls

Directions:
Place the meat into a slow cooker with enough water just to cover the top. Cook on med/low for 6 hours (or high for 4 hours). (You can also cook it on a low oven temp., the same way, if you prefer.)
Shred the meat gently with a fork and fill up your rolls.
Top them with cheese and some oregano (or any spices you like). Bake them on a sheet pan with a sprinkling of spices, at 350 degrees just until the cheese is melted and the subs are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Serve them up nice and warm.
