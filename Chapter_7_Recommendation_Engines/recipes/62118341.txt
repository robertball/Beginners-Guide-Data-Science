Ingredients:
1,5 kg plain yoghurt (use yoghurt from goats milk if you like)
2 tsp salt
2 cheese cloths
2 bay leaves
3 twigs fresh thyme
2 twigs fresh oregano
500 ml olive oil

Directions:
In a bowl mix yoghurt and salt.
Put both cheese cloths in a collander (so you have a double layer)and pour yoghurt in the middle.
Lift egdes of the cloth and tie a tight knot over the cream cheese mixture.
Hang the bundle over a bowl in the refrigerator.
Leave there for three days (when the yoghurt has drained it has the consistency of ricotta cheese).
Put the cream cheese in a bowl. Using a tablespoon form small balls of cream cheese and put them on a plate.
Cover and put in fridge for three hours.
Put cheeseballs, thyme and oregano in a clean bottling jar.
Fill up with olive oil.
Close the bottling jar air tight. Keep in the fridge.
Wait a few days for the herbs to infuse the oil and the cheese with flavor. You can keep it in the fridge for up to one week.
Serve at room temperature.
You can really get creative with this recipe. For example use fesh whole chilli instead of the herbs.
