Ingredients:
~fine sea salt
~1/2 pound green beans, trimmed
~10 medium asparagus spears, trimmed
~4 tablespoons unsalted butter
~1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon pine nuts
~1/3 cup finely chopped shallot
~3/4 cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano or Grana Pandano cheese plus more for serving
~1 large egg
~3 large egg yolks
~2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
~freshly ground black pepper
~1 pound fresh macceroni alla chitarra, or dried chittara pasta (available at some supermarkets and specialty stores)

Directions:
1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.. Add green beans and cook 2 minutes, then add asparagus; continue cooking until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes more. Using a fine-mes sieve, remove vegetables from water (reserve water); run under cold water to stop cooking. Cut asparagus in half crosswise, then quater lengthwise.
2)  In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat; add pine nuts, shallot and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 minute, then add beans and aspargus, stir to combine and remove from heat.
3) In a small bowl, whisk together cheese, egg, egg yolks, parsley and a generous grinding of pepper.
4) Return vegetable cooking water to a boil. Add pasta and cookuntil just tender, 2 to 3 minutes (if using drie pasta, cook until al dente.) Drain and transfer to a large serving bowl; immediately add vegetable mixture and toss to combine, then add egg mixture and toss well to coat strands. Serve immediately, passing extra cheese and pepper at the table.
