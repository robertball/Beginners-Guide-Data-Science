Ingredients:
Curry Paste:
8 shallots, roughly chopped
6 hot chile peppers, roughly chopped
8 stalks lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped almonds, or to taste
1 small bunch fresh cilantro, roughly chopped
8 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 tablespoons peanut oil
Chicken Curry:
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon peanut oil, or more as needed
1 onion, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 orange bell pepper, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 cup halved snow peas
1 large carrot, cut into matchsticks
2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine shallots, chile peppers, lemongrass, almonds, cilantro, garlic, ginger, and 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a food processor; pulse into a smooth paste. Measure out 1 cup of paste into a large bowl. Add chicken thighs and mix until thoroughly coated.
Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken in batches until cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large plate using a slotted spoon; set aside.
Place onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper, and carrot in the same skillet. Cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add snow peas; cook and stir until slightly softened but still crisp, about 1 minute.
Return chicken to the skillet. Stir in coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Simmer until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This spicy and delicious recipe is absolutely incredible. It is so tasty but not recommended for youngsters. I recommend this recipe to impress visitors or your family. Serve with JasmatiÂ® rice topped with cilantro.
