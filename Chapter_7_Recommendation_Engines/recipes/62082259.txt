Ingredients:
1-lb. bag mini peeled carrots (cut in half if desired)
3 Tablespoons unsalted butter
3 Tablespoons orange marmalade
1/3 cup Grand Marnier
1-2 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
1. Melt the butter in a large skillet over med-high heat; add carrots and toss to coat with the butter.
2. Add the marmalade and stir until it is melted.
3. Pour in the Grand Marnier, bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Uncover the carrots and cook until liquid has been reduced to a glaze ~ about 5 more minutes - if not cut in half, you may need to cook an additional 5 minutes.
5. Sprinkle with parsley.

I make this for the family for holidays - very easy & quick and you can make ahead for pot lucks.  Typical sweet glazed carrots, but the Grand Marnier adds a bit of a kick to it!
