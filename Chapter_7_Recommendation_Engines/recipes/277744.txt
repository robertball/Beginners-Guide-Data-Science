Ingredients:
1 (12 count) package Hawaiian bread rolls (such as King'sÂ®)
1/2 cup marinara sauce
8 ounces grated mozzarella cheese
3 Roma tomatoes, sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 cloves roasted garlic, finely minced
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
Cut the rolls in half. Set the bottom halves into the bottom of the prepared pan and spread with marinara sauce. Place a layer of mozzarella cheese over the marinara and add a layer of tomatoes over the cheese. Spread basil over the tomatoes and add the top halves of the rolls.
Combine melted butter, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; stir to combine. Brush over the tops of the sliders.
Bake in the preheated oven until the insides are gooey and the tops are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
