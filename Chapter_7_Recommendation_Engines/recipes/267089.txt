Ingredients:
6 pounds pumpkin with fairly straight sides
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, diced
2 large stalks celery, diced
1/2 medium green bell pepper, diced
2 pounds mozzarella cheese, cubed
16 ounces tomato sauce
1 1/2 cups water
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn, drained
6 large mushrooms, sliced
3/4 cup instant rice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil.
Wash the pumpkin and cut off the top at an angle to form a lid that won't fall through. Clean out and discard seeds and string.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, oregano, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper; cook 3 minutes. Add mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, water, corn, mushrooms, and instant rice. Stir well.
Pour mixture from the skillet into the pumpkin and replace lid.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour. When serving, scrape the insides of the pumpkin to get some of the soft flesh in each bowl.

Description: 
I am not sure where this recipe originated, but it has been a Halloween tradition in my husband's family for at least 20 years. It is a dinner we look forward to all year. Served with cornbread or sourdough rolls. Yum!
