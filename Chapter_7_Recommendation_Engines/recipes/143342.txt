Description: 
My husband and I are trying to add more variety to our diets, and cut back on red meat, so I came up with this ground chicken burger, and it is delish! I used my George Foreman grill to cook them. I served them with the spicy baked sweet potato fries found on this Website. They make a nice substitution for a regular cheeseburger and French fries.
