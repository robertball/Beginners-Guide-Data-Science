Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
6 cups Butterball® Chicken Broth, divided
2 cups chopped leftover cooked Butterball® Turkey
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained, thinly sliced
8 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained, cut into thin strips
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley or basil leaves (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion; cook and stir 5 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in rice; cook and stir 3 minutes, or until rice is golden.  Stir in 1/2 cup of the broth.  Cook and stir constantly 2 minutes, or until broth has been absorbed.  Continue to cook and stir constantly, adding another 3-1/2 cups of the broth, 1/2 cup at a time, until completely absorbed.
Stir in turkey, artichokes and tomatoes.  Continue adding enough broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until absorbed and rice is tender, but slightly firm in the center.  Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese, salt and pepper.
Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese and parsley, if desired.
