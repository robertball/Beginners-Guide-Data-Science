Ingredients:
1 pie shell (chocolate crumb, nilla wafer, or nutter butter work best)
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
4 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 small package non-instant vanilla pudding mix
1 3/4 cups milk
4 peanut butter cups, chopped up

Directions:
Melt the chocolate with the whipping cream.  Stir until smooth, and spread evenly over the bottom of the pie shell.  Refrigerate until ready to fill; chocolate should be firm before filling.
Put the dry pudding mix and peanut butter in a heavy saucepan.  Over low heat, gradually stir in the milk using a wire whisk.  Stir constantly until mixture thickens and comes to a slow boil.  Cool for 15 minutes, stirring often.  Pour peanut butter filling into crust.  Chill several hours.
Top with chopped peanut butter cups.
