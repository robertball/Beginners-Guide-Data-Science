Ingredients:
1 pound tomatillos, husked and quartered
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro leaves
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
1 jalapeno pepper (with seeds)
6 tablespoons lime juice
1/3 cup canola oil
4 green onions, finely chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
1 avocado, peeled, pitted and diced
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 can black beans (14.5 ounce), rinsed and drained
1/2 cup frozen petite white corn, cooked and cooled
1/2 head green cabbage, cored, shredded and chopped
5 large romaine leaves, chopped
4 cups rotisserie chicken, cubed (about 1 to 1/2 pounds)
1 red bell pepper, chopped
6 ounces sharp cheddar cheese
Tortilla chips (optional)

Directions:
1.  In a medium to large bowl of a food processor puree the tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, jalapeno pepper, and 5 tablespoons of lime juice.
2.  Pour into a medium bowl and whisk in oil and green onions.  Season with salt and pepper and set salsa verde dressing aside.
3.  In a separate bowl combine 1 tablespoon lime juice with diced avocado, corn, and black beans.  Set aside.
4.  In a large salad bowl combine chopped green cabbage, chopped romaine, and chopped red bell pepper.  Add avocado mixture and cheddar cheese and lightly toss.
5.  Toss with enough dressing to coat.  Serve with tortilla chips (that may be added to individual salads.)

Description: 
I've tried many Southwest Chicken salads both with a salsa verde and without.  I combined several recipes to arrive at the one below.  If you leave the chicken out, this salad could be served as a side salad for a Southwest or Mexican themed get-together.
