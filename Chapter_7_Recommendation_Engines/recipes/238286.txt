Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup flaked coconut

1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a work surface with waxed paper.
Stir oats, cocoa powder, and coconut together in a large bowl.
Whisk sugar, milk, and butter together in a nonstick pot; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir vanilla extract into butter mixture.
Stir oat mixture into butter mixture until well-combined. Drop mixture by the spoonful onto waxed paper and let sit until set, at least 15 minutes.

Description: 
Peanut-free! These no-bake chocolate macaroons are also known as 'Frogs and Haystacks.' My mother has been making these since before I was born; she passed this down to me. There are many no-bake cookies out there, but I like these best. Store in an airtight container in a cool spot. These can be frozen.
