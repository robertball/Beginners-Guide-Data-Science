Description: 
Although described as a summer time staple dessert in Germany ... takes advantage of the fresh berries of the season.  Served with a vanilla sauce, I grew up seeing it made with rhubarb as the primary ingredient. A versatile recipe. Can be served with whipped cream or ice cream. Eaten hot or cold.
