Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup flour
2 cups sugar
3/4 cup cocoa powder
2 t baking soda
1 t baking powder
1 t kosher salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 extra large eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 t vanilla
1 cup hot coffee

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Butter 2 8-inch round cake pans. Line with parchment paper, then butter and flour the pans.
Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low speed until combined.
In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla.
With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry.
With mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean.
Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.

Description: 
From Ina - aka Beatty's Chocolate Cake.  This turned out to be exactly that - your basic chocolate cake. I was expecting a little more, perhaps, and was slightly let down - - - but in retrospect, this was ridiculously easy to make, and will probably make again.  Nicely dense and moist.
