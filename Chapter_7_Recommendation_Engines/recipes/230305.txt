Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa
2 cups coconut milk
2 tablespoons flaked coconut (optional)
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring quinoa, coconut milk, and flaked coconut to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes; season with salt.

Description: 
A nice change from plain old grains. Quinoa has become a staple in our home because it only takes about 15 minutes to cook as opposed to 45 minutes for brown rice. I use canned coconut milk or coconut milk from the carton interchangeably. However, the coconut milk from the carton is sweetened, which my family likes but might not be right with some main dishes.
