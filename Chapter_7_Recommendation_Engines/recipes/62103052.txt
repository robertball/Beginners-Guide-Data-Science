Ingredients:
1 (2) lb bag frozen hash browns
1/2 lb bacon
3 green onions, or about 1/2 cup chopped onion
1 can low fat cream of chicken soup
1 cup low fat cheddar cheese
4 cups skim milk
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and crumble bacon. Reserve a little of the bacon drippings, saute onions till golden. Place everything in the crockpot and cook 8-10 hours on low.
Note: This makes a very thick potato soup. If you like yours a little thinner, add an additional cup of milk. Also, this can be made on the stovetop and simmered until ready to eat. Enjoy!

Description: 
I created this recipe after seeing a similar one that was SO high in fat I was afraid to try it. While this still isn't completely low fat, it's so good you have to try it!! The 'famous' part of the title came from church - every time we have a potluck I'm expected to bring this because everyone LOVES it!
