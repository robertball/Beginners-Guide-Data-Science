Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (or milk if not using powdered milk)
1/4 cup soft butter
2 eggs
3 3/4 cups bread flour
1/4 cup powdered milk, optional (see note next to water)
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
Topping:
1 egg
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons sugar
1/4 cup sliced almonds (optional)

Directions:
(See instructions for bread machines in Notes) Combine all main ingredients in bowl of stand mixer and knead using the bread hook until mixture is shaggy.  Let rest 10 minutes.  Continue kneading for 8-10 minutes or until dough is smooth and soft, adding more flour by the tablespoon if needed.  Place in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let rise 1-1 1/2 hours until doubled.  Continue with step 2.
When cycle is complete or dough has doubled, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide into thirds. Shape each into a 20-in. rope. Place ropes on a parchment-lined baking sheet; braid. Pinch ends to seal and tuck under. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 mins to 1 hour.
In a small bowl, beat egg and water; brush over dough. Sprinkle with sugar and almonds, if using. Bake at 350Â° for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack to cool. Yield: 1 loaf.

Description: 
Traditional cardamom bread I've made many times.  It always reminds me of trips to Solvang, CA.  Wonderful eaten plain any time of day or served with coffee for breakfast.  No need for butter or jam.  Everyone who's tried this bread loves it.
