Ingredients:
Vegetable shortening, for greasing bowls
16 oz. bag marshmallows (regular sized)
2 Tbsp. water
1-2 tsp. vanilla extract (clear or regular)
2 lbs. powdered sugar (7-9 cups)
Pinch of salt

Directions:
Grease microwave-safe bowl, spoon, and hook.
Add marshmallows and water to bowl and microwave for 60 seconds. Stir with spoon and melt for another 30 seconds if needed.
Stir in flavoring.
Reserve 1 cup sugar and add the rest to the bowl, along with salt. Create a well in the center, pour marshmallow mixture into well, and turn on low setting. Mix in all sugar.
If fondant is sticky, add sugar 1/4 cup at a time until no longer sticky.
Turn fondant out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Rub shortening on outside of ball. Wrap tightly and place in ziploc bag and let rest 2-3 hours.
Keep unused pieces covered when not used. If fondant becomes stiff, microwave for 20 seconds or until it becomes pliable.
