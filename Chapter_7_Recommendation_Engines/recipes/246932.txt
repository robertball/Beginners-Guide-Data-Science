Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 onions, sliced
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1/2 cup fromage blanc (French-style fresh cheese)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (11 ounce) package thin-crust pizza dough, at room temperature
8 strips cooked bacon
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
Combine creme fraiche and fromage blanc in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Spoon creme fraiche mixture on top. Cover evenly with onions, mushrooms, and bacon strips, leaving a 1-inch border. Scatter mozzarella cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is deep golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
After traveling to the Strasbourg/Alsace area in France, I fell in love with this pizza. I was able to obtain this recipe from one of the locals and tried it at home - it tastes just like I was in a restaurant back in the city. I hope you love this pizza as much as my family and I do!
