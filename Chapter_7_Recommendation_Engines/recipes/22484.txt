Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package Cheddar cheese
6 jalapeno peppers, seeded and halved
12 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat the broiler.
Cut Cheddar cheese into 12 slices long enough to fit inside the jalapeno halves. Insert cheese slices into the halves. Wrap the jalapeno halves with the bacon slices, securing with a toothpick, if necessary. Place on a medium baking sheet.
Broil 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bacon is evenly brown.
