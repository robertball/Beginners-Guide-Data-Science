Ingredients:
1 pint fresh strawberries
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup mascarpone cheese
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
18 ladyfingers
1/3 cup chilled espresso
1/2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Cut off the tops of the strawberries and slice the berries. Reserve 2 large whole berries for garnish.
In a blender, place 2 cups of strawberries and 2 tablespoons confectioners sugar; blend to puree and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, 1/4 cup cream, 1/4 cup sugar, and liqueur; beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until thickened.
Place 6 ladyfingers on a serving plate and brush each with approximately 1 teaspoon cold espresso coffee. Spread or pipe out 1/2 of the cheese mixture over the ladyfingers, and layer with half of the sliced strawberries.
Repeat with the next 6 ladyfingers, espresso, remaining cheese mixture, and sliced strawberries; top with remaining 6 ladyfingers.
In a small mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup heavy cream with 2 tablespoons sugar; beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed  until just whipped, approximately 1 minute. Spread cream evenly over top layer of ladyfingers.
Dust cocoa over whipped cream, and garnish with 2 reserved strawberries.  Pour strawberry puree onto two serving plates. Cut tiramisu in half, and place onto puree.

Description: 
Tiramisu is Italian for 'pick me up'.  This light, roll your eyes, taste bud tantalizer has become a traditional wedding anniversary dessert treat that I've been making for my husband and me for 17 years.  You might call it a happy hubby dessert!  This is my easy version of a classic with the elimination of raw eggs and a wonderful fresh strawberry layer and puree base.  It's delicioso!  It is made to accommodate two extra large portions.
