Ingredients:
2 Tbsp yeast
1 cup warm water
1 tsp sugar
1 cup milk, scalded
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 Tbsp salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 tsp nutmeg
5 cups flour, (approx)
Caramel Sauce:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup half and half cream
1 3/4 cups icing sugar

Directions:
Place yeast in small bowl.  Add the warm water.  Sprinkle 1 tsp sugar on top. Stir slightly.
Scald milk with 1/4 cup of the white sugar.
Place margarine in large bowl.  Pour hot milk mixture over top
to melt it.  Stir, and cool slightly.
Add salt, eggs, the rest of the
sugar (1/4 cup), nutmeg and yeast mixture.  Stir together and then add the flour.
Knead, keeping dough slightly sticky (you may need to add a
little more flour).
Place in large greased bowl, cover and let rise until dough doubles in size (about 1 hour).
Roll out dough on floured surface into a large rectangle (about 24
inches by 18 inches).
Brush dough with a little melted butter.
Sprinkle with a little brown sugar and cinnamon.
Fold dough into thirds (one side of the dough to the middle and then the other side of the dough over top).
There will be three layers of dough.
Cut dough into 1 inch strips.  Twist each strip and tie to make a knot.
Place buns into greased baking pans.
Cover and let rise until double the size (again about an
hour).
Bake at 325 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
Caramel Sauce:
Put ingredients, except icing sugar into a saucepan.
Boil until smooth.
Remove from heat and add icing sugar.  Beat until smooth.  Pour over buns while still warm.
