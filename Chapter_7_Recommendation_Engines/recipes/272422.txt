Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 teaspoons lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 onion, chopped
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 bunch fresh cilantro
1 bay leaf
4 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/4 cup water or broth, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine vegetable oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Add cubed lamb and marinate for about 30 minutes.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and brown meat on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove meat and set aside. Reduce heat, add onion, and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Return cooked lamb to skillet. Mix in beer and cilantro. Season with bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Cover skillet and simmer over low heat for about 1 hour. Add potatoes, cover, and cook over low heat until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes, adding water or broth if there is not enough liquid in the skillet.
