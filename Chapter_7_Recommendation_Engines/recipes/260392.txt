Ingredients:
4 oranges
3 blood oranges
1 small onion, finely diced
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
10 dried black olives

Directions:
Slice a little piece off the top and bottom of each orange so you have a stable cutting surface. Trim away all skin and pith with a small sharp knife without taking too much off the fruit. Slice oranges horizontally and arrange on a serving platter.
Combine onion, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl and pour over the oranges. Grind fresh pepper over the salad and arrange black olives on top.
