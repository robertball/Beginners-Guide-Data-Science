Description: 
I started making these years ago as a way to use up the broken pretzels after making chocolate covered pretzels for the holidays! You can use any flavor chocolate melts you have on hand.  I always make this last during my Christmas baking - it's a great way to use up leftover baking supplies (see variation at end of recipe!)White, Red and Green melts make for festive nibbles!  Everyone loves them!  Sue Logsdon
