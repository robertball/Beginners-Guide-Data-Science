Ingredients:
2 cups crushed Doritos - I HIGHLY suggest using the Taco flavored Doritos for this, or for any frying you do with Doritos, the flavor is intense and amazing and never fades away with the cooking process!  But, if you can’t find them, just use Nacho Cheese flavored Doritos!
Mexican Velveeta - approx. a 1? cube per ball
Oil for frying
1 large Egg
1/4 cup Flour
A splash of water

Directions:
Bowl #1 > The crushed Doritos.  I used a food processor, but you can use a ziplock bag and crush them up yourself.
Bowl #2 > The Egg, Flour and water mixed until blended.   You want a pancake batter-like consistency.
Cut out approx. 1? cubes of the Velveeta and roll it in your hands so it resembles a ball.  Just do the best you can, they don’t have to be perfect, since they’re going to melt inside.
Now place the Cheese balls into the egg mixture, making sure to coat them evenly.
Drop them into the crushed Doritos.  Again, make sure you get a nice thick coating on them, set aside.
Place one or two balls at a time into the hot oil and fry them up just until they’re golden, you may see some cheese peek through and that’s just fine.
Place them onto some paper towels to drain and cool just a bit.  Serve them warm.
