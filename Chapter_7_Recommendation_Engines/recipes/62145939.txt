Ingredients:
3/4 c pecans, toasted and cooled
1 pound butter (2 sticks)
3/4 c sugar
1 large egg yoke
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
1 3/4 c all-purpose flour

Directions:
Using a small food chopper, chop the pecans finely.
Mix butter in until creamy.
Add sugar and beat until fully blended.
Add egg yolk, vanilla and salt.
Slowly mix in the pecans.
Then mix in the flour until the dough starts to come together.
With your hands, with the dough into a ball, then divide dough in half.
Roll the dough into logs about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.
Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, overnight is better. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days for frozen for up to 3 months.)
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Using a sharp knife cut the dough into 1/3 inch thick slices and place them on a parchment lined cookie sheet.
Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden around the edges.
Enjoy.
