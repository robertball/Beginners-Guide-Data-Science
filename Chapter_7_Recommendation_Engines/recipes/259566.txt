Ingredients:
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and quartered lengthwise
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1/2 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
8 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1/2 cup sour cream
1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese
1 head romaine lettuce, sliced
1 bunch fresh cilantro, roughly chopped

Directions:
Cut butternut squash into spirals using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute squash until slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Add taco seasoning; stir. Add black beans and tomatoes; cook and stir until beans are hot and tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry 1 tortilla at a time until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side.
Place 1 tablespoon sour cream on each tortilla; add about 1/4 cup squash mixture and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon feta cheese. Top with lettuce and cilantro.
