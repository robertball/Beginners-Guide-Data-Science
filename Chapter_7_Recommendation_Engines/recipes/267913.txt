Ingredients:
1 Hatch chile
1 poblano pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion, diced
2 jalapenos, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken broth
2 (16 ounce) cans great northern beans, drained and rinsed
2 (15 ounce) cans fire-roasted corn
1 1/2 pounds cooked chicken, pulled apart
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa verde
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 lime, juiced
2 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
1 (12 ounce) bag tortilla chips, crushed, or to taste
1 bunch chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cut Hatch and poblano peppers in half and place, cut-sides down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins. Place roasted peppers into a food processor and blend until pureed.
Combine olive oil, bell pepper, onion, jalapenos, and garlic in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook until peppers are soft and onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Add chicken broth, beans, corn, chicken, salsa verde, pureed peppers, salt, and black pepper. Mix well and bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes.
Reduce heat to low, add lime juice, and cook 25 minutes more. Add 1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese to the pot and stir well. Cook 5 minutes more.
Serve soup topped with crushed tortilla chips, additional Monterey Jack cheese, and cilantro.

Description: 
Loaded with veggies and flavor, this chili is very hearty. The level of heat is dependent on the peppers, but the rest of the ingredients offer the ability to tone it down to make very a very satisfying spice.
