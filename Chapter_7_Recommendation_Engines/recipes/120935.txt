Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2/3 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 pound bulk Italian sausage
1 (3.25 ounce) package sliced pepperoni
2 tablespoons chopped onion
2 tablespoons chopped green pepper
1 cup pizza sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour, salt, garlic powder and pepper; stir in milk and eggs. Pour into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In a skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink; drain. Sprinkle over the crust. Top with pepperoni, onion and green pepper.
Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Spread with pizza sauce and sprinkle with cheese. Bake 5 minutes longer or until cheese is melted. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
