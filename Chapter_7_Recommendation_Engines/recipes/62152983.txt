Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs lean ground beef
1 stalk celery (chopped)
1/2 a red bell pepper (chopped)
1 white onion (chopped)
1 29 oz. can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 c tomato juice
2 c water
2 T chili powder
2 T brown sugar
6 beef bouillon cubes
3/4 c elbow macaroni

Directions:
1. In stock pot, begin browning ground beef.
2. When about half of beef is browned, add celery, red pepper, and onion.
3. Continue cooking until all beef is browned and vegetables are tender crisp. (For less fat, drain and rinse beef and vegetable mixture at this point.)
4. Add tomatoes, tomato juice, water, chili powder, brown sugar, and beef bouillon cubes.
5. Cover and simmer for half an hour.
6. Add macaroni noodles, and continue cooking until they are soft, about 10-15 minutes. (Canned kidney beans can also be added at this point, if desired.)

Description: 
This chili earned its blue ribbon at a chili cook-off three years in a row! It is a mild, sweet chili, but it could always be spiced up with a little Tabasco. In Wisconsin, chili has macaroni noodles in it, which my husband thinks is the best part of this recipe. Enjoy!
