Ingredients:
2 T butter
2 T flour
2 cups milk
1 chicken bouillon cube
2 T cooking oil
1/2 cup shredded zucchini
1-2 T hot green chile (to taste)
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1/2 to 1 tsp salt
2 tsp cumin
1 cup cooked chicken diced or shredded (optional)
8 corn tortillas
1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cup shredded Monterrey Jack

Directions:
Prepare a bechamel sauce: Melt butter on medium heat in a small pot. Whisk in flour until fully mixed.  Slowly add milk, whisking constantly to dissolve flour/butter mixture. Add bouillon cube and stir until dissolved and mixture thickens, but do not boil.
In a separate pan, sautee zucchini, chile, and onion in oil over medium-low heat until translucent. Add garlic, cumin, and salt. Stir until fragrant (~30 sec). Add onion mixture and cooked chicken (if using) to bechamel sauce. If the chicken is not pre-salted, add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt or to taste.
In a greased 9x9" pan, spread a thin layer of sauce.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Heat tortillas on a warm comal/griddle until pliable (about 30 seconds each side).  Dip tortillas in the bechamel mixture. Add to pan in layers (like a lasagna) of tortillas, sauce, cheese.
Bake at 375F for 20 minutes.  Then put under broiler just until cheese is golden brown (~2-5 minutes).
