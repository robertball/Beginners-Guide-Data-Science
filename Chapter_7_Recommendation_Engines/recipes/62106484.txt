Ingredients:
1 envelope unflavored gelatine
1/2 cup cold water
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 eggs, separated
1 can (6 ounces) frozen lemonade concentrate, kept frozen
1/2 cup sugar
1 9-inch graham cracker crust pie shell

Directions:
Sprinkle gelatine over cold water in 2 1/2 quart saucepan.  Add salt and egg yolks.  Mix well.
Place over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly and gelatine dissolves (about 3-5 minutes).  Remove from heat.
Add lemonade concentrate and stir until melted.  Set aside.
Beat egg whites until stiff, but not dry.  Gradually add sugar and beat until very stiff.
Fold into gelatine mixture.
Pour into pie shell.  Chill in refrigerator until firm.
