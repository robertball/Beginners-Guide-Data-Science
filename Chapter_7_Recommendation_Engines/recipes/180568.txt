4 eggs
1/4 cup canned pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg

Beat the eggs, pumpkin puree, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Dip the bread slices into the pumpkin mixture until coated on both sides.
Melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 4 of the bread slices into the skillet and cook until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining bread and butter.
