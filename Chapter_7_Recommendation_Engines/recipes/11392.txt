1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon baking powder

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and orange zest.
In a bowl of mixer, cream butter on medium speed, adding sugar gradually. Add vanilla and egg. Add flour mixture gradually, stopping frequently to push down from sides of bowl. When flour mixture is thoroughly combined, mix in chips.
Drop dough by scant spoonful onto baking sheet, spacing 1 inch apart, flattening slightly with back of spoon. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 10 to 12 minutes or until beginning to brown. Allow to cool completely on cooling rack.

Description: 
These get crispy when cool. I named them for May 1, the day I invented them. They taste bright and sunny, like the summer season Beltane is supposed to herald.
