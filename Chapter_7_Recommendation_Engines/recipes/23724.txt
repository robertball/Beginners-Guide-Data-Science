Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
garlic powder to taste
onion powder to taste
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
In a stainless steel pot over medium-high heat, combine green beans, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, until the beans begin to sweat.  Remove lid and stir occasionally until beans are tender.
When the beans and spices have begun to 'burn' on the bottom of the pan, which will lend a grilled flavor, stir in the olive oil and turn off heat.  Cover, and let stand a few minutes.  Scrape the bottom of the pan to incorporate the  'burnt' spices.  Beans should have a dark, caramel color, but not black.

Description: 
These green beans were the side dish my grandmother served most often because we all love them.  They are done but not mushy like canned beans.
