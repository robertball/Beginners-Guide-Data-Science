Stir in rice for one minute. Add wine; cook until almost all liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes.
Add 4 cups broth, 1 cup at a time, cooking until almost all broth is absorbed before adding more, stirring frequently, until rice is tender but still firm, about 20 minutes.
Stir in Parmesan and lemon juice. Add more broth by 1/4 cupfuls as needed if dry. Season with salt and pepper.
