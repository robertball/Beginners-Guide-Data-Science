Ingredients:
1 pound asparagus spears, ends trimmed
1 1/2 cups sour cream
1 1/2 tablespoons prepared horseradish
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
In a large covered pot, steam asparagus 3 to 4 minutes, or until tender but still bright green. Remove from the pot and arrange in a single layer in a 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl, mix together sour cream, horseradish, and garlic salt; spoon over asparagus. In a small bowl, stir together the melted butter and bread crumbs; sprinkle over the asparagus.
Preheat the oven's broiler and adjust the oven rack so that it is about 3 inches from the heat source.
Broil asparagus 1 to 2 minutes, until the topping is toasted, taking care to watch closely to prevent over browning.

Description: 
This is a great side dish that goes well with beef entrees. It combines sour cream, horseradish and garlic salt in a creamy sauce. My friend Libby makes this all the time for her dinner parties!
