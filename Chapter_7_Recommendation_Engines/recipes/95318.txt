Ingredients:
8 ounces saltine crackers
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/4 cup half-and-half cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the saltine crackers, celery, onion, eggs, parsley and pepper. Set aside.
Measure the half-and-half into a small cup and stir in the cornstarch. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in the half-and-half and simmer for a few minutes to thicken. The gravy will be somewhat thin.
Pour hot gravy over the cracker mixture one cup at a time, stirring each time, until the dressing is moist but not soupy. Cover the bowl tightly with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This dish is a holiday tradition in our family that dates back several generations. I think its origins are from the Pennsylvania Dutch country. It is quick, easy and a definite complement to the holiday table.
