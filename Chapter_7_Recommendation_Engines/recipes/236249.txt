Ingredients:
Dry Mixture:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons ground ginger
Wet Mixture:
1 cup plain yogurt
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 cup sultana raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and ginger together in a bowl.
Beat yogurt, pumpkin puree, sugar, and eggs together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Fold sultana raisins into the yogurt mixture. Stir dry mixture into the wet mixture; pour into prepared muffin cups to about 3/4 full.
Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a serving platter.
