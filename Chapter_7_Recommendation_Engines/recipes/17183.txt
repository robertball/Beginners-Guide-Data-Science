Description: 
This is a topping of sorts that I make on lobster. It is equally as good on any seafood. Spread this topping as thickly as you want over raw lobster tail halves. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until the lobster is cooked through and the topping is light brown and bubbly.
