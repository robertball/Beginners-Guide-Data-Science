Ingredients:
3 ripe bananas
2.5 cups rolled oats
1 cup raisins or dried cranberries
1 apple
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/3 cup honey or agave nectar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mash the bananas.  Peel, core and dice apple.  Stir in all of the ingredients.  Mix well, and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and slightly flatten because they won't spread or spread into a 9x11 pan sprayed with pan.
Bake for about 24 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly brown.
