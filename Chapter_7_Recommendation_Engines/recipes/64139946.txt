Ingredients:
1/4 cup coconut flour
8 large egg whites
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 cut water
coconut oil

Directions:
Mix together all ingredients except oil in a medium bowl. Make sure there are no lumps left (whisk works best for this, but a fork will do okay).
Heat up a nonstick skillet and put in about 1-2 tsp coconut oil in the pan - swirl to spread to the edges.
Pour about 3 tbsp of batter into pan, tipping pan to spread batter around the same way you did the oil.
DO NOT FLIP until you are absolutely certain that the first side is golden brown. Flipping before this point will rip the tortilla.
Repeat process until you're out of batter.
