Description: 
Francis was a great baker that did all the desserts for a restaurant that I worked at during my college years. This was a huge seller and once I added it to my Thanksgiving menu it was a hit with my guests too. It is a quick and delicious embellishment to any pumpkin or sweet potato pie as you bring it out of the oven
