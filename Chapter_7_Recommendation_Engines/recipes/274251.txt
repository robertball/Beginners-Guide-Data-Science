Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups oat flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
2 eggs
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
Mix oat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt together in a large bowl using a fork. Combine pumpkin puree, eggs, honey, applesauce, and oil in a separate bowl. Add pumpkin mixture to flour mixture and stir using a spatula until well combined.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling cups 3/4 full.
Bake until a fork or toothpick inserted in a cupcake center comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I wanted to make pumpkin muffins that were gluten free, healthy, delicious, and easy, so I included oat flour. Chocolate chips or walnuts are optional.
