Description: 
This is from a healthy cooking class. The beauty of this salad is that it will wait for you. It makes such a pretty dish on the table. The Soba buckwheat noodles are worth a trip to the Asian grocery store. Serve with salad tongs and try adding a horizontally sliced scallion for a eye catching garnish.
