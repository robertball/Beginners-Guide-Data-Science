Ingredients:
4 scaloppine chicken breasts (or pound them thin wrapped in plastic with a rolling pin or mallet) ~2 lbs of chicken
3/4 cup plain, nonfat Greek yogurt
1 tbsp smoky paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp minced ginger
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 lemons halved
cilantro or parsley for garnish

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine Greek yogurt, salt, ginger, garlic, paprika, cumin and lemon juice.
Toss chicken into the bowl generously coating it with the yogurt mix.
Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour prior to making it, marinating it longer is better.
Remove chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes prior to cooking so it is room temperature prior to cooking.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Use a roasting pan to arrange chicken in a single layer nestling lemon halves in between.
Roast chicken 25 minutes at 400 degrees F. Remove chicken from the oven and garnish with cilantro.
Switch the oven to high broiler setting. Place chicken under the broiler 5-6 minutes to blacken the edges a bit. Remove and devour!
