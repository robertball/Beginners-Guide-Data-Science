Ingredients:
2 cups flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup bran cereal
1 1/2 c. mashed bananas
2 eggs
1/2 cup butter (or margerine)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Stir together flour, baking powder, soda, salt and sugar.  Set aside.  Stir together mashed banana and bran cereal.  Let stand for 2-3 minutes, until ceral softens. Add eggs and butter.  Beat well. Stir in nuts.  Add flour mixture, stirring just until it is moistened.  Put into muffin papers or greased tins.  Bake 15 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
Note;  I like to reserve a small amount of chopped nuts to sprinkle on the top of the muffin batter before baking.  This gives it a nice presentation once cooked.
