Ingredients:
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup butter or margarine.softened
1 egg, room temperature
1-1/2 tsp vanilla
2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
7 oz macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped
2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2/3 cup white chocolate chips
3 Tbsp toffee chip, such as Skor or Heath Bits o' Brickle

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
In a large mixer bowl, combine the first 5 ingredients, beating at low speed at first, increasing to medium speed, and scraping sides of bowl often, until well mixed, about 2 minutes.
Add flour in quarter cup increments (flour should be lightly spooned into measuring cups and leveled off; do not tap down to "pack" flour), along with the baking soda and salt.  Continue beating until well mixed, about 2-3 minutes.
By hand with a wooden spoon, stir in madadamia nuts, chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls about 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets, flattening slightly with the back of the spoon.  Sprinkle about a 1/4 tsp. of toffee chips on each mound of cookie dough, pressing toffee chips into top of dough and flattening cookie a bit more.  (If any toffee chips fall onto baking sheet, remove them, as they'll melt and make a mess!)
Bake for 9-11 minutes in middle of oven (I recommend baking one sheet at a time), or until lightly browned.  Let cool for about a minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
Makes approximately 3 dozen cookies.
