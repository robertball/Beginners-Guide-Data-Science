Description: 
I haven't seen a recipe combining avocados with cream cheese and sour cream, so I made one! Came up with this creamy blend of cream cheese, sour cream, and avocado seasoned with ranch dressing mix, hot sauce, etc. Excellent with tortilla chips. Add more hot sauce, if you like (I don't add lemon juice because the sour cream already gives it tartness). We couldn't stop eating it!
