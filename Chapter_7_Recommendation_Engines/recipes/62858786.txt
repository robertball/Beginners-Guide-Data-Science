Ingredients:
8 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 1 lb)
1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbsp paprika
¼ tsp each salt and peper
1 can tomatoes, chopped
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1 sweet green pepper, diced
½ cup light sour cream
2 Tbsp minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces. In large skillet, heat oil over med-high heat; brown chicken, in batches. Transfer to plate.
Drain fat from pan; fry onion, garlic, paprika, salt and pepper over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
Add tomatoes and tomato paste; bring to boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits from bottom of pan. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Return chicken and any juices to pan. Add green pepper; cover and simmer until sauce is thick enough to mound on spoon. About 10 minutes. (Make-ahead: Let cool for 30 minutes; refrigerate until cold. Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 24 hours or freeze for up to 1 month.) Garnish with sour cream and parsley.
Additional Information:
Slow Cooker Paprika Chicken: After browning chicken, transfer to slow cooker. Continue with recipe, omitting tomato paste until later and scraping tomato mixture into slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 4 hours.
Stir green pepper and tomato paste into slow cooker; cover and cook on high for 15 minutes or until thickened. Serve topped with sour cream and parsley.
