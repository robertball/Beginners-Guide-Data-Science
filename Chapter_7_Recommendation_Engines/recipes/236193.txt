Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can sliced beets, drained with liquid reserved
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup distilled white vinegar
10 whole cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon sweet pickle relish
1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard

Directions:
Measure 1 cup beet juice from reserved juice.
Combine 1 cup beet juice, sugar, vinegar, cloves, salt, pepper, and bay leaves in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.
Place beets and eggs into a large bowl. Pour beet juice mixture over beets and eggs. Refrigerate for 3 days. Drain and discard pickling liquid.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise and scoop yolks into a bowl. Mix mayonnaise, relish, and mustard into egg yolks until smooth. Spoon egg yolk filling back into each egg white. Serve beets and eggs on a platter.
