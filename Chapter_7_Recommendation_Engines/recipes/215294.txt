Ingredients:
Crust:
1 Pillsbury® refrigerated pie crust, softened as directed on box
1 egg white
2 tablespoons ground almonds
Filling:
6 ounces semisweet baking chocolate, broken into pieces
1/4 cup butter
2 egg yolks
2 teaspoons raspberry-flavored liqueur (optional)
2 cups fresh raspberries
Topping:
1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 ounce semisweet baking chocolate
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup sliced almonds
Mint leaves

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Make pie crust as directed on box for One-Crust Baked Shell using 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom or 9-inch glass pie pan. Trim edge if necessary. Bake 7 minutes.
Remove partially baked crust from oven. Lightly brush crust with egg white; sprinkle with ground almonds. Return to oven; bake 5 to 10 minutes longer or until golden brown. Cool while making filling.
In 2-quart saucepan, melt 6 oz chocolate and the butter over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove from heat.
In small bowl, beat egg yolks slightly with wire whisk. Stir in liqueur. Add egg yolk mixture to chocolate. With wire whisk, beat over low heat 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens. Pour into cooled baked shell. Arrange raspberries over filling.
In 1-quart saucepan, melt jam over low heat. Stir in extract. Gently brush over raspberries.
In another 1-quart saucepan, melt 1 oz chocolate with oil over low heat, stirring frequently, until smooth. Drizzle over raspberries. Sprinkle with sliced almonds. Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes. Garnish with mint leaves. Store in refrigerator.
