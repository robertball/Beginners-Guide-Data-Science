Ingredients:
1 large russet potato, peeled and quartered
1 large sweet potato, peeled and quartered
1 cup corn
1 teaspoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cucumber, halved lengthwise and chopped
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup finely chopped peanuts

Directions:
Place the Russet potato pieces into a large saucepan, and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, turn the heat down, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the sweet potato, and cook about 15 minutes more. Remove a piece of each potato, and cut it in half to see if it is cooked enough. Once the potatoes are tender, add corn kernels; cook another 30 seconds. Drain through a colander. Fill the saucepan with cold water, and drop vegetables into water.  Cool for 5 minutes, and drain.
In a large bowl, whisk together mustard, lime juice, cilantro, and garlic.  Slowly whisk in oil.  Mix in salt and black pepper.
Cut cooled potatoes into 1 inch cubes, and add to dressing along with cucumber, and red onion. Toss well.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.  Toss the peanuts in just before serving.

Description: 
This is a 90's potato salad - a new and improved, redone, much better potato salad. Not only does it have a sweet potato, in addition to a Russet potato, but it also contains corn, cucumber, and peanuts!  Corn oil will do if you don't have canola.
