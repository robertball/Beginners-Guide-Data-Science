1/4 cup baking cocoa
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1 cup sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine cocoa and oil until smooth. In another bowl, beat eggs. Add the sugar, vanilla and cocoa mixture; mix well. Stir in flour and salt just until moistened. Fold in walnuts.
Pour into a greased 8-in. square baking pan; sprinkle with chocolate chips. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
I don't know where I got this recipe, but I've had it for over 30 years - it's written on an old yellow piece of paper. Adding chocolate chips was my idea. When my children were in school, I found out they were selling these brownies to their friends! -Marjorie Hoyt, Center Conway, New Hampshire
