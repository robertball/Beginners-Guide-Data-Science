Ingredients:
1/2 tbsp olive oil
3/4 lb white mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 tsp oregano
3/8 cup breadcrumbs
1/3 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
1 egg, beaten
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
1.  Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, oregano, and a pinch of salt.  Saute, covered, stirring often.  Remove from heat when mushrooms have lost their liquid and have become mostly dry.  Empty skillet onto a cutting board and roughly chop.
2.  Combine breadcrumbs, rolled oats, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.  Stir to mix, then add mushroom mixture and stir well.  Add Parmesan and stir.  Add beaten egg and stir.  Refrigerate for at least 15 min to allow oats to absorb the egg.
3.  Remove from fridge and form into 4-5 patties.
4.  Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.  Cook patties, covered, for 3 min on each side.  Place each patty on your favorite bun and top with your favorite condiments.

I found the inspiration for this recipe on another website, and I've never had a burger quite like it.
