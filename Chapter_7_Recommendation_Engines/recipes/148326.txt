Ingredients:
1 large eggplant, washed
1 tomato, seeded and chopped
1 small onion, diced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
Pierce the eggplant a few times with the tip of a paring knife or fork. Cook eggplant on preheated grill, turning often, until the skin is charred and the eggplant is tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle.
Remove the skin from the eggplant and dice the pulp. Place into a mixing bowl, and add tomato, onion, parsley, olive oil, vinegar, and feta cheese; mix well. Refrigerate for one hour, and season to taste with salt before serving.

Description: 
There are different ways to make eggplant salad, a very common summer salad in my country. This is a version called 'agioritiki' named from mount Athos (Agion Oros). It's refreshing with smoky flavor and can stay refrigerated up to three days. Serve it as a salad or on top of whole-wheat bread slices.
