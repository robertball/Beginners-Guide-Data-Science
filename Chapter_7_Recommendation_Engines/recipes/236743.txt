Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (16.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
3 egg whites
1/3 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons lemon extract
Frosting:
1 cup cold heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Filling:
1/3 cup blueberry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8-inch pans.
Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, vegetable oil, and lemon extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until batter is well combined, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
Beat cream in a chilled bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks are almost forming into stiff peaks; place bowl in refrigerator.
Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture.
Place 1 cake on a plate; top with blueberry pie filling. Place second cake atop blueberry filling. Generously frost cake with whipped cream cheese frosting.
