Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie shell
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups chopped pecans
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add 1/3 cup sugar and beat until smooth. Thoroughly mix in 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Do not overbeat. Spread mixture into pastry shell. Sprinkle with chopped pecans.
In a medium bowl, combine 3 beaten eggs, corn syrup, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix until incorporated but not frothy. Pour mixture over pecan layer.
Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until filling is set and pecans are browned. Pie will be quite high, but will settle as it cools.
