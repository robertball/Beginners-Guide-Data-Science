Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve about 1 cup butter crumbs.
Stir buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract into remaining crumbs until batter is just combined; pour batter into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle reserved butter crumbs over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
