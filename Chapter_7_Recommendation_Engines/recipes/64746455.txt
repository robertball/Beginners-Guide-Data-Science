Ingredients:
3 tablespoons of vegetable oil
2 Tablespoons of minced garlic
4 bay leaves
Chicken thighs -4 pieces (I used skinless)
Big Idaho potato- peeled & diced
Peas- like half a can
Carrots-  small can of sliced ones
Small can of tomato sauce
little bit of water on the side

Directions:
Rinse your thighs and pat dry.
Heat a deep skillet up on medium,  poor some oil till a drop of water pops. Add the garlic and stir till it has a nice light tan, (and a finely chopped onion if you want to go traditional and sauté them till it’s melted up).
With some thongs, carefully place the chicken in the skillet and let it sizzle for 30 secs, flip and 30 more secs.
Cover for a minute and then add the bay leaves and tomato sauce. Stir it a little, cover and let simmer for about 15min.  Add the potatoes, stir, flip the chicken and cover. In this time, I start the rice in the rice cooker, (add the peas and carrots a little bit after the potatoes if they’re fresh).  After 20 min add the carrots and peas, dash some salt and pepper on it, stir and cover for 3 min.
You’re done. Enjoy!

Description: 
Filipino fave. Garlicky tomato sauce based seared chicken thighs and simple veggies.   I used canned so I don’t have scraps and for the convenience.  All of this is cooked to how you feel, so feel free to make it you own.  I left out the yellow onion your supposed to sauté with the garlic (for bf reasons). I also prefer to have sliced red bell pepper for that pop of color, slight crunch, and tang.  Serve with steamed white rice.
