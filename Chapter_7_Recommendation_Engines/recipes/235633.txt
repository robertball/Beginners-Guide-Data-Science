Ingredients:
5 pounds beef short ribs, cut into serving-sized pieces
Salt and ground black pepper
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large onions, cut in half and sliced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
4 cups SwansonÂ® Beef Stock
1 cup dry red wine

Directions:
Season the beef with the salt and black pepper.  Coat the beef with half the flour.
Heat the oil in an 8-quart saucepot over medium-high heat. Add the beef in 2 batches and cook until well browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the saucepot.
Add the onions and tomato paste to the saucepot and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the carrots, celery, chopped garlic and rosemary and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the stock, wine and remaining flour and heat to a boil. Return the beef to the saucepot. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the beef is fork-tender.
