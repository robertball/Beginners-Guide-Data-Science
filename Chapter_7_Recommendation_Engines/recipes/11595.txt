Ingredients:
1 pound butter
2 1/3 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
9 eggs
4 1/8 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat the waffle iron on medium setting.
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Stir in the vanilla and salt.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition. Then stir in the flour.
Drop the batter by heaping soupspoonful onto the waffle grid. Close the cover and bake for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Every waffle iron is a little different so you may want to test it on the first couple of cookies. Place finished cookies onto a wire rack to cool.
