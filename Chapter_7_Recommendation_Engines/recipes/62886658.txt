Ingredients:
1 package frozen puff pastry, thawed to room temperature
1/2 pound of bacon, sliced into small strips
1 small onion, diced finely
1 tbsp butter
3-4 apples, peeled and diced, roughly three cups full
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/8 tsp cinnamon, or to taste
1 tbsp sugar
1 cup grated sharp cheddar
salt and pepper to taste
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In a small frying pan, cook and stir the bacon slices until lightly crisped.  Remove to a paper towel with a slotted spoon, then to a bowl.
In the bacon drippings, saute the diced onion until golden brown, season with salt and pepper, and remove to the same bowl as the bacon.  Drain the drippings completely from the pan, and add the pat of butter.
Add the diced apples, the lemon juice, the cinnamon and sugar, and saute until the apples are softened, about 5 minutes.  Add to the bacon and onion mix, and allow to cool slightly.
Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface until quite thin, then slice into squares.  This recipe can make 4 huge turnovers or 8 small ones, to your preference.
Spoon equal amounts of the filling onto the middle of your squares, then top with the grated cheddar.  Wet one triangle of the square with water, then fold over the other side.  Pinch the seams well and transfer to a prepared baking sheet.  Slit small holes in the top with a knife, and put them in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.  Cool on a baking rack, and enjoy!
