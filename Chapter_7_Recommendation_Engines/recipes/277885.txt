Ingredients:
oil for frying
1 1/2 cups buttermilk, or more as needed
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon parsley flakes
3 dashes hot sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 large onions, sliced

Directions:
Add enough oil to a Dutch oven so that it comes halfway up the sides of the pot. Heat over medium heat until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Meanwhile, combine buttermilk, flour, egg, baking powder, paprika, celery salt, parsley, hot sauce, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Whisk until ingredients are combined and batter is very smooth.
Separate onion slices into rings and dip each one in batter. Shake excess batter off rings and lower them carefully into the hot oil, in batches if necessary. Cook until deep golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and repeat with remaining rings. Serve immediately.
