Ingredients:
2 pounds sea scallops
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons ground black pepper
4 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons dried marjoram
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Pat scallops dry with paper towels and set aside.
Place flour, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, marjoram, salt, and cayenne pepper in a large plastic resealable bag and shake well to mix. Add scallops to the bag and toss to coat with flour mixture.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add all scallops in a single layer and sear until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drizzle balsamic vinegar over seared scallops.

Description: 
The tastiest scallops you will ever try. I like my food with a little zip, but  you can leave out the cayenne pepper if you don't like it spicy.
