Ingredients:
1 pound flank steak, sliced very thin against the grain
1 garlic clove, minced
Juice from 1/2 lime
1/4 cup Herdez Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce
2 Tablespoons Olive Oil
Corn Salsa:
2 fresh ears corn cut from cob
1 small red bell pepper
1 small orange bell pepper
1 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
1/4 cup red onion, chopped
1 garlic clove, minced
Juice from 1/2 lime
2 T Herdez Traditional Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce
1 head romaine lettuce, torn, washed and dried
Garnish:
Pepper Jack Cheese
Sliced colored pepper rings

Directions:
In a bowl, mix together garlic, lime juice and chipotle sauce. Pour over the sliced meat in a bowl and toss to coat. Marinate in refrigerator at least 2 hours.
In another bowl combine corn, bell peppers, jalape√±o pepper, onion, garlic, lime juice and chipotle sauce; mix gently. Refrigerate 1-2 hours to allow flavors to blend.
Heat oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. With tongs, add half the meat to pan in a single layer; do not stir for a good minute. Turn meat to the other side and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove to a clean plate.
Repeat with other half of meat, allowing pan to get very hot again first.
Top lettuce with meat mixture, corn salsa, cheese, pepper rings and any other toppings you desire.
You can serve with your favorite salad dressing but this salad is so packed with flavor that none is needed.
