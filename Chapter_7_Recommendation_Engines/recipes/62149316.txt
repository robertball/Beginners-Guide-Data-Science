Ingredients:
6 large lettuce leafs (looseleaf or romaine)
6 oz lean ground turkey
4 large fresh shiitake mushrooms, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon oil
2 tablespoons green onion, chopped

Directions:
1.  Prepare the lettuce leafs by separating, washing, patting dry, and arranging around a platter.
2.  Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the turkey, onions, garlic, and ginger in the skillet for 5 minutes, or until meat is lightly brown and onions translucent.  Add mushrooms and soy sauce, stirring frequently until cooked through, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the green onion and continue to cook for 1 minute.
3.  Remove from heat and spoon the meat mixture in the center of the platter.  To serve, have each person spoon the meat mixture into a lettuce leaf and wrap it like a burrito.
