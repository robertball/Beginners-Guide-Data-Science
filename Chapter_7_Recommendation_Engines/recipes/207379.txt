Ingredients:
3 large baking potatoes, 10 to 12 ounces each, preferably Idaho, washed and dried
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 pound ground turkey or lean ground beef
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
1 (8 ounce) can peas, drained
1 (8 ounce) can sliced carrots, drained
1 (8 ounce) can cut green beans, drained
1 cup canned diced tomatoes, drained
1 (15 ounce) can beef or turkey gravy

Directions:
Preheat the conventional oven to 450 degrees F. Place the potatoes in a microwave-safe, oven-proof glass baking dish, such as a pie plate, that fits in the microwave oven. Microwave the potatoes at full power for 10 minutes (the amount of time it takes to preheat the oven). Transfer the potatoes to the conventional oven and bake until tender, about 20 minutes.
Ten to 15 minutes before the potatoes are done baking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground turkey and cook until lightly browned, chopping and turning as needed with a spatula so the turkey browns evenly, about 5 minutes. Add the seasoning to the skillet, followed by the peas, carrots, green beans, tomatoes and gravy to make the stew. Stir gently to combine and simmer for 5 minutes. Keep warm.
To serve: Cut each potato in half across its equator and set each half, cut-side down on a plate so that it looks like a small mountain. Cut a slit in the top of each potato half and squeeze the sides gently forcing some of the potato to 'erupt' from the top.  Ladle 1 cup of the stew over each potato to resemble flowing lava; serve immediately.
