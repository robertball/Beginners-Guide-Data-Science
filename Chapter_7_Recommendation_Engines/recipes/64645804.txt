Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons real maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon lemon or vanilla extract
pinch of coarse salt
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Add real maple syrup, extract, salt, and heavy whipping cream to a mixing bowl.  With the mixer set on low speed, whip ingredients together.  Once incorporated, set mixer to high speed and beat until the cream holds its shape.  (Stiff peaks, some like to say.)  Use immediately, or keep chilled in refrigerator up to 4 hours before serving.
