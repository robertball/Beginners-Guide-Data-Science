Description: 
We love to serve these on Waffle Wednesdays for dinner or for large group gatherings. These are high in fiber and flavor with whole wheat flour, flax seed meal, and wheat germ, and are quite delicious and filling. Serve with homemade blueberry syrup, butter syrup, yogurt, peanut butter and honey, or fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Make a huge batch with a mixer and freeze the uneaten waffles for easy weeknight meals or quick and hearty breakfast warmed and crisped in the toaster.
