Ingredients:
2 medium poblano peppers
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 small shallots, minced
4 Roma tomatoes, diced
2 small zucchini, diced
2 small yellow squash, diced
1 small eggplant, coarsely diced
Dash of salt
Kefir cheese or plain Greek yogurt (optional)

Directions:
Roast poblanos by cutting off tops and removing seeds and ribs. Using tongs, place peppers over open flame on stovetop or grill. Rotate peppers as flesh chars to a brownish black color. Once the whole peppers are charred, remove from heat and immediately place in paper bag. After about 5 minutes, the peppers' skin will soften and burnt layers will separate a bit. Remove peppers from bag and use a paring knife to remove charred skin. Discard charred skin and dice poblano peppers.
Add olive oil to medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add poblanos, tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant and salt. Stir until well combined. Cover, stir occasionally and saut√© 10 minutes until all vegetables are tender, but not too mushy.
If desired, add a small spoonful of kefir cheese or plain Greek yogurt to temper the heat and add a rich mouthfeel.
