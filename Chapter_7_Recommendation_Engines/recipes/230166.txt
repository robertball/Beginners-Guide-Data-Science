Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3 large eggs
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons butter, divided

Directions:
Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl; make a deep well in the center of flour mixture. Break eggs into the well and beat until smooth.
Mix milk and water together in a small bowl; slowly stir milk mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, into flour mixture until batter is a thin, paste-like consistency. Cover bowl and allow batter to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with butter, using 1/2 teaspoon butter per muffin cup.
Place muffin tin on the second shelf from the top in the preheated oven until butter melts and begins to smoke, 3 to 4 minutes.
Whisk the batter to fully incorporate all the ingredients, about 2 minutes. Pour batter into the melted butter in each muffin tin, 1/2 to 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until puddings are golden brown and well-risen, keeping the oven door closed the entire time of cooking, 17 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is my Grandmother's traditional Yorkshire pudding recipe. She's been using it since before I can remember, and they always turn out perfectly! Crispy golden brown on the outside, and a fluffy tender inside. Fill with your favorite gravy, and you have an instant crowd pleaser! Goes great with roasts or with holiday turkeys.
