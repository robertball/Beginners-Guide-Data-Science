Ingredients:
3 cups Self Raising Flower
1/2 Cup Whole Wheat Flour
1/2 cup corn meal
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups Warm Water

Directions:
Mix everything together to form a batter.
Let set in large bowl, covered, an hour or longer, until batter rises and becomes stretchy.
It can sit as long as 3-6 hours.
When ready, stir batter if liquid has settled on bottom.
Then whip in blender, 2 cups of batter at a time, thinning it with 1/2 - 3/4 cup water.
Batter will be quite thin.
Cook in non-stick frypan WITHOUT OIL (is that a great instruction or what?) over medium or medium-high heat.
Use 1/2 cup batter per injera for a 12-inch pan or 1/3 cup batter for a 10-inch pan.
Pour batter in heated pan and quickly swirl pan to spread batter as thin as possible.
Batter should be no thicker than 1/8-inch.
Do not turn over.
Injera does not easily stick or burn.
It is cooked through when bubbles appear all over the top.
Lay each injera on a clean towel for a minute or two, then stack in covered dish to keep warm.
Finished injera will be thicker than a crepe, but thinner than a pancake.
