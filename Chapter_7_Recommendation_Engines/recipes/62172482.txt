Ingredients
5  medium sweet potatoes (10 oz. each)
1/2  cup cranberry relish
1/2  cup dried cranberries or raisins, snipped or chopped
2  Tbsp. butter, softened
1/2  tsp. salt

3. Using a potato masher or fork, mash potato pulp until smooth. Stir in relish, cranberries, butter, and salt. Spoon potato mixture into each potato shell. Place, filled sides up, in a 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Sprinkle with walnuts.
