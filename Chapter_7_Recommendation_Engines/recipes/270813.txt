Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) New York strip steak, well marbled
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons roughly chopped shallot
1 tablespoon roughly chopped garlic
1 sprig fresh thyme

Directions:
Place a heat-resistant pad underneath a large pot filled with water. Attach a sous vide precision cooker to the pot and set temperature to 135 degrees F (57 degrees C).
Generously season steak with salt and pepper on both sides. Place into a plastic bag and seal with a vacuum sealer to remove all air.
Place the sealed bag in the water once temperature has been reached, making sure the bag is completely submerged. Leave in the water for 4 hours.
Remove plastic pouch from water and remove the steak. Pat dry with paper towels.
Melt butter in a medium nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat; cook shallot, garlic, and thyme sprig for 5 minutes. Remove shallot, garlic, and thyme using a spatula. Add steak and sear, pressing down onto the meat with the bottom of the spatula, about 1 minute. Flip steak and repeat on the other side for 1 minute. Cut steak into 2 equal portions and spoon butter over the steak.
