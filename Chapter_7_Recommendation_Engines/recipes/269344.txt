Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 1/3 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1/4 cup light olive oil
1/4 cup applesauce
1/2 teaspoon vanilla, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups white rice flour
1 tablespoon white rice flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix pumpkin, sugar, eggs, oil, applesauce, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl.
Combine 1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon rice flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a separate bowl. Stir into the pumpkin mixture until well blended. Pour batter into the pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out nearly clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
Many say this is the best thing I have ever baked! It is gluten-, dairy-, and nut-free and is truly delicious and moist. This tastes the same as a normal pumpkin bread and will not cause allergic reactions. This can easily be turned into pumpkin muffins.
