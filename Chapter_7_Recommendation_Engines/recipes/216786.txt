Combine the raspberries and jelly in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Mix the cold water and cornstarch; stir into the raspberry mixture. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; boil and stir one minute. Cool.

Description: 
This sauce is usually served with Finnish or Danish rice pudding. When I made this with Finnish rice pudding, my husband said I could forget the pudding, but begged that I keep making the raspberry currant sauce on a regular basis! It can also be made with fresh raspberries or cranberries, fresh or frozen. Serve on vanilla ice cream, pound cake, or over fresh berries.
