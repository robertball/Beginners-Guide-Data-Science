Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup broccoli florets
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 baking potato
5 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups cooked white rice
1 1/2 cups uncooked green lentils
2 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
Heat the oil in a stock pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, broccoli and celery; cook and stir until tender. Meanwhile, peel the potato and heat in the microwave for 5 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Transfer the potato and vegetables to a food processor and blend until smooth. Return to the pot and bring to a boil.
Add the cooked rice, lentils and curry powder. Simmer over low heat, covered, until lentils are soft, about 45 minutes.
