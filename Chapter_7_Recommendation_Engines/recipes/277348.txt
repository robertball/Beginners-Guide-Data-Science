Ingredients:
baking spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2/3 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon baking powder
2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries
1 orange, zested

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with baking spray.
Combine flour, sugar, oil, eggs, orange juice, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl using an electric mixer until thoroughly incorporated. Stir in cranberries and orange zest. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
Remove from the oven and turn cake out onto a cooling rack; let cool for 1 hour.
