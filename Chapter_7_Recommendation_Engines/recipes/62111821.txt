Ingredients:
2 large crusty buns (from bakery or local grocery)
1 wedge of double cream Brie cheese
1 cup of diced fresh fruit (Apples, strawberries, raspberries, cranberries) or Sauteed mushrooms and Onions

Directions:
Chop brie into small bits - set aside in a medium sized bowl.
Using a sharp knife - cut a 1 inch hole out of the top of the bun. With (clean) fingers, scoop out the inside bread to create a empty bun "shell" - put half of the bread chunks into bowl - discard (or eat) the remaining bread bits.
Add chopped fruit pieces or sauteed mixture into the bowl with the brie and bread remains and mix together.Fill the empty shells with the brie/sweet or savory mixture. Place the "tops" back onto the filled buns.  Wrap buns in foil and place on indirect heat on grill.  Cook until cheese melts (approx 10 - 15 minutes) Turn once.
Cool, unwrap buns and serve on a pretty plate with a knife to cut into quarters.
