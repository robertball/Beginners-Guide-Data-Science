Ingredients:
Ricotta Filling:
1 tub 475 g Tre Stelle® Ricotta Cheese, Extra Smooth, drained
1 cup 250 mL confectioners sugar [icing sugar]
1 tbsp 15 mL vanilla
1/2 cup 125 mL miniature chocolate chips
Éclair Dough:
1/2 cup 125 mL butter
1 cup 250 mL water
1/4 tsp 1 mL salt
1 cup 250 mL all purpose flour
4 eggs
Chocolate Glaze:
1/2 cup 125 mL heavy cream
2 squares semisweet chocolate

Directions:
Filling: In a medium bowl combine all ingredients, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Éclair Dough: Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). In a medium saucepan, mix water, butter and salt. Bring to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and slowly pour in flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Put back on heat and continue to stir until the dough dries out and stops sticking to the sides of the pot. Remove from heat; add eggs, one at a time, stirring until mixture turns glossy. Fill a decorating bag with dough. On a non-stick cookie sheet, squeeze out “˜finger-sized Éclairs”™, spacing well apart. Bake for 30 minutes.
Glaze: In a small saucepan, heat the cream over medium heat just until it boils. Immediately turn off the heat. Place the chocolate squares in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted and smooth. Set aside and keep warm.
When Éclairs are cool, carefully slice each horizontally with a serrated knife. Place equal amounts of Ricotta filling into the bottom half of each Éclair, cover with Éclair top and drizzle with chocolate glaze. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to use.
Makes 18 Éclairs.
