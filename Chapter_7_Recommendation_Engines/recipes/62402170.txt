Description: 
This cake is sure to be a hit layered with caramel, flan and chocolate cake.  You can find this cake in most mexican bakeries.  The first time I tried it, I knew I had to find a good recipe.  Finally after much pleading the woman gave it to me!  It's very time consuming but worth the end result! This is sure to be a hit.
