Ingredients:
2 cups plain whole milk yogurt
1 cup whipping cream
1 1/8 cups raw sugar
1 cup pumpkin puree
3 tablespoons brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/8 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Combine the yogurt, cream, sugar, pumpkin puree, brandy, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and salt in a mixing bowl. Whisk together until the sugar and salt have completely dissolved. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency, about 20 minutes. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded container. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Description: 
My own recipe for delicious pumpkin frozen yogurt using my favorite formula of 2 cups yogurt, 1 cup whipping cream.  Just creamy enough to suit our taste, fewer calories than ice cream, and great pumpkin fall-time flavor. I churned it using my KitchenAidÂ® Ice Cream Bowl Attachment. Hope you enjoy it.
