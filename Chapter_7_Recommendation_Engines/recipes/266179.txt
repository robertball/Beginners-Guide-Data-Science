Description: 
This used to be a slow cooker meal that would take a full day to make... but now I have adapted it for the pressure cooker and the process now takes far less time. This is my go-to recipe for pot roast on a busy weekday. It uses inexpensive cuts of meat, namely beef chuck, made posh by the slow cooker. After years of tweaking others' recipes I think I found a good mix of high-quality pot roast while still being very quick and easy.
