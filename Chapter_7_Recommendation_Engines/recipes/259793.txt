Ingredients:
styrofoam block
lollipop sticks
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ®)
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) container prepared vanilla frosting, at room temperature
waxed paper
1 (14 ounce) bag confectioner's coating, or more as needed
1 (1.75 ounce) package multicolored candy sprinkles, or as needed

Directions:
Poke holes 2 to 3 inches apart into 1 side of the foam block using a lollipop stick.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and oil in a bowl with an electric mixture until blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Let cake cool until easily handled, about 20 minutes.
Crumble the cake into a bowl using your hands, discarding any hard or lumpy pieces. Mix in frosting until thoroughly combined.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Roll the cake mixture into 48 uniformly sized cake balls. Arrange cake balls on lined baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
Melt confectioners' coating in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Remove 3 cake balls at a time from the freezer. Dip the tip of a lollipop stick into the melted coating, then insert stick halfway into a firm cake ball. Dip cake ball into the coating; tap to remove excess coating. Scatter sprinkles over the cake ball. Stick cake pop upright in the prepared foam block. Repeat with the remaining sticks and cake balls.
