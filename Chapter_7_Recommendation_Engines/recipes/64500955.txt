Ingredients:
For Cake
2 cups, White Granulated Sugar
0.75 cup, Butter, softened at room temperature
3 Large Eggs
1.5 tsp, Vanilla Extract
3 cups, All-Purpose Flour
3.5 tsp, Baking Powder
1/8 tsp, Salt
1.5 cups, Buttermilk or Whole Milk
3 tbsp, Instant Coffee
For Butter Cream
2 cups (4 sticks), Butter, softened at room temperature
0.25 cups, Kahlua liquor, or strong espresso
3-4 tbsp, Heavy Cream
3 cups, Confectioner's Sugar
1/8 tsp, Salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F and line a cupcake pan with liners
In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla. Mixing ingredients by hand helps avoid over-mixing, which will lead to a dome-shaped cupcake.
In a separate bowl, combine together the flour, baking powder and salt. Measure out the buttermilk, then add the instant coffee; stir to dissolve completely.
Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean
Remove the cupcakes from the pan and cool on a wire rack.
For the Butter Cream: Mix the softened butter in a mixer bowl until light and fluffy
Add the Kahlua and heavy cream, then begin adding the confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup at a time. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl often
Add the salt and mix for another 5 minutes to get a very fluffy butter cream
Transfer frosting into a pastry bag. Once cupcakes are completely cooled, frost with butter cream.
Store cupcakes in air-tight container in the refrigerator if not serving right away. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before serving.
