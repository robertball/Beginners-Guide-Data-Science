Ingredients:
6 small bell peppers
(for an extra kick, use jalapeno peppers instead)
8 oz. cream cheese
1 c. salsa (any kind)
3/4 c. shredded pepper jack cheese
1 1/2 c. crushed tortilla chips

Directions:
Wash the peppers and cut them in half, from top to bottom.  Rip out the stems, seeds and membranes, then set aside.
In a mixing bowl, blend together the cream cheese, salsa and shredded pepper jack cheese.  Then, gently fold in the crushed tortilla chips.
Spoon the cream cheese mixture into the pepper halves and serve immediately.
**If you have leftover filling, serve it as a dip with additional tortilla chips.

Description: 
My friends and I get together for a weekly dinner and we all takes turns bringing different parts of the meal.  It was my turn to bring an appetizer and I was tired of doing the same old stuff.  I had some peppers still on my plants from summer, so I decided to do something with them.  Here's what I came up with.  I didn't measure anything, so use your judgment when making these; my measurement estimations may not be exact.
