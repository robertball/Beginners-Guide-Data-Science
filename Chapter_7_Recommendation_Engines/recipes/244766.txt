Ingredients:
1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Mix 1/2 cup lukewarm water and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Combine 1/2 cup water, olive oil, honey, and salt in a separate bowl; add 1 cup flour and mix well. Mix yeast mixture into flour mixture. Add remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough is well combined.
Knead dough on a floured work surface until dough is soft, smooth, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Roll dough into 4 calzone shapes.

Description: 
Ready in a snap and my kids love it! This can be used for pizza dough too. My dear chef friend Darrin Gleason shared this recipe with me over ten years ago while attending college. It has been a go-to recipe for my family for all these years and I thought I should share it with my cooking community.
