Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds red potatoes, cubed
3 tablespoons white vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1 bunch arugula - rinsed, dried and torn

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and cool. Transfer to a large bowl.
Meanwhile, mix vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl.  Drizzle in olive oil,  whisking until mixture thickens.
Toss potatoes with vinegar and oil mixture and arugula. Serve at room temperature.

Description: 
A different and yummy potato salad; it uses no mayonnaise.  This is a nice alternative to use arugula, rather than just adding it to a green salad.
