Ingredients:
6 cherry tomatoes, whole
2 medium green pepper, quartered
2 medium red bell pepper, quartered
1 small yellow zucchini/squash sliced thick
1 large red onion, quartered
6 fresh mushrooms, halved
1.5 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1.5 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground italian seasoning(freshly ground is best)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
about 4 skewers

Directions:
Skewer the vegetables and place in a 9" x 13" pan. In an x-small bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; drizzle and/or brush over vegetables(both sides). Grill over medium heat for approximately 10 minutes or until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the tips blackened-or to desired doneness-some like them soft, I like the tips burnt- However, some veggies-like tomatoes- cook quickly and may need to be removed before the others. Enjoy!
