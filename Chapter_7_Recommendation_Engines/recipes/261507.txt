Ingredients:
2 turnips, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch wedges
1 small beet, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 cup distilled white vinegar
1 cup water
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon sea salt

Directions:
Divide turnips, beet, and garlic between two 16-ounce Mason jars.
Combine vinegar, water, sugar, and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and pour over turnips, leaving 1/2 inch of space on top. Seal jars and refrigerate for 1 week.

Oh Tri Goodness
Description: 
Finally, the underestimated and neglected turnip takes the stage. Oh that crunchy, fuchsia goodness! A staple in the Middle East, pickled turnips are the perfect addition to many dishes or wonderful on their own. This recipe will yield 2 Mason jars worth of pickled turnips, but I recommend making more than less since it does require planning ahead by 1 week.
