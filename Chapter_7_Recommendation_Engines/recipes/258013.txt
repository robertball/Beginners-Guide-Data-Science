Ingredients:
1 (8 inch) soft flour tortilla
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons tomato sauce
1 cooked chicken breast, sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
2 green onions, finely chopped
1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 pinch dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove tortilla from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top. Arrange chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce; cover with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza cutter.

Description: 
This is an extremely easy/fast way to prepare a delicious pizza that is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that is can be devoured alone! I make this often when entertaining guests and it always goes fast. You can make any sort of topping variations. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it. I cook this also with my family. Each person gets their own tortilla to, as my kids say, decorate.
