Ingredients:
6 Cups of rye bread cubes--cut into 2 inch pieces
1 Cup of mashed potatoes
1 Cup of diced cooked cabbage
2 Cups corned beef, cut into bite size pieces
2 Cups shredded swiss cheese
BATTER:
4 eggs beaten
2 Cups 1/2 and 1/2 or heavy cream
1 tsp. caynenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Spray a 2 1/2 quart glass casserole dish with non-stick spray.  Place half the rye bread cubes on the bottom of the casserole.  Next spoon the mashed potatoes evenly over the bread, do the same with the cabbage and then the corned beef.  Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups of the swiss cheese over the corned beef and top with the remaining bread.  In a medium bowl beat the eggs, cream and cayenne pepper and pour evenly over the entire casserole.  Use a fork to gently press the bread under the batter, allowing as much of the batter to absorb as possble.  Keep the casserole at room temperature for 20 minutes before baking.  Bake the dish at 350 degrees for 30 to 45 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, without the egg batter.  Half-way through baking sprinkle the remaining swiss cheese over the top.  Allow the casserole to sit for 15 minutes before serving.
