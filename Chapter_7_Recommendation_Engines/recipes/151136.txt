Ingredients:
1 cup wild rice
3 cups water
1 cup brown rice
2 cups water
2 cups chopped pecans, toasted
2 cups golden raisins
8 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
3 oranges, zested and juiced
1/2 cup dry Marsala wine (optional)
1/2 cup olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
In one saucepan, combine the wild rice and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 40 to 50 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed.
In a separate saucepan, combine the brown rice and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed.
After both kinds of  rice have finished cooking, spread out on baking sheets to cool and dry for about 30 minutes.
In a large  bowl, combine the wild rice, brown rice, pecans, raisins, green onions, mint, orange juice and zest. Stir in the wine and olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Cover and set aside for 2 hours to blend flavors. Serve at room temperature.

I have made variations of this festive rice dish many times with rave comments from my guests.  It will vary almost every ingredient, the rice, citrus, dried fruits. It is healthy and you can serve it all year long.
