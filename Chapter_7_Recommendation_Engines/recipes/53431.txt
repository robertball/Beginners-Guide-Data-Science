Beat together cream cheese and butter until fluffy with an electric mixer.  Add remaining ingredients except red bell pepper; beat well.
Place a piece of plastic wrap on a baking sheet.  Spoon cheese mixture onto plastic wrap to form a candy cane shape, log or ball.  Fold up plastic wrap over cheese to encase.  Refrigerate until cheese is firm, about 4 hours or overnight.
Unwrap cheese mixture.  Place on serving plate.  Smooth entire shape with spatula or knife.  Decorate with bell pepper.  May be covered and refrigerated overnight.
