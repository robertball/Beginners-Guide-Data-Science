Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups rolled oats
1 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon molasses (optional)
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place rolled oats and brown sugar in a bowl. Pour melted butter over oats and stir to combine. Let mixture stand at room temperature overnight so oats absorb butter.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet very well, or line it with greased parchment paper.
Mix salt, molasses, flour, egg, and vanilla into oat mixture. Drop level teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Bake only 12 cookies per pan.
Bake in preheated oven until edges are brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Allow to remain on sheet a few minutes, until firm, then immediately remove with spatula to cooling rack.

Description: 
These need to stand overnight. Do not make them in hot, humid weather as the cookies absorb moisture from the air and become limp.
