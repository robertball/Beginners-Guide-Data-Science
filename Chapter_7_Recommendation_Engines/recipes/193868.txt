Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups coconut milk
1 tablespoon water, or as needed (optional)
1 1/4 cups white rice flour
2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

Directions:
Preheat  oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray mini-muffin pans with cooking spray.
Mix together the coconut milk with the water in a mixing bowl. Stir in white rice flour, shredded coconut, and salt. Spoon the mixture into the prepared mini muffin cups, and sprinkle with sugar if desired.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown and crusty, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Delicious coconut muffins that contain no eggs, no oil, no wheat flour, and it's very easy to make. Crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside. This is actually a recipe from Indonesia, and they use a different type of cooking tool, which is heavy steel and the dough cooked on the stove. Since I don't have that equipment, I am using the muffin baking tray and baking them instead, but they still come out very good and tasty. You can freeze some of them; also reheat with microwave, or serve in a party for snacks.
