Ingredients:
1 (19.8 ounce) package brownie mix
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup water
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place brownie mix, vegetable oil, water, and eggs in a bowl; stir 50 strokes with a spoon.
Spoon the brownie batter into ice cream cones, filling them about 3/4 full. Place cones on an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a brownie center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
