Description: 
The most thick and delicious potato soup ever.  I created this soup after having a similar soup at a restaraunt.  Incredible comfort food with ease!  It's a very simple recipe to adjust to your taste. We always add extra garlic and cheddar and switch between peeled and unpeeled potatoes.  My family always asks for this soup in the winter!
