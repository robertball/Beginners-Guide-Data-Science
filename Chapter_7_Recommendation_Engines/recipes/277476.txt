Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
1 (8 ounce) package butterscotch chips
1 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each interval, until melted, 1 to 3 minutes.
Melt butterscotch chips in a second microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl for 15 seconds at a time, stirring after each interval, until melted, 1 to 3 minutes.
Microwave sliced almonds on a microwave-safe plate on high for 1 minute at a time, stirring after each interval, until light brown and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add 1/2 of the toasted almonds, 1/2 of the cranberries, and 1/2 of the apricots to the melted chocolate; stir until blended. Add remaining almonds, cranberries, and apricots to the melted butterscotch; stir until blended. Drop alternating spoonfuls of each mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and drag a knife through the mixtures several times to create a marbled effect.
Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour. Break into 24 pieces.
