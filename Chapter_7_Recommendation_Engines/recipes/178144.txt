1 tablespoon garlic powder

Description: 
This is a rub you can use on basically anything from chicken to toast for a mild zest! This rub is great on grilled meats such as steak, pork, chicken, or turkey. It's also ideal for stir-fried or steamed vegetables. My favorite way to use this rub is to rub some on sourdough bread and toast until the bread is browned and crunchy.
