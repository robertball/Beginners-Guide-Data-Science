Ingredients:
4 medium unpeeled yellow onions
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and fresh ground pepper
Balsamic vinegar (optional)

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lowest position; heat to 425 degrees.
Cut onions in half; toss with oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Place, cut-side down, on a lipped cookie sheet.
Roast until tender and cut surfaces are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Adjust seasonings; drizzle with balsamic vinegar.

I love Roasted Onions - no peeling, and the cut surfaces turn rich caramel brown.
