Ingredients:
1 1/2 c flour
1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs
1 c firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 t baking soda
3/4 c (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened
6 ounces Cheddar cheese, thinly sliced
2 1/2 c baking apples, cored, peeled, and sliced
3/4 c granulated sugar
1/2 c chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bow, mix together the flour, graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, baking soda, and butter.  Set aside 1 1/2 cups of the crumb mixture and pat the rest into an ungreased 9x13 inch baking dish.  Place the cheese slices on top of the crumb mixture.
In a medium bowl, combine the apples and granulated sugar.  Layer over the cheese.  Add the nuts to the reserved crumb mixture and sprinkle over the apples.  Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool completely, then cut into 2-inch squares.
