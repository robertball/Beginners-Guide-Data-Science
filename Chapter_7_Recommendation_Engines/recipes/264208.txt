Ingredients:
2 tablespoons salted butter
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon psyllium husk
1/2 cup baby kale
5 sun-dried tomatoes, cut into strips

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, turning shrimp after 30 seconds, until only slightly pink, about 1 minute. Add cream cheese and heavy cream; increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring frequently, until cream cheese is melted and no lumps remain, about 2 minutes.
Sprinkle garlic powder, basil, salt, and pepper into the skillet and stir well. Mix in Parmesan cheese until well combined. Let simmer until sauce starts to thicken, about 5 minutes. Add psyllium husk. Cook and stir until desired thickness is reached, 5 to 7 minutes more. Fold in kale and sun-dried tomatoes. Remove from heat.

Description: 
Tender shrimp in our famous creamy keto garlic-Parmesan sauce, without the carbs! One forkful and you'll wonder where this has been all your life... I serve mine over a bed of steamed shredded cauliflower. Good over spinach salad as well!
