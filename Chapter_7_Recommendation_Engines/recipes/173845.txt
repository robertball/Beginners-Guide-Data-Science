Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup half-and-half cream
3/4 teaspoon lemon zest
3/4 cup fresh huckleberries
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter and lemon juice until evenly mixed and slightly crumbly. Whisk together the eggs and half-and-half in a small bowl; add 3/4 teaspoons lemon zest with the egg mixture to flour mixture, and mix gently just until well blended and forming a dough. Fold in the huckleberries.
Divide dough in half, and on a floured surface, shape each half into a ball, then flatten slightly. Cut each round into six wedges; place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 12 minutes. Whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice to make a glaze. Drizzle glaze on cooled scones. Sprinkle with remaining lemon zest for garnish.
