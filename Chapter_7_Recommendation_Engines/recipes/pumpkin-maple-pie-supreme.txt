Ingredients:
1 small sugar pumpkin
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup real maple syrup
1 1/4 cups half-and-half cream
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
3 eggs
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
Cut up pumpkin, and remove seeds. Place in large baking pan, and cover with foil or lid. Bake for 1 hour, or until very tender. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Scrape pumpkin into a food processor; puree until smooth. Measure 1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree. In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and salt. Stir in maple syrup, half-and-half, and flour. Mix in eggs one at a time. Pour filling into unbaked pie shell.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until center is set.

Description: 
The first pumpkin pies were nothing like we make today. The most available sweetener was maple syrup, REAL maple syrup. I decided to try adding that to these pies and what a difference! This is my husband's favorite pie, using actual pumpkins that we grow. Using REAL maple syrup is key to the flavor. For extra special times, I serve with maple-sweetened whipped cream.
