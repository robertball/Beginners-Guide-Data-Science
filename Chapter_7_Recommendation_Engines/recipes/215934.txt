Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese
1 teaspoon grated lime peel
1 teaspoon lime juice
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust, room temperature
1/4 cup chopped sliced almonds
1 (21 ounce) can LUCKY LEAFÂ® Premium Blueberry Fruit Filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, lime peel, lime juice, sugar, and almond extract until creamy. Remove 3/4 cup cheese filling; set aside.
Unroll one pie crust and press it into glass 9-inch pie pan, pressing crust up sides and bottom. Sprinkle the bottom of crust with chopped almonds, lightly pressing down into the crust; spoon and spread 3/4 cup cheese filling over the bottom and sides of pie crust.
Unroll the second pie crust; press or roll smooth and place over the cheese filling. Press crusts together; tuck top edges under the rim to form fluting crust; flute crust. Lightly prick bottom crust with fork to remove any air bubbles. Spread LUCKY LEAF Blueberry Pie Filling into crust; place spoonfuls of remaining lime cream cheese over pie filling; lightly swirl together with spoon to form a designed top.
Bake in preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes; reduce heat to 375 degrees; continue baking for 25-30 minutes or only until the crust is golden. Let cool, for 15-20 minutes.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.
