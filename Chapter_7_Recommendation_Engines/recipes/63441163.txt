Ingredients:
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 Tbs Fig preserves with Ginger
1 Tsp minced garlic
1/4 cup chardonnay or other white wine
Olive oil

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet large enough to accommodate the two chicken breasts.
Brown the chicken on each side then remove from heat.
Add preserves, garlic and white wine, stir until blended.
Return chicken to pan, cover, reduce heat and simmer on low for 15 minutes.
Halfway through, turn the chicken so both sides are coated.

Description: 
Quick to make, not your usual chicken. The paring of figs, garlic and ginger make a sweet and savory glaze as the chicken cooks.
