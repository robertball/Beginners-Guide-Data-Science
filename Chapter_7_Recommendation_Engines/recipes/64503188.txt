Ingredients:
1 cup gluten free sourdough starter, at room temperature
1/2 cup fine chestnut flour, unsifted
1/4tsp ground cinnamon
1/8tsp baking soda
1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature (not melted)
1/2 cup milk, at room temperature
2 medium eggs, at room temperature
1 Tbsp natural syrup (rice, maple, honey or agave)
1/2 cup milk, at room temperature
1 tsp baking powder (optional)

Directions:
Turn on your waffle iron.
In a large mixing bowl whisk 1/2 cup of milk, the eggs, the syrup until smooth. Add the chestnut flour, cinnamon, and baking soda by sprinkling them over the egg mixture while mixing well the whole time.
Fold in the sourdough starter until fully incorporated, yet taking care not to mix too much as this will allow the gas to escape and result in a flat waffle.
At this point check for consistency. If the batter is too thick add a touch more milk a couple of Tbsp at a time making sure it has a viable consistency but trying not to stir too much.

Nothing screams Autumn like chestnuts. Naturally leavened gf sourdough starter mixed with fine chestnut flour gives this waffle a smooth, smoky flavor accented by a buttery soft inside and a light crispy shell outside. Top with your favorite pumpkin butter or pumpkin syrup and you'll be ready to play in the leaves.
