Ingredients:
2 cans sweet peas, drained
1/2 cup mayo (I used Miracle Whip -- your preference)
1 TBSP prepared yellow mustard
4-5 eggs (may use less -- this is also your preference)
Relish (a couple of tablespoons)
Salt/Pepper (optional)

Directions:
Hard boil the eggs.  Peel and chop them, like you would for potato salad.  Mix the drained peas, and all ingredients together in a bowl or plastic container.  Cover and chill well.

Description: 
Delicious -- similar to potato salad, but with peas instead of potatoes.  It may sound weird, but I get MANY requests for the recipe once people try it.  Even my husband, who HATES peas and will pick them out of recipes that have them, gobbles this up.  Give it a try!  (My mother-in-law passed this recipe down to me.)
