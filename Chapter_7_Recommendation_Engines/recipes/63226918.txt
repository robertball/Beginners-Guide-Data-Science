Ingredients:
2 large russet potatoes
2-3 Tblsp. olive oil
1 tsp. dried dill or parsley
1 tsp. paprika
2 tblsp. grated parmesan cheese
2 tsp. kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.  Wash potatoes; peel if desired.  I like them with the skins on.
Quarter and cut potatoes in 1/2-3/4 inch chunks. Place in a medium sized bowl.  Add olive oil and toss to coat the potatoes.
Mix the remaining ingredients together and toss with potatoes.
Place potatoes in a single layer in a 13x9 pan.  Bake for 40-45 minutes or until nicely golden brown.

Description: 
Yummy!  Country-fried potatoes made in the oven.  Crispier and less greasy than pan-fried. I like it best with the dill.
