Ingredients:
cooking spray
12 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
2 onions, thinly sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup non-dairy butter
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups vegetable broth
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x13-inch baking dishes with nonstick cooking spray.
Layer potatoes and onions in the prepared baking dishes, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper.
Melt non-dairy butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour until blended. Whisk in vegetable broth, stirring constantly, until sauce boils and thickens. Pour sauce over the potatoes and onions; sprinkle paprika over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and golden brown, about 50 minutes.
