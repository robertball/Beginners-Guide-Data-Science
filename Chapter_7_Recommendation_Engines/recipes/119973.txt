Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
3 cups mashed fresh strawberries
1 cup whipped topping
BLUEBERRY SAUCE:
1 (12 ounce) package frozen unsweetened blueberries
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Line the bottom and sides of a 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan with a double layer of heavy-duty foil; set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and sour cream until light. Fold in strawberries and whipped topping. Pour into prepared pan. Cover and freeze for several hours or overnight.
In a saucepan, bring the blueberries, sugar and water to a boil; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer to a blender; cover and puree until smooth. Cover and refrigerate.
Remove strawberry cream from the freezer 15-20 minutes before serving. Use foil to lift out of pan; remove foil. Cut into slices with a serrated knife. Serve with blueberry sauce.
