Still over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the same skillet.  Add the sliced pork and stir-fry until it has lots it's pink color.  Stir in the curry; cook 1 minute.  Drain the pork of any excess oil and return to the skillet.

Description: 
This is a recipe I recently pulled out from my hand-typed Tried and True recipe binder.  I hadn't made it in many years, and my family loved revisiting it.  It's still as delicious as ever!
