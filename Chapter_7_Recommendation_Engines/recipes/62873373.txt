Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 green chile peppers, seeded and diced
1 small sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken broth
1 can diced tomatoes
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, minced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
8 oz. package cream cheese, cubed
1/4 cup white cornmeal
1 can black beans
1 can sweet corn
one whole roaster chicken, cooked and pulled from the bone
salt and white pepper to taste
tortilla chips for garnish

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, heat oil and saute peppers, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the onions are translucent.
Add chicken broth and bring to a boil.  Add tomatoes, cilantro, cumin, and cream cheese, and mix with a hand blender until mixture is uniform and smooth.  (Alternatively, you can transfer the mixture to a regular blender in small batches.)  Sprinkle in cornmeal gradually, and whisk until no lumps remain.
Stir in beans, corn, pulled chicken, salt and pepper, and simmer over low heat for 10-20 additional minutes.  Serve garnished with tortilla chips.
