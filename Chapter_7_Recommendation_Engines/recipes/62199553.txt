Ingredients:
40 Saltines (the saltier the better)
1 cup light brown sugar (not dark)
1 cup (2 sticks) butter
12 oz bag chocolate chips
1/2 cup - 1 cup chopped nuts (pecan or walnut or whatever you like).

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place the saltines in a jelly roll pan in 8 rows of 5.  Melt butter on low heat in a nonstick pot.  Add brown sugar, increase heat to medium and stir gently continuously.  At the first sign of bubbles (boiling) set timer for 3 minutes.  Stir continuously while boiling.  At exactly 3 minutes remove from heat.  Do not overcook.  Pour over saltines and distribute it as evenly as possible.  Put in the oven for 5 minutes on 400 degrees.  After baking, spread chocolate chips across the top and allow to soften for 1 to 2 minutes.  With the back of a spoon spread the chocolate chips over the top of the crackers evenly in a gentle circular motion.  While still warm sprinkle as many nuts as you like across the top.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  Break into bite size pieces and enjoy!
Substitute the chocolate chips and nuts with your own combos.  For example, dark chocolate and shredded coconut.  Milk chocolate and peanut butter chips, or white chocolate, or butterscotch.  Itâ€™s all good!
