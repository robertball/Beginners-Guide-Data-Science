Description: 
Belle Plaine, Iowa's June Formanek sends a fruity streusel-topped bread delightful for brunch. This is a great make-ahead treat that freezes well, too.

I omitted the nuts for allergy-related reasons, swapped out the cinnamon for allspice to make the flavor more interesting, and the flour in the topping for crushed ginger snaps.Modified from: Dutch Apple Bread
