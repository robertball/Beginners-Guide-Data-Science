Ingredients:
4 cups sliced California Almonds, roasted*
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pound fine-quality bittersweet chocolate
1/2 pound fine-quality semi-sweet chocolate
3 ounces milk chocolate or white chocolate (optional)

Directions:
Oil a large baking sheet. Set aside.
In a large heavy saucepan bring butter, sugar, water, vanilla and salt to a boil over moderate heat, stirring with a wooden spoon. Boil mixture, without stirring, until deep golden, about 12 minutes.
Remove pan from heat and stir in 2 cups roasted almonds. Immediately pour onto reserved baking sheet. Spread evenly and then place into the refrigerator to set.
Chop chocolate. In a hot double boiler, melt chocolate until smooth. Pour chocolate over cooled almond toffee and spread evenly with an offset spatula.  Sprinkle top with remaining almonds. If desired, drizzle top with melted milk chocolate, or white chocolate for contrast.  Chill uncovered until firm, at least 1 hour. Break toffee into pieces.
