Ingredients:
3 1/4 cups penne pasta
1 tablespoon butter, or more to taste
1 1/2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups milk
1/2 cup frozen peas
1/2 cup frozen sweet corn
1 (7 ounce) can tuna, drained
1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook mushrooms and onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk. Add peas and corn. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add tuna and 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and mix to combine.
Drain penne and fold into the sauce. Spread in a large baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the top is golden, 20 to 30 minutes.
