Ingredients:
1 (.87 ounce) package brown gravy mix
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups tomato sauce
1 cup diced tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir gravy mix, water, and milk together in a bowl until dissolved and smooth.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and crumble in ground beef; add onion, mushrooms, and garlic. Cook and stir until the beef is evenly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Stir gravy mixture, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, oregano, and basil into ground beef mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Bring beef-tomato mixture to a boil, reduce heat, cover skillet with a lid, and simmer until heated through, 10 minutes.
Stir Cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, and egg noodles into beef-tomato mixture; pour entire mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Top casserole with Parmesan cheese. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and noodles are cooked, about 25 minutes.
