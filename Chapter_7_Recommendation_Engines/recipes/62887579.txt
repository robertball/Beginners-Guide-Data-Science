Ingredients:
3 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon molasses
8 tablespoons (1 stick) cold butter, cut into peices
2 large eggs
3/4 cup coconut milk
shredded coconut for topping

Directions:
Heat your oven to 400 degrees.  Line a large cookie sheet with foil.
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and molasses.
Using a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the mixture until it is well integrated.
Beat together the eggs and the coconut milk, then add them to the mixture and mix.  When a dough begins to come together, invert the bowl onto a floured surface and kneed until a uniform dough has been formed and the ingredients are well mixed.
Cut the dough into three pieces.  With each piece, form a ball, then pat the ball down into a disc about 3/4 inches thick.  Cross cut each disc into four peices.
Arrange the scones on the cookie sheet and top with the shredded coconut, pressing down lightly to keep it in place.
Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 25 minutes.  Check your scones at 15 minutes then every few minutes after.  They should be lightly browned.  Remove them to cool on a rack.

Description: 
Europe meets the tropics in this delicious morning treat.  Make sure you use a coconut milk you trust as some brands are more watery than others.  Working with cold butter is essential.
