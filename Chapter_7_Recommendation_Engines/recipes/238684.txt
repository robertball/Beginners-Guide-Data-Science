Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
32 fluid ounces water, or more if needed
1  yellow onion, peeled and slits cut into it
1 bunch celery, stalks (including leaves) separated
3  carrots
2 tablespoons tomato paste, or more to taste
1 tablespoon salt
5  whole black peppercorns
1  bay leaf
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, each cut in half

Directions:
Combine chicken stock, water, yellow onion, celery, carrots, tomato paste, salt, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large pot; bring to a gentle simmer. Decrease heat to medium-low and simmer, checking the flavor occasionally, until vegetables are slightly tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
Bring stock to a boil and add chicken, pouring in more water if chicken isn't completely covered in liquid. Bring poaching liquid to a boil; remove pot from heat and cover tightly with a lid until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Poached chicken has much more flavor and a better taste than boiled chicken. If you want to eat more lean protein, give this recipe a try. I like to eat the veggies!
