Ingredients:
20 ounces bread flour (about 4 cups)
12 ounces water
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon active or instant yeast

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.
Set your mixing bowl on a scale (if using), zero the scale, and pour the flour in. Zero the scale again and add the water. Add the salt. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water to allow it to dissolve.
Fit the bowl into the mixer and, using the paddle attachment, mix on medium speed until the dough has come together. Replace the paddle with a dough hook.  Continue mixing until your dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
Remove the mixing bowl from the machine, cover it with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise to about twice its size. Push a finger into the dough. The dough should give some resistance, but not spring back. If it springs back, let it rest longer.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it to expel excess gas and redistribute the yeast. Cover with a dish towel and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Shape the dough into a boule by pushing the dough back and forth on the counter in a circular motion until you have a round smooth ball.
Cover the dough with a dish towel and allow to rise for about an hour.
Slice an X into the top of the dough to help it to expand.
Grease dutch oven.
Place bread inside dutch oven, cover with lid and bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.  Reduce over to 375°F and continue baking with lid on for 20 minutes.   Remove lid and continue baking for 25 minutes to 35 minutes.
