Ingredients:
1/2 cup old-fashioned oatmeal
3/4 cup almond milk
1/2 cup almond flour
1 ripe banana
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
cooking spray

Directions:
Place oats in a blender and blend into a fine powder. Add almond milk, almond flour, banana, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt; blend until well mixed. Let batter sit until thickened, about 10 minutes.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and coat with cooking spray. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the hot skillet and cook until bubbles form and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
