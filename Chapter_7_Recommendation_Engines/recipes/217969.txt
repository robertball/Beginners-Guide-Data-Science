Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked rotini pasta
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 cup chunky blue cheese dressing
1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 pound frozen cooked chicken strips, defrosted and diced
1/2 cup red bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup green bell pepper, diced
1 cup red onion, diced

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Stir together the mayonnaise, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce, salt and pepper in a large bowl.  Add the chicken, bell peppers, red onion, and cooked pasta and toss to coat with the dressing. Cover and chill at least 1 hour in the refrigerator before serving.
