https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless, skinless salmon fillet
4 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
3 tablespoons green onions
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
dash Tabasco sauce

Directions:
Rinse and pat fish dry.  Place in a shallow baking pan you've greased well or sprayed with nonstick spray (line with foil for quick cleanup).  Brush fish with 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees.
While fish is baking, combine your remaining ingredients, including the final 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Remove the fish from the oven when the time's up.  Spread it with the cheese mixture, and put under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese mixture is golden brown and fish flakes easily.
