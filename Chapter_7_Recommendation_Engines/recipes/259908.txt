Ingredients:
3 cactus figs
1 cup water
1/2 cup white granulated sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

Directions:
Remove the outer skin of the cactus figs to expose the light green flesh. Push the flesh through a mesh sieve into a bowl, collecting the juice and trapping the seeds and pulp.
Combine water and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; allow to cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Stir cactus juice and lime juice into the sugar water. Mix thoroughly; chill for 1 hour.
Pour cactus-lime mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
