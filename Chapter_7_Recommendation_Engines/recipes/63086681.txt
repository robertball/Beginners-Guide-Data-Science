Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained with ricer
1 T butter
2 green onions, finely chopped (light parts only)
8 eggs, beaten
1 cup cream cheese
1 cup sour cream
1 cup heavy cream
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
12 strips crispy bacon, crumbled
2 or 3 Roma tomatoes, chopped
6 to 8 Peppadews, chopped
Jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/2 sleeve crushed Ritz crackers
Salt & pepper to taste
Tabasco (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Butter a 9 inch pie pan.
Cook spinach with 1 T butter  in microwave for about 2 minutes.
Add 7 strips of the crumbled bacon (remainder is reserved for topping), 2 cups cheddar and all other ingredients except eggs and Ritz crackers. (If cream cheese isn't soft enough to blend, heat in microwave for a minute.)
Stir well, taste and season with salt & pepper.
Mix in eggs.
Pour into baking dish and bake approximately 30 minutes.
Remove from oven and add crushed Ritz crackers mixed with another 1/2 cup or so of cheddar. Sprinkle this on top and then add reserved bacon to top.
Place back in oven until set. For me, the total cooking time was about 45 to 50 minutes.
Let stand about 15 minutes before cutting.
Serve with Tabasco on the side if desired.
