Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
4 egg whites
1 cup milk
1/2 cup applesauce
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 48 mini-muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir the flour, sugar, baking powder, pumpkin puree, egg whites, milk, applesauce, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and ginger together in a large bowl until everything is just moistened; pour into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
