Ingredients:
1/2 cup Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Valentina)
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon brown sugar, or more to taste
4 chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a small baking dish.
Mix the hot sauce, paprika, ground cayenne pepper, and brown sugar in a bowl, and stir until the mixture is well combined. Place the chicken thighs in the baking dish, and coat them with a layer of sauce. Cover the dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake until the chicken has cooked through, and the sauce has thickened and started to brown, about 20 more minutes.

Description: 
My husband is Mexican, and he loves spicy chicken from the supermarket. I was trying to recreate one of the spicy packaged chicken dishes at home, and that's what i came up with. Chicken thighs are softer and juicier. It is very spicy and tangy, easy to make, and he loves it!
