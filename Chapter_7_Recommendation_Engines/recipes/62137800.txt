Ingredients:
1 medium onion
1 tsp minced garlic
1 medium cabbage
2 Tbsp canola oil
1/4 cup oyster sauce
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut the cabbage in half and discard the core. Slice into wedges. Saute the onion and garlic in a wok until the onion turns translucent. Add the cabbage and stir fry to desired doneness (we like ours a little on the crispy side). Add the oyster sauce and salt and pepper and stir fry for another minute or so.  Serve with rice. Good as a side dish to any grilled meat.
