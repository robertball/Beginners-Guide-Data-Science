Ingredients:
The Bar Mixture:
1/2 cup of softened butter
3/4 cup of sugar
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. orange zest (the zest of one orange)
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup white chocolate chips
White Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting:
One 8oz. package of softened cream cheese
1 tsp. vanilla extract
A pinch of salt
1/2 cup of melted white chocolate chips
3 cups of powdered sugar
1/2 cup of dried cranberries for topping

Directions:
*Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
The Bars:
*In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and eggs.  Make sure it is well combined and the add the vanilla extract and the orange zest.
*Combine flour with the baking powder and salt in a smaller bowl and mix the flour mixture into the creamed mixture.
*When the dough is thoroughly combined add the cranberries and the white chocolate chips.
*Grease a 9" by 13" baking pan and spread mixture evenly throughout the pan.
*Bake for 20-25 minutes in a 350 degree oven. The bars should be golden brown.
The Frosting:
*First melt the white chocolate chips in the microwave.  Use intervals of 15-20 seconds.
*In a bowl beat together the cream cheese, a pinch of salt and the vanilla.
*Add the melted white chocolate chips and beat thoroughly.
*Begin adding the powdered sugar one cup at a time until it is thoroughly combined. If it is not thick enough add a little bit more powdered sugar.
Frosting and Decorating:
*When the bars are cooled spread the frosting on the bars evenly.
*Sprinkle the dried cranberries on the bars evenly.
*You can reserve some of the frosting and use a pastry bag to drizzle some over the dried cranberries. Either use a fine tip or cut the tip off of the bag so that only a little comes out at a time.
Serving:
*Cut them into eight squares(one cut across the 13" and three down the 9") and then cut each square at an angle to make 16 rectangular bars.
*Keep bars chilled until it is time to serve them.
