Roasted Carrot Fries Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
24 oz baby carrots (the small thin baby carrots, not the thick chunky "baby-cut" carrots)
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil
kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
In a larger bowl, mix together the balsamic mixture with the carrots so that the carrots are fully coated.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.  Spread out the carrots evenly on the tray.  Bake for 20 minutes and stir.  Bake for another 15 minutes and check to see if they're done. (They should have a french fry consistency - you should be able to easily spear the carrot with a fork.)  Continue baking for another 5-10 minutes if needed.  Sprinkle lightly with kosher salt and mix well before serving.  Serve with your favorite dipping sauce for sweet potato fries, or sprinkle with some fresh Italian parsley.

Description: 
A healthier version of sweet potato fries.  The balsamic vinegar doesn't really have a strong flavor in the end - it just sweetens the fries a bit so they are more similar to a sweet potato fry.
