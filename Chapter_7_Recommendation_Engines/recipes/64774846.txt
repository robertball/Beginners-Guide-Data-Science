Ingredients:
12 savory Hawaiian rolls
½ lb shaved roast beef from deli, chopped up
1 can consommé
Spicy horseradish
1-3 jalapenos to desired level of heat
Provolone
Pepper jack cheese
About ¼ cup flour give or take
Worcestershire sauce
Salt/pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop roast beef roughly so is just a loose crumbly meat.  Finely chop jalapenos and add to sauce pan with beef consommé.  Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer roast beef on medium low  heat, just to heat.  Add flour to thicken into gravy.  Stir constantly until thickened.  Then remove from heat.
Preheat oven to 300.  Just warm enough to melt cheese and toast the sandwiches.
Slice rolls in half without separating rolls from eachother.  Put on baking sheet and remove top layer.  Put 6 slices of cheese on bottom halves of bread.  Spoon meat mixture atop bottom layer  of cheese.  Cover with 6 additional slices of cheese.  Then on top of that cheese, add a THIN schmear of horseradish sauce.  Replace top rolls and bake until melty.  Then I cut each slider apart.  Enjoy!

Description: 
Sloppy melty goodness.  Usually I make this without the flour to thicken the broth into a gravy, so can absolutely do it without the flour and just strain the meat before putting on the sliders and then use the sauce like an au jus to dip in on the side but I preferred these with the meaty gravy.  Reminded me of a grown up sloppy joe.  Yum!
