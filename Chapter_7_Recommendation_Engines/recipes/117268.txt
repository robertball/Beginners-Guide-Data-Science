Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups cold milk
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk milk and pudding mix for 2 minutes; let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Stir in chocolate chips. In a small mixing bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add peppermint extract; beat until soft peaks form. Fold into pudding.
Transfer to an ungreased 8-in. square dish. Cover and freeze for 2 hours or until firm. Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before cutting.
