Ingredients:
- 2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin (ground)
- 1 tsp caraway (seeds or ground)
- 1 chipotle, in adobo sauce plus 1 tsp adobo sauce
- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound)

Directions:
Combine the first six ingredients in a mortar. Smash together to form a paste. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread half of the spice paste over the chicken, front and back.
Place chicken in a shallow bowl (or in a re-sealable plastic bag). Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.
Preheat a grill or grill pan.
Brush chicken with oil. Season with salt and pepper. Grill over moderate heat, turning until cooked through, about 9 minutes.
Serve chicken with the remaining harissa for diners to try the extra heat! Or store the harissa in a closed container (for up to 1 week) for another time.

Description: 
If you are interested in a little bit of heat, but not too much, this is a great recipe for you. I used a mortar and pestle to form the spice paste, but you can easily use a small bowl and the back side of a spoon. Be sure to pair it with sides that counteract the heat. I served this alongside rice with peas and onions mixed in. It was perfect! The salad that I served the chicken on top of, Green Chile and Tomato Salad, is also another recipe of mine on this site.
