Ingredients:
1 cup Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons garam masala, divided
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon salt
3  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup heavy cream
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 cloves garlic, minced
1  jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water, or more as needed
½ cup ketchup
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Whisk Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, lemon juice, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, black pepper, ginger, and salt together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, and work the marinade into the chicken until it is coated. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.
Transfer chicken and marinade to a slow cooker. Add heavy cream, tomato sauce, garlic, jalapeno pepper, remaining 1 tablespoon garam masala, butter, cumin, paprika, and salt; mix with a ladle to combine.
Cover and cook on Low for 5 hours, or on High for 3 hours, until chicken juices run clear.
Whisk cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl until completely combined, adding more water if necessary. Add to the slow cooker. Mix in ketchup. Cook on High for an additional 20 minutes. Serve with cilantro.
