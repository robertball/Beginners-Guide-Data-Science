While chicken cooks, cut 4 (1/4-inch) slices from orange, reserving remaining orange for another use.  Recoat pan with cooking spray.  Add orange slices; cook 1 minute, turning after 30 seconds.  Add orange juice mixture to pan, scraping to loosen browned bits.  Return chicken to pan.  Bring to a boil; cook, uncovered, 4 minutes or until chicken is done and sauce is thickened, turning chicken once.
