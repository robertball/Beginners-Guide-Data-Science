Ingredients:
2 lbs ground or cubed pork
salt & pepper to taste
2 med. onions, chopped
6 Tbsp flour
2 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes with juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 C fresh roasted or frozen green chiles (not canned)
6 C beef or chicken stock
Jalapeno peppers (optional)

Directions:
In a large pot, brown the pork &amp; onions, seasoned with the salt &amp; pepper.  Drain &amp; return to pot.  Sprinkle with flour and stir to coat.  Cook for 3 minutes while stirring to avoid a raw flour taste.  Add tomatoes &amp; garlic.  Cover &amp; simmer for 30 minutes.  Add the stock &amp; stir to combine.  Cover and simmer for 1 or more hours.  Adjust season to taste.  Add more stock for a thinner chile or add more flour mixed with cold water to thicken the sauce.

Description: 
Great by itself served in a bowl accompanied with flour tortillas and assorted condimdents.  I offer shredded cheese, raw onion, sour cream and crushed red pepper or hot pepper sauce for those that are more adventurous!  You can adjust the heat to your taste by the type of chiles you use or adding the jalapenos.  We buy fresh roasted green chiles in the fall, when they are in season, from roadside vendors and fill the freezer to have on hand to make this year round.  This is also a wonderful topping for burritos, baked or mashed potatoes, eggs or anything that you want to add a little kick to!
