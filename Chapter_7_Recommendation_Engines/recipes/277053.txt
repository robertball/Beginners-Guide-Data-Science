Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk, divided
10 ounces milk chocolate, chopped
2 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 (3.5 ounce) package sea salt microwave popcorn
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons golden syrup

Directions:
Combine 1 can of condensed milk and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Beat cooled chocolate mixture using an electric mixer on low speed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cream and beat on medium speed until thick and creamy, 3 to 4 minutes.
Spoon mixture into 12 individual serving dishes. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or overnight.
Place packaged popcorn in the microwave; cook on high until popping begins to slow down, about 2 minutes.
Combine remaining condensed milk, butter, and syrup in a saucepan over medium heat until boiling, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir constantly until thick, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in popcorn.
Divide gooey salted caramel popcorn over chilled mousse.

I've been hooked on this recipe ever since I tasted it the first time, a long time ago. It is the most delicious chocolate mousse I've ever tasted! And combined with the salted caramel popcorn, it's amazing. As well as its delicious flavor and texture, it is also very easy to make, and doesn't take long at all. I bet you'll love it!
