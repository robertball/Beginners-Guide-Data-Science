Description: 
We love this quinoa salad! It's another easy cold lunch for my wife to bring to work. The quinoa and garbanzo beans provide a double protein punch, and the lemon-basil dressing is simple, light, and fresh. You can't help but to admire the beautiful splash of color from the vegetables.
