Ingredients:
1 ¾ cups water
1 cup quinoa
¾ cup dried cranberries
1 cup bite-size broccoli pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
½ cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine water and quinoa in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 8 minutes. Add cranberries; cook until plump and quinoa is tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain; fold into the quinoa mixture.
Mix olive oil, orange juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a small bowl to make dressing. Pour over quinoa mixture; toss to combine. Sprinkle walnuts on top.
