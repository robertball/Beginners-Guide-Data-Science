Description: 
This Fuzzy Beach Balls recipe was dreamed up prior to our annual beach trip in August 2015. We wanted something fun and unique. The alcohol-infused melon balls (aka Spiked Balls) adds a fun kick and is the signature ingredient of this drink. Everyone loved it, some a bit too much! We're including both the batch and individual recipes below. Release your inner beach! Enjoy and share with friends.
