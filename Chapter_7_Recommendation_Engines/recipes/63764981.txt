Ingredients:
2 head of cauliflower (about 5 lbs)
4 small garlic cloves (minced)
2 egg s
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp oregano
pinch onion powder

Directions:
Remove green stems and leaves from cauliflower heads and chop into large florets. Run cauliflower through a juicer. (The juice can be used for something else or discarded) Collect the cauliflower pulp, you should have about 1 lb.
In a small skillet add 1 tbs olive oil over medium heat. Add your minced garlic and sautee about 30 seconds over medium heat. Mix cauliflower pulp with sauteed garlic, and all remaining ingredients. Mix well.
Cut a piece of parchment paper to the size of your pizza pan. Spray it with non-stick spray and then form the cauliflower dough in an even layer on the pan. Pat down along all edges until it looks like a crust.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-45 minutes or until golden brown and slightly firm to touch. Sides may be a darker shade of brown and that's ok.
Remove from oven and add pizza sauce, mozzarella and pizza toppings. Go easy, remember, it's thin crust. Bake for another 5 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly. Top with fresh tomatoes and basil. Best served immediately!
