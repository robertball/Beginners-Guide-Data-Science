Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut oil for frying
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons dark soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1 pinch black pepper

Directions:
Heat the peanut oil in a wok or skillet with high sides over medium-high heat until almost smoking; add the green beans. Quickly cook and stir the beans in the hot oil until they are bright green and starting to show brown spots, about 2 minutes. Remove the beans to a bowl. Drain all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the pan and return to heat. Cook and stir the ginger and garlic in the oil until they have started to brown, about 2 minutes. Return the green beans to the wok; add the dark soy sauce, sugar, and black pepper. Cook until hot; about 30 more seconds.
