Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork
1 large egg, slightly beaten
1 small onion, finely chopped or grated
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
1 to 2 cups water
breadcrumbs
olive or vegetable oil
Optional:
I also usually add whatever's on hand to give the budgers a little something extra: a little oregano, thyme, herbes de Provence, etc...or go with some paprika and a little ancho powder.  These are just some suggestions and can be altered to taste or completely left out.

Directions:
Combine the first 4 ingredients.  Salt and pepper to taste; add any optional seasonings at this point as well.
Stir in water a little at a time, letting the meat mixture absorb it until it reaches a sour cream like consistency.  (you can add a little breadcrumbs to get back the thickness or help with the stickiness)
Heat enough oil to cover the bottom of a frying pan on medium heat (between a 4-5).
Scoop up medium sized "balls" of meat (using a tablespoon here helps a bit), dredge in breadcrumbs.
Fry burgers at medium heat for 5-6 minutes per side.
