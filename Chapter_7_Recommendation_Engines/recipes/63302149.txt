Ingredients:
1 - 19 oz can coconut milk (Chaokoh brand is our favorite)
3 Tbl. Massaman Curry Paste
1/3 cup honey
1/8 tsp. cardamom
1 tsp. sea salt
4 cinnamon sticks
6 bay leaves
2 cups small red potatoes, quartered
1 cup carrots, coarsely chopped
1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped
1 green pepper, coarsely chopped
peanuts and cashews, optional

Directions:
Heat coconut milk and massaman curry paste in a pot over medium heat and stir.  Whisk frequently to keep mixture from sticking.  It will be ready when you see red oil bubbling or cook 15 minutes if it doesn't bubble.
Reduce heat to med-low and add sugar, cardamom, sea salt, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves and cook for 5 minutes.
Add red potatoes and bamboo shoots and add enough water to barely cover.  Increase to med-high heat and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes.
Add carrots and enough water to barely cover and increase heat to a boil again.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes are almost tender (10 to 20 minutes). Add onions and green peppers and cook for 5 minutes
Serve over basmati or jasmine rice.
Garnish with peanuts or cashews.

Description: 
My husband and I love massaman curry, but wanted to try a version with more vegetables, so we created one.  It turned out wonderfully and my children loved it!
