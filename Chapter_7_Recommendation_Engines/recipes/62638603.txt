Ingredients:
Large can of fat free vegetarian refried beans.
taco seasoning
low fat sour cream
four large diced tomatoes or a can of well drained tomatoes
Guacamole. (I use avocados mixed with Herdez mild salsa).
little can of diced green chilies.
shredded Mexican cheese mix I use a whole bag.
Optional: you can also add green onions and/or black olives on top

Directions:
Layer one: Large can of fat free vegetarian refried beans.
Layer two: mix taco seasoning into low fat sour cream and spread over beans.
Layer three: four large diced tomatoes (use your jug dement for adequate coverage.
Layer four: Guacamole. (I use avocados mixed with Herdez mild salsa). Tomatoes will anchor the sour cream layer.
Layer five: one cute little can of diced green chilies. Suggest wee flinging through fingers for even spreaddage.
(Optional: you can also add green onions and/or black olives on top)
Layer seven: shredded Mexican cheese mix. Or to taste. I use a whole bag.

Description: 
I would like to share with you all my very special Seven Layer Bean Dip recipe. Get out a pen and paper. Casserole dish for dip, and a strong chip like Mission Rounds. Dip is thick- will destroy lesser chips.
