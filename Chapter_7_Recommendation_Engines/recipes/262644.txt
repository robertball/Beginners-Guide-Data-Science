Ingredients:
1 cup water
2 cloves garlic
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 artichokes, trimmed and stemmed
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Combine water, garlic, bay leaf, and salt inside a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Place steamer in the pot. Add artichokes, trimmed top facing up; drizzle with lemon juice. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid.
Cool until easily handled. Pull off outer petals one at a time. Pull through teeth to remove the soft portion of the petal. Discard remaining petal. Spoon out fuzzy center near the stem and discard. Eat the bottom whole or cut into pieces.
