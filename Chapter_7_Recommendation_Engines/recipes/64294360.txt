Ingredients:
1/2 cup of cannellini beans
1 Carrot, minced
1/2 Onion, minced
1 Celer stalk, minced
2 TBSP of Extra virgin olive oil, divided
1.5 grams salt
1 pinch Black pepper
1 dash of Sage, finely minced
250 grams of semolina rice flour
1 teaspoon of ground turmeric
Warm water, as needed

Directions:
Soak beans as required.
Heat olive oil in a pot and sauté celery, carrot and onion for 5-10 minutes, stirring, until translucent.
Strain and rinse beans and add them to the pot. Stir and cook for 5 minutes coating well. Add some hot water – about 6 cups – and cook until the beans are tender.
Add salt, pepper, and sage.
In a mixing bowl, add flour, turmeric, 1 Tbsp oil and add some warm water and knead until a soft but dry dough is formed. Set aside, covered, for 30 minutes.
Roll the dough on a clean surface – I use a wide wood cutting board – or use a pasta machine. You can use some more semolina rice flour to dust if the dough is sticky. When the pasta is thin, cut it into 2 inch rhombus shapes and set aside to dry a bit.
When the soup is ready, add the maltagliati and let cook for 5-10 minutes. You don’t want it to be al dente, but a bit mushy. Serve warm and sprinkle with more ground black pepper.
