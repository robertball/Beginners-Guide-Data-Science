Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
4 cups torn kale leaves
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
4 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Cook and stir the garlic and ginger in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Stir the kale into the garlic and ginger mixture; continue cooking and stirring 1 minute more.
Add the drained spaghetti to the kale mixture; toss while cooking about 30 seconds before adding the soy sauce and water. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes.
Make a well in the middle of the spaghetti mixture. Pour the eggs into the well; gently fold the eggs into the noodle mixture as they cook until they are evenly distributed through the noodles and cooked, about 5 minutes.
Season with the crushed red pepper flakes. Drizzle the sesame oil over the noodles to serve.
