Ingredients:
6 red potatoes, cubed
1 cheesy smoked sausage ring
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
6 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. While the potatoes are cooking, brown the sausage ring in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skin is browned, cut into 2 inch pieces.
Transfer the potatoes and sausage to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Drizzle the olive oil over them, and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven. While the sausage and potatoes are baking, reheat the same skillet with the sausage juices over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs, and cook, stirring occasionally, until eggs are scrambled and cooked through. Stir into the sausage and potatoes before serving.
