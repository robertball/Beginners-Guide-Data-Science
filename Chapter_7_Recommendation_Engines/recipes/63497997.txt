Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
16 ounces tomato sauce
1 cup chopped onion, about 1 medium onion
1/4 cup chopped celery
1 (15.5 ounce) can red kidney beans
1 cup frozen corn
1 cup water
1/8 cup chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble, and place in a medium, thick-bottomed stockpot.
Add all ingredients to stockpot with browned ground beef. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Add additional water before serving for a thinner consistency, if desired. (Place lid on pot to avoid evaporation of liquid if you feel it is getting too thick.)
Garnish with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream & onions.
