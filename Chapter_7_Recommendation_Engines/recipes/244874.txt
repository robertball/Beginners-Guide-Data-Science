Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups millet, rinsed and drained
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
1 cup frozen peas
3/4 cup white wine
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
4 plum tomatoes, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook and stir millet in a large saucepan over medium heat until fragrant and toasted, 5 to 8 minutes.
Bring vegetable broth to a boil in a large saucepan; add millet and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover saucepan, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, 18 to 22 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir onion mixture, spinach, and peas into millet; add wine and rosemary and stir. Increase heat to medium, cover saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper; return cover and cook until tomatoes soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir Parmesan cheese into millet mixture.

Description: 
A savory vegetarian pilaf of millet and vegetables, flavored with rosemary and wine. My daughter loved that it was made with 'birdseed' and she gave it the silly title. Serve with additional fresh grated Parmesan.
