Ingredients:
2 cups strawberries, cut into pieces
2 cups blueberries
2 cups rhubarb, cut in small slices
3/4 cup sugar (more or less)
1 cup flour
1 cup rolled oats
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Combine fruit and sugar, and place in greased 9Ã—13 pan.  If you would like a thicker crisp as we do, just put fruit in a smaller, deeper dish.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, oats, salt, sugar and butter.  Sprinkle oat mix on top of fruit.  Bake for 40 minutes or until fruit is bubbling and the top is golden brown.  Let it cool a bit before serving
