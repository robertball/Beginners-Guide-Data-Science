Ingredients:
4 cups water
4 cups broccoli florets
2 tablespoons margarine
1 onion, chopped
1 large stalk celery, chopped
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder
2 1/2 cups whole milk
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a medium-sized cooking pot, add water and broccoli florets and bring to boil; reduce heat and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain, reserving all of the water.
In a food processor or blender, process half the cooked broccoli until fairly smooth. Chop remaining broccoli and set aside.
In a heavy-bottomed cooking pot, melt butter or margarine, add onion and celery and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes until soft. Stir in flour; cook, stirring constantly for about 1 to 2 minutes. Add reserved water and chicken bouillon granules, and bring to boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium; simmer, stirring constantly until thickened.
Stir in milk, nutmeg, pepper, and processed and chopped broccoli, and heat through. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve garnished with grated cheddar cheese.
