Ingredients:
1/8 cup olive oil
1/8 cup soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
3 tablespoons Bourbon seeded mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1 (1 pound) boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
Whisk together the olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, mustard, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Place the pork loin in a large sealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour before cooking.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer the pork loin to a baking dish; pour marinade over the pork.
Cook in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
