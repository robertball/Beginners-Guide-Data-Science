Ingredients:
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 medium red onion, coarsely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 cups vegetable broth
1 (14.5 oz) can Italian-style diced tomatoes
1 tbsp. dried Italian seasoning
1 tbsp. dried celery flakes
1 tsp. white pepper
1 tsp. dried marjoram
1 1/4 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup uncooked brown rice
1 1/2 tbsps. balsamic vinegar
Parmesan cheese to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pot. Saute the onion and garlic until softened.
Stir in broth, tomatoes, seasonings, lentils and rice. Bring to soup to a boil, then cover and reduce heat. Let simmer for 55 minutes.
Just before serving, stir in 1 1/2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar. I use tomato-flavored balsamic vinegar, so feel free to experiment with different varieties. Top with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

Description: 
Red lentils and brown rice make for a thick vegetarian soup that's full of fiber, filling you up quickly. I came up with this when I only had a few ingredients to work with while in the mood for lentil soup. Enjoy.
