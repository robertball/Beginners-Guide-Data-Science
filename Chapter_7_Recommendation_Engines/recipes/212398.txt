Ingredients:
9 pounds pork shoulder, cut into cubes
3 tablespoons garlic powder
1/4 cup fennel seed
2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
4 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1/2 cup dry white wine
15 feet 1 1/2 inch diameter hog casings, rinsed

Directions:
Combine the pork cubes with the garlic powder, fennel seed, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and parsley; grind through a coarse plate. Mix in the white wine and grind again. Stuff into the rinsed hog casings, twisting into 4-inch lengths. Cover and refrigerate overnight to allow the seasonings to infuse into the meat before cooking or freezing.
