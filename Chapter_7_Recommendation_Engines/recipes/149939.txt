Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 shallot, minced
1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
8 ounces fresh green beans, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and jalapeno; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Add green beans and season with salt. Cook and stir until tender but still bright green, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat and stir in lemon juice to loosen any bits from the bottom of the pan. Serve immediately.
