Ingredients:
1 gallon apple juice
1 gallon apple cider
3 cups white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
12 cinnamon sticks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 whole cloves
1 (1 liter) bottle 151 proof grain alcohol (such as Everclear®)
2 cups cake-flavored vodka (such as UV®)

Directions:
Combine apple juice, apple cider, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, vanilla extract, and cloves together in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sugars are dissolved, about 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and cool completely, about 1 hour.
Stir grain alcohol and vodka into apple juice mixture. Remove cinnamon sticks and set aside. Pour moonshine into bottles; add 1 cinnamon stick per bottle and seal. Store moonshine in refrigerator.

Description: 
This recipe tastes amazing cold or warmed and the alcohol taste is very minimal. The longer it sits in the jars before you drink it, the better it will taste!
