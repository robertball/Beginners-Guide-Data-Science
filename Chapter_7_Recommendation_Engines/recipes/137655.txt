Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds sea scallops
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 tablespoons butter
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons grated orange zest
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until very hot. Season the scallops with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook the scallops in the hot oil until evenly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the scallops and set aside.
Melt the butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Cook the green onions and orange zest in the butter for 1 minute. Stir in the wine and then the cream; bring to a boil while stirring and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the scallops to the sauce, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer together until the scallops are heated through, about 5 minutes.
