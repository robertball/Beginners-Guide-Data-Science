Ingredients:
8 Yukon Gold potatoes
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 yellow chile peppers
2 garlic cloves
14 ounces queso blanco (fresh white cheese)
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, or more as needed (optional)
4 leaves lettuce, or more to taste
2 hard-boiled eggs, halved
6 large black olives, halved

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes; cook until tender when pierced with a fork, 30 to 45 minutes. Drain and let cool, about 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a small saucepan. Add yellow chile peppers and garlic cloves; cook and stir until lightly golden, about 2 minutes.
Transfer chile peppers and garlic cloves to a blender. Add queso blanco and vegetable oil; blend until smooth. Thin with heavy cream until a creamy consistency is reached.
Arrange lettuce leaves on a large platter. Cut potatoes in half and place on top. Pour sauce over potatoes. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs and black olives.
