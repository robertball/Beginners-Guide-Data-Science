Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground round
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
3 cups cooked long-grain rice
1 cup fat-free sour cream
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1/4 cup skim milk
3/4 cup reduced-fat Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Cook first 3 ingredients in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until meat is browned, stirring to crumble. Add water and next 6 ingredients (water through chiles); bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Uncover and simmer an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.
Combine the rice, sour cream, sliced green onions, and milk in a bowl. Spoon rice mixture into a 9-inch baking dish. Top with beef mixture; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 375 degrees for 10 minutes or until thoroughly heated. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
