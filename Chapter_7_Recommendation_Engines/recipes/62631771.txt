Ingredients:
16 Boston Bibb or butter lettuce leaves
1 pound chicken (chopped into small cubes)
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon distilled vinegar
1/4 cup of sweet and spicy chili sauce
1 tablespoon of Korean red pepper flakes
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 teaspoons Asian sesame oil

Directions:
Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not tear them. Set aside.
In a medium skillet over high heat, brown the chicken in 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring often and reducing the heat to medium, if necessary. Drain, and set aside to cool. Cook the onion in the same pan, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, vinegar, chile pepper sauce and pepper flakes to the onions, and stir. Stir in chopped water chestnuts, green onions, sesame oil, and cooked chicken; continue cooking until the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.
Arrange lettuce leaves around the outer edge of a large serving platter, and pile meat mixture in the center.
