Ingredients:
3 lb Chicken Breast
2 small onions
1 green pepper
½ C celery (approx 2 stalks)
2 medium cloves garlic
1 bunch Green Onions
3 Tbs Fresh Parsley
½ C Vegetable Oil
½ C Flour
4 C chicken broth
1 tsp Ground Black Pepper
½ tsp Crushed Red Pepper
2 tsp Sweet Basil
½ tsp Cayenne Pepper
1 Tbs Tony  Chachere's Original Seasoning

Directions:
1.  Dice all vegetables into similar sized pieces (including parsley).  Set aside.
2.  In skillet, brown chicken in a small amount of oil and Tony’s seasoning.  (you may also broil it to cut a bit of fat).  Remove from skillet and set aside.
3.  In 2 quart sauce pan, heat vegetable oil, then add flour to make a roux (a thick 'gravy' of oil and floud, will turn an even light brown when ready).  Using low heat, add vegetables, stirring to coat thoroughly in the roux, then cover and simmer until tender (approximately 20 minutes).
4.  Slowly add chicken broth, stirring until completely blended.  Bring to boil and add remaining ingredients except the chicken.
5.  Reduce heat, maintaining simmer, and cover for 30 minutes.
6.  Add chicken and stir well.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir thouroughly, then let stand covered for 10 minutes.  Serve over cooked rice.
*Notes:  You can use less chicken if you shred it instead of cubing.  This recipe can be doubled and freezes fantastically, but do NOT double the roux!
