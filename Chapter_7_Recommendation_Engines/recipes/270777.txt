Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 tablespoon garlic paste
1/2 tablespoon ginger paste
3 whole cloves, or more to taste
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon water, plus more as needed
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon roasted ground cumin

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook until beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic paste and ginger paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in cloves, bay leaves, chili powder, cumin, coriander, and 1 tablespoon water. Stir and cook until spices have started to release their oils, 2 to 3 minutes. Add beef and stir to combine. Cook until beef begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
Pour in 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook until water has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric. Cook until beef starts to release oil, about 5 minutes more. Add 1 tablespoon more of water if needed to maintain moisture in beef and curry consistency.
Cover and cook, stirring occasionally until mixture has thickened, another 10 minutes. Add cinnamon and cardamom; cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat and add roasted cumin.
