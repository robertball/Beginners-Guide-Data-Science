Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon grill seasoning
4 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed and cut into eighths
2 sheets aluminum foil
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
Mix olive oil and grill seasoning together in a large bowl. Add potato wedges and toss to coat.
Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil. Crumple up foil slightly and grease with cooking spray. Arrange potato wedges on the foil so that they are not touching and have enough room to cook.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until brown and crispy, about 25 minutes.
