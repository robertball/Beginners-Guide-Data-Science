Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons tamarind paste
1 stalk lemon grass, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon muscovado sugar
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
20 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
2 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter
2 tablespoons chopped peanuts
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 teaspoons red Thai curry paste
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon brown sugar

Directions:
Place vegetable oil, soy sauce, tamarind paste, lemon grass, garlic, cumin, coriander, lime juice, muscovado sugar, and chili powder in a blender and process to a smooth paste. In a large bowl, or a large resealable plastic bag, toss chicken strips with marinade. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
In a small saucepan, combine peanut butter, peanuts, coconut milk, curry paste, fish sauce, tomato paste, and brown sugar. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until smooth. Keep warm.
Thread chicken onto skewers. Grill until no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Serve with peanut sauce.
