Ingredients:
1 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
2 carrots, thinly sliced
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 clove garlic, minced
3 cups water
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
2 cubes beef bouillon
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey sausage in the hot pot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir carrots, onion, mushrooms, 1/4 cup parsley, and garlic into sausage. Cook and stir until onion is soft, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour water, garbanzo beans with liquid, beef bouillon cubes, and sage into sausage mixture. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Skim and discard any accumulated fat. Season with salt and pepper; garnish with remaining 4 teaspoons parsley.

Description: 
Yummy! This soup is great! I make this soup when I make an Italian dinner for guests and everyone wants the recipe. It's also great on those cold winter days where suppers call for a hot and delicious soup. A combination of sausage and vegetable in a beefy broth. This may be made a day in advance. Tastes even better the second day. Enjoy!
