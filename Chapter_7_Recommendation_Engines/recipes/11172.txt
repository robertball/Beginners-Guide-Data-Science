Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Oil mold with vegetable oil or spray. Dust mold with flour, then tap mold on side to remove any excess flour. Press dough into mold, scraping excess off with a knife so that dough is flush with the edge of the mold. Loosen edges and let dough fall onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Let cool for a few minutes before removing from sheet.
