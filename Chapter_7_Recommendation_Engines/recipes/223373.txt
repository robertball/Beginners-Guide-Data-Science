Ingredients:
1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic
1/4 large onion, chopped
1/4 large onion, sliced
1 (2 pound) beef rump roast
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups cooked brown rice

Directions:
Mix beef broth, mushroom soup with roasted garlic, chopped onion, and sliced onion together in a slow cooker until thoroughly combined; place the beef rump roast into the soup mixture, cover the cooker, and cook on Low until beef is very tender, at least 7 hours.
One hour before serving time, remove the roast from the cooker and cut into bite-size pieces; remove and strain 2 cups of beef broth and set aside. Return beef pieces to the slow cooker.
Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat and stir in flour to make a paste. Reduce heat to low and cook and stir the flour mixture until it bubbles and turns golden brown, about 15 minutes. Watch carefully because the mixture burns easily. Whisk about 1/4 cup of the reserved beef broth into flour mixture at a time and bring gravy to a simmer.
To serve, spoon brown rice onto serving plates and top with beef pieces; pour gravy over beef.
