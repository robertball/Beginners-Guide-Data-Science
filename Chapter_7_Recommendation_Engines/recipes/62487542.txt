Title:
Diane's Colcannon a la Jayni Recipe

Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 small head cabbage, chopped
About 3 T. Canola oil
1 large onion, chopped
1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste
Real bacon bits, bottled--to taste
1/4 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Place potatoes in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender.
Heat canola oil in a large frying pan (an "every day pan" is ideal!).  Saute the cabbage and onion until soft and translucent. Putting a lid on the pan helps the vegetables cook faster.
Drain the cooked potatoes, mash with milk and season with salt and pepper.
Fold in the bacon bits, cabbage, and onions, then transfer the mixture to a large serving bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in the melted butter.
POSSIBLE VARIATION:  Next time I may try mixing the melted butter into the dish before transferring it to the serving bowl, so that certain PIGS at my table won't get an unfair share!
LOL
Serve immediately.

Description: 
This was EXCELLENT.  The only change I made was to add salt (about 1.5 teaspoons) to the water in which the potatoes were cooked--I find it's impossible to get potatoes salty enough if you don't add salt to the cooking water.  

I know I'll miss the flavor, but to economize on cholesterol, next time I may use canola oil to cook the cabbage/onion, and add bottled REAL bacon bits.  This would also make the recipe a little faster to prepare.  

I don't think the FLAVOR of the original can be beat!Modified from: Diane's Colcannon
