Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can chunk chicken, drained
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
⅛ cup chopped dill pickle
⅛ cup chopped onion
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
¼ cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Without breaking up large chicken pieces, empty canned chicken into medium bowl. Stir in mayonnaise, pickle, onion, sunflower seeds, and cranberries; mix until well blended and very large chicken chunks are broken up.

Description: 
A sweet, but healthy chicken salad. The sweet secret is dried cranberries. Awesome on homemade bread or on crackers. I spread cream cheese on the bread or crackers, and top with chicken salad.
