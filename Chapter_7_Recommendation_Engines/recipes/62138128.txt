Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix (Betty Crocker, supermoist works best)
2/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1 container (8 oz) sour cream (1 cup)
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup chopped pecans
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
Simple Powdered Sugar Glaze
1/3 cup stick margarine or butter
2 cups powdered sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2-4 tablespoons water

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F (325°F for dark or nonstick pan). Grease and lightly flour bundt pan, or spray with baking spray with flour.
In large bowl, beat dry cake mix, oil, eggs and sour cream with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, then on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Spread half of the batter in pan.
Stir together brown sugar, pecans and cinnamon; sprinkle over batter in pan. Carefully spread remaining batter evenly over pecan mixture.
Bake 50 to 55 minutes or until deep golden brown.
Cool 20-30 minutes and invert on cake plate.  Cool completley.  Use Simple Glaze for frosting.  Store covered.
Simple Glaze
Melt margarine in a saucepan. Stir in powdered sugar and vanilla. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until smooth and of desired consistency (a thick syrup). Drizzle over cooled cake.  This simple glaze can be enhanced by changing the Vanilla with any Extract.  Some of my Favorites are Lemon, Orange, or Rum.

Description: 
This cake exudes wonderful childhood memories of special occasions and holidays.  The yellow cake is so moist it will melt in your mouth.  I recently taught my daughter how to make it, so this is a family tradition being passed down.
