Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup margarine
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
salt to taste
1 (16 ounce) jar natural peanut butter
ghost-shaped cookie cutter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a non-stick baking sheet.
Whisk flour and baking soda together in a bowl. Beat margarine and sugar together in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in egg until evenly combined. Stir flour mixture into margarine mixture until dough is just combined; stir in vinegar.
Turn dough onto a floured surface and roll into an 1/8-inch thick rectangle. Cut dough into ghost shapes using the cookie cutter. Arrange ghosts on the prepared baking sheet. Prick holes into each ghost using a clean pin. Sprinkle ghosts with salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until crackers are golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes. Allow crackers to cool completely. Spread peanut butter onto cooled crackers.
