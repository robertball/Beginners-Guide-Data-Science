Ingredients:
1 cup butter
½ cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans
¾ cup sifted confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C.) Lightly butter 2 baking sheets, or line with parchment paper.
Cream the butter, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Sift together the flour and salt; mix into the butter mixture. Stir in the pecans. Dust your hands with a little of the confectioners' sugar and roll the dough into 1 inch balls.
Place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets and bake for 25 minutes or just until brown.  Put on racks to cool for 15 minutes, then roll in the confectioners sugar.
