Ingredients:
1 pound pumpkin
salt
1 and 1/4cup flour
1/4cup+2tbsp.butter
1/4cup+2tbsp.grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Remove the rind and green part before cutting pumpkin in large pieces and cooking in lightly salted water.When cooked strain and transfer to a board.Add the flour a little at a time,and a pinch of salt,adding more flour if the dough is to soft.Everything depends on the flouriness of the pumpkin itself.Knead all the ingredients well to obtain a fairly soft and elastic dough.Form the dough into finger-thick rolls,then cut into 3/4 inch pieces.Form the gnocchi into their characteristic hollowed shape against the back of a fork, (i like a grater).Boil the gnocchi in plenty of salted water a few at a time so thet they do not stick together.Remove with a slotted spoon as they float to the surface.Transfer to individual plates,cover with plenty of melted butter and sprinkle with grated Parmesan.Serve piping hot.
