Ingredients:
Chocolate batter
3 cups shredded zucchini
3 cups of sugar
1 and 1/2 cups of canola oil
3 eggs
3 cups flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon vanilla
Cream Cheese Swirl
1 8 ounce package cream cheese
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
Topping
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
1/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Grate 3 cups of zucchini. Remove any large chunks. Pieces should be fine.
In mixing bowl combine 3 cups of sugar and canola oil. Add 3 eggs. Mix well on low.  Add shredded zucchini and  1 teaspoon vanilla. Mix again on low.
Sift 3 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of cocoa, 2 teaspoons soda, and 1 teaspoon salt into a separate bowl,
Measure out 1 cup of butter milk.
Start the mixer on low. Gradually add 1/4 of the flour mixture and then 1/4 cup of the buttermilk. Continue to alternate adding these ingredients until all are incorporated. Then mix for 1 minute on medium high speed so the batter is lighter.
Spray a sheet pan with baking spray. Pour in chocolate batter and spread evenly.
In a separate bowl,combine softened cream cheese with sugar.  Then add 1 egg and mix until all are combined smoothly.  This can be done by hand. If the cream cheese is too firm, an electric mixer can be used.
Spoon the cream cheese mixture over the cake in drizzles. Then use a table knife to swirl the cream cheese filling into the chocolate cake batter for a marbled effect.
Sprinkle with milk chocolate and mini semi-sweet chips.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.
