Ingredients:
2 cups milk
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1/3 cup semolina

Directions:
In a small saucepan, stir together the milk and sugar. Set over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Milk tends to boil over as soon as it boils, so stay with it! When it boils, immediately remove from the heat. Stir in the semolina, and return to the burner. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until thickened but still pourable. Pour into serving bowls, and top with your favorite hot cereal toppings.
