Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the cake mix into a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and add peanut butter, oil, eggs, and water. Mix until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Flatten slightly using a fork dipped in water.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Let cookies set on cookie sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before carefully removing from the cookie sheet to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
This is a quick recipe for cookies when you are in a crunch for time and need to have something for the dessert platter now!  These are very soft and taste great.  I have yet to have anyone toss these cookies back on my platter.
