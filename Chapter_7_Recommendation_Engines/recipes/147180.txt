Description: 
I was experimenting at camp one day when I was tired of drinking wine, beer, and all those sweet coolers.  What a nice, refreshing surprise this was!  This is just what you need when you get tired of the same old thing. It's light-tasting and very refreshing. All you need is lime vodka, club soda, a splash of cola, and lime slices!
