Ingredients:
4 pork chops
2 tablespoons of butter
Dash of onion powder on each pork chop
Dash of garlic powder on each pork chop
8 slices of cheese
12 pieces of any type of bacon (best with smoked though)

Directions:
TIP.   If you don't move quickly then the cheese won't melt     and the bacon won't sink into the cheese.
1.  Melt the butter in a fry pan. Cook the pork chops at   medium heat for around five minutes on each side. While thier cooking dash the onion powder and garlic          powder over the pork chops.
2.   RIGHT as their done cooking put 2 slices of cheese on top of the pork chop. Quickly put a bowl over them to keep the heat in. In the same pan cook the bacon on medium heat for around 6 min.
3.   DO NOT WAIT FOR BACON TO COOL DOWN! While using paper towels or gloves or a hand towel, wrap three strips of bacon around each pork chop.
SUGGESTION. If you want it to melt more, put the wrapped pork chops in the pan again on low heat covered till it melts enough for you.
