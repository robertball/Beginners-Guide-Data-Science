Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound tilapia fillets
salt and pepper to taste
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded and sliced
1 bunch fresh asparagus spears, trimmed and chopped
poultry seasoning
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the honey, lime juice, and garlic. Season tilapia with salt and pepper, place in the bowl, and marinate 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
Arrange the squash and asparagus in the baking dish. Place tilapia on top of vegetables, and season with poultry seasoning. Discard remaining marinade.
Bake 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until vegetables are tender and fish is easily flaked. Sprinkle with mozzarella, and continue baking 5 minutes, or until cheese is lightly browned.
