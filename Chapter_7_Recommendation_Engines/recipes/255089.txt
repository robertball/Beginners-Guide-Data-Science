Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup skim milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk whole wheat flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until coarse crumbs form. Stir in cranberries and pecans. Mix in skim milk until dough comes together and is the consistency of cookie dough.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Pat into a 1-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedges with a greased knife. Arrange 2 inches apart on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool, about 15 minutes.
