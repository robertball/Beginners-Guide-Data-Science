Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup canned chicken broth
1/2 cup half-and-half
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water, drained and chopped
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil and butter together in a saucepan. Cook and stir garlic, onion, and red bell pepper in hot oil mixture until onion is lightly transparent, about 5 minutes; season with Italian seasoning and continue cooking and stirring another 2 minutes. Sprinkle flour over the onion mixture; stir to incorporate. Whisk white wine into the onion mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir half-and-half into the mixture, cook until it just begins to bubble and stir spinach, artichokes, and mozzarella cheese into the mixture; cook and stir until the cheese has fully melted, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family favorite. It is great to serve with crusty bread, tortilla chips, and vegetables. You can substitute vegetable stock for chicken broth, or to eliminate wine add an extra 1/2 cup of stock. Keep warm in a small slow cooker or fondue pot.
