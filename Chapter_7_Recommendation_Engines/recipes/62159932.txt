Ingredients:
1 quart 2% low-fat or whole milk
1/2 cup non-fat powdered milk
2 tablespoons sugar (sugar substitute will not work)
1/2 cup  plain yogurt that contains active live cultures

Directions:
Add the plain yogurt to a 2 quart, flat ceramic or glass dish with lid and let arrive to room temperature. Heat milk, dry milk and sugar to 170 degrees. When cools back to 110 degrees, take 1 cup and pour into the dish and whisk with the yogurt until blended. Add the rest of the warm milk and stir well.  Place it covered on a heating pad on medium temperature and cover with a clean towel.   Allow to sit for 6-12hrs. The yogurt is ready when it reaches a semi-solid state and retains its shape when the container is tilted at a slight angle. MOST IMPORTANT: DO NOT STIR!! Place the container in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours. It will thicken considerably. The clear liquid that forms around the yogurt is called “whey”. Pour off before eating.This will keep in the refrigerator at least 10 days. It thickens over time.
