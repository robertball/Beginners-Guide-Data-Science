Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup oats
1 cup crispy rice cereal (such as Rice KrispiesÂ®)
1 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, and butter together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add 1 egg one at a time, allowing the first to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next with the vanilla.
Stir flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Beat into the butter mixture until just incorporated into a dough. Fold oats, crispy rice cereal, and coconut into the dough; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
Drop cookie dough by teaspoonful onto baking sheets.
Bake in preheated oven until browned, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool cookies slightly on baking sheets before moving to cooling racks to cool completely.
