Ingredients:
1 Tbsp light butter
1 medium RED onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 cups fat-free skim milk
2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup low-fat shredded SHARP cheddar cheese
1/4 c shredded parmesan cheese
1 tsp garlic salt or sea salt
1/4 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F. Coat a 9×13 baking dish with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds.  Stir in flour; then add milk slowly, stirring.
Add potatoes and stir to mix. Bring to a boil. Stir in 3/4 cup of the sharp cheddar cheese and 2 tbsp of the shredded parmesan cheese, garlic salt and pepper.
Pour mixture into prepared baking dish and level out surface. Bake for 1 hour, uncovered. Cover and bake until potatoes are fork-tender, about 20 minutes more.
Change oven temperature to broil. Sprinkle remaining cheese over potatoes. Broil 6 inches from the heating element until the cheese is golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes
