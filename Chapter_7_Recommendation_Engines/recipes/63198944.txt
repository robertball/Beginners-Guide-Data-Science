Ingredients:
4oz cream cheese, softened (can use regular, whipped, 1/3 less fat, etc.)
3 teaspoons ranch dip mix, divided
1 large chicken breast, cut into small pieces
3-4 Tablespoons buffalo wing sauce
1, 8-count tube reduced fat crescent rolls
Avocado Bleu Cheese Dip
1 avocado
1/3 cup bleu cheese dressing

Directions:
1. Preheat oven according to crescent roll package directions. Mix together cream cheese and 2 teaspoons ranch dip mix in a small bowl. Season chicken with remaining teaspoon ranch dip mix, and cook in a non-stick sprayed skillet. Toss with buffalo wing sauce, and set aside to cool.
2. Lay crescent rolls out flat, and cut each triangle in half with a pizza cutter. Gently flatten each triangle, and place 1 teaspoon cream cheese mix in the center. Top with a spoonful of chicken. Bring all three sides of the crescent roll triangle to the top, then pinch all three seams to seal. Place on a baking sheet, and bake according to crescent roll package directions.
3. While the poppers are baking, mash avocado until smooth. Stir in bleu cheese dressing, and serve with poppers.
