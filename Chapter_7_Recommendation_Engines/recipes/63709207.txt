Description: 
This light and delicious salad is packed with protein, vitamins and fiber.  I tried this while visiting a resort in Marco Island, and could not wait to recreated it myself.  This salad is the perfect dish for a light lunch, or a side dish at dinner.  Your vegetarian friends will thank you for serving this at any dinner party or bbq.
