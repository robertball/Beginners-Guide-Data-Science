Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup medium-aged Gouda cheese, such as Prima Donna, finely shredded
1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste
15 black olives, or as needed

Directions:
Combine cream cheese and Gouda cheese in a bowl and season with balsamic vinegar. Cut off small portions of the cheese mixture with a teaspoon and roll into balls.
Cut olives in half and then into small squares. Push olive squares onto the outside of the cheese balls so they look like soccer balls.
