Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, finely chopped
2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, undrained
salt and pepper to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
4 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef and onion until the beef is evenly brown and the onion is tender. Remove from heat.
Layer 1/2 the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish, and cover with 1/2 the beef and onion mixture. Spread 1/2 the kidney beans and 1/2 their liquid over the beef and onion, and season with salt and pepper. Repeat the layers, and cover with the tomato soup. Top with the bacon.
Cover and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove cover and continue baking 1 hour, or until the bacon is crisp and the potatoes are tender.

Description: 
One of the comfort foods from my days at home (thanks, Mom!!!), which I continue to make. Ground beef, potatoes, and kidney beans with a tomato soup and bacon topping make a very hearty and filling casserole, especially great in the cooler seasons.
