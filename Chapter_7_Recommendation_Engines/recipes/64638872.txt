Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped onion
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1/2 cup chopped peeled apple
2 tablespoons chopped pecans, toasted
1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
Dash plus 1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
Dash plus 1/4 teaspoon pepper, divided
2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (6 ounces each)
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 ounces Brie cheese, cubed
1/4 cup cider vinegar
3/4 cup apple juice, divided
1 tablespoon honey
1-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion in 1 tablespoon butter for 1 minute. Add apple; cook 2-3 minutes longer or until apple is golden brown. Remove from the heat; add pecans, rosemary, and a dash of salt and pepper.
Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness; sprinkle with garlic powder and remaining salt and pepper. Place apple mixture and Brie on half of each chicken breast; fold chicken over. Secure with toothpicks if necessary.
In the same skillet, brown chicken in remaining butter. Stir in vinegar, honey, and 1/4 cup apple juice. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until a thermometer reads 170Â°.
Remove chicken to a serving platter; discard toothpicks. Combine cornstarch and remaining apple juice; add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Serve with chicken.
