Ingredients:
1 pound Italian sausage
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup chopped celery
2 garlic cloves, minced
14 slices French bread (1/2 inch thick)
4 large tomatoes, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1-1/2 cups milk
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, cook sausage, onion, celery and garlic over medium heat until beef is no longer pink; drain and set aside. Toast bread; line the bottom of an un-greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish with 10 slices. Top with half of the meat mixture and half of the tomatoes.
Combine seasonings; sprinkle half over tomatoes. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. Crumble remaining bread over top. Repeat layers of meat, tomatoes, seasonings and oil.
In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter; stir in flour until smooth. Gradually stir in milk; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; stir in Parmesan. Pour over casserole. Top with mozzarella. Bake, uncovered, at 350Â° for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly and cheese is golden brown.
