Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cornstarch
1 cup icing or powdered sugar
1 1/2 cup softened unsalted butter (about 3 sticks), cubed
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In a large bowl, sift and combine flour, corn starch, salt, and icing sugar.  Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs and soft dough forms.  Knead dough until smooth, about 6-10 times.  Shape into 1-in. balls and chill for 30 - 60 minutes.
Pat dough into an un-greased 15 x 10 x 1-in. baking pan. Pierce with a fork; Bake 15-20 minutes or until only slightly browned.  Cut into squares while warm.  Transfer to wire rack and cool.  Yield: 2 dozen

This cookie is part of my 12 Days of Christmas: Holiday and Celebration Cookies from Around the World collection that I make every year to give as gifts for the holiday season.  This is a classic Scotch shortbread cookie.  I like how simple this recipe is - only 5 ingredients but oh so tasty!
