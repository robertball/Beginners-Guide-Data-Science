Description: 
Making your own brown sugar is so simple and easy and it tastes exactly like store-bought! You'll never run out of brown sugar if you keep two simple ingredients on hand: white granulated sugar and molasses. Recipe ingredients are for light brown sugar. For dark brown sugar, simply use 2 tablespoons of molasses for every 1 cup of white sugar. To keep it moist, put a slice of bread into the storage container.
