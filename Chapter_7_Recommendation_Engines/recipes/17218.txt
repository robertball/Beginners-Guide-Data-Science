Â½ cup water
4  bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin

Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes, spooning sauce over chicken several times. (Note: If sauce begins to stick to the baking dish, add an additional 1/4 cup water).
Remove chicken from baking dish and skim fat off of the sauce. Serve sauce hot with the chicken.
