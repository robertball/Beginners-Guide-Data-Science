Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups quick cooking Irish Oatmeal (regular oatmeal can also be used)
1 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 cup lowfat milk
1 teaspoon honey or sugar
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs, beaten
1/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine oats, yogurt, milk, and honey.  Stir in flour, baking soda and salt. Add beaten eggs and mix well.  Fold in nuts.
Note: Batter will thicken as it stands; if it gets too thick, add a tbs of milk.
Heat a large, non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat.  Spoon about 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle for each pancake.  Cook until bottom is browned and top begins to bubble (edges should be set and spatula should be easy to slide underneath). Flip and cook until the other sides are browned, about 2 mins.  Serve immediately.
