Ingredients:
1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter
3 eggs
1 cup oil
1/2 cup milk
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups flour
2 tablespoons Dulce de Leche cream
1 box Royal Flan with caramel sauce
1 small box instant chocolate pudding
1 cup mini chocolate chips
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup coconut
1/2 box Girl Scout Samoa Cookies (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325° F (165° C).
In a large mixing bowl, add all ingredients up to the flour.
Pour half of the batter into another bowl.
One bowl gets the following mixed in:
Royal Flan without the caramel sauce and Dulce de Leche cream.
The other bowl gets the following mixed in: instant chocolate pudding, chocolate chips, cocoa powder and 1/4 cup of the coconut.
Grease two large loaf pans.
Dust the greased pans with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder.
Pour the yellow batter evenly into loaf pans.
Pour the chocolate batter evenly on top of the yellow batter.
Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of coconut, sugar-cocoa mixture and add a few crushed Samoa cookies on top of bread.
Bake for one hour or until the bread loosens evenly from the sides and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.
ENJOY!
