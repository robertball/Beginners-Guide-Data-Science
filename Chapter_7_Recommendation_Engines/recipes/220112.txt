Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
1  egg, beaten
1 cup vegetable oil for frying
½ cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup maple syrup
½ cup chopped pecans
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease a casserole dish.
Place flour in a shallow bowl and press chicken strips into the flour; tap to remove excess flour.
Dip floured chicken in the egg and again coat with flour.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry chicken strips until golden brown and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 5 minutes per side; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and stir in brown sugar, maple syrup, pecans, and Creole seasoning. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute.
Place chicken strips into the prepared casserole dish; pour praline sauce over chicken and toss chicken to coat with sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Boneless chicken breasts are covered in a pecan praline glaze. The Creole seasoning cuts back some of the sweetness. Dark Karo® syrup can be used in place of the maple syrup if that's what you have.
