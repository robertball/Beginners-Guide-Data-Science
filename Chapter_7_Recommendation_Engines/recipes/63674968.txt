Ingredients:
2 Cups Elbow Macaroni
1 Small can of Tuna Fish
½ Can or 1 Small Can of Petite Peas
½ Onion
4 Eggs
1 Cucumber peeled and diced
1 cup of celery diced
3 tbsp. of Mayonnaise

Directions:
First cook the elbow macaroni and either chill it in the fridge, or toss in the strainer under cold water until it’s really cold. Hard boil your eggs at the same time. When they are done shell them and run under cold water until they feel really cold. You will need a fairly large salad bowl. Cut up the onion and eggs into small pieces, size isn't that important, cut them as small as you like. Put in the veggies and tuna fish. Put it all in the bowl and put about 3 tbsp. of Mayonnaise and mix it all really good, sometimes you need more. Be careful not to put too much mayonnaise in it. Store in fridge until you’re ready to eat it.
