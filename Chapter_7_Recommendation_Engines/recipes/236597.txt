Ingredients:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground allspice
1 cup applesauce
1 cup rolled oats, or more to taste
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl; add egg and beat until creamy.
Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and allspice together in another bowl. Stir 1/2 the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir applesauce into butter mixture; mix well. Stir remaining 1/2 the flour mixture into butter mixture until just combined; add oats and chocolate chips. Pour muffin batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
I took the original recipe found on this site and changed it up to be gluten-free and lower in sugar/fats. These muffins were highly praised, thinking these were too good to be gluten-free! I prefer to cut the fats and sugars in half by using applesauce and agave nectar.
