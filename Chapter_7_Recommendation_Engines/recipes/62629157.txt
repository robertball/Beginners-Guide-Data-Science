Ingredients:
Cookie Dough:
2 cups flour
1 cup unsalted butter, cold cut into cubes
1/4 tsp salt
1 8 ounce package of cream cheese
1/3 cup sour cream
1 tsp vanilla
2 tbsps sugar
Filling:
16 ounces of apricot preserves
1 cup dried apricots, cut into small pieces
Topping:
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl cut butter into the flour, using your hands knead in the cream cheese.
Add sour cream, sugar and vanilla, using your hands again knead until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky add flour 1 tbsp at a time.
Cut dough into 4 pieces and chill for at least 2 hours.
Make filling, place apricots and preserves in a small saucepan, cook over medium heat to thicken, remove from heat and allow to cool.
Make topping, mix together cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.
Roll each dough piece into a 8 inch circle, spread 1/4 of the apricot mixture over the circle, using a pizza cutter or a pastry wheel cut the circle into 12 segments, roll the cookie from the wide end to the point to form a crescent roll, roll the cookie in the cinnamon sugar and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.
Place the cookie sheets in the fridge or freezer to keep chilled until all the cookies are rolled.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees, bake for 22 to 24 minutes or until lightly browned.
Cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
Store in a wax paper lined Tupperware container, use wax paper between layers so they don't stick together.
