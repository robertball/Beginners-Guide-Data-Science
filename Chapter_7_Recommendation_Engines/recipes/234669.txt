Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup light brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup canola oil
3 eggs
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup cooked quinoa
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Whisk pumpkin, brown sugar, white sugar, canola oil, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth. Sift flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, salt, allspice, and cloves together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, a little at a time, into pumpkin mixture until batter is smooth; fold in quinoa, walnuts, and cranberries. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until top of loaf springs back when lightly touched, 50 to 60 minutes.
