Ingredients:
COOKIE:
6 egg yolks
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup melted butter
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract (or Anise)
1  1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
GLAZE:
1 egg white
1 tablespoon sugar

Directions:
Beat egg yolks and sugar until thick and creamy.
Add in extracts.
Melt butter and incorporate slowly beating well.
Add salt, baking powder and flour, mix well.
Dough should be soft and be able to roll without being too sticky.  If too loose add 1/4 cup more flour and try again.
Put dough in refrigerator and let dough rest for 30 minutes.
Pre heat oven to 350 degrees.
Line baking pans with parchment paper.
Beat remaining egg white with the remaining sugar and set aside.
Using about 1 tablespoon of dough roll into a 5 inch rope.
Shape dough into "S" shape and place on baking sheet.
Brush dough with the egg/sugar wash lightly.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until cookies are "set" and golden brown.
Cool on wire rack.
Store in airtight container.

Description: 
This is my version of the Stella D'oro Breakfast Treat Cookies.  They are meant for dunking in coffee, tea or wine.  These are not as crumbly as the original cookie and stand up to dunking much better without dissolving.  This is a very close rendition in flavor but with better staying power.
