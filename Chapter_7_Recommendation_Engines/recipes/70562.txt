Ingredients:
6 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives
salt and pepper to taste
1 (4 pound) boneless pork loin roast
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes. Drain, cool, and place in a bowl. Toss with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, chives, salt, and pepper.
Rub the pork loin roast with 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place the roast on a rack in a shallow roasting pan, and cook 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Arrange the potatoes around the roast, and continue cooking 50 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from heat, cover with foil, and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.
