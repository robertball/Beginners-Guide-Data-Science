Ingredients:
1 pound chicken breasts, sliced
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, minced
1/2 head red leaf lettuce, torn into bite sized pieces
3 green onions, sliced thin
6 radishes, sliced thin
1 cucumber, julined
2 carrots, sliced thin
2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lime juice
2 teaspoons white sugar
Crushed peanuts to garnish
2 tablespoons Olive oil

Directions:
To make the basil chicken, put chicken, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and garlic into a non stick pan. Cook until chicken is done and all liquid is absorbed. Throw in the basil, toss it around and remove from heat. Set aside.
To make the salad in a large bowl toss together the lettuce, green onions, radishes, cucumbers, and carrots. Set aside.
To make the dressing whisk together in a small bowl the lime juice, sugar, and olive oil, add salt and pepper to taste. Once emulsified add all the dressing to the salad and toss to coat.
Divide salad onto four dinner plates, add four equal parts of the chicken to each, and garnish with crushed peanuts if desired.

This Asian inspired twist I created came from a Thai stir fry recipe I saw. I just turned it into a refreshing summertime meal for those days when it's too hot to cook. Yummy !
