Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 tsp. (or more!) almond flavoring
2 1/8 cups flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 cup glazed mixed fruit
3/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped almonds, optional

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar together.
Beat in eggs until smooth.
Stir in milk and flavorings.
In large bowl, mix remaining ingredients.
Add to butter mixture. Stir just until moist.
Turn into greased loaf pans - I prefer to make 2 small loaves vs 1 large.
Bake x 55 minutes (or longer for large loaf), or until tests done with toothpick.
Let stand 10 minutes.
Remove from pan to cool.

Description: 
Ok, I have an confession to make - I like fruit cake. And I cringe when ppl say they hate it. Maybe because I've found this recipe for a light colored, moist load that has an almond flavor and colorful bits of fruit. It freezes well. I make it in mini-loaf pans, so there's always some to share...and I really hope ppl give it a chance when I do!
