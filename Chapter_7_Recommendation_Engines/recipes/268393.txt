Ingredients:
½ cup white wine
½ cup apricot jam
½ cup packed brown sugar
½ cup Spanish olives, drained and sliced
⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
⅓ cup red wine vinegar
⅓ cup drained capers
⅓ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon caper brine, or to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix white wine, apricot jam, jam, brown sugar, olives, 1/3 cup olive oil, red wine vinegar, capers, cilantro, garlic, and caper brine in a large bowl.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts until browned, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Do not overcook.
Arrange chicken in a single layer in a baking dish. Pour apricot-olive mixture on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes.
