Description: 
I’ve used both homemade or store bought graham crusts in the recipe with perfect results! Fluffy cheesecake....This Pumpkin Cheesecake recipe should’ve been named easier than pie, it’s one of the quickest you’ll ever find!  It literally takes just a few minutes to prepare; just toss all of the ingredients into the blender and pour it into a pie crust and bake!  Just like that, it turns out perfect every time....Pumpkin Pie Spice is a mixture I don’t use very often so I usually just mix up a small batch at home in the fall since I have all of the ingredients on hand anyhow! I top this with whip
