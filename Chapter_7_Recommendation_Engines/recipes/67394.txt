Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups enchilada sauce
1 (7-1/2 ounce) bag corn tortilla chips
2 cups sour cream

Directions:
Cover the bottom of a shallow microwaveable dish, with some of the enchilada sauce.  Arrange a layer of  tortilla chips on top.  Follow with another layer of sauce, then a layer of sour cream. Sprinkle cheese over the top. Repeat  layers to use up all ingredients, finishing with cheese on top.
Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes, or until cheese has melted throughout.  Serve immediately.
