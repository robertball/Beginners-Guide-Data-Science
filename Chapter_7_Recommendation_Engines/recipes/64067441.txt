Ingredients:
4 ft of 1/4" wide ribbon, cut into 12" long sections
1/2 oz unflavored gelatin powder (or two envelopes of Knox)
1 1/2 cups birdseed
baking sheet lined with waxed paper
four cookie cutters of any shape (roughly 4x4")
cooking spray

Directions:
1. Get Loopy. Tie ends of each ribbon section together to form 4 loops for hanging.
2. Stir away. Mix gelatin w/1/2 cup boiling water. Stir well to dissolve, then add birdseed, continuing to stir well. If mixture is watery, add more seed until it's stiff but sticky.
3. Make the mold. Place cookie cutters an inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly coat each cutter with cooking spray. Fill each halfway with birdseed mix.
4. Press tight. Place knotted end of each ribbon loop on top center of each cutter. Then fill with more mix until loop is secured. Firmly press the mix with back of spoon to compact.
5. Hang it up. After a few hours, coax each birdseed ornament onto fresh waxed paper. Let dry, flipping every so often, for 72 hours or until hard. Hang ornaments outside in trees.
