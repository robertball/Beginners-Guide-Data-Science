Ingredients:
5 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1 pinch salt
4 cups milk
2 1/2 cups flour
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed, divided

Directions:
Mix eggs, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Add milk, flour, and oil. Mix until batter is smooth and thin.
Heat 2 small nonstick skillets over medium heat. Lightly oil the skillets. Pour in enough batter to just cover the bottom of each skillet. Tilt the pans to spread batter evenly.
Lift the blini carefully when edges start to brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is browned, about 1 minute more. Stack blini on a plate.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my Russian teacher/neighbor. It is tried and true, and my family loves it! Cooking time really depends on how many skillets you are using! Many years ago when I first started making the blini, I used 1 skillet and it took forever to use up all the batter. Now I use 4 skillets and the time goes by quickly. I have substituted coconut oil and it tastes delicious, but it tends to harden if the batter is cold. Batter can be refrigerated for later use. Serve hot with sour cream and/or jelly.
