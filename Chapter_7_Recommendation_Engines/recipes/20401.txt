Ingredients:
2 cups chopped dried apricots
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup white sugar
2 cups butter
3 cups packed light brown sugar
3 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
8 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a small saucepan, combine the dried apricots, lemon juice and white sugar. Cook over medium high heat, stirring occasionally, until thick; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, baking soda and salt, stir into the creamed mixture, then stir in the rolled oats. Set aside 1/4 of the mixture and press the rest into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread the apricot mixture over the entire crust. Crumble the reserved oat mixture over the top of the apricot layer.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until top is toasted. Cool before cutting into squares.
