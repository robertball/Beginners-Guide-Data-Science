Ingredients:
1/2 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc)
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 teaspoons very finely minced shallots
4 ounces cold unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes
salt to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)

Directions:
Place wine, lemon juice, cream, shallots, and cream in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, and let simmer until liquid is reduced by about 75%, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and whisk in about 2 cubes of butter. Keep butter moving until it melts. When melted, add a few more cubes, whisking continuously so butter emulsifies into the wine/lemon juice mixture.
Continue to add butter, a few cubes at a time until all of it has been incorporated and the sauce has a thick, luxurious texture, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Taste for seasonings and add a pinch of salt and cayenne, if desired. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Although beurre blanc purists would object to the bit of cream in this classic sauce, it does help create a more stable base, enhances the flavor, and makes an even more beautiful color than when made without. Have all the ingredients measured and handy before starting as this sauce comes together rather quickly.
