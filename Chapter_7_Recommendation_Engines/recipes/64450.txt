Ingredients:
1 pound pork spareribs, cut into 3 inch pieces
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, sliced
5 green onions cut into 2-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon rice wine
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add the spareribs, and cook uncovered for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and set aside.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Stir in the ginger, green onions, and cinnamon; cook and stir until fragrant. Stir in the spareribs and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in the water, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover. Simmer until the spareribs are tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
For people who don't want tons of sugar in their rubs, it's a nice change to provide lighter ribs.  When I don't have spare ribs, I have pork chops.
