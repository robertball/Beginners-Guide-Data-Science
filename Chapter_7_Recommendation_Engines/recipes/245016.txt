Ingredients:
1 cup oats
1 cup coconut flakes
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup ground flax seeds
1/2 cup hemp seed hearts
1/2 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup almond butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Stir oats, coconut, honey, ground flax seeds, hemp seed hearts, chocolate chips, almond butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until combined. Roll dough into 3/4-inch balls and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.

Submitter: 
Centsible
Description: 
These are gluten-free. You can substitute peanut butter for the almond butter. As an alternative to rolling the dough into balls, you can spread the dough in bottom of a baking dish and cut into bars. I upped the honey from 1/3 to 1/2 cup so they are more cohesive.
