Ingredients:
1 c long grain rice, raw
2 c water (for cooking the rice)
1/2 tsp ground cardamom
1/2 gallon whole milk
1 c sugar
1/2 c golden raisins
1/2 tsp saffron threads

Directions:
Cook the rice in the water until nearly done, in a large covered pot over a low heat, about 20 mins.
Add the milk and increase heat to medium
cook UNCOVERED for about an hour, stirring every 2 or 3 mins to keep the rice from sticking and burning.  Yes that's a lot of stirring but it's worth it - take a book into the kitchen to read between stirs!  By the end, the volume should have reduced by about 1/3rd and the kheer should be kind of thickish.
Add the sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron.  Stir constantly for about another 5 mins.
Reduce heat slightly to a sort of medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, for about another 15 mins.
Chill and serve as a dessert.
