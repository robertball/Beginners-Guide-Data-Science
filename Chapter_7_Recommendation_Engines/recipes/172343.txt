Ingredients:
7 egg yolks
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1/3 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream, whipped to stiff peaks

Directions:
Fill a large saucepan with several inches of water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat until the water maintains a strong simmer. Place the egg yolks, Marsala wine, and sugar into a metal mixing bowl. Place the bowl over the simmering water. Beat constantly with a wire whisk until the zabaglione turns pale yellow and thickens to the consistency of softly whipped cream.
Scrape the zabaglione into a clean mixing bowl and set over ice, stirring occasionally until cold. Once cold, fold in the whipped cream.

Description: 
This zabaglione is different because it incorporates cream. I have viewed other recipes and this varies a lot. Serve chilled with fresh fruit of your choice. To make sure zabaglione is the right consistency, run the whisk through and see that it falls in a steady stream standing on itself as it lands in the bowl.
