Ingredients:
3 Cups apple cider vinegar
1-2 TBS red pepper flakes (or to taste)
1/4 cup ground black pepper
2 tsp salt or to taste (the original recipe calls for much more)
1/2 cup ketchup (for lower carb uses Heinz reduced sugar)
2-3 tablespoons brown sugar (or 1-2 TBS splenda blend)

Directions:
Stir together vinegar, red pepper flakes, black pepper and salt in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil.
Stir in ketchup and brown sugar.
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
Cool and store at room temp or in the fridge. Keeps well for long periods.  Note the serving amount is arbitrary depending on how much sauce you like on your meat.  Also great on chicken and ribs.

Description: 
This sauce is a favorite in Sumter County SC where my husband grew up.  I've adopted it as my favorite go-to sauce for pulled pork.
