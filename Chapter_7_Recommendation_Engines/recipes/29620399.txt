Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup finely diced carrot
1/2 cup finely diced celery
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 cups dried cannelloni beans, soaked and rinsed
32 oz. box chicken broth
2 bay leaves
3 tbsp. dry italian seasoning
5 oz. baby spinach, finely chopped

Directions:
In a large pan or dutch oven, over medium heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions, carrot and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the beans. Continue to cook for 1 minute. Stir in the broth. Add the bay leaves and all seasonings. Bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook until the beans are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. In a small saucepan, combine the remaining olive oil, spinach and some chopped garlic. Bring to a simmer and cook until the garlic is golden. Add spinach and garlic to soup. Let simmer for 15 minutes.
