Ingredients
One 6-pound fresh turkey breast, on the bone, rinsed and patted dry
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup beef bovril
1 tsp kitchen bouquet
1 1/2 tbsp dry mustard
1 tsp blueberry syrup or maple syrup
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 stalk celery, cut into 2 inch pieces
1 small carrot, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
2 small onions, peeled and quartered
1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3 cups turkey or chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned

Directions
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
Rub the turkey all over with the butter, including the cavity of the breast.
Mix together beef Bovril, kitchen bouquet, dry mustard and syrup.  Spread over turkey.
Season generously with salt and pepper. Scatter the vegetables on the bottom of a roasting pan just large enough to hold the turkey. Set the meat breast-side up in the pan. Roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast registers 160 degrees F. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil for 30 minutes. (The breast temperature will continue to rise to 170 degrees as it rests.)
Mix the flour with the stock or water.  Bring to a boil.  Strain the gravy from the pan, discarding the vegetables, and season with salt and pepper to taste.   Add the juices to the stock.. Whisk in the stock and continue to stir. Bring to a boil and cook until thickened, about 3 minutes.
Carve the breast and serve with the gravy.
