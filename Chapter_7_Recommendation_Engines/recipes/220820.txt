Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dried pinto beans
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth
2 cups tomato juice
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 potatoes, diced
2 carrots, diced
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (13 ounce) package smoked sausage
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Cover pinto beans with water in a bowl and allow to soak overnight. Drain.
Melt butter in a 6-quart stock pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and celery in butter until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir garlic into onion mixture until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Stir beef broth, tomato juice, sugar, and drained pinto beans into the vegetable mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans are tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Mix potatoes, carrots, oregano, salt, and black pepper into the bean soup; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes more.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
Place smoked sausage on a baking sheet.
Bake sausage in the preheated oven until browned, about 10 minutes.
Cut sausage into quarters, then slice. Add sausage and parsley to the soup; continue to simmer for 10 more minutes.

Description: 
The woman who owned and made the soups at my favorite deli was retiring. I asked her why, and she said, 'I'm an old lady, I'm tired of getting up early for work.' She gave me the recipe to one of my favorites. I made a few tweaks, it's DELICIOUS.
