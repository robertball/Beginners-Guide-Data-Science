Ingredients:
For the Pastry:
5 1/2 ounces farmer's cheese
3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
3 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
For the Filling:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 apples, cored and thinly sliced

Directions:
Combine farmer's cheese, melted butter, and milk in a bowl and stir until smooth.
Mix 1 3/4 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and baking powder in a separate bowl. Add to the ricotta mixture. Mix until pastry dough comes together. Refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
Beat 1/2 cup sugar and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened. Add sour cream, 2 tablespoons flour, and vanilla extract; stir until filling is well combined.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch springform cake pan.
Press the chilled pastry into the bottom and sides of the cake pan. Add 1/2 the apples; top with 1/2 of the filling. Repeat layering, ending with the filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Remove and let cool in pan.
