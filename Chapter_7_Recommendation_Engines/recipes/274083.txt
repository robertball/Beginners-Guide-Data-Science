Ingredients:
Cake:
1 1/4 cups sifted cake flour
1 tablespoon sifted cake flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 egg whites
2/3 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1/3 cup sweetened coconut milk
2 tablespoons sweetened coconut milk
1/3 cup almond milk
3 ounces sweetened flaked coconut
2 ounces sliced almonds
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Frosting:
2 1/4 cups unsalted butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract
1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages powdered sugar
1/2 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 15x10x1-inch pan with parchment paper.
Sift cake flour, baking powder, and salt together 3 times in a bowl.
Beat egg whites using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until foamy. Add 1/2 of the total amount of sugar gradually; continue to beat until soft peaks form.
Beat butter using an electric mixer in a separate bowl until creamy. Gradually add remaining sugar; beat until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture alternately with coconut milk and almond milk in small amounts at a time, beating after each addition until smooth. Mix in flaked coconut, almonds, almond extract, coconut extract, and vanilla extract. Add egg white-sugar mixture and beat thoroughly into batter. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes; remove cake and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
While cake continues to cool, beat butter, salt, vanilla extract, almond extract, and coconut extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add powdered sugar to butter mixture alternately with coconut milk, beating until smooth. Frost cooled cake.
