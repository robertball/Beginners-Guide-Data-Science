Description: 
Turkey Italian sausage and jalapeno peppers add kick to this chunky soup. 'The original recipe called for a lot of butter and three cooking pots. I eliminated the butter and tossed the ingredients together in just one pot,' says Guyla Cooper from Enville, Tennessee. 'My husband really enjoys this meaty soup, so I make plenty and freeze what's left over in individual servings for his lunches.'
