Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1 1/2 cups boiling water
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup honey
2 eggs
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1 tablespoon salt
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water; set aside. In another bowl, stir boiling water and shortening until shortening is melted. Add honey; cool to 110 degrees F-115 degrees F. Add eggs, oats, salt and shortening mixture to yeast mixture. Add 3 cups flour; stir until smooth. Stir in enough of the flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape each portion into a loaf. Place in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3 -in. loaf pans. Prick tops with a fork. Brush with butter. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove form pans to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
This recipe has been handed down for four generations. Whenever I make this, it takes me back to when I was a young girl on Grandpa's farm. We loved to toast it and smother it with honey.
