Ingredients:
1 dry cake mix
1 egg
1/2 Cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Melt butter and mix all ingredients together. Drop onto cookie sheets using a cookie scoop or spoon to make your desired size cookie. Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes to suit your taste.
My favorite cake mix to use is the "funfetti" kind, though you can use any you like. Also, you can make any number of combinations, i.e. devils food cake mix, and adding chocolate or peanut butter chips. I also recently made these with white cake mix, and added a cup of oats and a cup of butterscotch chips. Enjoy, and be prepared to share the recipe!

These are the fastest, easiest cookies to make, and also the most addicting! I learned to make them from my mother-in-law. You can use any kind of cake mix, and add any number of chips, nuts, sprinkles, etc. to suit your taste.
