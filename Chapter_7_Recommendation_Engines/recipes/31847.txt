Ingredients:
1/2 cup coffee flavored liqueur
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 Cornish game hens
salt and pepper to taste
2 slices orange, halved
2 slices lemon, halved
1 cup seedless grapes (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small saucepan, stir together the coffee liqueur, orange and lemon juices, mustard and paprika. Add butter and bring to a boil. Once boiling, lower heat and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat, cover and set aside.
Rinse hens under cold running water and pat dry. Season the cavities with salt and pepper to taste. Stuff each bird with half a slice of orange and half a slice of lemon. Stuff grapes into the cavity if desired. Spoon in about a tablespoon of the sauce. Truss or skewer the legs together and place breast side up in a shallow roasting pan, and tent loosely with foil.
Roast for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove foil and baste with the coffee liqueur sauce. Continue roasting for an additional 30 minutes, basting a few more times. Remove hens to a serving platter and remove trussing or skewers. Place roasting pan onto the stovetop and deglaze with the remaining basting sauce. Simmer until thickened, then spoon over roasted hens.  Garnish with remaining lemon and orange slices.
