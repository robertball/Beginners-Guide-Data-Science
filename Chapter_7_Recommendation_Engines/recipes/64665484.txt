Ingredients:
18 Oreo cookies (12 whole and 6 coarsely chopped)
16 ounces cream cheese softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs lightly beaten
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275Â°F (it's a cooler oven than usual).
Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper cups and place one Oreo cookie into each.
In a medium bowl, beat cream cheese, gradually adding sugar, vanilla, eggs, sour cream, mixing well after each addition.
Stir in chopped cookies by hand.
Spoon batter into muffin pan, filling each to almost the top.
Divide batter evenly among cookie-lined cups, filling each almost to the top.
Bake for 20-22 minutes.
Remove from oven and transfer to cooling racks. Then refrigerate for 4 hours or more (optional). Serve and enjoy!
