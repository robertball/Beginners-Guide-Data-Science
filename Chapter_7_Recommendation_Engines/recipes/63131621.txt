Ingredients:
1 large can of Chicken breast, drained well
1 8oz brick of cream cheese
12 oz of cheese, Cheddar or cheddar-jack
2 cans mild enchilada sauce
½ can diced tomato,  drained
1 medium onion diced
½ tsp cumin
1/16-1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
1/16-1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flake
1 tsp minced garlic
¼ tsp sugar
Salt to taste
2-3 tbsp minced fresh cilantro
12-15 corn tortillas
Vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine onion, garlic, cumin, cayenne, crushed pepper, enchilada sauce, tomatoes, sugar and salt.  Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally until onions are tender but not falling apart.
Combine chicken, cilantro, cream cheese, and half the cheese mix.  Spoon in half a ladle of cooked sauce and combine.
Preheat oven at 350 degrees.
Heat oil over very low heat until the back of a wooden spoon makes small bubbles around the handle.  On a nearby plate spoon enchilada sauce.  Prepare a baking dish with a ladle of enchilada sauce, spread to coat the bottom of the pan.  Fry tortilla one at a time.  Place on prepared plate and then transfer sauced side up in pan.  Fill the middle with a liberal spoonful of chicken mixture and roll.  Repeat until there is no more chicken mixture.  Apply the remaining sauce to the top and spread even.
Bake for 10 minutes.  Add remaining half of cheese mixture.  Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until all the cheese is nice and melty.  Bon Apetite!
