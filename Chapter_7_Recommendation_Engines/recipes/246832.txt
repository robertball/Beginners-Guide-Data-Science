Ingredients:
Batter:
3 eggs
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
Filling:
1 (8 ounce) container cottage cheese
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons butter, or as needed
1 (10 ounce) package frozen sweetened strawberries, thawed, or to taste

Directions:
Beat eggs, flour, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in milk and 1 1/2 tablespoon butter gradually. Cover with plastic wrap and let batter rest in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours.
Combine cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in a blender; blend until filling is smooth.
Melt a bit of butter in a large skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Ladle in a small amount of batter and swirl skillet to spread batter in a thin layer. Cook until set, about 30 seconds. Flip and continue cooking until second side is cooked, about 10 seconds. Transfer to a plate to cool. Repeat with remaining butter and batter.
Spoon filling onto blintzes and fold. Top with strawberries.
