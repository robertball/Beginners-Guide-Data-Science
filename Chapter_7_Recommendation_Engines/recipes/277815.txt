Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 medium sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt, cornstarch, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.
Cut potatoes in half lengthwise, then cut each half into 3 wedges. Place in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. Add spice mixture and stir with a rubber spatula or your hands until potatoes are completely coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the thickest parts of potato wedges are easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.
