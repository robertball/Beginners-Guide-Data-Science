Ingredients:
3/4 cup light molasses
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup chopped almonds, or to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix molasses, cream, sugar, and cocoa powder together in a pot; bring to a boil. Heat to 251 degrees F (122degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball, 30 to 40 minutes. The finished candy will be same firmness of the ball in water. Remove pot from heat and stir in almonds and vanilla extract.
Spoon candy into small paper candy cups. Cool to room temperature and store in an airtight container at room temperature.
