Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) container silken tofu
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup applesauce
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 eggs
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 drop orange food coloring (optional)
Ganache:
1/4 cup 70% to 80% dark chocolate, chopped
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon honey
2 teaspoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a tart pan on a baking sheet.
Combine silken tofu, pumpkin puree, applesauce, cornstarch, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, and food coloring in a bowl. Puree using a stick blender until smooth. Pour batter into the tart pan, filling only halfway.
Bake in the preheated oven until flan has set, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely before inverting onto a serving plate.
Place chocolate in a metal bowl. Heat cream, honey, and butter in a small saucepan until almost boiling and pour over chocolate. Leave for 1 minute, then stir well until chocolate has melted. Transfer chocolate ganache to a piping bag fitted with a small tip and decorate pumpkin flan. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
I make this fun pumpkin dessert every year for Halloween in my pumpkin-shaped baking dish. You can, of course, make it in regular ramekins for a non-seasonal dessert.
