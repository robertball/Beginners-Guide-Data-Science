Ingredients:
4lb Roasting chicken
1 tsp olive oil
1 medium onion
1/2 bulb of garlic cloves smashed(not chopped)
1/3lb Salted Butter cut into small finger size
1 tblsp Garlic Pepper ( or 1/2 and 1/2 garlic powder and pepper)
1 tblsp Seasoning Salt
2-3 large carrots cut into 1" pieces
Some potatoes
**Optional : 1 tblsp dehydrated garlic cloves**

Directions:
Prep the Bird, preheat oven to 400 F
Put 1/2 of the vegetables and 3-4 cloves of garlic inside the chicken.
Add 3-4 pads of butter to cavity and re-seal chicken.
With a very sharp knife, make small cuts the width of the butter pads on the skin of the chicken.
In each of these holes put one pad of butter and one clove of garlic.
**tip : the butter will make the skin crispy in small circles the size of the butter stick. if you can do it strategically you could have the entire skin this way if you desire**
Season the outside of the chicken on both sides with seasoning salt and garlic pepper.
Place chicken in roaster(cake pan preferrable) and surround with remaining onions, potatoes, carrots, and remaining butter. If you ran out add 1/4 cup in a 9x12 pan.
Roast for 180 minutes at 400 degrees.
Remove from oven and let sit 15 minutes.**super important or it might be dry**
Baste liberally from the pan on the top of the chicken.
Cut and serve.
