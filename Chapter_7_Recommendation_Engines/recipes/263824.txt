Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (7 ounce) can tuna, drained and flaked
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 tablespoons capers
1/3 cup sweet corn, drained
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/4 cucumber, finely chopped
2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain. Place penne in a large mixing bowl and toss well with olive oil.
Combine tuna, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and capers in the bowl of a food processor; blend until smooth and creamy. Add to the penne and mix until well combined. Add corn, bell pepper, and cucumber and toss together. Spoon into a serving dish. Arrange quartered eggs on top.

Description: 
This is an Italian recipe, very nice for the summer months! It has cucumber in it, which I don't like, but my husband does, so I just add cucumber to his individual portion.
