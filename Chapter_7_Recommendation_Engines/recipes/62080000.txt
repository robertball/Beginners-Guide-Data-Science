Ingredients:
Frozen Perogies (8 pieces per serving)
1 lb bacon
1 large Spanish onion
Gratted Cheddar Cheese
Sour Cream
Butter/margarine

Directions:
Put the perogies in a pot of rapidly boiling salted water and boil until they float (be careful not to over boil them to the point of falling apart)
While the perogies are boiling, cook the bacon on medium high heat.
As the bacon gets close to getting crispy, add the chopped onion and turn the heat down to at least medium.
Drain pergoies, put them in a large bowl and coat with butter. Then add them to the pan with bacon and onions. Move perogies around until they are golden brown.
Add the shredded cheese and let it melt slightly.
Serve immediately with sour cream on the side or on top of the mixture.
Also amazing topped with your favorite salsa.
