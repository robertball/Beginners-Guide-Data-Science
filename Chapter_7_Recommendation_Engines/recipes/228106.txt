Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups orzo pasta
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup water
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped - divided
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cucumbers, peeled and chopped
2 cups crumbled feta cheese
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 red onion, very thinly sliced and cut into 1-inch pieces
