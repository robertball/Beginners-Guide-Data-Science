Description: 
'I combined three recipes to come up with this take on the classic creamy chicken rice soup,' says Marge Wagner from Roselle, Illinois. 'I cut down on the butter, increased the vegetables and eliminated the half-and-half cream. This lower-fat version is truly delicious...and no one can tell it's light!'
