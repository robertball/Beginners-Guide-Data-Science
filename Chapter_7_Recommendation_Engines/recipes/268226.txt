Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup frozen southwest-style O'Brien potatoes with onions and peppers
12 eggs, beaten
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded pepperjack cheese
1 cup picante sauce
1 cup crushed nacho cheese tortilla chips (such as DoritosÂ®)
12 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Combine butter and potatoes in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until potatoes are slightly browned on the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add eggs to the skillet with the potatoes and cook until set, 5 to 7 minutes more. Add Cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese, and picante sauce. Mix with potatoes and eggs until thoroughly incorporated. Add crushed chips to the skillet and stir until well mixed.
Divide egg mixture evenly among tortillas and roll up burrito-style.

Description: 
Our daughter-in-law started a breakfast tradition when we visited, and it has transformed into this breakfast burrito that has crushed nacho chips in it along with eggs, potatoes, and cheese. This is just as good without the tortilla, just serve it in a bowl.
