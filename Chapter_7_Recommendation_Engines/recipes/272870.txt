Ingredients:
2 cups complete pancake mix (such as Aunt JemimaÂ®)
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon banana extract
1 cup mini marshmallows
1/2 cup white chocolate chips, or more to taste
1/2 cup coconut flakes, or more to taste

Directions:
Combine pancake mix, water, vanilla, and banana extract in a large bowl. Stir just until large lumps disappear; do not overmix. Let stand until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the griddle; sprinkle a few marshmallows, white chocolate chips, and coconut flakes on top. Cook until bubbles form, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until edges are dry and bottom is golden brown; marshmallows and chocolate chips will melt and caramelize into the pancake. Repeat with remaining batter and toppings.

Description: 
My son and I like to make different flavored pancakes. This recipe was created from ingredients found in the pantry and it's often requested by the rest of the family as it's considered the best pancakes we have ever made. The caramelized marshmallows and white chocolate chips are what makes these great! Serve with whipped cream.
