1. In a bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, brown sugar and pumpkin spice together and set aside.
2.  In a pan with medium heat, melt the butter, sprinkle the cinnamon and white sugar over the apples and cook the apples until they are soft.  Remove from the stove and set aside.
3.   Place another pan on the stove with medium heat and lightly oil the pan.
4.  When the pan is hot, place a tortilla in the pan.  Spread a generous amount of pumpkin on top of the tortilla, then place brie on one side, and cover the brie side with cooked apples.
5.  When the tortilla turns golden brown, fold in half.  Let sit for another minute and remove from the pan.
