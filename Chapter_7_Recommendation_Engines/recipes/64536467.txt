Ingredients:

Directions:
1) In a large bowl, combine the confectioners sugar, coconut, almonds, and milk. Shape into 1-inch balls. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.
2) In a microwave, melt semisweet chips on high for about 1 minute, stir. Microwave at additional 10 to 20 second intervals, stirring until smooth. Dip balls in chocolate; allow excess to drip off. Coat or garnish with ingredients of your choice. Place on waxed paper; let stand until set. Store in an airtight container.
