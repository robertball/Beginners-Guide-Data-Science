Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 cups corn flakes, crushed
4 slices bread, cut into thirds
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Whisk the eggs and milk together in a bowl. Spread the crushed corn flakes onto a plate.
Dip each piece of bread into the egg mixture and then press gently into the cereal, turning to coat completely. Place the breadsticks onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook the coated breadsticks in the melted butter until golden, about 4 minutes each side.
