Ingredients:
Strawberry-Rhubarb Filling:
1-1/2 cups diced fresh rhubarb
1-1/2 cups diced fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoon water, divided
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Cake Batter:
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1-1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
Topping:
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 cup flour
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place the rhubarb, strawberries, 1/2 cup sugar, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water in a saucepan. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until mixture begins to boil (about 5 minutes), then reduce the heat to low.
In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of water with the cornstarch and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved.  Add to the saucepan with the rhubarb and strawberries, and continue to cook until mixture begins to thicken (about 2 minutes). Remove from stove and set aside to cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9" deep dish pie pan with non-stick cooking spray, and place on a baking sheet.
In a mixing bowl, beat 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of sugar until light. Beat in the egg, vanilla and yogurt. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and the salt, just until combined. Spread 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan. Pour strawberry-rhubarb filling over the batter, then spread the remaining batter in small mounds atop the filling. Set aside.
In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour and 2 tablespoons of butter. Mix using a fork, a pastry blender, or your hands, until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle on top of the batter and filling.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 35 minutes or until the cake is topping is nicely browned. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of sweetened whipped cream, if desired.

Description: 
Growing up in Wisconsin, we had a patch of rhubarb growing in our backyard, and I loved all of the delicious desserts my Mom would make when it was in season. This recipe is my spin on her strawberry-rhubarb cake.
