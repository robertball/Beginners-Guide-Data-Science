Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons minced chives
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/4 cup orange juice
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the butter, chives, parsley, salt and pepper. Shape into a 6-in. x 2-in. rectangle; place on waxed paper. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
Flatten chicken to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut butter mixture into six strips; place one strip in the center of each chicken breast half. Roll up and tuck in ends; secure with a toothpick.
Place the flour in a shallow bowl. In another bowl, beat egg and orange juice. In a third bowl, combine bread crumbs and orange peel. Coat chicken with flour, dip in egg mixture, then roll in crumb mixture. Place seam side down in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish.
Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until chicken juices run clear. Discard toothpicks before serving.

Description: 
My favorite meal features these golden crumb-coated chicken rolls with a savory chive filling. They have a lovely orange flavor without being overwhelming. Serve them with rice or potatoes for Sunday dinner or a party. --Arlene Butler, Ogden, Utah
