Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked white rice
1 cup of frozen peas or cooked green beans
Chopped and cooked leftover meats (chicken, turkey, ham, beef, whatever!)
1/2 onion, chopped
Vegetable oil.
1 cup of peanuts
Crystalyzed ginger to taste
Soy sauce to taste

Directions:
Boil the rice to cooked.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok or frying pan and fry the onion until translucent.
Add the meat and heat.
Throw in all the other ingredients and heat through. I like to add a small amount of soy sauce and then let others add more if they so wish.
