Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 carrots, shredded
1/2 onion, diced
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
2 large chicken breasts, chopped in small pieces
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken broth
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 tablespoons red curry paste
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 ounces rice noodles, broken in half

Directions:
Heat a large stock pot over medium heat. Add oil, carrots, onion, and bell pepper. Cook for about 3 minutes. Add chicken and mix well. Add garlic. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes.
Mix in chicken broth, coconut milk, curry paste, salt, and pepper. Bring soup to a boil, about 5 minutes. Add noodles and allow soup to come to a boil again. Reduce heat to low and simmer about 3 minutes.
Cover the pot, remove from heat,  and let sit just until noodles are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
