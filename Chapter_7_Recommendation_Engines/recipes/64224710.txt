Ingredients:
6 cups 1/2" sourdough bread cubes
1 cup chopped onions
1 cup chopped celery
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage
3/4 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
3 tablespoons sweet or  dry sherry
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup dried cherries
3/4 cup pecans, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted if desired

Directions:
To make the bread cubes, start with 1 loaf of leftover bread.  Remove the crusts and cut the bread into 1/2" cubes until you have about 6 cups.
Spread them out on a cutting board and allow them to dry, if possible, overnight.
The next day, place the bread cubes in a large bowl, add the onion, celery, thyme, sage, paprika, salt, pepper, cherries and nuts, and toss until they are well-mixed.
Add the melted butter, sherry and chicken broth.
Stuff your chicken or turkey and roast as directed.
To prepare stuffing on its own, place in a shallow baking dish, cover with foil and bake at 350F for 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
If the stuffing dries out, you may wish to add a little chicken broth as it cooks.

Description: 
This is one of the BEST stuffings I've ever made/tasted.  You can use cherry flavored cranberries if you can't find dried cherries.
