Ingredients:
Keto wraps:
3 eggs
1/2 cup almond milk
1/4 cup coconut flour
1 pinch sea salt
cooking spray
Filling:
2 cups baby spinach
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
3 chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Whisk eggs and almond milk together in a bowl until well combined.
Combine coconut flour and salt in a separate bowl. Stir in egg mixture; whisk until a smooth and soft batter forms, about 2 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes.
Heat an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat; grease with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of the batter in and immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the wrap is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, about 3 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen wrap; flip wrap and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
Place spinach, feta cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes in the center of the wraps; drizzle with olive oil. Roll from one end to the other to make the wraps.
