Ingredients:
2 cups all purpous flour
1 tsp. cream of tartar
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
1/2 ts vanilla
1/2-3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
pinch of salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
combine white and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl, cut butter into sugar and use your fingers to mix it together until it resembles fine bread crumbs.  Add flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmet and salt.  Sift together.  Add vanilla, and 1/2 cup of milk.  You will want a soft, not sticky dough, add more milk as necessary.  Be patient, it takes a little kneading to get the dough to the right consistancy, it may be rather dry at first.
Pat or roll the dough to 1/2 inch and use a small juice glass or a 2" round cookie cutter to shape your dough.  Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet, or place a sheet of parchment paper on your cookie sheet, bake for 12-14 minutes.
