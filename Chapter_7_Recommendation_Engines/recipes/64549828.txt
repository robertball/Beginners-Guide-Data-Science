Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups pureed butternut squash
2 egg whites, room temperature
3 tbsp coconut oil
2 tbsp maple syrup
1/2 cup plain, Greek yogurt
1/2 cup Gluten Free rolled oats
1 1/2 cups Gluten Free baking flour
1/3 cup Truvia baking blend or coconut sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp allspice
1/4 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and line a muffin tin with muffin liners or spray with nonstick cooking spray.
In a small bowl, whip butternut squash, egg whites, maple syrup and Greek yogurt together with a hand blender.
In another large bowl, mix together baking flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspices.
To the flour mixture, add the wet ingredients. Once fully incorporated, add the coconut oil to the mixture (I find this prevents the coconut oil from hardening). After combined, fold in the rolled oats and cranberries to the batter.
Spoon the batter into the muffin cavities 3/4 of the way full (do not fill to the top as they will rise) and bake 25 minutes until the muffins bounce when you gently touch the center.
Cool muffins in the baking pan 5 minutes then remove to a cooling rack to cool fully.
