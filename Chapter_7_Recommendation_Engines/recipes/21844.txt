Ingredients:
6 red potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 (11 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, undrained
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper

1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
2 cups vegetable broth

salt to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 30 minutes; drain.
To the potatoes add corn, bell pepper, onion, red pepper flakes and vegetable broth.  Boil for about 15 minutes; remove from heat.
In a food processor or blender puree all but 1 1/2 cups of the vegetable and broth mixture with the tofu.  Process in batches if necessary.  Combine the pureed mixture with the remaining 1 1/2 cups  vegetable and broth mixture, and cook over low heat for 5 minutes; do not boil.  Season with salt to taste.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I've modified to be low-fat and vegetarian. The original called for heavy cream and chicken broth. I think it is quite yummy, and especially good on chilly evenings!
