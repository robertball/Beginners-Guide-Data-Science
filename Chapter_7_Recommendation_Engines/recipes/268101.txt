1/2 cup water

2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons corn syrup
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add potatoes; stir-fry until browned in spots and partially cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, mix water, soy sauce, ketchup, corn syrup, sugar, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl.
Pour soy sauce mixture over potatoes. Reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender and sauce thickens, 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and toss to coat.
