Knoephla Broth:
1 large can chicken broth (6/8 cups)
1 stick butter
4 medium potatoes cubed
1 cup chopped carrots

1 large can Campbell's Cream of Chicken
2 cups of milk
1 can evaporated milk
Salt/Pepper/Chicken Bouillon to taste
Heavy Cream (1 to 2 pints)

Directions:
Knoephla Dough:
If the dough is sticky, you may need to add a little more flour as you knead it. Roll out and cut into small (1 to 1.5 inch) knoephla pieces and add to the broth.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Knoephla Broth:
Boil first 6 ingredients for 20 minutes, then add the milk and cream of chicken soup. Cut in the knoephla or add in "pre-made" knoephla. Simmer for 20 minutes or more to cook knoephla. Add the can of evaporated milk when the knoephla is done. Before serving add in heavy cream, do NOT boil once the cream has been added.
