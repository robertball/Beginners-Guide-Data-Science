Ingredients:
5 cups of old-fashioned oats
1 1/2 cups nuts of choice, chopped coarsely
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (optional)
1 1/2 cups dried fruit of choice (raisins, apricots, cherries, cranberries)
1/2 cup molasses
1 tsp vanilla extract
3 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup canola or vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Place the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir until thoroughly combined. In a separate bowl, stir together the liquid ingredients. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients until they are evenly coated. Spread the mixture evenly on a baking sheet with sides and bake until light brown and toasted (about 25-30 minutes). For even cooking, carefully stir the granola mixture every 10 minutes.Remove the granola from the oven and allow to cool- it will become crunchier as it cools down. Store the granola in an airtight container at room temperature or in the freezer in a Ziploc bag. Serving size is 2/3 cup.
