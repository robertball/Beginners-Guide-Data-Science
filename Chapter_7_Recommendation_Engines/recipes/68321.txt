Ingredients:
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 2 inch pieces
½ cup sour cream
½ cup all-purpose flour
4 ounces Ranch-flavored tortilla chips
vegetable cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place tortilla chips and flour into a food processor or blender, and process into crumbs. Pour into a bowl. Place chicken pieces into a sealable plastic bag with sour cream. Massage the  bag to make sure chicken pieces are coated with sour cream. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Dip coated chicken pieces into the chip crumbs, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Spray lightly with vegetable cooking spray.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
