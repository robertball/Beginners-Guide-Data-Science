Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) container low-fat cottage cheese
4 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9 inch cooking dish with cooking spray.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in medium skillet. Saute the onion until soft and translucent.
In a large bowl combine cottage cheese, cornflake crumbs, egg, oil and sauteed onion. Gradually stir in the milk to moisten. You might only need 1/2 cup of the milk, the mixture should be moist but not soupy.
Spread the cottage cheese mixture into the prepared pan and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until bubbly and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
