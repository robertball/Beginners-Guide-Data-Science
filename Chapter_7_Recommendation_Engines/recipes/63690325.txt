Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 teaspoon Icelandic sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground organic tellicherry black pepper
1 teaspoon honey
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flake
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 garlic clove, minced; sautéed just until beginning to brown
Sea Salt to garnish
Pepper to garnish
6 oz. salmon fillets

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Add salmon fillets to mixture and place in re-sealable bag to marinate.  Marinate for about an hour.
Remove salmon from marinade.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a sauté pan.  Reduce heat to medium, and place salmon in pan. Add 3 tablespoons of marinade to the pan and then discard the remaining liquid.  Cover pan.
As it is cooking, occasionally spoon some of the liquid in the pan over the fish, coating well.
Turn salmon over to brown both sides (2-3 minutes each side with lid on at medium heat).
Sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper before serving.
