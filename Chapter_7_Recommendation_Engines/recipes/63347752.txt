Description: 
Learning to reduce carbs can make it difficult to find recipes that are delicious and can be served to guests.  This is my attempt at recreating a breakfast casserole I was served at a party many years ago. The result is full of flavor but with minimal carbs.  I haven't tasted a better egg casserole.  A generous 1/8th of the recipe is about 6-7 carbs, and is very filling. Enjoy!
