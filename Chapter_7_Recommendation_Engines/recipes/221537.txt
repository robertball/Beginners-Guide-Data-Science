Ingredients:
½ cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound chicken tenders, pounded thin
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1  onion, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup
1 ¼ cups Marsala wine

Directions:
Stir flour, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow dish. Press chicken tenders into the flour to coat on all sides; shake to remove excess flour.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken tenders in the melted butter until lightly browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet to a plate and cover to keep warm.
Melt remaining butter in the skillet. Cook onion slices in the melted butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir the mushrooms into the cooked onions; cook and stir until the mushrooms are browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Return the chicken to the skillet.
Whisk mushroom soup and Marsala wine together in a bowl; pour over the chicken mixture. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
