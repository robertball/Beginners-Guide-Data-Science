Ingredients:
1 rack of Pork Ribs
3 garlic cloves
rosemary
Plum sauce
1 high standing slow cooker pot w/lid at least 10 inches in diameter
4 potatoes (fill the pot if you like)
4-5 carrots (fill the pot if you like)
shallots/small onions

Directions:
Pierce the fleshy parts and insert slivers of garlic throughout the ribs backside and front. If you like garlic go nutz. Take a handfull of rosemary and press it into the surface of the pork ribs massaging it gentley-both sides-(let stand for a little bit) Clean and chop all vegtables, if you don't have small onions quarter larger ones. You can peel the potatoes, red ones always taste better with the skin on. When you're done with the veggies, take the plum sauce and coat the entire rack back & front generously. Stand the rack upright with the cartiledge pointing upward. Take all your vegtables and put them in the pot (center) of the rack. It keeps them standing upright. I sometimes use stuffing instead and serve with a  turkey meal, or roast duck. The oven should be set @ 350 degrees. This is a slow cook. It should take no more than 2 hours. You can't burn it unless you forget about it, the juices will be amazing. Nice gravy, for the potatoes.
