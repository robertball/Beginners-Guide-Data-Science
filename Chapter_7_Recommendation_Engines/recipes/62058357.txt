Ingredients:
-4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
-1 16 oz jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and patted dry on paper towels
-4 1/4 inch thin mozzerella slices (prepackaged sandwich cheese works great here)
-2 cups bottled Italian dressing, NOT FAT FREE.

Directions:
Place the chicken and dressing in a bowl or  gal sized ziplock, and refrigerate 4-6 hours to marinate. Heat a large, deep skillet over med-high heat, pour in the dressing, then lay in the chicken pieces. Cook mostly undisturbed until lightly browned and just cooked through, about 10 min each side. While that cooks, preheat broiler. Remove chicken to a foil lined baking sheet. Place a layer of peppers on each breast, then top that with a piece (or two) of cheese. Place under the broiler for just a minute or two to melt and brown the cheese. Serve immediately.
