Combine basil, pine nuts, Asiago, garlic, pepper, and salt in a food processor; pulse until uniformly chopped. Gradually add olive oil until a thick paste forms. Taste and adjust the seasoning.

Description: 
This is a fairly simple recipe I came across years ago. It is divided into two parts, the pesto and an Alfredo sauce, and then the two are mixed together! Serve over hot pasta. Have fun with the pasta - some of our favorites for this are penne and farfalle (bow tie).
