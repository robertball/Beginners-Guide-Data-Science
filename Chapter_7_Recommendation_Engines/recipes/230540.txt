Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/3 cup light corn syrup (such as KaroÂ®)
1/2 cup water
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix sugar, corn syrup, and water together in a microwave-safe bowl.
Cook sugar mixture in the microwave until mixture is 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), or until a small amount of sugar mixture dropped into cold water forms a rigid ball, 3 minutes.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks.
Stir sugar mixture into egg whites until no longer glossy, about 7 minutes. Stir in vanilla extract.
Drop candy by teaspoonfuls onto a sheet of waxed paper. Let stand until cooled, 15 minutes.
