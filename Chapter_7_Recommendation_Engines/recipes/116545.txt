Ingredients:
3/4 pound boneless pork roast, cut into 1 inch cubes
1 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup chopped green pepper
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 cup dry red wine or beef broth
1 cup canned diced tomatoes
1/2 cup salsa
2 tablespoons canned chopped green chiles, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 dash ground cloves
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped

Directions:
In a large saucepan, cook the pork in oil over medium heat until no longer pink; remove and set aside. In the same pan, saute the green pepper, onion and garlic for 1-2 minutes or until tender. Stir in the pork, wine or broth, tomatoes, salsa, 1 tablespoon chilies, cumin, sugar and cloves. Cover and cook over low heat for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the parsley, jalapeno and remaining chilies. Cover and cook 20-25 minutes longer or until meat is tender.

Description: 
Doris McGuire found other recipes for green chili stew to be too bland, so she created this version at her home in Grants Pass, Oregon. 'It makes a great dinner served with corn bread sticks and a simple salad,' she writes.
