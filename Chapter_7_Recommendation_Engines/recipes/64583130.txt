Description: 
These banana and peanut butter overnight oats are the perfect breakfast for people who don’t have much time for faffing in the mornings. 2 or 3 minutes of effort the night before, then in the morning you can grab the tub straight from the fridge and you’re all set – much quicker than cooking up porridge. They can even be eaten on the go if you’re running late. You can add whatever flavours you fancy – fruit, nuts, maple syrup or honey, chocolate spread, seeds, it's your breakfast!
