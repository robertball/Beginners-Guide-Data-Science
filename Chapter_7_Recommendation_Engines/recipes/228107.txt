Ingredients:
8 red potatoes
6 slices bacon
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cucumber, chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
3 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1 cup celery, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon paprika
salt and pepper to taste
1 hard-cooked egg, sliced
3 sprigs fresh parsley, or as desired
1 pinch paprika, for garnish

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool. Chop potatoes and transfer into a large salad bowl.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble bacon when cool.
Stir mayonnaise, crumbled bacon, cucumber, red onion, 3 chopped eggs, celery, 1/2 cup parsley, and 1 tablespoon paprika into the potatoes until thoroughly combined. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Garnish salad with slices of hard-cooked egg, 3 sprigs of fresh parsley, and a pinch of paprika.

Description: 
Did not see this recipe anywhere on Allrecipes and, as it's been a huge favorite here for years, I decided to post it. Dazzling with a nice steak! Serve year round. Turkey bacon and fat-free mayo may be substituted, though keep in mind that both will sacrifice a bit of taste. :)
