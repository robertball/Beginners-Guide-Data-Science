Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 yellow cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla
4 eggs
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated)
1 cup whole milk or evaporated milk
1 cup whipping cream
1 (12 ounce) container Betty Crocker速 Whipped fluffy white frosting

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pan). Grease and flour or spray bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan.
In large bowl, beat cake mix, water, oil, vanilla and eggs with electric mixer on low speed 30 seconds, then on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour into pan.
Bake 29 to 35 minutes or until edges are golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes. Poke top of hot cake every 1/2 inch with long-tined fork, wiping fork occasionally to reduce sticking.
In large bowl, stir together sweetened condensed milk, whole milk and whipping cream. Carefully pour evenly over top of cake. Cover; refrigerate about 1 hour or until mixture is absorbed into cake. Frost with frosting.
