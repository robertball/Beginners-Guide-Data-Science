Ingredients:
1 (20-oz) bag shredded hash browns (like Simply Potatoes)
3 slices Canadian bacon, chopped
1/3 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup red bell pepper, chopped
2 Tbsp parsley, chopped
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
2 Tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Coat 12 muffin tins with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine potatoes, Canadian bacon, onions, red bell pepper, parsley, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Toss lightly with a fork, drizzle with olive oil, and toss with fork again until well mixed.
Spoon mixture evenly into 12 muffins cups, and with the back of a spoon, press lightly to pack into each cup.
Bake for 50-55 minutes or until potatoes are browned.
Remove from oven, run a small knife or spatula around the edge of each cup, making sure the edges are loosened.  Lift each potato cup out, and invert to serve with the bottom side up.
