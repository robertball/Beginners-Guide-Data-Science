Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, softened
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese
4 ounce Cool Whip
2 tablespoons of lemon juice
1/2 cup confectioners sugar
2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant lemon pudding mix
3 1/2 cups milk
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine the flour and butter in a food processor, then mix in nuts and pulse until a ball forms. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.
In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, lemon juice, and sugar together until smooth and well blended. Spread evenly over the cooled crust. In another bowl, whisk together the lemon pudding mix and milk for 3 to 5 minutes. Spread over the cream cheese layer. Chill until set, then top with whipped topping.
