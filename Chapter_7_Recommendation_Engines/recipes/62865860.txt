Ingredients:
Canola oil, for the rack
1/2 tsp paprika
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
Kosher salt & Black pepper
2 1/4 lbs bone-in chicken parts (thighs, legs, or breasts), skin removed
1 cup crushed buttery round crackers (such as Ritz; about 4oz)
1/4 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 TB vinegar
3/4 lb broccoli, chopped (about 4 cups), or 12 oz broccoli slaw
1 large carrot, coarsely grated
1/2 small shallot, chopped

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and lightly coat with oil.  In a shallow baking dish, combine the paprika, 1 cup of the buttermilk, and 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper.  Add the chicken and turn to coat.
Place the crushed crackers in a shallow bowl.  Remove the chicken from the buttermilk mixture and coat with the crackers, pressing gently to help them adhere.  Place the chicken on the rack and bake, turning halfway through, until crispy and an instant-read thermometer register 165 degrees in the center of the thickest piece of chicken, 40 to 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, vinegar, the remaining 1/4 cup of buttermilk, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Add the broccoli or broccoli slaw, carrot and shallot and toss to combine.  Serve with the chicken.
