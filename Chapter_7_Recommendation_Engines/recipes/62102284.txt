Ingredients:
3 cups self-raising flour
1 cup cold lemonade (or soda water to make a lower calorie version)
1 cup pouring cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 420-430 degrees
Grease and lightly flour an oven tray
Sift flour into a large bowl
Combine lemonade and cream and add the combined mixture to the sifted flour
Combine until just combined
The dough will be a bit sticky so lightly flour your hands and place dough on greased and floured oven tray
Gently pat down and cut into triangles or squares
Do NOT over handle the dough. The lemonade puts a lot of air into the mixture. If you handle too much the air bubbles will come out and the scones will not rise.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.

Description: 
These scones are so quick and simple. They only have three ingredients and produce deliciously light scones. The bubbles in the lemonade makes them rise. There is no need to rub butter as in the traditional scone recipe. Can be served hot with whipped cream and berry jam.
