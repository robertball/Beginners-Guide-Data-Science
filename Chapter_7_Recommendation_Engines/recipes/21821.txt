Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds beef sirloin
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3/4 cup salsa
1/3 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
6 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Cut beef into thin strips. (Beef is easier to cut if partially frozen, about 1 1/2 hours.)
Heat 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add oil; rotate skillet to coat sides.
Add beef; stir-fry 2 to 3 minutes or until brown; drain. Stir in salsa, ketchup, brown sugar and mustard. Cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes or until hot. Serve in tortillas with sour cream, shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes, if desired.
