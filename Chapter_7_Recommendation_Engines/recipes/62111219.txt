Spread evenly over each piece of halibut
Bake at 475 degrees for approx 20 min, depending on thickness of filets.  Check center of one filet with fork.  You want the halibut to be slightly white with a little opaque.  Once the halibut is pulled from the oven, let it sit for 5 min and it will be done perfectly.  Do not over cook!  Garnish with fresh dill or a slice of lemon.
