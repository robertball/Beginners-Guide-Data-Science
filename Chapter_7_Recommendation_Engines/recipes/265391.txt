Description: 
The sweet-salty combination of watermelon, feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, and mint might sound strange but once you've tried it you'll be convinced. A perfect summer appetizer or even light lunch, this Greek watermelon pizza looks beautiful, is a little different, and couldn't be easier to make.
