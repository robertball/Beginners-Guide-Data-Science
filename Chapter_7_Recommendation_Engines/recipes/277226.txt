Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups half-and-half, divided
4 ounces semisweet Belgian chocolate (43% cacao)
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1/2 cup Cabernet Sauvignon
1 pinch grated chocolate

Directions:
Combine 1 cup half-and-half and Belgian chocolate in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally with a whisk, until chocolate is melted and mixture is hot, about 5 minutes. Add Cabernet Sauvignon and heat for 2 minutes more, whisking occasionally, until hot. Divide into 2 mugs.
Heat remaining 1/2 cup of half-and-half either on the stove or in the microwave until hot. Transfer to a milk frother and froth until creamy. Divide frothed half-and-half between the 2 mugs and sprinkle with grated chocolate.
