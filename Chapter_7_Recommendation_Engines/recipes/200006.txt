Ingredients:
5 slices bacon
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 (28 ounce) can tomatoes with liquid
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 cups diced potatoes
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
6 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste
salt and pepper to taste
2 pounds catfish, cut into bite-sized pieces

Directions:
Place the bacon in a Dutch oven or a large pot with a lid; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Reserving the drippings in the skillet, remove the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. Crumble the bacon and set aside.
Put the onions in the pot; cover and allow to cook about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes, tomato sauce, potatoes, Worcestershire sauce, and hot pepper sauce into the onions. Season with salt and pepper; allow to simmer 30 minutes. Stir the crumbled bacon and catfish into the mixture; continue cooking until the fish flakes easily, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
When my children were young, we camped most weekends in the summer. Saturday night was usually 'catfish night' with fish straight from the lake into the pot or pan. This was a real quickie favorite.
