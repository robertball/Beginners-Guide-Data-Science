Description: 
Fire up the tiki torches -- it's time for a luau! This delicious slow-roasted pork is rubbed with sea salt and liquid smoke to recall the glorious flavors of pig cooked in a traditional Hawaiian imu. Once cooked and cooled, it can be shredded and served with poi, yams or even on a bun. You may use ordinary sea salt for this recipe if the Hawaiian variety is unavailable.
