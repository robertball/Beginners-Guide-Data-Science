Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) broiler-fryer chicken
2 1/2 quarts water
2 celery ribs with leaves
1 large onion, cut into chunks
DRESSING:
4 celery ribs, chopped
2 small onions, chopped
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 cups crumbled cornbread
1 cup chopped green onions
3/4 cup chopped pecans, toasted
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley
2 eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
Place chicken in a soup kettle or Dutch oven. Add the water, celery and onion; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until chicken is tender. Remove chicken from broth. Strain broth, discarding vegetables; set broth aside. When cool enough to handle, remove chicken from bones; dice and place in a large bowl.
In a skillet, saute celery and onions in butter until tender; stir in salt, sage, pepper and cayenne. Add to chicken. Stir in the corn bread, green onions, pecans, parsley and eggs. Add 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 cups of reserved broth, stirring gently to mix. (Refrigerate remaining broth for another use.)
Transfer to greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and bake at 325 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover; bake 15-20 minutes longer or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F.
