Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1/2 cup butter
2 cloves garlic, diced
1 pound green bell pepper, chopped
1 1/2 pounds onion, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
5 cups canned diced tomatoes with their juice
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'centÂ®)
1 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef and ground pork. Cook and stir until the meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Set meat aside. Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked meat, pinto beans, tomatoes, parsley, chili powder, pepper, monosodium glutamate, salt, and cumin. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer for 1 hour.
