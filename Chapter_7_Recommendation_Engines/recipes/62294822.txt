Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, cooked and deboned
2 chicken bullion cubes
1 cup rice
3 stalks of celery, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped, optional
1/2 stick of margarine
salt and pepper, to your taste

Directions:
In a big pot, put 6 cups of water and the bouillons and boil until bouillon has dissolved. Put the chicken in broth on medium heat  and cook until done. May take an hour, depending the size of the chicken. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken and discard. I shred the chicken with my hands and put into a bowl and set aside. DO NOT PUT INTO FOOD PROCESSOR. Add margarine, let it boil for 15 minutes or til dissolved. Add celery, onion, rice, salt and pepper  to the broth and boil on medium heat. Add the chicken and stir. Cook til rice is done. Probably 20 to 30min. *Add more water if too thick, 1 cup at a time.

Description: 
My mom use to make this when I was a little girl. I added chicken bullion cubes to add more flavor. Every time I make this recipe it all gets eaten the same day. Even my children love it!
