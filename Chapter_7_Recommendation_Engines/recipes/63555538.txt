Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1/2 cup whole milk ricotta cheese
1 large egg
2 cups pancake mix (I used gluten free)
2 tablespoons coconut oil or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Ingredients â€“ Blueberry Sauce
1 cup fresh blueberries (can use frozen, thaw first)
1/2 cup sugar (or agave)
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Making the waffles: In a large bowl whisk milk, ricotta and egg until smooth; add remaining ingredients and combine well. Set aside and heat your waffle maker.
In a small sauce pan heat the blueberry ingredients and bring to a boil. Immediately stir and lower temperature to a low simmer until ready!
Once your waffle maker is heated; coat with cooking spray or brush with butter.
Add a scoop full of batter in the center of the waffle iron and close. Let cook for about 3 minutes then check if done. (each iron is different).
Pour blueberry sauce on top of each waffle!
