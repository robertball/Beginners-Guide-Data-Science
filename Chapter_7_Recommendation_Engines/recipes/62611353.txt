Ingredients:
1 large red onion sliced
4 cloves of garlic
1/2 C. red wine
2 28 oz. cans of diced tomato
1 bunch fresh basil chopped
1 can tomato paste
1T. Italian seasoning
1/2 t. red pepper flakes
2 12oz jars roasted red peppers
2 C. vegetable stock
1 to 1 1/2 C. heavy cream

Directions:
Saute red onion till caramelized then add garlic. When you begin to smell garlic, add the wine. Add the diced tomato, basil and tomato paste.
Stir in the seasoning and pepper flakes. Chop up the roasted peppers and add them, let cook for about 15 mins.
Remove from stove and either use a food processor or blender to smooth out soup. Do it in batches so you don't get burned. Add a little vegetable stock to each batch you blend. You want it just a little chunky, but not to chunky. Return to the stove and add the heavy cream and heat to a temp. to eat.
I serve this with homemade croutons. Cut up a loaf of artisan bread, (I used a rosemary one), and put it on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, pepper and garlic powder, mix to coat each piece. Cook in a 350 degree oven until brown. Take out and put the oven on broil. Sprinkle the top of croutons with with grated, fresh parm cheese and just put under the broiler to melt cheese on croutons.
Put croutons on top of soup with a little more fresh grated parm cheese and enjoy!
