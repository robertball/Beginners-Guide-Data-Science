Ingredients:
2 liters lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1 (4 ounce) jar maraschino cherries
1 (46 fluid ounce) can pineapple juice
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans frozen orange juice concentrate
1 drop peppermint extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pint orange sherbet

Directions:
Use 1 liter of lemon-lime soda to fill an ice cube tray. Reserving the cherry juice, place the maraschino cherries into the soda filled tray. Freeze 1 hour, or until solid.
In a punch bowl, mix the remaining 1 liter lemon-lime soda, reserved maraschino cherry juice, pineapple juice, and orange juice concentrate. Flavor with peppermint and vanilla extract. Slide in the orange sherbet and the ice cubes you made earlier.
