Ingredients:
4 lbs of Bavarian or Polish sauerkraut, rinsed well, drained, and cut up, and excess liquid squeezed out.
5 medium yellow onions, chopped
1 pound portabella mushrooms, chopped
3 TBSP. sugar
1 TBSP. salt
2 1/2 to 3 sticks butter (do not use margerine)

Directions:
In frying pan, fry mushrooms, and onions in butter till tender.  Add saurkraut that has been squeezed dry, sugar, salt, and cook until golden and liquid is cooked out.  Let filling cool as you get dough ready.
Fill pierogis with this.  It will take about 3 batches of dough to use all this filling up.
This is the Polish version of pierogi. The Russian version substitutes chopped hard boiled egg for the mushrooms.
People also fry onions to serve along with their pierogi's and top with sour creme.

The Polish pronounce it Pierogi, and the Russians pronounce it Pieroshki.  This is a sourkraut filling for the delicious little dumplings that are often eaten on Christmas Eve as part of the meatless meal.  Even my toddler gobbles these up!
