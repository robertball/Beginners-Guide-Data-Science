Ingredients:
6 medium-sized beets, scrubbed and ends trimmed
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
1/8 tsp cracked black pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp dill

Directions:
1. Using a mandolin, thinly slice beets to about 1/16" thickness. Place beet slices in a bowl and add in salt. Toss to combine. Allow beets to sit for about 30 minutes. Drain excess liquid.
2. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
3. Pour olive oil over beets and toss to combine. Mix together black pepper, garlic powder, and dill. Sprinkle over beets and toss to coat. Place beet slices on cookie sheets in a single layer. Bake in preheated oven until beet chips are crispy, about 40-50 minutes. Sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.
Note: Make sure to slice the beets as thin as you can, or they will not get crispy. Also, watch them closely after 40 minutes to avoid them burning. I prefer to leave the skin on the beets, but you could peel them before slicing, if desired.
