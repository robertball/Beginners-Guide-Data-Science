Ingredients:
1 1/2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas, drained
1 1/2 onions, chopped
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 eggs
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 pinch ground black pepper, or to taste
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Mash chickpeas in a bowl using a masher. Combine mashed chickpeas, onions, parsley, and garlic in a blender and blend until smooth.
Mix eggs, cumin, coriander, salt, lemon juice, baking powder, black pepper, and cayenne together in a bowl. Add chickpea mixture and mix together. Add bread crumbs slowly and combine using your hands until mixture isn't sticky, but will hold together when frying.
Heat oil over medium-high heat in a skillet. Form mixture into about 12 patties about as wide as the palm of your hand. Fry patties in the hot oil until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
