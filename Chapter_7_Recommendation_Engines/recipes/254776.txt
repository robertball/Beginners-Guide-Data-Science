Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray (optional)
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
1 orange, zested
2 cups grated zucchini
1 cup mixed dried fruit
1/4 cup poppy seeds
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup orange juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x12-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, baking powder, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger together in a bowl.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in white sugar and brown sugar until incorporated. Mix in vegetable oil. Beat flour mixture in gradually until batter is smooth. Stir in orange zest. Fold in zucchini, dried fruit, and poppy seeds.
Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan, about 10 minutes.
Mix confectioners' sugar and orange juice together in a small bowl to make glaze.
Prick cake all over with a fork; drizzle glaze on top. Let cake cool completely before serving, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
A wonderful burst of citrus in a quick bread that takes no time at all to make! Rich batter fills an entire 8 x 12 pan and uses up that wonderful garden zucchini that is overflowing gardens in the fall. Delicious with or without glaze! Freezes extremely well!
