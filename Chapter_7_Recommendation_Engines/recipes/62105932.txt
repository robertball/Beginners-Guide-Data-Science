Ingredients:
1/4  	 cup high-quality dry  cat food
2 cups cooked ground beef, finely crumbled
1/4 cup grated carrots
1/2 cup canned grated parmesan cheese
1 large egg
1 tablespoon tomato paste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F.
Put the cat food in a food processor or blender and grind to a coarse powder. I use my Magic Bullet.
In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients, mixing thoroughly.
Form the dough into marble-sized balls or create a large pancake-like object with the dough, flattening it out to an even ½” thickness.
Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the bottoms of the treats are golden brown.
Remove from the oven, let cool thoroughly. Break apart if necessary and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Description: 
Not just for Italian cats! One of my cats, Sweet Pea, is always after my spaghetti. These treats have a great tomato and Parmesan aroma and taste that allows me to eat my food in peace while she indulges elsewhere. Note: These are a treat and should suppliment a healthy diet.
