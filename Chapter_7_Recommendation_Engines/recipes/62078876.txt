Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package white mushrooms, chopped
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon butter
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
Fresh parsley for garnish
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and sautee briefly until slightly soft. Add mushrooms and cook until softened. Place the cream cheese in a blender and transfer the mushrooms and the skillet liquid to the blender (you can choose to drain the mushrooms slightly if you wish). Blend until smooth and creamy, and pour into a glass or ceramic bowl. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours or until firm and pate-texture. Garnish with parsley and serve with bagel chips or wheat crackers.
