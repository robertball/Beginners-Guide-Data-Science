Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups hot water
1/3 cup olive oil, any oil is fine
1/3 cup honey
2  tablespoons molasses
1  tablespoon salt, Sea Salt is good
6 cups  of 100% whole grain wheat flour (can substitute one cup white flour into recipe)
2  tablespoons dry active yeast

Directions:
Combine 1 cup lukewarm water (100-105 F) and 2 Tbsp. yeast in a bowl to activate yeast.
Place 1 3/4 cups hot water and following four ingredients into the bowl and mix.
Add: 2 Cups 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour (to cool the water and end up with warm dough). Then add yeast mixture.
Lastly, add 4 Cups of 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour (may want to add 3 cups whole wheat and 1 cup white flour). Dough should be tacky. May want to add up to one cup more flour if too sticky (I don't).
When your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.
Grease two bread pans with Crisco or coconut oil. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.
Punch down dough and form into two loaves.
Place dough into loaf pans and let rise until double (one hour).
Preheat oven to 350 F, then bake for 36 minutes.
When done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled. (Condensation will make it soggy) Put in tinfoil to store on the counter. If you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick. Enjoy.
