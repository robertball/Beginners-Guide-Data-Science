Ingredients:
1 small bunch fresh Italian parsley, stemmed and roughly chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound fresh medium shrimp - shells on, rinsed, and patted dry
bamboo skewers
1 tablespoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's®), or to taste
1/2 cup salted butter
3 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Place parsley and olive oil into a resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Soak skewers in water during the last 30 minutes or so.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove shrimp from the marinade and thread onto skewers. Season generously with seasoned salt. Place parsley and remaining marinade in a grill-safe pan with butter and garlic.
Grill skewers until shrimp are pink and firm, about 3 minutes per side. In the meantime, place the grill pan on the grate; melt and simmer the butter-parsley mixture until butter is just golden-brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
Remove shrimp from skewers and drop into the butter-parsley mixture. Toss to coat. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Simple flavors... Grilled shrimp, finished in a basic, yet 'oh, so good' garlic and butter sauce. I am not a shells-on gal but they make heck of a difference. Pick them off the serving plate and enjoy! Get a napkin--you'll need it.
