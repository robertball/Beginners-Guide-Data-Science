Ingredients:
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup packed light-brown sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup vegetable shortening
1 can strained and pureed sweet potatoes
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and allspice.
Add the shortening and cut in with two knives until crumbly.
Add the sweet potatoes and mix well with a wooden spoon.
Add the cream and pecans and stir just until moistened.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Roll out the dough to 1 1/2 inches thick.  Cut out biscuits with a 2-inch floured biscuit cutter.
Place biscuits 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown.  Serve warm, or let cool on a wire rack until room temperature.
