Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3/4 cup orange juice
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups sliced celery
1 1/2 cups sliced carrots
4 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut in 1/2-inch strips
1/4 cup coarsely chopped peanuts
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the first five ingredients until smooth; set aside. In a nonstick skillet or wok, stir-fry celery and carrots in 2 teaspoons oil until crisp-tender. Remove and keep warm. In the same skillet, stir-fry chicken in remaining oil until no longer pink.
Return vegetables to the pan. Stir orange juice mixture and add to the pan. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Sprinkle with nuts. Serve over rice if desired.
