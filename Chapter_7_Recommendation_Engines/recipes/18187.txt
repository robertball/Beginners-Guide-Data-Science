Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, and baking soda. Add the egg, vanilla, and butter; mix until dough forms. Stir in the chopped walnuts. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the edges are golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
I invented this recipe last year and my family continues to beg for more. If you like, you can substitute pecans for the walnuts.
