Ingredients:
1 pound brown crimini mushrooms or baby bellas
2 tablespoons butter
1 small yellow onion, chopped
2/3 cup Holland HouseÂ® Sherry Cooking Wine
2 tablespoons flour
3 cups whole milk
1 (14 ounce) can reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon dried sage

Directions:
Wipe mushroom caps with a damp cloth. Trim stems and coarsely chop mushrooms. In a 6-quart pot, melt butter with onion. Add mushrooms and sherry cooking wine. Cook over high heat, stirring occasionally, 8-10 minutes or until most, but not all, of the liquid is absorbed. Sprinkle flour over mushrooms; stir in milk, broth, soy sauce and sage. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat. Simmer gently 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove soup from heat. Use an immersion blender to puree soup. Or pour soup into a blender in three batches. Blend each batch until smooth and return to pot to keep warm. Serve garnished with sniped chives or mild green onion.

Description: 
Served as a walk-around appetizer in mugs or as a sit-down first course, this creamy soup is as easy as it is delicious -- a mushroom-lover's delight and relatively low fat. If you wish, prepare the soup a day or two in advance and refrigerate. Warm it up on the stovetop or microwave just prior to serving.
