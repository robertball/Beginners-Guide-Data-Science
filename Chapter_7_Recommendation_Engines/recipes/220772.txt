Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 (14 ounce) can refried beans
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
6 (9 inch) flour tortillas
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
8 ounces sour cream
1/2 cup salsa, or to taste (optional)
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease from the skillet.
Stir refried beans, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, and taco seasoning into the drained ground beef mixture.
Spoon ground beef mixture down the center of each tortilla. Roll the tortillas around the beef filling.
Stir cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and salsa together in a bowl.
Spread about 1/2 the cream of mushroom soup mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange rolled tortillas into a single layer in the baking dish with the seam side down.
Pour remaining cream of mushroom soup mixture over the tortillas.
Top with 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and melted, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
This is a simple recipe that my family loves. I passed it along to my mom several years ago and she loves it as well. I sometimes add in a can of green chilies along with a diced jalapeno to the meat mixture. Hope all will enjoy!
