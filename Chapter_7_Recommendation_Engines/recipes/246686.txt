Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch salt
2 cups self-rising flour
1 cup chopped crystallized ginger
2 tablespoons white sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in egg, ground ginger, and salt. Gradually add flour until cookie dough comes together, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in chopped crystallized ginger.
Place 2 tablespoons white sugar in a shallow dish. Shape dough into balls, and roll one side in sugar. Press onto prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
