Ingredients:
1 large zucchini
1/2 cup vegetable broth, or as needed, divided
1 small onion, diced
1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 small tomato, diced
1 small portobello mushroom, cubed
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 (12 ounce) package veggie meat substitute (such as YvesÂ® Ground Round)
2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped

Directions:
Cut zucchini into noodles using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade. Set aside.
Combine 1/4 cup broth, onion, and tomato paste in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook until onion begins to soften, about 3 minutes. Add tomato, mushroom, garlic, oregano, thyme, tarragon, and marjoram. Cook until the mushroom just begins to soften, about 3 minutes more.
Stir veggie meat, spinach, and remaining 1/4 cup broth into the pan with the mushroom mixture. Add an additional 1/4 cup broth if the pan seems dry. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender and sauce is beginning to thicken, about 10 minutes.
Stir zucchini noodles into the pan with the sauce and cook to desired firmness, 3 to 5 minutes more.
