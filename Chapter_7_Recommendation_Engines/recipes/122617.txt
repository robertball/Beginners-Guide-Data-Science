3/4 cup sugar
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk

In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg, milk and vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Chill for 1 hour or until easy to handle.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8-in. thickness. Cut with cookie cutters of your choice. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 5-8 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

With a fresh breeze, my longtime-favorite sugar cookie recipe got under way on a new track. I cut out sailboats and frisky fish, frosting them brightly for the nautical gathering. My guests ate their limit! -Martha Conaway, Pataskala, Ohio
