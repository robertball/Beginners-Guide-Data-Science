Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
3 med lemons, juiced
2 TBSP minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
1/3 teaspoon paprika
1 tsp. of crushed basil
1 tsp. of crushed oregano
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper

Directions:
Cut 3 slits in each chicken breast to allow marinade to penetrate. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika for about 30 seconds. Place chicken in a large bowl, and pour marinade over. Using your hands, work marinade into chicken. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.
Cook chicken on grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear.
