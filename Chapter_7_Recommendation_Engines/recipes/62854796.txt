Ingredients:
1 cup flour
3 large eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups plain breadcrumbs
2 organic lemons, 1 zested and 1 cut into wedges
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
2 TB chopped fresh thyme
2 cloves garlic
1/2 cup grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese
1 1/2 lbs pork tenderloin, chicken or veal cutlets, pounded 1/8 in thick
Salt & Pepper
EVOO, for frying
3 ripe heirloom tomatoes, diced
1 ear corn, kernels scraped from cob
1/2 small red onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup basil leaves, torn or shredded, or 1/4 cup tarragon leaves, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Place a rack on a baking sheet.  Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes.  Combine the lemon zest, parsley, thyme and garlic on a cutting board and finely chop together to form a gremolata.  Add to the bread crumbs along with the cheese and work through with your fingers.
Season the cutlets with salt and pepper, then coat in the flour, the eggs and the breadcrumbs.  In a large skillet, heat a layer of EVOO over medium-high heat.
In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, corn, onion and basil (or tarragon).  Season with salt and pepper.
Fry the cutlets in batches for 3 minutes on each side.  Transfer to the prepare baking sheet and keep warm in the oven as you continue.  Top with the tomato-corn salad and serve with the lemon wedges.
