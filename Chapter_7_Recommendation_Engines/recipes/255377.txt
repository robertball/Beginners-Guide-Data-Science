Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups white sugar
2 cups persimmon pulp
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Glaze:
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x16-inch baking pan.
Combine flour, 2 1/2 cups sugar, persimmon pulp, milk, butter, eggs, baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 1 hour. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue baking until top is browned, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool, about 10 minutes; pudding will sink in the center.
Combine 1 cup sugar, water, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar has dissolved into a clear glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour over warm pudding; let stand until set, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
The best persimmon recipe I have ever tried. Handed down in my wife's family from her mother and grandmother. 
If you have not tried persimmons, this is an excellent place to start.
