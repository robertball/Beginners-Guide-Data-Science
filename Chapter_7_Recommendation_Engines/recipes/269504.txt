Ingredients:
4 bone-in pork chops, trimmed of fat
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch ground cumin
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (15.25 ounce) can Tex-Mex style corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can Ranch-style mixed beans, drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1/3 cup brown sugar
4 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Season pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes.
Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook, in batches if necessary, until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Combine corn, beans, tomatoes, and brown sugar in the skillet. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Return pork chops to the skillet and cover. Reduce heat and simmer until chops are slightly pink in the centers, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve over rice.
