1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker® SuperMoist® white cake mix
1 1/4 cups water

3 egg whites
1 (10 ounce) jar lemon curd
1 (12 ounce) container Betty Crocker® Whipped fluffy white frosting

Heat oven to 350 degrees F for shiny metal pans (or 325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Place paper baking cup in each of 24 regular-size muffin cups.
In large bowl, make cake mix as directed on box, using water, oil and egg whites. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups.
Bake as directed on box or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
