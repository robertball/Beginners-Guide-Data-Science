Ingredients:
Cake:
1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
4 eggs
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 (6 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, quartered, juice drained and reserved
1 (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips
Filling:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 (12 ounce) can cherry pie filling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.
Combine chocolate cake mix and instant pudding mix in a large bowl. Add eggs, water, and vegetable oil; mix well to combine. Mix in 1/2 cup maraschino cherry juice until smooth. Stir in cherry pieces and chocolate chips. Divide cake batter between prepared pans, filling each halfway.
Bake cakes in the preheated oven until toothpicks inserted in the centers come out clean, 26 to 32 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, 10 minutes. Remove from pans and transfer to wire racks to cool completely, about 1 hour.
Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Add sugar and cream of tartar. Increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form, 4 to 6 minutes.
Spread 1/4 of the whipped cream evenly over the bottom cake layer. Cover whipped cream with a thin layer of pie filling. Place second layer of cake on top. Spread another 1/4 of the whipped cream over the second layer; cover with pie filling. Place third layer of cake on top. Spread remaining whipped cream on top; cover with remaining pie filling.

Description: 
I lived in Germany when I was little and I continue to love German desserts. Black Forest Cake is one of my faves, only I Americanized it and made it more amazing! I took my mom's great chocolate cake and added to it to create this masterpiece which recently took first place in the cake division of our city bake-off. My husband took the leftovers to a Chemistry Society meeting and they said that it was amazing and he didn't bring any back home with him. I hope you enjoy it just as much as those judges and those crazy chemists.
