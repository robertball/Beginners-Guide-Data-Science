Description: 
A very interesting use for the highly productive fresh basil herb. This recipe for a sweet and savory jelly is written for opal basil, but I bet it would work very well for exotic varieties with sweet notes like lemon basil or others.
Try this on your herb bumper crop to bring some major interest to your morning toast! I am dying to try it on pork or chicken!
