Ingredients:
6 (6 ounce) fillets cod
6 cups water
1 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons salt
1 ½ cups butter, melted
1 dash paprika

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
Place the fish in a large saucepan.  Mix together the water, sugar, and salt. Pour the water-mixture over the fish. The water-mixture should fully cover the fish, if it doesn't add more water.  Bring the water to a boil over a  medium-high heat.  Boil for 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove fillets from water, and blot on paper towels to remove excess water. Brush with 6 tablespoons melted butter, and sprinkle with paprika.
Broil for 8 to 10 minutes per inch of thickness, or until the fillets are golden brown.  Serve with the remaining melted butter.
