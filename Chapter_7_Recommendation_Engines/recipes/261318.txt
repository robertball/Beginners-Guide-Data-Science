Ingredients:
1 large tomato, chopped
2 red chile peppers, chopped, divided
7 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon ginger paste
2 tablespoons tamarind pulp
1 cup water
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion
2 1/4 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 medium tomato, diced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 dried whole lime
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons dried whole lime powder
2 cups boiling water
1/2 cup cilantro, finely chopped
salt to taste

Directions:
Mix chopped tomato, 1 chile, garlic, and ginger paste together in a bowl.
Soak tamarind pulp in 1 cup water for 15 minutes. Rub tamarind by hand to loosen the seeds. Add flour and mix well. Filter the mixture through a sieve; discard residue.
Heat oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp; saute until shrimp is opaque and oil hisses, about 6 minutes. Mix in remaining chile, diced tomato, tomato paste, and dried whole lime. Add black pepper, turmeric, and lime powder; stir to combine.
Pour boiling water into the shrimp mixture; add cilantro and the tamarind-flour mixture. Mix well. Bring to a boil and reduce to medium-low heat. Let simmer until stew is nicely thickened, about 45 minutes. Add salt; simmer until flavors blend, about 15 minutes more.
