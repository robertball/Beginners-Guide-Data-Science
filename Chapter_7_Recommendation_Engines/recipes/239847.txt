Ingredients:
1 pound broccoli crowns, cut into small pieces
1/2 pound cauliflower, broken into small florets
1/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
2/3 cup grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons bread crumbs

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add broccoli and cauliflower and cook uncovered until tender yet firm to the bite, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain and transfer broccoli-cauliflower to a baking dish.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; add flour and stir until browned and bubbling, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk half-and-half and Dijon mustard into butter-flour mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until cream sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes.
Stir 2/3 cup Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and paprika into cream sauce; cook and stir until cheeses are melted. Season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over broccoli-cauliflower mixture and top with 3 tablespoons Cheddar cheese and bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
