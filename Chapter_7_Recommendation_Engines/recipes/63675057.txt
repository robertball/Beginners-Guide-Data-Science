Ingredients:
4 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cardamom, and 1 cup crisco. Work like pie dough. Dissolve 1 pkg yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar in 1/4 cup water.

Directions:
Fresh out of the oven! I used Jane Mosset's overnight kuchen dough recipe and compared a few different kuchen custard recipes and came up with: 4 eggs slightly beaten, 1 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups half & half, 1 tsp. vanilla. Mix until well blended. I used 2 cans of peaches packed in juice and well drained. I layered the fruit on the dough and then poured the custard over the top. I baked them at 325 for about 45 minutes. My oven runs a little cool so it may take less time in other ovens.
