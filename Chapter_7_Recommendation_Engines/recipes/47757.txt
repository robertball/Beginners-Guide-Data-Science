Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves chopped fresh garlic
2 cups sliced chanterelle mushrooms
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups Arborio rice
5 cups vegetable broth
2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
salt
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Cook and stir the garlic and mushrooms in the melted butter for three minutes, being sure to brown the mushrooms little. Set aside.
Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in rice, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Slowly add vegetable broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and allowing all the liquid to be absorbed before adding more broth. Continue cooking until the rice is tender to the tooth. Stir in the mushroom mixture and heat through, about 1 minute.  Stir in cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
