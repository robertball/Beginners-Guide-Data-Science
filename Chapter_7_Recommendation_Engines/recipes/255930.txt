Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 pounds butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and chopped
2 small onions, chopped
2 small carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
5 cups chicken broth
2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup maple syrup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cup heavy whipping cream
2 cups peeled and diced Granny Smith apples
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add butternut squash, onions, carrots, and celery; cook, stirring often, until onions are tender, about 12 minutes.
Pour broth into the pot; stir in 2 teaspoons cinnamon and nutmeg. Cover and simmer until carrots are soft, about 40 minutes. Stir maple syrup, salt, and pepper into the soup.
Cool soup slightly, about 10 minutes. Puree in a food processor or blender in small batches until smooth. Transfer to another pot; stir in heavy cream.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix apples, white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together and spread on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake apple mixture in the preheated oven until softened, 7 to 8 minutes.
Serve soup garnished with baked apples.
