Ingredients:
1 bunch Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli), trimmed
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the Chinese broccoli and cook uncovered until just tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Meanwhile, whisk the sugar, cornstarch, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, ginger, and garlic together in a small saucepan over medium heat until thickened and no longer cloudy, 5 to 7 minutes. Toss the broccoli in the sauce and serve.
