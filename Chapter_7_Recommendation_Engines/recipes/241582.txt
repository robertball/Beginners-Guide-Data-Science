1/2 cup Gay Lea Gold 18% Sour Cream
1/4 cup mixed chopped fresh herbs such as parsley, chives, tarragon and/or dill
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

Whisk sour cream with mixed herbs, vinegar, honey, mustard, salt and pepper until combined; set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil; add potatoes and cook for 12 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water.
