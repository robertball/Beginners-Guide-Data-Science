Ingredients:
Southwest Sauce:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup ranch dressing
1/4 cup taco sauce
4 (4 ounce) hamburger patties
1 dash Worcestershire sauce, or to taste
8 flour tortillas
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese
1/2 head lettuce, shredded, or to taste
3 tablespoons picante sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Mix sour cream, ranch dressing, and taco sauce together in a bowl until Southwest sauce is smooth. Cover bowl and refrigerate for flavors to blend.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook hamburger patties in the preheated grill for 5 minutes, seasoning with Worcestershire sauce. Flip patties. Arrange tortillas on the grill and lower heat to medium-low under tortillas. Add Cheddar cheese and Colby-Jack cheese to tortillas; cook until cheeses melt, 2 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking hamburger patties until cooked through, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Spread Southwest sauce onto 1/2 of the tortillas; top with lettuce and picante sauce. Place 1 hamburger patty on top of picante sauce layer and top patty with a tortilla, creating a sandwich.

Description: 
This is a great twist on the hamburger that everyone is sure to love! It's a combination of southwest and the classic American hamburger. I have three kids who all eat very differently from one another and this was a hit for them as well as hubby! I like to serve these with either sweet potato fries or green bean fries!
