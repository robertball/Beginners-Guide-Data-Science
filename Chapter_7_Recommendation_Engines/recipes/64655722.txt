Ingredients:
Chocolate Waffle Cone
1 C sugar
4 large egg whites
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 Tsp salt
4 Tbsp butter melted
6 Tbsp Cocoa powder
11 Tbsp flour
Choco Taco
Blue Bunny Ice Cream any flavor
Chocolate waffle cone recipe
Chocolate wafers
Chopped peanuts

Directions:
Slice the rounded sides of the ice cream, straight through the container
Then cut half circle "log" into 5-6 slices.
Lay them out and refreeze
Mix all the chocolate waffle ingredients together, until smooth
In a waffle cone maker pipe a lot of batter into the machine (about 2 Tbsp)
Cook for about 40 seconds
Pull out the waffle cone "oval" and place one of the frozen ice cream half circles onto it, and wrap it up
Place back in the freezer, work about 3 taco's at a time, you don't want the ice cream to melt, it will make the waffles too soggy.
Melt the chocolate wafers and let cool to room temperature, then dip the open ice cream side of the taco into the chocolate, covering all the exposed ice cream.
Then immediately dip into the chopped peanuts.
Keep frozen until you are ready to serve.
