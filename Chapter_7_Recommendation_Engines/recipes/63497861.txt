Ingredients:
1 lb. Lean Ground Turkey
1 Egg, beaten
1 C. Oatmeal
1/2 med. Onion
3 Tbsp. Pear Applesauce
1 tsp. (ea.) Salt, Pepper
3 Tbsp. Chili seasoning
1 tsp. Garlic, minced
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
Sauce:
1/4 C. Br. Sugar
1/2 C. Barbecue Sauce (I use Sweet Baby Ray's)
1 tsp. Chili seasoning
2 Tbsp. Onions, chopped
2 tsp. Olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350* Mix all ingredients in large bowl with hands. Press mixture into 8 x 8 baking dish. Bake for approx. 50 minutes, basting with sauce periodically as meatloaf cooks.
For Sauce: Caramelize onions in small saucepan with Olive oil. Stir barbecue sauce, br. sugar and chili seasoning into saucepan with onions. Mix well over LOW heat. Cook just enough to warm sauce mixture. Periodically baste meatloaf with basting brush throughout cooking time to give meatloaf a nice glaze and flavor!
