Water
large pan to boil water in

Directions:
Fill pan 3/4 full of water.
Place pan on high heat to a rolling boil.
Meanwhile, in a bowl add 2 beaten eggs, salt and pepper and your choice of ingredients.(I use ham, onions and shredded cheddar cheese.)
Pour mixed ingredients into the ziplock bag and seal.
