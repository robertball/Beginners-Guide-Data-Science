Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 1/3 cups water
2/3 cup quinoa
1/2 cup cauliflower florets, or more to taste
3 carrots, shredded
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste
2 large eggs
1/4 cup chopped fresh kale
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon flax seeds (optional)
1 tablespoon chia seeds (optional)
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini muffin tin with oil.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain any excess liquid and let cool briefly.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.
Mix cooked quinoa, steamed cauliflower, carrots, Cheddar cheese, eggs, kale, flour, flax seeds, chia seeds, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Spoon mixture into the muffin cups and press down lightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool in pan, about 5 minutes. Remove bites from pan and let cool, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This is by far my favorite vegetarian quinoa recipe. My 2-year-old went crazy eating them. He couldn't even tell there were veggies in it! He asked for seconds... and thirds.
