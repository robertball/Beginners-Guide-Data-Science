Ingredients:
3 tablespoons pesto
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 pound chicken breast tenderloins
1 cup panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk pesto and mayonnaise together in a bowl. Dredge both sides of each chicken tender in the pesto mixture and coat with bread crumbs. Arrange tenders on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Turn chicken pieces and continue baking until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
