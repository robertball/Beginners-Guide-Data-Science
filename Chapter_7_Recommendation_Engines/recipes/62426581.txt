Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
1 bunch spinach, thick stems removed and leaves chopped (about 4 cups)
1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1/2 cup whole-wheat bread crumbs
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
Sea salt and black pepper
1/4 cup clean ketchup
2 pounds red potatoes, quartered
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup jarred marinara sauce, warmed (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400° F. In a bowl, combine the turkey, onion, spinach, parsley, bread crumbs, mustard, egg white, and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper.
Transfer the mixture to a baking sheet and form it into a 10-inch loaf. Spread with the ketchup. Bake until cooked through, 45 to 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pot of enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Mash with the buttermilk, oil, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
Serve the meat loaf with the potatoes and the marinara sauce, if using

Description: 
Mixing spinach, whole-wheat bread crumbs, and lean turkey boosts the fiber and reduces the fat in this hearty classic. Buttermilk in the potatoes lowers the saturated fat.
