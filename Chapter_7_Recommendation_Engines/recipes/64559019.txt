Ingredients:
2  small flour tortillas
2 eggs
1/4 cup of onion
1/3 cup of sharp cheddar cheese
2 strips of bacon, cooked crispy
Cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Saute your onions until they begin to caramelize. Remove from heat and set aside
Whisk your eggs and fry them in a pan like an omelet. Keep it flat like a pancake. It will fit well in your tortillas.
Place one tortilla on a Belgium round waffle maker and place fried eggs, onions, cheese, and bacon. Place other tortilla on top. Close your waffle maker and cook until cheese is thoroughly melted, which is about 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove and cut in quarters. Garnish with cilantro and serve with salsa and plain Greek yogurt ( or sour cream) and enjoy!
