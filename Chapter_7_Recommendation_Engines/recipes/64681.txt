Ingredients:
2 cups canned white or yellow hominy, drained
2 cups fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
2 cups peeled and cubed butternut squash
1 1/2 cups diced peeled potatoes
5 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Place the hominy, green beans, squash, and potatoes into a pot, and pour in water and chicken bouillon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes. Blend flour into the butter, then stir into the soup. Increase heat to medium, and cook for 5 more minutes, or until soup thickens. Season with pepper, and serve.

Description: 
The Iroquois Indians cultivated and used the Three Sisters (corn, squash and beans) in their diet. This is a recipe passed down by our relatives. You may use regular corn instead of hominy, but hominy is more traditional.
