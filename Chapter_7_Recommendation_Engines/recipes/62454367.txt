Ingredients:
1 pre-cooked Roasted Chicken from the deli, shredded
1 26oz can of cream of chicken soup
1/2 bag of frozen mixed vegetables
2 cups of cooked rice or mashed potatoes
1 sheet of puff pastry, thawed
4 Tbsp of butter
1 Tbsp of minced onion flakes
1/2 tsp of celery seed
1/2 cup of milk
pinch of black pepper
4 large ramekins or other oven-safe dishes

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Add the minced onion and celery seed to the pan.  When the onions have softened, add the chicken and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the soup, the vegetables, rice, and pepper.  Cook for another 2 minutes, then add milk and mix well.
If using mashed potatoes, scoop 1/4 cup of potatoes in the bottom of your ramekin.  Top with soup mixture.
Bake at 350 for 15 minutes.
Roll out the puff pastry into a thin sheet (the puff pastry will rise in the oven.)  Cut circles the same size as your ramekins.  Place puff pastry circles on top of ramekins, and bake for another 15 minutes, or until golden.
Let rest for 10 minutes, these will be very hot.
Enjoy!
