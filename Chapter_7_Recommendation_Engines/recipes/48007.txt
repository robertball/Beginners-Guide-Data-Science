Ingredients:
4 Tyson® Individually Fresh Frozen® Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts, thawed
1/2 cup instant rice
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
1/2 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Combine water and bouillon granules in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil; add rice. Remove from heat; let stand 5 minutes. Stir in spinach and bell pepper; mix well.
Wash hands. Flatten each chicken breast to about 1/4 inch by pounding between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place one-fourth of rice mixture on each chicken breast. Roll up, tucking in edges. Wash hands.
Divide crescent roll dough into 4 squares. Press each square to measure 6 x 6 inches. Place chicken in center; fold dough to enclose chicken; press edges to seal. Place on greased baking pan, seam side down. Wash hands.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until dough is golden brown and chicken is done (internal temp 170 degrees F).
