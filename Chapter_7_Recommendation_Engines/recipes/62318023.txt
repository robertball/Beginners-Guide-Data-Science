Description: 
This is the best carrot cake I have ever eaten, and many others that I've made this cake for agree with me! I'm not a fan of carrot cakes with all those extras in them (i.e. pineapple, coconut, pecans, etc). All I want in my carrot cake is carrots. This is just the cake. The fact that it's made using just one bowl makes it even better! Trust me, you will not regret making this cake!
