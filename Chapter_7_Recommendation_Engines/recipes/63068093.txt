Ingredients:
8 Tbsp unsalted butter
4 Tbsp vegetable shortening
3 Cups flour
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1.2 tsp baking soda
1 1/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
1. Chill fat
Cut butter and shortening into 1/2" pieces and refrigerate about 30 minutes
2. Mix Dough
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in food processor until combined. Add chilled fats and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal.
3. Knead Dough
Transfer flour mixture to large bowl. Stir in buttermilk until combined. Turn out onto lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 8 to 10 times to form smooth, cohesive ball. Roll into 9" circle, about 3/4" thick
4. Cut biscuits
Use 2 1/2" biscuit cutter dipped in flour, cut out rounds and arrange upside down on prepared baking sheet. Gather remaining dough and pat gently into 3/4" thick circle. Cut out rounds from dough and transfer to baking sheet.
5. Bake Biscuits
Bake until biscuits begin to rise, about 5 min. Rotate pan and reduce oven temp to 400 degrees. Bake until golden brown, 10 to12 min more. Transfer to wire rack and leet cool 5 min. Serve warm.
