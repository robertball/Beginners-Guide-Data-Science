Ingredients:
1 lb Lean Ground Turkey
1 lb Ground Chicken
1 (15 ounce) Can Black Beans-rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) Can Sweet Corn-rinsed and drained
1 (2.5 ounce) Can Fire Roasted Diced Green Chiles
1 Cup Chunky Salsa-mild
1 Packet Taco Seasoning
3/4 Cup Unseasoned Breadcrumbs
3 Egg Whites
1 (28 ounce) Can Enchilada Sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients (except enchilada sauce) and mix until thoroughly combined.  Transfer mixture to the baking dish, forming into a loaf shape.  Pour half of the enchilada sauce over the meatloaf and reserve the other half for later.  Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes.  Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the meatloaf and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until juices run clear and there is no pink remaining.
Slice and serve.  Spoon the sauce over the slices before serving for extra flavor.
