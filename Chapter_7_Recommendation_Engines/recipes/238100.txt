Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1/2 cup chopped sweet onion
4 green onions, or to taste, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup chunky salsa
12 corn tortillas
1 cup shredded pepperjack cheese, divided
2 1/2 cups enchilada sauce
4 ounces sliced black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir taco seasoning mix into the beef; transfer to a large bowl, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Cook and stir sweet onion and green onion in the hot drippings until tender, 5 to 7 minutes; add to seasoned ground beef along with cream cheese and salsa. Stir the mixture until the cream cheese melts completely.
Arrange tortillas onto a flat work surface. Spoon even amounts of the beef mixture in a line down the center of each tortilla. Top beef with even portions of the pepperjack cheese. Roll tortillas around the filling and arrange into a baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce evenly over the tortillas; top with olives and remaining cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts completely, about 20 minutes.
