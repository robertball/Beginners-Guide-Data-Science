Description: 
This whimsical and delicious chicken salad was inspired by the famous Cosmopolitan cocktail.  The cranberry-citrus mixture is used in two ways - one portion to marinate the chicken and the remainder as a salad dressing.  The crisp and clean flavor combinations create a light and healthy yet totally satisfying salad that enhances the chicken.  An indoor grill pan may be used to cook the chicken, if preferred.
