Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 6-lb fully-cooked, bone-in ham
1 fresh pineapple
2 6-oz. cans pineapple juice
1 cup brown sugar

Directions:
While the ham is baking, mix the pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe ceramic or glass bowl and microwave on medium power until the glaze is boiling and slightly thickened. After 30 minutes, pour about half the glaze evenly over the ham and pineapple. Cook the ham for another 30 minutes, then pour the rest of the brown sugar mixture over it. Continue baking the ham until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest section reads 140° F, about 30 more minutes. Allow to cool for 15 minutes, and serve.While the ham is baking, mix the pineapple juice and brown sugar in a microwave-safe ceramic or glass bowl and microwave on medium power until the glaze is boiling and slightly thickened.

Directions: Preheat oven to 325° F. Place the ham, cut side down, in a roasting pan. With a sharp knife, remove the skin from the pineapple, slice it into 1/2-inch slices, and cut out the cores from the slices. Pin the slices onto the ham with toothpicks. Bake ham in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes.
