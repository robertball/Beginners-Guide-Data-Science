Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup water
2 potatoes, sliced
1 cup sliced carrots
2 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 (14.5 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
1 pound kielbasa sausage
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup sour cream
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the butter in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water, potatoes, carrots, beef bouillon granules, sugar, and caraway seeds; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
Place the sauerkraut on top of the vegetables in a layer, and place the sausages onto the sauerkraut. Cover, and cook until the sausages are heated through, about 15 minutes.
Whisk the flour into the sour cream in a bowl, and stir into the sauerkraut mixture. Bring to a simmer to thicken the sour cream, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve hot.

Description: 
This is a good one for people that don't care for sauerkraut a whole lot. It doesn't have a strong flavor of sauerkraut, it is very creamy and tasty.
