Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
3 large green bell peppers, halved and seeded
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 onion, diced
granulated garlic to taste
salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 cups finely shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute the onions and brown the ground beef; drain. Return to heat and mix in onion, cooked rice, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Pour in 1 1/2 cans tomato sauce and mix thoroughly. Let simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
Spoon the meat mixture onto each half of the green peppers. Pour a little tomato sauce into bottom of the baking dish. Pour remaining tomato sauce on top of peppers.  Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until mixture begins to turn golden brown.
Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the top of each stuffed pepper. Return to the oven and bake until cheese is lightly browned, about 5 to 10 minutes.
