Ingredients:
8 pounds beef chuck roast
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 (1.25 ounce) packages chili seasoning mix
3 cups dried pinto beans

Directions:
In a large stock pot over high heat, brown roast on all sides. Reduce heat to medium low and add the diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, yellow onion, garlic powder, ground cumin and chili seasoning mix. Cover and simmer until meat comes apart easily, about 3 to 4 hours.
Meanwhile, rinse the pinto beans and soak them in a bowl of warm water.
Remove cooked roast from the pot and set aside. Rinse the pinto beans and pour them into the pot. Pour in enough water to cover the beans and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until the beans are very tender, about 1 1/2 hours, adding extra water as needed.
Shred roast with fork and discard the fat. Add the shredded meat to the cooked beans and pour in enough water to cover. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes

Description: 
I just came up with this one day playing around in the kitchen. It's become a ranch favorite. Very unique and meaty, this is always a big hit at our potlucks. The men just love it. This will feed the cavalry. If you like Tex-Mex, you'll like this. Garnish with cheese.
