Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 (8 ounce) jars salsa
1 cup quick-cooking barley
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 clove garlic, minced
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Mix water, chicken stock, salsa, barley, chili powder, cumin, and garlic together in a slow cooker.
Cook on High until the liquid is bubbling, 5 to 10 minutes. Switch slow cooker to Low and continue to cook until the barley is tender, about 20 minutes more.
Stir chicken, black beans, and white beans into the mixture in the slow cooker. Switch slow cooker to High again until the liquid is bubbling. Cook on Low until the beans are softened, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Quick-cooking barley and pre-cooked chicken makes this pot of chili quick, thick, and comforting. I am going to serve it with Cheddar cornbread. Serve with what ever toppings you might like. I used stock that I made from the picked chicken that I used for the chili. Made it that much richer.
