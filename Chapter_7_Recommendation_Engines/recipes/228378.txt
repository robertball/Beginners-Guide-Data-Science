Ingredients:
1/2 cup farro
1 cup pitted and sliced black cherries
1/4 cup red wine
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 jalapeno chicken sausages, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup dry white wine
5 cups baby spinach leaves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 ounces goat cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farro in the boiling water until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.
Cook and stir cherries in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until liquid is released, 5 to 7 minutes. Add red wine and 1 pinch salt; simmer until cherries soften and sauce is slightly reduced, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat.
Heat olive oil in a frying pan; cook and stir sausage until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and a pinch salt. Cook and stir until liquid is released from mushrooms, about 5 minutes. Stir farro and white wine into mushroom mixture; cook until wine has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
Remove pan from heat. Add spinach, parsley, and cherry sauce; stir until spinach is slightly wilted. Stir in goat cheese until melted; toss well.

Description: 
Farro, a cleaner nuttier taste from barley, pairs so well with jalapeno chicken sausage, black cherries, mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese. Serve with toasted baguette. Wow! Who would have thunk it?
