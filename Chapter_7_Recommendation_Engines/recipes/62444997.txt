Ingredients:
6 cups oil, for frying*
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoons house seasoning, recipe follows
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 pounds fresh okra, sliced 1/2 inch thick
1/2 cup buttermilk
*************************
Home seasoning:
1/2 cup salt
1/4 black pepper
1/4 garlic powder
Mix together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.
*************************
*Can use deep fryer if you prefer over skillet frying

Directions:
Heat oil in a large, heavey bottom skillet to 350 degrees. (I use a cast iron skillet) Also you may not need to use all the oil; do not fill the pan more than halfway up the sides with oil.
In a medium bowl, combine cornmeal, flour, home seasoning, and cayenne pepper. Dip okra in buttermilk and then dredge in cornmeal-flour mixture to coat well. Carefully add okra to the hot oil, in batches as needed, and cook until golden brown. (Do not stir the okra in the pan, if you need to move the okra around just shake the pan.) Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

This brings back memories of sitting on my grandmothers counter watching her cook for the family. Oh how those days were so much simpler.
