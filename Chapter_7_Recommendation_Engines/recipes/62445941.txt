Description: 
I threw this together in my crock pot one day and we loved it! A little time consuming because I sauteed the vegetables and browned the meat first, but it's well worth it. Browning the meat first gives it a better flavor, and adding the garlic puts it over the top.Modified from: Slow Cooker Swiss Steak
