Ingredients:
4 Meaty Beef Shanks
2 T olive oil
2 large onions, peeled and chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3 pounds beets, peeled and shredded
3 carrots, peeled chopped
3 celery ribs, peeled and chopped
1 turnip, peeled and chopped
1 small savoy cabbage, shredded
2 quarts beef broth
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in dutch oven, or heavy bottom soup pot.
Thorough dry beef shank, sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Brown beef shank, one or two at a time (don't crowd) until nicely caramelized on both sides.
As shanks are browned move them to a platter and cover.
Sautee onions in the soup pot, deglazing with a little red wine or broth as needed.
Once onions have softened add thyme and garlic, cook for a minute or so.
Add carrots, beets, celery, and turnip. Cook for about 3 minutes.
Add vinegar, and stir until combined.
Add broth and cabbage.
Cook until all vegetables are soft on simmer -- one hour or more.
Adjust seasonings.
Optional: Garnish with fresh dill

Description: 
I made this up on a cold, Winter day when I couldn't find a Borscht recipe that met the criteria for a dietary challenge I had  undertaken. This one includes lots of vegetables, beef shank, but no sugar, dairy or potatoes.
