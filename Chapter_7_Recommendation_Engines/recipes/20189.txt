Ingredients:
8 ounces bittersweet chocolate
10 fluid ounces heavy cream

Directions:
Chop chocolate and place in top of a double boiler, or in a microwave-safe bowl, microwave chocolate until melted. Stir occasionally until chocolate is smooth.   Allow to cool slightly.
Whip cream in large bowl with electric mixer until soft peaks barely form.
Fold chocolate into cream and spoon into serving dishes.  Chill 30 minutes in refrigerator, until set.

Description: 
I use French chocolate with a 70% cocoa content. Serves four people, or one greedy one! Chill for a couple of hours, and use the firmed mousse to make chocolate truffles. Heavenly.
