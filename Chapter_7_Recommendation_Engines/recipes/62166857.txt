Ingredients:
1 large egg
1 TSP molasses
2 Tbs. almond meal/flour
2 Tbs. flax meal
1 TBS Rice Flour
1 TBS Tapioca Flour
1/4 tsp. baking powder
Pinch of salt

Directions:
In a small bowl whisk the egg and molasses together. Then add remaining ingredients and mix well. In a small ramekin or pyrex bowl (about 6-8 inches) spray with non-stick spray (we like olive oil the best). Heres the part thats not my favorite, your going to microwave on high for about 1 minute and 10 seconds. Now this will differ a bit depending on your microwave. Now I know microwaves aren’t the best and I haven’t had much time to play with oven baking this yet, so I will try it and we shall see. Once this is done you should be able to turn it out on a plate. Make them ahead and freeze for easy lunch bread, or eat it hot with lots of butter and honey! ENJOY!~
