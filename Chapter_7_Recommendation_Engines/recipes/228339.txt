Ingredients:
1/2 cup cashews
1/2 cup white sugar
1 bunch kale, cut into thin ribbons
5 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Spread cashews onto a baking sheet.
Toast cashews in preheated oven until browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat while the cashews are toasting; cook and stir until melted. As soon as it is melted and the nuts are done toasting, pour the nuts in the saucepan; stir to coat. Spread cashews onto baking sheet to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
Massage kale and soy sauce together in a bowl until kale softens. Fold raisins and sugar-coated cashews into the kale.
Refrigerate 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I had this at a restaurant in San Diego and fell in love. I searched the internet to try and find a recipe but could not, so I attempted it on my own and, voila! I got it! You can use walnuts or other nuts if you prefer.
