Ingredients:
4 cups egg noodles (such as No Yolks®)
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 cups grated kohlrabi
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add kohlrabi, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the kohlrabi is tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the drained egg noodles into the kohlrabi; cook and stir until the noodles are slightly fried, 5 to 7 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe that my husband introduced me to from my mother-in-law. It is a Hungarian dish; it is really easy and really good. I like No Yolks® noodles.
