Ingredients:
3 pounds apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tablespoon butter, cut into small pieces
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Spread apple slices into prepared baking pan. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter pieces and sprinkle with lemon juice. Mix flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into oat mixture until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs; spread over apples.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned and apples are soft and tender, about 30 minutes.
