Ingredients:
2 tsp. margarine
1 white or whole wheat bread slice
Â½ tsp. margarine
1 large egg
Salt and pepper (optional)

Directions:
Heat the frying pan on medium-low heat. Spread the first amount of margarine on both sides of the bread slice with the table knife.
Place a drinking glass upside down on the center of the bread slice. Press to cut out a round piece.
Place both the bread slice and round piece of bread in the frying pan. Brown 1 side of each.
Use the pancake lifter to turn both pieces over.
Melt the second amount off margarine in the hole in the bread slice. Break the egg into the hole.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the lid on the frying pan.  Cook slowly until the white of the egg is set. Remove the framed egg with the pancake lifter and enjoy!
