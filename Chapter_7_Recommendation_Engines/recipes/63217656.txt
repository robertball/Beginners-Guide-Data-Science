Ingredients:
1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed well and drained
1 cup chicken broth
1 bunch lacinato kale, washed and sliced
2 quarts water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 large shallot, chopped
1/2 teaspoon Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning

Directions:
Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan.  Stir in the quinoa; cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until quinoa is cooked through (about 10 minutes).
Bring the water to boil in a large saucepan; add the kale and boil just for about two or three minutes.  Drain in a colander and set aside.
Return the saucepan to medium heat. Add olive oil and chopped shallot, then cook until shallot is softened.  Add the drained kale. If you like your greens more cooked, continue cooking for a few minutes.  Add quinoa to the greens and season with the creole seasoning, adding more to taste if you want!
