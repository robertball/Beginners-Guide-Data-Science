Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried navy beans
water to cover
7 cups chicken stock
1/2 cup butter
4 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1/2 pound bacon
1 Ham hock

Directions:
Clean and sort the beans. Place them in a large bowl with water to cover and soak overnight.
In a large pot over medium heat, combine the beans and the chicken stock and allow to simmer.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots and onion and saute for 10 minutes, or until onion is caramelized. Add this mixture to the pot.
In the same skillet over medium high heat, saute the bacon for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is crisp. Drain the grease and add the bacon along with the ham hock to the chicken stock. Continue to simmer at least four hours over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the beans are tender and the soup has thickened.
