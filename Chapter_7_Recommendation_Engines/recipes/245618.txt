Ingredients:
8 ounces cooked pulled pork, chopped
1/2 white onion, minced
1 (12 ounce) package wonton wrappers
2 quarts canola oil
1 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Mix pulled pork and onion together in a bowl.
Spoon pork mixture, about 1 teaspoon per wonton, onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten 2 of the 4 sides of each wrapper with water and fold wrapper over filling, forming a triangle. Press to seal.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) or until almost smoking.
Working in batches, fry wontons in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer cooked wontons to crumpled paper towels. Serve immediately with barbeque sauce.

Description: 
A mashup of Southern BBQ with an Asian twist. This was inspired by my time living in Memphis, where you can get the world's best meats cooked low and slow.
