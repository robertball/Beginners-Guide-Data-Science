Ingredients:
1 deep dish pie crust
4-5 large tomatoes
bunch of fresh basil, chopped
1/4-1/2 cup red onion, minced
1/2 lb bacon
garlic powder
dried oregano
crushed red pepper
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup mayo
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Peel, slice and remove seeds from tomatoes. Lay out on a kitchen towel and salt (this helps to remove moisture) for 30-60 min. Pat with paper towel before putting in pie.
Cook, drain and crumble bacon.
Chop basil and mince onion.
Layer tomatoes, basil, onions, bacon, light sprinkle of garlic powder, oregano and crushed red pepper (I had enough to make 3 layers... well, 2 1/2).
Mix cheese with mayo and sour cream (I added a tiny bit of the bacon, onions and basil); spread evenly over top of pie .
Loosely cover pie pan with foil and bake at 375 for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 30 minutes or until browned and bubbly.
Cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting. Tasty cold as well.
