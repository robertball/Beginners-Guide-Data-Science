https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted
3 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate, grated
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2/3 cup butter, cut into pieces
2 tablespoons rum
1 egg
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup chopped pistachio nuts

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, chocolate, salt and confectioners' sugar. Mix in butter until the mixture appears crumbly. Add rum and egg, and mix until a smooth dough forms. Wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
Roll dough out into thin 6 inch long ropes. Twist two ropes together, and put the ends together to form a crown. Mix together the egg yolk and water, brush over each crown, and sprinkle with chopped pistachios.
Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm. Cool cookies on wire racks.

Description: 
These are Christmas cookies you've probably never tasted!  They're great! When I first tried this recipe everybody loved them!  They're kind of slow to make, but they look and taste delicious! One can also use Amaretto instead of rum, and almonds instead of pistachio nuts.
