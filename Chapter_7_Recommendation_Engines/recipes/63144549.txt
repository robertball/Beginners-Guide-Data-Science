https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 palm-sized salmon steaks/filets (thawed & raw)
1 tbsp honey mustard
2 tsp soy sauce (give or take)
2 tsp brown sugar (give or take)
2 tsp canola oil

Directions:
Whip up the honey mustard, soy sauce, sugar, & canola oil in a small bowl. Refrigerate for between 10 minutes & 1 hour (the longer it's in there, the better it will stick to the salmon). **This would be a perfect time to thaw the fish if you're using frozen filets.**
Move a shelf to the very highest rung in the oven (so between 6 & 10 inches from the roof). Set to "Broil." (Some ovens have the option for a low or high broil; pick the highest offered temperature.)
Line an oven-safe glass dish with aluminum foil.
Place salmon in foil-lined glassware & paint on .5 - .75 of the refrigerated mixture (until the top & sides are completely covered). Broil for 7 minutes, then paint on the rest of the mixture. Broil for another 8 minutes. Remove from oven.
Ta-da! You're practically a chef.
