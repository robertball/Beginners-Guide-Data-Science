Ingredients:
2 pounds extra-lean ground beef
1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs
2 eggs
1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a mixing bowl, combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, onion, and parmesan cheese. Shape into a loaf and place in a 8x4-inch loaf pan. Top with tomato sauce.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until internal temperature measures 160 degrees F (70 degrees C); the meat should be well done, with no trace of pink. Remove from oven, and allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
