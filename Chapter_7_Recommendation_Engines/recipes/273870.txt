Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
1 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni
2 cups heavy cream
1 (16 ounce) package shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Colby-Jack cheese
1 cup sour cream
1 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons barbeque rub

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a pizza pan with aluminum foil; lay bacon strips on top.
Bake bacon in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Drain bacon slices on paper towels and allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Place in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly.
Preheat a smoker to 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C). Add wood chips according to manufacturerâ€™s directions.
Mix together cream, Cheddar cheese, Colby-Jack cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, butter, and barbeque rub in the warm pasta pot; add drained macaroni. Mix well and let the cheese melt. Pour into a 9x13-inch aluminum pan and sprinkle bacon on top.
Place the pan on the rack in the preheated smoker. Cook until cheese is bubbly, about 3 1/2 hours.
