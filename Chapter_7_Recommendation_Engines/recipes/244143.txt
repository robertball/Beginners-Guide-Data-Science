Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups olive oil
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine
1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chervil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
4 bunches green onions, chopped
3 (6 ounce) cans mushroom stems and pieces

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook chicken in hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Add red wine, tarragon, chervil, chives, and parsley to chicken; mix well.
Mix green onions and mushrooms into chicken mixture; simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a thick sauce and chicken is longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This dish is simple to make and tastes even better the second day. I serve is over rice with a salad and crusty French bread. Tres magnifique.
