Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork sausage, regular or hot
2 cups finely shredded Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese blend
1 1/4 cups self-rising flour
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix together ground sausage, shredded cheese, flour, and cream cheese in a large bowl until well combined. Form into walnut-sized balls, either with your hands or with a cookie scoop, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the sausage balls are browned and no longer pink inside, about 20 minutes.
