Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked jasmine rice
1-1/2 cups water
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 carrot, chopped
1/4 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon Maggi®(Jugo seasoning sauce)
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1/3 cup cashew pieces
1 oz (1 little box) raisins
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
6 canned lychees, drained and quartered

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Once cooked, spread the rice into a shallow dish, and refrigerate until cold, or use 3 cups leftover cooked jasmine rice.
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the carrots and onions, and cook until the onion begins to soften. Add the garlic and cook a few seconds until fragrant. Add the cold rice, and cook and stir until hot. Pour in the Magi®, soy sauce, green onions, cashews, raisins, and white pepper. Cook and stir until hot, then stir in the quartered lychees to serve.
