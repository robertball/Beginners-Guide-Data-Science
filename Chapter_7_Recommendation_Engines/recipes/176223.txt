Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans
4 cups water
1 (7 ounce) can sliced jalapeno peppers, drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Place the pinto beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand overnight to soak.
Drain and rinse the following day, then place beans into a slow cooker along with 4 cups of water, the jalapenos, tomatoes, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, liquid smoke, and barbeque sauce; stir well.
Set the slow cooker to High and cook for 4 hours. Stir the beans again, and turn the slow cooker to Low, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and the beans are tender, about 3 hours more.
