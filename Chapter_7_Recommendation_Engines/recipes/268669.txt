Ingredients:
1/2 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
4 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 tablespoons Pinot Grigio wine
2 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
While pasta cooks, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add shrimp and cook until tails start curling in, about 2 minutes per side. Add remaining butter, Pinot Grigio, lemon juice, half-and-half, and Parmesan cheese. Stir to incorporate.
Drain linguine and divide noodles between 2 bowls. Serve shrimp mixture on top and garnish with parsley.
