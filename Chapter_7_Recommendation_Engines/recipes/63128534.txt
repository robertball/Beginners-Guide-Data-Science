Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups sugar
2 whole eggs
1 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 cup pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup butter and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla. Mix in 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt. Spread 1/2 of batter in the prepared pan.
Prepare the filling: In a medium bowl mix 1/3 cup flour, brown sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and cinnamon. Sprinkle cake batter with 1/2 the filling. Sprinkle 2/3 cup of the pecans on the first layer in the pan. Spread second half of batter over the filling, and top with remaining filling and remaining pecans.
Bake 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.
