Ingredients:
3 Cups of water (filtered)
3 Cups low sodium Chicken broth (I prefer Pacific or Imagine Organic Low Sodium broth because of their very low sodium content)
4-5 Cups of Broccoli
4 Cups of skim milk (3 1/2 cups whole milk)
1/2 Teaspoon Nutmeg (or All Spice)
1 Teaspoon Mrs. Dash no Salt (table blend)
4 Tablespoons Low Sodium Sour Cream
1/2 Cup lower sodium Cheese (sharp cheddar pref.)
4 Tablespoons No Salt butter
1 Celery Stock
1/2 Onion
1/2 Teaspoon Celery seed
1/2 Cup flour (make it into a roux)
1/2 Cup No Salt Chicken stock (see my recipe if you need one)

Directions:
In a five quart pan, heat water 1 teaspoon of no salt, 1/2 teaspoon celery, and 4-5 cups of broccoli, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook for 10 minutes.  Strain and reserve water.
Put half of the broccoli on the side, puree the onion, celery and half of the broccoli.  Return water to the pan, add the puree mixture, butter, nutmeg and fresh ground pepper to the pan.  Simmer for 10-15 minutes.  Add the corn starch, sour cream and milk.  Bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes.
Add the remaining ingredients and broccoli to the pan and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat and cook for an additional 15-20 minutes.
Add flour roux to thicken to desired consistency, and, season to taste.
Serve with a garnish of parsley and cheese.
