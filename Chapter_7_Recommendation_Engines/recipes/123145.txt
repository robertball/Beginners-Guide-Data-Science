1/4 cup cornmeal
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

1 egg
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup maple syrup
3 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat egg; add milk, syrup and oil.  Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into a greased 9-in. square baking pan. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes; cut into squares. Serve warm.

Description: 
It's not necessary to serve maple syrup with this moist corn bread from Dorothy Bateman of Carver, Massachusetts. The maple flavoring is baked into the loaf, providing a delicious change of pace from traditional corn bread.
