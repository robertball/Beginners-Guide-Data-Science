Ingredients:
12 Hard Boiled Eggs
2 tbsp Mayo
Dried Mustard
2 tsp Sweet Pickle Juice
2 tsp Relish Juice
Salt
Black Pepper
Cinnamon
Paprika

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the eggs. Boil them for 12 minutes. To prevent the eggs from cracking, add salt. Then transfer the eggs into a large bowl of cool water and put in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes.
Now that eggs are cooled, peel off the shells. Cute the eggs in half and put the yolks in a large mixing bowl. Place the empty egg whites on a plate.
Take the bowl of yolks and mash them with the back of a spoon. Add the mayo, dried mustard, pickle juice, relish juice, salt, pepper, and cinnamon and mix until smooth.
Take the plate of egg whites and fill each one with the batter. Sprinkle paprika on top. Wrap in plastic wrap and put in the fridge until ready to serve.
