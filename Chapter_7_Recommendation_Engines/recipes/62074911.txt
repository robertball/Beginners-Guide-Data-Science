Ingredients:
2 bags shredded cabbage
1 cup mayonnasie
2 T. sugar
3 T. white vinegar

Directions:
I buy the pre-shredded cabbage in the produce section of the grocery store.  Mix the mayo with the sugar and vinegar and mix into cabbage.  It is so easy, but it is so delicious. It is excellent on burgers or just served as a side dish.
