Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
7/8 cup butter
3 egg yolks
1 cup milk
2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup brandy
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the flour and baking powder; set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Blend in the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk. The dough will be stiff like a cookie dough.
Divide the dough into 10 pieces and shape into balls. Roll each ball into a 9-inch circle. Place on cookie sheets and prick with a fork in several places.
Bake cookies in batches in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until edges are just starting to brown. Let cool.
In a saucepan, boil the unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours. Monitor the water closely to make sure there is always water covering the cans. Remove cans from heat and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
In a small measuring cup, combine the brandy and water.
Place one cookie layer on serving plate. Brush with brandy mixture, then spread with the now-thickened condensed milk. Sprinkle with nuts. Continue stacking until all layers are used.

I loved this recipe 27 years ago when I was in Chile. I haven't made it in years, but I do remember my family really enjoyed it.
