Ingredients:
3 1/2 c. reduced-sodium chicken stock
1 4oz. can V-8
1 Tbsp. olive oil
6 shallots, finely chopped
3 medium zucchini, chopped
1/2 c. dry white wine
1 1/3 c. Arborio rice
16 sun-dried tomato halves (not oil-packed), finely chopped
1/4 c. dried parsley
1/2 tsp. dried marjoram
1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper
2 Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine the stock and tomato juice in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer.
In a medium nonstick pan, heat the oil.
Add the shallots and saute approximately 2 minutes, until soft.
Add zucchini and wine.  Cook about 5 minutes longer or until the zucchini is softened.
Add the Arborio rice and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute.
Add 1 cup of the stock mixture then the sundried tomatoes, parsley and marjoram.  Cook, stirring until the liquid is absorbed.
Continue adding 1/2 cup of the stock at a time, stirring until the stock is absorbed before adding more, until the rice is just tender.
Total cooking time will be approximately 30 minutes.
Stir in pepper, and cheese if desired, and serve.
This dish is best served right away but will also be good later if not over-cooked.

This is an adaptation from a WW recipe and my first try at Risotto.  It turned out great for me, I hope it will for you as well.
