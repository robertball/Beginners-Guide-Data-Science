Heat a large saut√© pan over a medium-high temperature.  Add in oil.  Lightly season shrimp with salt and pepper.  Add to the hot pan and cook each side for about 2-3 minutes.  Remove from pan and set in a bowl.
Spiralize your zucchini then chop up a little.  (It just makes it easier to eat).  Using the same pan over medium heat add in 1 tablespoon of oil.  Add in zucchini, garlic, salt and pepper.  Let cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Pour in chicken broth, lemon zest and if you are adding in spinach.  Let cook for about 5 minutes and let the liquid reduce by 1/4.  Add capers and shrimp to the pan.  Let cook for another minute to warm shrimp through.
Drizzle a little extra EVOO after you plate.

Description: 
We just love our zucchini pasta at home.  I go every Sunday to our farmers market and stock up!  Today I even had some left over fresh spinach from the week and decided to add it in as well. You can omit but if you have spinach or any other leftover veggies - Go ahead and add them in!  Enjoy
