Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
1 zucchini, sliced into long ribbons with vegetable peeler or knife
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups baby spinach, or more to taste
1/2 cup thinly sliced basil leaves
2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and garlic to the hot oil. Use tongs to turn zucchini and garlic to coat with oil, about 30 seconds. Stir in spinach and cook 2 minutes. Add basil, sunflower seeds, salt, and pepper and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large platter and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil before serving.

Description: 
Serving this dish with fresh grilled fish is a perfect combination. Zucchini can be grilled, fried, sauteed, or eaten raw in a salad. I grew up eating zucchini and eggs for breakfast, and now I just love making pasta with this versatile vegetable!
