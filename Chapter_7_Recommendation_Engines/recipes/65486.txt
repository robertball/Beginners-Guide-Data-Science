Ingredients:
4 green plantains, peeled, and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chunky peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Place plantain chunks and salt into a saucepan, and add water to cover plantains. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until a fork will easily pierce the plantains, about 20 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water, then drain the plantains. Allow to steam for a few minutes.
Mash the plantain with the peanut butter and reserved water until fine. Allow to cool until you can handle it, then roll into 24 golf ball-sized pieces. Place onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until the balls firm up, and turn golden brown, about 45 minutes.
