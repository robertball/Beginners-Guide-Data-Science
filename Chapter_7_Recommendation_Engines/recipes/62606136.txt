https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/972286.jpg
Ingredients:
2-3 lbs. boneless & skinless chicken ($4-$6 depending on brand or store specials)
(2) 26 oz Jars of favorite flavor salsa (I used a generic brand, 1 jar Lime Garlic flavor & 1 jar of White Corn Black Bean flavor)($2 each)
You will also use one of these jars filled with water (2x - equal parts water to salsa) free from your tap unless otherwise preferred
(2) 10.5 oz cans of Black Beans (generic brand .50 cents each)
(1) 10.5 oz can of whole kernal corn (generic brand .50 cents each)
(4)packets of taco seasoning (generic brand .50 cents each)
Rice - any brand ($1-$2)
OPTIONAL:1/8 cup fresh cut cilantro (.44 cents by the bunch in produce section)
OPTIONAL: 1 lime or lime juice (less than $1)
OPTIONAL: 1-2 Chili Peppers, red or green - your preference ($1-$3)

Directions:
Very large pan(1-2 gallons+)
10 in Frying Pan or larger (the larger the easier w/as deep sides as possible)
In large pan, dump all salsa, beans, corn, 1 jar of water per jar of salsa, cilantro (OPTIONAL), & only 2 taco seasoning packets. (OPTIONAL:2-4 Tablespoons of lime juice or juice from 1-2 limes & diced/sliced up chili pepper), and rice. Stir and let simmer on medium heat, stirring occasionally, careful not to let rice burn to bottom.  (Cover if desired or have less time available to you)
While simmering, cube the chicken to desired size chunks/cubes. Begin "browning" chicken, adding 1 pkt of taco seasoning, add about 1/4 cup of water (enough to cover bottom & have about 1/8 - 1/4 in. in bottom) and stir/turning chicken chunks as you pre-fry them, add 2nd pkt as needed & enough water to keep cubes moist; make sure they are cooked all the way through. If whole 2nd pkt not used here, add to rest of simmering pot.
Add chicken and juices to the simmering gumbo; continuing to stir.
Let gumbo simmer, covered, with chicken for minimum of 15-30 mins., stirring occasionally.
Serve with favorite corn chips - flavored or plain either one
OPTIONAL - prepare rice to your desired flavoring and  serve gumbo over it.
OPTIONAL - serve with sour cream and cheese
OPTIONAL - If you have funds available you can remove the "Poor Man's..." aspect from the title and "fancify" this recipe with brand names, and more fresh seasonings, herbs, or vegetables. Also, the spiciness can be increased, as desired by adding various spices, if you have them (cayenne, chili powder, pepper, etc.)or chili peppers.
Easy to "grow" this just by adding water, as there is plenty of flavor to give room to play w/the water amt. Also salsa is inexpensive, so not hard to add more of
