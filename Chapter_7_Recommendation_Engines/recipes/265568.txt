Ingredients:
2 cups boiling water
2 Earl Grey tea bags
2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste
1 lime, juiced
6 slices lime (optional)

Directions:
Pour boiling water over tea bags in a jar or pitcher, and allow to steep for 15 minutes.
Remove tea bags, add sugar, and stir in lime juice. Adjust the sweetness to suit your taste and cool mixture to room temperature.
Drop a lime slice into each ice pop mold. Pour in mixture, leaving about 1/4 inch space at the top. Place the sticks or tops in and freeze until solid, 3 to 4 hours.
Run some warm water over the molds to help loosen the ice pops.

Description: 
Southerners love their sweet tea, although I've never been a huge fan. These ice pops have a good balance of sweet-tart, but if you're a sweet tea lover, go ahead and add more sugar. Once you taste fresh lime in tea, you may never go back to lemon (I haven't).
