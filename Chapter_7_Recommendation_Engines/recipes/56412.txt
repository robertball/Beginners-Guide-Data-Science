Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package thin spaghetti
4 (4 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage
5 assorted bell peppers, seeded and cut into strips
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup minced flat leaf parsley
freshly grated Parmesan cheese to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
While the pasta is getting started, slice sausages lengthwise, and remove the casings. Brown sausages in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of the olive oil. Remove sausages to a platter, and keep warm in the oven. Add the bell peppers, garlic, oregano and basil to the skillet, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Saute over medium heat until peppers are tender.
Toss the pepper mixture with the drained spaghetti until well blended, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, and arrange the sausages on the top. Garnish with Italian parsley and Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
This dish was inspired by a description in the novel, 'The Godfather.' It is also a favorite with my 'family.' Serve with a crusty bread, a green salad, and a robust dry red wine for a very satisfying meal. The amount of oil and garlic can be adjusted to your taste.
