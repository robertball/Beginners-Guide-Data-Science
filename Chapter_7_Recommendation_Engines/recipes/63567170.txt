Ingredients:
2.5 lbs ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (8 oz.) can tomato sauce
1 (6 oz.) can tomato paste
1/2 c. ketchup
1/3 c. packed dark brown sugar
2 T soy sauce
2 T yellow mustard
2 t. Worcestershire sauce
Water (if needed

Directions:
Brown meat, onions and garlic in a large skillet until meat is no longer pink.
Drain well!
Stir in remaining ingredients.
Mix well and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.
Watch carefully. The mix burns easily unless you watch it carefully.
The mixture should be moist and hold its shape on a bun, so if it looks too dry, add water.
Serve on hamburg buns. Cole slaw is a good accompaniment.
