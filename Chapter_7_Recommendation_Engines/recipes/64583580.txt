Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 cups Cheerios
2 cups Corn Chex
2 cups Rice Chex
2 cups Wheat Chex
2 cups stick pretzels
2 cups mixed nuts
8 Tbs butter
6 Tbs Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp celery salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250. Place butter in a large roasting pan and place in oven until the butter melts.  Stir butter, Worcestershire sauce and spices  together and toss in the cereal, pretzels, and nuts . Bake at 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 10 minutes.
Notes:  The Cheerios may get a bit overdone, so they can be added after baking 30 minutes if desired, but they won't be as seasoned. Also, the original recipe had 12 Tbs of butter, and I routinely use less than the 8 my mom used.

Description: 
My mom made this recipe during my childhood in the 1970-80s . It is more flavorful than the one on the back of the Chex box.
