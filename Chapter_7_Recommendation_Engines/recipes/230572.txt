Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
2 bunches green onions, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded 1/4 inch thick
2 (16 ounce) packages sliced bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix cream cheese and green onions in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Spread about 1/4 cup of cream cheese mixture over each chicken breast. Starting at the narrow end, roll chicken breasts over filling. Wrap each chicken breast in 4 slices of bacon. Set wrapped chicken on a rack set in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 1 hour.
