Ingredients:
1 cup milk, or as needed
3/4 cup oat flour
3/4 cup old-fashioned oats
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix milk, oat flour, oats, egg, oil, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.
