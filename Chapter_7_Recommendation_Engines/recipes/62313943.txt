Ingredients:
8 meaty pork loin spareribs
1 tablespoon light olive oil
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/4 cup dried minced onion
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons horseradish sauce
1/2 cup red wine
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until the oil shimmers, and brown the ribs on all sides, about 10 minutes per side. Transfer the ribs to a slow cooker. In the pan you browned the ribs in pour in the beef broth, ketchup, brown sugar, lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, seafood seasoning, dried onion, nutmeg,horeradish sauce, wine, and salt and pepper. Stir the ingredients until the sauce has dissolved any brown bits of flavor from the bottom of the pan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium-low heat for ten minutes. Coat the ribs in the slow cooker with sauce, cover, and let cook on high heat for four hours or until the meat is very tender and falls off the bones.
