Add oil when hot and add Beef; let brown and caramelize on both sides.  Remove from pan and add all the vegetables, stir and let sauté for about 10 to 15 minutes.     Add beef broth.  Bring up to a simmer; return roast to pan and nestle it in the center of pan and vegetables so that about ½ to ¾ of the meat is submerged in the liquid.
3.	Cover and put in the oven for 1 ½ hours or until the meat is falling apart.  Remove from oven.  Remove meat to a platter and set aside.  Strain veggies from broth and put broth back into pan and heat to simmer.  Add cornstarch and water stirring constantly to thicken.
