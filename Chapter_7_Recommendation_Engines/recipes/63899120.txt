Ingredients:
3 slabs pork back ribs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup paprika
3 tablespoons seasoned salt
2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoon celery salt
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground sage
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 cup your favorite barbecue sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar sauce)
1/2 cup honey

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300.
In a plastic bowl with a good lid, combine sugar, paprika, seasoned salt, chili powder, black pepper, celery salt, onion powder, garlic powder, ground sage and dry mustard.  Place lid on and shake to combine thoroughly. Set spice rub aside. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
In small saucepan over low heat, stir together barbecue sauce and honey. Heat through, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Set barbecue glaze aside, keep warm or at room temperature before using. (If storing for more than 2 hours, cover and refrigerate. Reheat gently before using).
Remove the membrane from the back side of the ribs.  Pat ribs dry with paper towels and season generously with spice rub, using about 4-6 tablespoons for each slab of ribs. Cover with foil and bake in preheated oven for 3 hours.  Remove from oven and baste heavily with the glaze.  Grill over medium heat in a covered grill for 10 minutes per side, basting again with the glaze.  (You can also broil it for a few minutes instead of the grill.  This just caramelizes the sauce and crisps the edges up a bit.)
