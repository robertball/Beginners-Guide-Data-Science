Ingredients:
Topping:
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1 tablespoon milk
Cake:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup almond paste
1 cup white sugar
4 eggs, at room temperature
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.
Combine slivered almonds, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and milk in a small saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until butter is melted and mixture is smooth, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove topping from heat.
Combine 1 1/2 cup flour, cream of tartar, and salt in a bowl.
Beat 3/4 cup softened butter and almond paste in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Gradually add 1 cup white sugar and continue beating until mixture is light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating 1 minute after each addition; stir in lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture and beat until batter is just mixed, about 1 minute more; pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon flour evenly over batter. Spoon the topping over the flour layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This is a dense, rich cake with a candy-like topping that is easy to make. It freezes really well so you can have a great dessert on hand. Wrap well and store at room temperature up to 2 days or freeze up to 1 month. Crisp it in the oven briefly at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for that just-baked taste. Serve with whipped cream and raspberries.
