Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) packages firm tofu, drained
3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
1 teaspoon sesame oil
4 green bell peppers, chopped
2 large onions, diced
2 carrots, diced
1 bunch green onions, sliced thin
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup natural, unsalted peanut butter
2 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons sriracha sauce, or more to taste
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Slice tofu into 1/2-inch-thick strips and press between paper towels to remove excess water; leave to drain while preparing vegetables.
Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil and sesame oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add green bell peppers, onions, and carrots; saute until peppers and carrots are tender and onions are golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, mix in green onions and garlic, and cover with a lid.
Chop tofu into bite-sized chunks. Heat remaining peanut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add tofu and cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Combine peanut butter, water, sriracha sauce, soy sauce, salt, and black pepper in a blender and blend until smooth to make the peanut sauce.
Transfer tofu and peanut sauce to the skillet with the vegetables. Heat over low heat until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
