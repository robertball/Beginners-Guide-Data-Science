Description: 
This dish is one of the few entrees which is served both lunch and dinner at The Golden Lamb. Lambshanks, though difficult to find, are a flavorful, meaty cut of lamb often ignored by most people. The braising of the lambshank (cooking in liquid) gives it a tenderness and flavor that makes the entrée one of the most popular at The Golden Lamb.
