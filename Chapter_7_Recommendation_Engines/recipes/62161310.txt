Ingredients:
2 cups orange juice
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
Juice from one lemon, or 3 tablespoons manufactured lemon juice

Directions:
In a small saucepan over medium heat, add the water and sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves, then remove from heat. Add the orange and lemon juice, and stir until blended.
Place sorbet mix into an ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer's directions. If you don't have an ice cream maker, place the mixture in an airtight plastic container and put it in the freezer. Freeze for 2 hours, then stir. Freeze for an additional 2 hours and stir again. Freeze for any additional time needed. Store sorbet in an airtight container.
