Ingredients:
125 g flour
125 g buckwheat flour
2 tl baking powder
250 ml milk (add more milk when batter is too thick)
2 eggs
50 g melted butter
salt

Directions:
Use a poffertjes pan or something like it. I have used a blini's pan for instance. Be creative, in the US there are no poffertjes pans sold yet.
Mix all the ingredients with a mixer to a nice batter, slightly thick.
Heat the pan on high. Grease it. Put a little batter in every hole and let it be there until the top is dry, when it is dry, turn the poffertje. Both sides of the poffertjes nee to be light brown.

Description: 
This is a recipe for old Dutch Poffertjes. This recipe is adjusted to modern times, so in this one no yeast, but baking powder, which speeds the process up with half an hour. Other than that I prefer baking it with baking powder, gives less of a thready mess.
Recipe is in METRIC!!! as I have no sense on US standard.
