Ingredients:
1 1/2 warm water
1/4 cup canola oil
A little less than 1/4 cup white sugar
3 cups white flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2  teaspoon active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select White Bread cycle; press Start.
When the dough has raised once and second cycle of kneading begins, turn machine off.  Reset by pressing Start once again.  This gives the dough two full raising cycles before the final raising cycle prior to baking.
