Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 head garlic
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon coarsely ground sea salt
2 teaspoons dried thyme
2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
1/3 cup olive oil
1 5-pound rack of pork

Directions:
Peel and slice all garlic cloves.
Mince garlic along with fresh rosemary and transfer to a bowl and stir in the salt, thyme, pepper, and olive oil until thoroughly combined.
Place the rack of pork on a foil-lined baking sheet with the bones on the bottom.
Press the garlic & herb mixture on top of the pork.
Bake at 425 for 10 minutes and then reduce temperature to 350 and continue cooking for about 15 minutes per pound, until the pork reaches 145 degrees.
If the crust starts to brown too quickly, cover loosely with foil and continue cooking.
Remove and let rest for 3-5 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite recipes for 2013.  This came from Kate Miller from her blog Cooking during Stolen Moments....an affair with my kitchen.  I believe she serves Costco in much the same way the Allstar Ambassadors serve Allrecipes.  Costco sells rack of pork during the holidays.
