Ingredients:
3 tablespoons maple syrup
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon chocolate chips

Directions:
Whisk together maple syrup, egg, and vanilla extract in a large mug. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Stir into the maple syrup mixture until well combined. Fold in walnuts and chocolate chips.
Microwave at the highest setting until mug cake has set and risen well, about 2 minutes. Keep microwaving at 15-second intervals if it still appears soft.

Description: 
I usually use walnuts for this yummy mug cake, because I have them in my freezer, but any kind of nut will do.
