Ingredients:
1/4 cup chopped red onion
4 tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup olive oil
1 lime, juiced
1 pinch salt and black pepper (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package tortilla chips
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1/2 cup guacamole (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix together the onion, tomatoes, parsley, olive oil, lime juice, salt and pepper in a bowl.
Spread tortilla chips in a single layer onto a baking sheet, and spoon about 1 teaspoon of the tomato salsa onto each chip. Spread 1 cup of Cheddar cheese over the nachos, top the chips with another teaspoon or so of salsa, and top with the remaining 1 cup of cheese.
Bake the nachos in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling, about 5 minutes. Serve hot with sour cream, guacamole, and any remaining salsa on the side for dipping the chips.

Description: 
I got this recipe from summer camp, and when I made them at home, my whole family was impressed. Layers of tortilla chips and salsa with the works on the side - tastes just like the nachos they serve at restaurants.  Perfect for a party!
