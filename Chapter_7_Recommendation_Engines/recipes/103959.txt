Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
4 thick cut pork chops
2 tablespoons maple syrup
2 cups cornflake crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly oil a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Mix together the apple pie filling and cinnamon in a bowl.
Lay each chop on cutting board and, with a sharp knife held parallel to the board, cut a pocket into the chop going all the way to the bone and leaving the sides intact. Fill each pocket with one quarter of the filling mixture (about 1/2 cup). Coat the pork chops with maple syrup, then dredge them in the cornflake crumbs until completely covered. Place chops in baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe was formed from an idea I had one night for pork chops stuffed with apples. This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party and I know I'll be making these again very shortly.
