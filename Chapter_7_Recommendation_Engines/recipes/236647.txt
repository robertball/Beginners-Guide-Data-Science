1 cup half-and-half
2 tablespoons hazelnut liqueur (such as FrangelicoÂ®)

12 pieces brioche (about 1 1/2-inch thick)
1 cup toasted hazelnuts, chopped
1/2 cup maple syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and hazelnut liqueur together in a shallow bowl.
Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large skillet, tilting the skillet to assure complete coverage.
Dip 2 slices brioche in the egg mixture, moistening both sides.
Cook brioche in the hot skillet until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat process until all bread is cooked.
Cut each slice of brioche into half on a bias. Sprinkle hazelnuts over the halves and top with maple syrup.
