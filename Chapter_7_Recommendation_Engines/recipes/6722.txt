Ingredients:
1 cup bread flour
1/3 cup amaranth flour
2/3 cup brown rice flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 cup chopped rhubarb
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup honey
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 egg
1/2 cup chopped strawberries

Directions:
Place rhubarb and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.  Cook until tender, about 15 minutes.  Strain the rhubarb, and reserve the juice.  Measure the juices, and if necessary, add a bit of water to make 3/4 cup liquid.
Whisk together rhubarb juice, honey, oil, and egg.
In a large bowl, mix flours, baking powder, baking soda, and allspice.  Pour juice mixture into flour mixture, and stir briefly to combine.  Do not overmix.  Fold in rhubarb and strawberries.  Spoon batter into 12 oiled or paper lined muffin cups.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 22 to 25 minutes.
