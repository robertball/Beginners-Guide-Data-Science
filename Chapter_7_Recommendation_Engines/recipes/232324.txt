Description: 
This recipe combines canned items with fresh items, so it's really quick to prepare and tastes very fresh. Perfect for summer! The amounts indicated below are what I use when I make a big batch for barbeques, so I suggest cutting down for a family-size portion. Refrigerate for extra cool freshness! Keeps well in refrigerator.
