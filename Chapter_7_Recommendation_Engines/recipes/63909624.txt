Ingredients:
1/2 green pepper, diced
1/2 onion, diced
Extra-virgin olive oil
2 large chicken breasts
1/4 c. all-purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste
juice from 1/2 lime
4-5 Roma tomatoes
Dash of oregano
4 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Saute diced green pepper and onion in olive oil over medium heat.
Meanwhile, pound chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap to create thin cutlets.  Cut each in half to make two cutlets out of each breast.
Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a gallon-sized ziploc bag.  Add chicken cutlets and toss to coat.
Add chicken to pan and brown on both sides.  Sprinkle with lime juice.
Add diced tomatoes and oregano to pan and cover.  Cook for 5-10 minutes until tomatoes soften and sauce thickens.  Add water if necessary to keep ingredients from scorching.
Top each piece of chicken with a slice of provolone cheese and serve with sauce.
