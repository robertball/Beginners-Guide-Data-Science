Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 cup water
6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 1/2 cups mashed banana
1 tablespoon whole cloves
6 half pint canning jars with lids and rings

Directions:
Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice, mashed banana, and cloves. Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens, about 45 minutes. Strain to remove cloves.
Divide the jam between the jars, screw on lids, and refrigerate.

Description: 
This is a family favorite. It's very good on toast, especially beer-bread toast. (Recipes available from this site.) Try it with peanut butter for a great sandwich. You can also use it to top ice cream. It's popular with banana-lovers young and old. This can be frozen, but it will darken. As written, it's fine, but you can experiment with spices too. Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, lemon/orange peel are all good candidates. Pick one or two for variety.
