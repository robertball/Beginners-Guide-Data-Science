Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups fresh pumpkin seeds
1/2 cup whiskey (such as Jack Daniel'sÂ®)
2 tablespoons bacon drippings

2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
Stir pumpkin seeds, whiskey, bacon drippings, brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt together in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the seeds begin to turn gray in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes; drain.
Spread the drained seeds onto a baking sheet in a single layer; season with salt.
Roast the pumpkin seeds in preheated oven until crisp and golden brown, 60 to 90 minutes.
