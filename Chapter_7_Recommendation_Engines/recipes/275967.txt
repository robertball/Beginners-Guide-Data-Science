Ingredients:
4 cups cauliflower florets
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more to taste
2/3 cup low-sodium vegetable broth, or as needed
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons shredded Gruyere cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss cauliflower with oil and spread in an even layer onto a foil-lined baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring once, until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Do not overbrown the cauliflower; it'll be bitter when blended into the soup.
Blend roasted cauliflower, broth, salt, pepper, and garlic powder in a food processor or blender until smooth. Add more broth to reach desired consistency.
Transfer soup to a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon cheese until melted. Serve topped with remaining cheese and parsley.
