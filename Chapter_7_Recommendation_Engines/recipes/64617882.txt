Ingredients:
For the cookie dough (http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62210660/marthas-rolled-sugar-cookies/):
400 grams Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
150 grams sugar
2 packets vanilla sugar (Store a vanilla bean in a jar of sugar and voila, you have vanilla sugar handy for any occasion. 1 packet is ~1 Tbsp.)
2 eggs
300 grams butter
For the caramels (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/24956/caramels-i/):
400 grams white sugar
500 grams corn syrup
400 grams whipping cream
220 grams butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
For the toppings and coating:
400 grams coconut flakes
200 grams pecans (optional), chopped
400 grams milk chocolate couverture
400 grams semisweet chocolate couverture

Directions:
Make 1 recipe of  Martha's cookie dough (http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62210660/marthas-rolled-sugar-cookies/).
Roast the coconut flakes and pecans in the oven (~120 degC, 60 min), stirring occasionally.
Roll out the cookie dough and cut out forms. One recipe makes 75 cookies.
Bake the cookies in the oven until golden and crispy. (~175 degC, 15 min)
Prepare the caramel (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/24956/caramels-i/):
Put the ingredients except 1 200 ml container of cream in a large pot and heat until boiling.
Add the remaining 200 ml container of cream and continue heating until 116 degC is reached. Use a thermometer.
While heating the caramel, I'll spread a thin layer of the caramel on each cookie to improve adhesion later.
When the caramel reaches 120 degC, immediately remove the heat source and stir in the roasted coconut flakes and chopped pecans.
Apply a generous layer of topping to the cookies.
Melt the chocolate. If you want to have lovely tempered chocolate, then melt the chocolate to 40-45 degC. Then cool the chocolate to below 29 degC. Reheat the chocolate to just over 30 degC and keep the chocolate at 30 deg while dipping.
Dip the base of the cookies in chocolate and drizzle remaining chocolate over the top.

Description: 
I invented this recipe when I had a craving for the famous girl scout cookies but was far too far from home. My friends beg me to make these at every occasion. They contain multiple steps and are a lot of work. I usually split the tasks out over multiple days. Day 1: make dough and roast coconut. Day 2: bake cookies. Day 3: make caramel topping. Day 4: chocolate coating.
