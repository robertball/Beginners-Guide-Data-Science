Ingredients:
5 sheets phyllo dough
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon orange zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 cups fresh raspberries
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Drain ricotta cheese in a sieve for 20 minutes; set aside.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 3-inch loose-bottomed tart pans with nonfat cooking spray.
Leave phyllo sheets in a stack and use a ruler to trace 6 5-inch squares onto top sheet (3 squares across and 2 squares down). Using a sharp knife, cut along traced lines, through all 5 sheets of dough. Immediately line each tart pan with 5 sheets of dough, lightly brushing melted butter or margarine between each layer. Trim edges of dough.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, sugar, egg, orange rind, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. Beat with electric mixer until smooth. Pour an equal amount of mixture into each tart pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, until golden brown. Cool tarts slightly, then arrange raspberries on top. To serve, remove tarts from pans and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
