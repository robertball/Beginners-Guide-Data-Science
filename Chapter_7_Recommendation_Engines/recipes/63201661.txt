Ingredients:
3/4 cup (100 g) Nuts
1 scoop Kal Pure Stevia Extract (equivalent to 1 tbsp Sugar)
1/4 tsp Sea Salt
1 1/2 (7ml) tsp Vanilla Extract (No Corn Syrup, Gluten Free)
3 3/4 cups (865 mL) Filtered Water

Directions:
Soak nuts overnight by putting them in blender, covering them with water, add 1/2 tsp Sea Salt and let set for at least 7 hours
Pour out water and rinse nuts
Press the Speed Up button until blender reaches speed 10. Allow the cycle to run for 30 seconds. When the display reads 30 seconds, press the Stop button. You may need to use a rubber spatula to scrape the ingredients off the sides of the jar. Move ingredients towards the center of the jar, and if necessary hold down the Pulse button for 10 seconds until nuts are blended to a paste.
Add Stevia, Salt, Vanilla, and Water
Select the Whole Juice cycle. Allow the blender to run a complete cycle.
Optional: Add either cinnamon and spices to make a chai, cocoa to make chocolate milk, or strawberries to make strawberry milk

Description: 
Easy to make and way better tasting than store bought nut milk. I normally use almonds, however, cashews work great too, but I don't soak them overnight.
