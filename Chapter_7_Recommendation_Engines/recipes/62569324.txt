Ingredients:
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups eggnog
2 teaspoons orange flavored extract
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 small package instant vanilla pudding

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease bottom only of a 9x5 inch loaf pan, or three 3x5 inch loaf pans.
Blend together the eggs, eggnog, orange extract, sugar, vanilla and butter.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, pudding mix, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add to eggnog mixture and stir just enough to moisten; pour into prepared pan.
Bake bread in large pan for 40 to 60 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Breads baked in the smaller pans require 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool for 10 minutes, and remove from pan.  Cool completely, wrap tightly and store in refrigerator.
