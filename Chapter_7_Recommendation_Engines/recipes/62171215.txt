Ingredients:
5 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoons salt
2 cups hot water
2 cups shredded Asiago cheese
1/4 cup cornmeal

Directions:
Mix yeast and sugar in hot water (110 F). Stir in 2 cups of the flour, mix well, cover and let rest 15 minutes.
Add 2 teaspoons salt and remaining 3 cups flour to yeast mixture.  Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour as necessary to prevent sticking.  Turn in a well-greased bowl, cover and let rise 1 1/2 hours in a warm draft-free place.
Punch down, and knead in shredded Asiago cheese, reserving 1/2 cup for topping.  Divide in half, shape into two loaves.  Press finger into top of loaves, making dimples.  Sprinkle with remaining Asiago, pushing it into dimples as much as possible.  Place loaves on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkled with corn meal.  Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
Bake in a pre-heated 375 oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown.
