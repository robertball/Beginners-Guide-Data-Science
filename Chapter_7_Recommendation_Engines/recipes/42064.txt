Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed potatoes
1 egg, beaten
1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix in the mashed potatoes and egg until well blended.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully drop the potato mixture by spoonfuls into the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oil to drain on paper towels.

Description: 
My mother would always cook extra mashed potatoes so us kids could have these delicious puffs the next day. Over the years I have experimented with her basic recipe and sometimes will add grated cheddar cheese, chopped green onions and bacon bits to the mixture. I have also added corn niblets for a really different tasting puff.
