1 (9 inch) frozen pie crust, thawed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
1 cup fresh strawberries, halved
4 kiwi, peeled and sliced
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Roll pastry into an 11 inch circle. Lay flat on a baking sheet or pizza pan. Prick several times with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until light brown. Remove and allow to cool completely.
In a small mixing bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until mixture is creamy and smooth. Spread evenly onto cooled pastry. Arrange fruit in a decorative pattern over cream cheese layer. Chill until ready to serve.
