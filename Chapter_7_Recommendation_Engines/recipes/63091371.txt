Ingredients:
4 Round Steaks
1 egg
all purpose flour, - I personally like seasoned flour when I can find it!
1/4 c milk
1/2 t salt
1/4 t black pepper
1/4 t white pepper
1/4 t paprika
gravy:
2-3 T flour
2 C milk
drippings from chicken fry

Directions:
in medium shallow bowl, (i like loaf pans myself) mix egg and 1/4 c milk, and a good amount of flour in another.
Take your seasonings and combine in a spare salt shaker or empty seasoning bottle.
Take a meat tenderizer to your meat, and give it a good beating to make it good & tender, then sprinkle both sides with seasoning.
Meanwhile, heat a large skillet with enough oil to coat your meat halfway at medium heat.
Next, take your steaks and dredge in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in egg mixture, and then back again into the flour, making sure to coat all sides.
Now, you can stop here, but for a crispier, more flavorful crust, dip the meat in egg and back into the flour once more.  Personally, I like to re-season btwn egg & flour coats, too.
Place steaks in skillet w/ hot oil and cook on each side until brown & crisp on each side - usually 6-8 minutes on each side.
next, after steaks are cooked thoroughly on each side, remove from pan.  Drain off oil, but keep drippings from meat for the gravy.
With the skillet on low heat, add a couple Tbsp of flour to drippings and mix with wire whisk.  Add about 2 C cold milk to flour mixture and stir until thickens.  Add more flour if necessary.  add pepper to taste, or add more of the seasoning for the meat if desired!
pour gravy over steaks and serve with mashed potatoes!! YUM
