Title:
Hoisin but Not Really Country Ribs Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3-4 lbs pork, country ribs
1 tbsp peanut oil
1 15oz can tomato sauce
1/3 cup hoisin sauce
1-2 tbsp dried minced onion
3 or 4 shitake mushrooms (dried shitake would be fine, I save mushroom trimmings in the freezer)

Directions:
Brown country ribs over high heat in peanut oil until well browned all over. This step is not necessary but worthwhile.
Add tomato sauce, hoisin sauce, onion and mushrooms to slowcooker and stir to combine. Place the pork into the sauce and turn the pieces until coated in sauce. Cook on low for 8-10 hrs.
Remove cooked meat from sauce and shred, removing bones. Set aside. Strain the sauce to remove onion bits and mushroom bits and return to slowcooker with meat. Alternatively put meat and sauce straight into the fridge for tomorrow when it is even better.

Description: 
I love cooking country ribs in my slowcooker - such a cheap cut of meat to have so much flavor! However although the ol' bottle of BBQ sauce is delicious it is very sweet and rich. Enter the spirit of adventure and some random pantry items to create a delicious, lighter alternative.
