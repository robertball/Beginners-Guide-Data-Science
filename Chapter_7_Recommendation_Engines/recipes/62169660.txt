Ingredients:
1/3 cup rice
3 cups milk
½ cup fresh grated coconut
¼ cup jaggery/gur
½ cup sugar
2 tablespoons cashewnuts
2 tablespoons raisins
½ teaspoon cardamom (elaichi) powder
1 tablespoon ghee

Directions:
Soak rice in cold water for 1 hour. Drain the rice in a sieve or clean cloth.
Boil milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Add the rice, jaggery, sugar, coconut, and cardamom powder. Simmer 30 – 45 minutes so rice is cooked and the mixture is thick and creamy.
Heat ghee in a small frying pan or tadka ladle. Fry cashews and raisins in ghee, and add them to the kheer.
Cook to room temperature. Eat right away, or better, chill in the refrigerator for a few hours and serve. If the kheer gets too thick, thin it out with some milk.

Description: 
Annam parvanam is probably the most common Naivedyam item in South India. I like to add some more flavor and richness to this traditional parvanam by adding some fresh coconut  to it. You can use sugar instead of jaggery, but I like using a bit of both. Feel free to experiment with this dessert. I like to serve this cold.
