Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen cut okra
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (20 ounce) package frozen corn
1 tablespoon file powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir to release some of the juices, then add the onion and okra. Fry until tender and browned, stirring constantly. Be careful, as this tends to brown quickly.
Pour in the tomatoes, and simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes. Mix in the corn, and simmer for another 10 minutes. Season with file powder, salt and pepper, and serve.
