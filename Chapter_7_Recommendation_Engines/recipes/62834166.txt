Description: 
Mushrooms are sauteed with onions and garlic. Red wine and beef broth are added and the sauce is reduced down until there is almost no liquid left.  Makes a great side dish to beef recipes...also goes great on top of steaks. Use a good quality red wine that you would actually drink.Modified from: Wine Soaked Mushrooms
