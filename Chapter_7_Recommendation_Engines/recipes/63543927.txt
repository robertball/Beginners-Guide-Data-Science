Ingredients:
1 large red bell pepper
1 small onion, peeled and halved
non-stick cooking spray
1 1 / 4 teaspoon Garlic Powder
1 cup plain, fat free Greek yogurt
1 / 2 cup ricotta cheese
1 / 4 teaspoon cumin
1 / 8 teaspoon cayenne Pepper
2 teaspoon parsley

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Cut bell pepper in half lengthwise, and discard seeds and membranes. Place pepper halves, skin sides up, on a foil-lined baking sheet; flatten with hand. Broil 15 minutes or until blackened. Place in a zip-top plastic bag; seal. Let stand 10 minutes. Remove peel and discard. Set roasted pepper aside.
Reduce oven temperature to 400Â° F. Place onion halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Bake for 15 minutes; turn over onion halves. Bake an additional 15 minutes or until onions are soft and begin to brown. Place onion halves on a plate. Cool 15 minutes.
Place roasted pepper, onion, and garlic in a food processor; process until fairly smooth. Add yogurt, cheese, cumin and cayenne; process until smooth. Spoon dip into a bowl, and stir in parsley. Cover and chill.
