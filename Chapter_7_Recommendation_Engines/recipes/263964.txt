Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
3 eggs
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix flour, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; add milk and eggs in that order. Stir until just a few lumps remain in the batter.
Melt butter in a 9- or 10-inch oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Pour batter into skillet and wait for 1 minute.
Place skillet in the preheated oven and bake until puffed and mostly set, 15 to 18 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe my brother Dave shared with the family. It's quite dramatic right from the oven. This is a cross between a pancake and a souffle. It's a blank canvas ready for your creative additions. We used 'canned apple pie filling' from this website as an accompaniment/topping. Would also be great with maple syrup or strawberries and whipped cream.
