1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 eggs
6 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1 (20 ounce) can unsweetened pineapple chunks, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Roll out half of pastry to line pie pan, and roll out other half to cut into strips for lattice top.
In a medium mixing bowl combine eggs, sugar, flour, salt, lemon juice, and grated lemon rind. Mix well then stir in pineapple. Spread filling into pastry-lined pie pan, make lattice top, and crimp edges. Place in preheated oven and bake 40 minutes or until filling is set and crust is lightly browned. Chill before serving.
