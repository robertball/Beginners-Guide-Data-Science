Ingredients:
9 slices bacon
Heavy duty aluminum foil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut a piece of heavy duty aluminum foil about twice as long as a rimmed baking sheet. Pinch and fold every inch or so of the foil to create ridges for the bacon to drain into while cooking.
Place bacon side by side on the ridged foil.
Bake in preheat oven to your desired level of doneness and a bit of foam forms on the surface, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
By using heavy duty aluminum foil and creating some valleys for the bacon fat to flow results in perfectly flat, perfectly crisp, yet still succulent strips of bacon. Perfect for a BLT!
