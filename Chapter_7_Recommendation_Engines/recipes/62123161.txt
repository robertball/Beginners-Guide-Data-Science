Ingredients:
1 lb sliced bacon
1 (14oz) smoked sausage
1 sm pkg brown sugar

Directions:
Slice bacon in half so that you have 4 inch strip of bacon.  Slice smoked sausage into 1/2 inch bite size circles.  Wrap one slice of bacon around each sausage circle.  Spray nonstick spray in pan and place bacon wrapped sausages side by side in 13 x 9 inch casserole dish.  It's ok if the sausage's are touching and pushed together.  Top all with brown sugar and bake in oven at 350* for 1 hour.  Pull out pan and place on oven pads and set out toothpicks to eat with.  They will be the first thing in the kitchen gone, I promise.
