Ingredients:
4 large parsnips, peeled, 1 X 1/2 X 1/2 batons
3 T butter
1 t honey
2 large (11 oz) boxes spinach leaves
1 med onion, finely chopped
1 T olive oil
1 t arrowroot powder
1.5 c heavy cream
1/4 t nutmeg
salt and pepper

Directions:
Clean, peel, and cut parsnips. Parboil for 10 min until almost tender. Drain and set aside.
Blanch spinach 15 seconds. (A large pot with deep basket works well for this; work with one box of spinach at a time.) Immediately cool with cold running water. Transfer to colander to drain.
The previous two steps can be done ahead, but the final steps should be done just before serving.
Preheat oven to 400F. Melt 2 T butter and stir in 1 t honey. Transfer parsnips to parchment-lined baking sheet. Toss with butter-honey and salt and pepper. Roast at 400F for 20-30 min until beginning to crisp and brown.
Meanwhile, gently saute onion in olive oil and 1 T butter until translucent. Add 1 c cream and heat gently. Mix arrowroot powder with remaining 1/2 c cream and stir well. To the warm cream, whisk in cream-arrowroot slurry and continue to whisk and heat gently just until cream begins to thicken.
Squeeze excess liquid from spinach. Stir into cream mixture, heating until warmed through. Stir in nutmeg. Salt and pepper to taste. Toss in roasted parsnips.

Description: 
The most well-received dish at dinner. The mild, creaminess was a welcome contrast to the peppery salad and tart, boozy cranberry sauce. Needs some strong flavors on the menu for balance.
