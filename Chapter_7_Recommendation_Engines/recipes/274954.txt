Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons fig butter
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Champagne vinaigrette

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat oil over high heat in a large oven-safe saute pan. Place chicken into the hot oil and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix fig butter, Dijon mustard, and vinaigrette together in a small bowl. Flip chicken using tongs and coat top with fig mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove from the oven and cover chicken with aluminum foil; let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
