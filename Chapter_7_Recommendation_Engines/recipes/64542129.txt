Ingredients:
2 cups sweet potatoes
1 cup red lentils
1 broccoli stalk
5 oz spinach
1/2 yellow onion
3 oz marble cheese
5 cloves garlic
2 eggs
1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 tbs La Grille Vegetable Seasoning (contains enough salt)
1 tsp pepper
1/2 cup oil for frying

Directions:
Cut up and back the sweet potato. Cook lentils according to instructions on package. Cut up and steam broccoli, then chop finely. Pan fry spinach and yellow onion. Grate cheese and mince garlic.
Insure that all items are drained of water. Add sweet potatoes, lentils, broccoli, spinach, onion, cheese and garlic to a bowl and mix well.
In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, flour, pepper and vegetable seasoning together into a paste. Mix the paste into the rest of the ingredients.
Shape patties and cook in oil on a non-stick pan on medium heat. Can also be baked at 425 F for 15 minutes per side.
