Ingredients:
2 Loaf Frozen White Bread Dough
1/2 cup Butter, softened, divided
1 cup firmly packed Brown Sugar
4 teaspoons Ground Cinnamon
3/4 cup Pecan or Walnut Pieces
4 ounces Cream Cheese, softened
1 cup Powdered Sugar
1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1 1/2 teaspoons Milk

Directions:
On lightly floured surface, roll dough into Two 17x5-inch rectangles; overlap long edges by 1-inch. Spread with ¼ cup softened butter. Sprinkle dough with sugar, cinnamon and pecans or walnuts.
Roll up dough, beginning with long side; slice into 15 rolls. Transfer to a greased 13x9-inch baking dish. Let rise in warm place until doubled in size (about 45 minutes).
Bake in a preheated 350°F oven 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine remaining ingredients and ¼ cup butter; mix until smooth. Spread warm rolls with cream cheese frosting.
