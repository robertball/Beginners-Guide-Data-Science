1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dried apricots, finely chopped

Directions:
In mixing bowl, cream butter and cream cheese. Mix in flour. Chill one hour.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, pour hot water over apricots. Let stand 5 minutes, then drain. In medium bowl, combine egg, brown sugar, butter, pecans and apricots.
Preheat oven to 325F. Roll dough into balls, each about one heaping teaspoon-sized. Press each ball into an ungreased mini-muffin cup forming it to the sides of the cup. Fill each cup with apricot mixture.
Bake 25-30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in pan, then remove to wire rack.
