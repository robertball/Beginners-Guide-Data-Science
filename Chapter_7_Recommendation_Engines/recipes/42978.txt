Ingredients:
2 medium acorn squash, halved and seeded
4 tablespoons fresh orange juice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Arrange squash halves cut side up in a shallow baking dish. Place one tablespoon of orange juice into each cavity. Sprinkle each one with ginger and nutmeg. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake for 60 to 90 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the squash is tender. Baking time will depend on the size of the squash. Remove from the oven, discard aluminum foil, and let the squash rest for 5 minutes before serving to let the juices settle.
