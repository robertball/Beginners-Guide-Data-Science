Ingredients:
2 cups brown rice
4 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package extra firm tofu, diced
3/4 cup tamari almonds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1 bunch kale, ribs removed, chopped
1/2 large head red cabbage, chopped
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/2 cup tamari soy sauce
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
8 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup stone-ground mustard
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring the brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, place a cover on the saucepan, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Spread the rice onto a large platter and chill in refrigerator until cooled completely.
Gently toss the cooled rice, diced tofu, tamari almonds, sesame seeds, chopped kale, red cabbage, shredded carrot, chopped flat-leaf parsley, and chopped dill together in a large mixing bowl.
Whisk the lemon juice, tamari soy sauce, olive oil, garlic, and mustard together in a small bowl; season with salt and black pepper.
Drizzle the dressing over the rice mixture; toss gently to coat evenly.
