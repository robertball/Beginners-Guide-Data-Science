Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried apricots, diced
10 sprigs fresh thyme, or to taste
10 sprigs fresh rosemary, or to taste
8 cloves garlic, diced
1 (3 1/2) pound boneless leg of lamb
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon vadouvan (optional)
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup Madeira wine
For Roasting:
1 ounce chopped fresh rosemary
1 ounce chopped fresh thyme
6 cups apple juice
2 lemons, sliced
1 cup tzatziki sauce (optional)

Directions:
Mix apricots, thyme, rosemary, and 1/2 of the diced garlic and rub onto lamb. Tie lamb with kitchen string and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine coriander, allspice, cumin, salt, pepper, and vadouvan and rub over lamb. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Brown the roast on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Pour in Madeira wine and bring to a boil, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place lamb and juices in a pan and rub with chopped rosemary and thyme. Add apple juice and top with lemon slices.
Bake in the preheated oven, basting and rotating the lamb occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
Remove from the oven and let rest until internal temperature reaches 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). In the meantime, transfer the liquid into a pan and boil until thickened as desired, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve lamb with tzatziki sauce.

Description: 
This slow-roasted recipe is best if domestic lamb is used, as it is much more mild and flavorful than imported lamb. I made this recipe for a friend in TN that did not have a smoker. It is based on my pulled pork recipe I perfected in a TraegerÂ® smoker. You can garnish the final product with more chopped fresh herbs and vadouvan if desired.
