Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 extra large egg
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons crushed fennel seeds
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups pasta sauce
2 zucchini, halved and sliced
1 (8 ounce) package baby bella mushrooms, quartered
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine turkey, onion, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, oregano, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well. Shape into golf ball-sized meatballs and place in the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine pasta sauce, zucchini, and mushrooms in a small saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes. Add up to 1/2 cup water to thin sauce if needed.
Serve meatballs with sauce.
