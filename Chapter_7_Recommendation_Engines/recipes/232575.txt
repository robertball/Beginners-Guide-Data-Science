Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1 onion, finely chopped
1 green onion, chopped
1 egg
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons parsley paste
1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix ground turkey, bread crumbs, onion, green onion, egg, garlic, parsley paste, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and salt together in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
Form turkey mixture into 4 patties; arrange in a baking dish.
Bake turkey burgers in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
