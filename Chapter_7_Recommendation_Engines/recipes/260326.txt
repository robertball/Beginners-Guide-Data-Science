Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 yellow onions, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups College Inn® Beef Broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can Contadina® Diced Tomatoes, undrained
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
Topping Options:
Shredded Cheddar cheese
onion, chopped
Sour cream
Sliced green onions
Cilantro leaves

Directions:
Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onions and bell pepper and cook until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add beef and salt and cook about 8 minutes until beef is no longer pink, breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon.
Stir in beans, broth and tomatoes. Simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 1 hour. Stir in vinegar. Serve with toppings, as desired.
