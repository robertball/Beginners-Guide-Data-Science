Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
5 eggs
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan.
Cream together 1cup butter or margarine, shortening,  brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Sift 2 1/2 cups of the flour and baking powder. Add alternately with milk to the creamed mixture.  Stir 1/2 cup flour with the chopped pecans, then fold into the batter.  Pour into prepared pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let stand in pan 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
To Make Frosting:  In a small saucepan, beat 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, butter or margarine, and milk together.  Bring to a rolling boil, and cook for one minute.  Remove from heat, and stir in vanilla.  Cool, then beat until thickened. Add a little milk if it too thick. Spread on cake.
