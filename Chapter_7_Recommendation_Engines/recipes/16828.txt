Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups shortening
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups mashed cooked carrots
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 orange, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla and carrots. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in the walnuts. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly golden. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the glaze, put 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar into a medium bowl. Grate the rind of the orange into the bowl with the sugar. Squeeze in enough juice from the orange to form a thin but spreadable consistency. Mix until smooth. If necessary, stir in more confectioners' sugar. Spread onto the cooled cookies. Store in an airtight container.

My Grandma used to make these cookies all the time, and I grew up hooked!  You'll be surprised at how great the combination of flavors are, especially with the citrusy glaze.
