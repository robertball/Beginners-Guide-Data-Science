Ingredients:
1 medium spaghetti squash
2 cups chopped seeded tomatoes
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
1 garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 cups fresh broccoli florets
1 large carrot, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons water
2 ounces fresh or frozen snow peas, sliced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Pierce squash six times with a sharp knife. Place on a microwave-safe plate; microwave on high for 7 minutes. Turn squash; cook 7 minutes longer. Cover with an inverted bowl; let stand for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, oil and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat, uncovered, on high for 2-3 minutes or until tomatoes are softened, stirring once. Stir in the basil, salt and pepper. Place broccoli, carrot and water in another microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Add peas; cover and cook 1-2 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender. Let stand for 5 minutes; drain. Add to tomato mixture.
Halve squash lengthwise; remove seeds. Using a fork, separate squash into strands; toss with tomato mixture. Serve with Parmesan cheese.
