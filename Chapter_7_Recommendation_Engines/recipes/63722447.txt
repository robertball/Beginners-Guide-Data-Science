Ingredients:
1 Cup sugar (powder)
1 Cup Ghee (Samna)*
1 Tsp Baking Powder (B.B)
1 Tsp Vanilla
2 Cup flour or as needed

Directions:
Mix sugar and Ghee until almost white.
Add the B.B. and mix.
Add the flour in small quantities as the dough thickens almost dry but still in a shape that you are able to play with it and make the Ghorayebah balls.
Switch on the oven on low to medium heat (150C).
Cut in to small spoon portion pieces and make a ball with your hands.
Knead dough briefly, and form into walnut-sized balls.
Add the balls to the oven dish and press down with inserting cloves in the center, almond or any topping you like.
Bake in for 10-20 minutes until ivory in color do not let is blush.
Get it out and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a seasonal Sudanese cookies for Eid celebrations usually. As I moved away from home I took with me what ever reminded me of home and family. You are surely free to try and bake at anytime of the year. This recipe was handed down to me by my mother.
