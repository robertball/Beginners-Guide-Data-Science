Ingredients:
1 pound beef sirloin steak or top round steak, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons chopped onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves, crushed
2 cups fresh or frozen whole baby carrots
1 3/4 cups Swanson® Beef Broth (Regular, 50% Less Sodium or Certified Organic)
1/2 cup Burgundy or other dry red wine
Hot cooked orzo pasta

Directions:
Place the beef in a large bowl.  Add the flour and toss to coat.
Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook until it's well browned, stirring often. Add the onion, garlic, parsley, mushrooms and thyme and cook until the mushrooms are tender.  Add the carrots, broth and wine to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the beef is cooked through.
Serve the beef mixture over the orzo.
