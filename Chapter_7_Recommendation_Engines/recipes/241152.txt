Ingredients:
12  small chicken wings
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon coarse salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
¼ teaspoon paprika
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's(<sup>&reg;</sup>)), or to taste
2 quarts vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.
Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange onto a large plate so they do not touch. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.
Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings again 15 to 30 minutes.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Transfer fried wings to a large stainless steel bowl. Drizzle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.
