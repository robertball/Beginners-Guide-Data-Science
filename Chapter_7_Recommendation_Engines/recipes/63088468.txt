Ingredients:
2 packs of drumettes/wingettes
2 cups flour
3 tablespoons garlic powder
4 tablespoons Emeril's Essence Seasoning
1 teaspoon white pepper
3/4 cup hot sauce (more if you like it hotter)
3/4 cup honey
4 tablespoons brown sugar
Vegetable oil
Ranch or blue cheese dressing
Celery

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees for frying.
Preheat over to 350 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
In a large bowl, combine flour, garlic powder, Emeril's Essence Seasoning, salt and white pepper.  Dredge the wings/drums in the flour mixture and set aside on a plate.  Dredge the wings a second time and immediately drop into oil to fry until a dark golden brown (about 9-12 minutes).  Drain on paper towels.
While the wings are cooking, mix the honey, hot sauce and brown sugar in a large bowl.  Cover the wings with the sauce mixture and place on lined baking sheet.  Bake for about 10 minutes.
Serve hot with ranch or blue cheese dressing and celery

Description: 
My husband says the only problem with these wings is that he can't stop eating them.  He likes them super hot but you can make them as hot or sweet as you like.
Serve them hot or cold and they are just as good the next day.  I also leave a few without sauce....they are just as tasty for the pickier eaters.
