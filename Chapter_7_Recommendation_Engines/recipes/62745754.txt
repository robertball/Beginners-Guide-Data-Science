Ingredients:
Baby carrots
Celery
White or Red onion
Roasted Red Pepper
Pinto Beans (canned should be drained)
Slivers of Bread and Butter Pickle
Frozen Corn
1/4 c. Apple Cider Vineger
1/4 c. water
1/4 c. sugar (or per taste)
3-4 Tbsp. oil (What you prefer)

Directions:
Slice carrots, celery, pickles, peppers & onions to desired size.
Carrots need to be steamed to soften a bit but still have a crunch.
Throw all veggies in a bowl with a matching lid to keep in the fridge.
Dressing:
Combine vinegar and sugar. Warm in microwave to melt the sugar. Add water and vinegar. Stir together and pour into the veggies.
Close the lid and shake. Keep in fridge.

Description: 
This recipe is from Aunt Jane. I altered it to use in my green salads.
Leave it more chunky for green salad additions, or cut it smaller for a relish that will compliment meats or veggies. Serve as a small side on dinner plate.
