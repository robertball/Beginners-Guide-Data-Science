Ingredients:
1 pound dried red beans
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 green pepper, chopped
1 small, sweet onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 cup chicken stock
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp brown sugar
1 pound smoked ham, chopped into 1/2 inch chunks
1/2 pound andouille sausage, cut into pieces
4 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Soak the beans over night in the refrigerator.
In the morning, put everything into the slow cooker, except for the rice, and mix.
Cook on 'High' for 6 or 7 hours hours (or, until the beans are tender).
Remove about a cup of the beans and mash them with a fork or a potato masher, then return the mashed beans to the skillet. You could also use a blender for this.
Add the mashed beans back into the slow cooker, and stir. Reduce to low, and let it cook for another hour or two.
Serve over rice.

Description: 
This is a super easy recipe to execute. Soak the beans over night, throw everything in the slow cooker, and pretty much ignore it for the rest of the day.
