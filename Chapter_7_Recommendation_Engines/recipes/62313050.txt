Ingredients:
3 c. flour
1/4 tsp. yeast
1 14 tsp. salt

Directions:
In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt.  Ads 1 5/8 c. water and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap.  Let dough rest for about 18 hours at warm room temperature.
Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles.  Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice.  Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball.  Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seams side down on towel and dust with more flour.  Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours.
At least 1/2 hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 and place a 6-8 qt. heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats.  When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven.  Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up.  Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed.  Cover with lid and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove lid and bake for 15-30 minutes more, till loaf is brown.
