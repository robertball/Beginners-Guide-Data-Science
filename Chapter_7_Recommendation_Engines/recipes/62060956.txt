Description: 
A spur-of-the-moment creation when I wanted something with a great flavor punch and lots of color, plus quick to prepare---this one fills the bill, with  baby spinach and colorful cranberries and mandarin oranges, plus the crunch of sweetened  almonds and the pungent feta cheese---a new favorite at our house! You may substitute blue cheese for the feta and any kind of sweetened pecans or walnuts, if desired, for the almonds. Great with grilled chicken...
