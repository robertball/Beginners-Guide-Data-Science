Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
3 cups diced sweet potatoes
2 McIntosh apples - peeled, cored, and diced
1 cup diced carrots
3 cups chicken broth

1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Add sweet potatoes, apples, and carrots; continue to cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and apple cider and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
Add chicken, pepper, rosemary, turmeric, and bay leaf; cook until vegetables are soft and chicken is no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice and season with salt before serving.

Description: 
I made this chicken stew on a cold autumn night when I had an excess of fresh apples. The apple adds a sweet, pleasant flavor which complements the root vegetables, resulting in a light, but delicious, dinner which warms you from the inside. Great with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and served with sourdough rolls for dipping.
