Ingredients:
1 or 2 packs of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts)
1 tablespoon of fresh thyme
1 tablespoon of fresh coarsely chopped rosemary
1 tablespoon of fresh coarsely chopped sage
1 teaspoon of roasted minced garlic
juice of 1 lemon (about 3 to 4 tablespoons)
1 tablespoon of honey (I used a chunk of honeycomb instead)
1/4 teaspoon of lemon zest
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup of white wine (to deglaze the pan)

Directions:
Place the thyme, rosemary, sage, garlic, lemon juice, honey, lemon zest and some salt and pepper into a one gallon Zip Lock bag
Next place the chicken thighs into the bag and massage the herbs into the chicken
Put the bag in the fridge for 2 hours to let the chicken marinate
When ready to cook, heat some olive oil in a large pan
Place the marinated chicken into the hot oil and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes per side
While it is cooking, add the remainder of the marinade into the pan
When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and add the wine to deglaze the pan
Once reduced, pour the sauce onto the chicken and serve immediately
Each pack of chicken serves about 4 people

Description: 
I like lemons.  I like herbs.  And this recipe combines two of my favorite tastes.  Once you taste the chicken, it explodes in your mouth! I think you will like this recipe too.
