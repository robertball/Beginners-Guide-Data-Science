Description: 
A favorite served at a particular school for wizardry and witchcraft can be served to your children too! Healthy and light, it can also be made less so by turning it into an alcoholic version, but that is up to the witch in the kitchen! Canned pumpkin is fine, but fresh-roasted pumpkin has more color.
