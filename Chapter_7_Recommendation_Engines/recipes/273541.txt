Ingredients:
2 small bananas
1 medium avocado, pitted and peeled
2 large eggs
1/2 cup milk

1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Cream together bananas and avocado in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer. Pour in eggs and milk; mix well.
Whisk whole wheat flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a separate bowl.
Pour flour mixture into banana mixture slowly and mix until incorporated. Add walnuts and mix for 1 minute.
Divide batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
