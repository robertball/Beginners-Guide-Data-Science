Description: 
I just dug this out of my grandmother's recipe booklet, and it used to be one of my most favorite things to eat that she made when I was a child. The dessert is similar to a chocolate pudding, but would fall into the category of a blancmange. Simple to make and flavorful! The topping after the dessert cools down is the best part!
