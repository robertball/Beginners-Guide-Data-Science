Ingredients:
3/4 cup pineapple juice
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup dry mustard powder
1/2 cup red currant jelly
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup canned pineapple chunks, drained and chopped, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Whisk together the pineapple juice with cornstarch in a small saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the dry mustard powder, red currant jelly, raisins, and pineapple. (Lumps of jelly will dissolve as mixture heats.) Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring constantly, and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Keep raisins stirred into sauce as it cooks so they don't burn. Serve warm.

Description: 
My mom served this sweet little sauce as a warmed condiment for our ham every Easter. It's easy, unique and tasty! You can make it earlier, and re-heat it, but it's best right off the stove!
