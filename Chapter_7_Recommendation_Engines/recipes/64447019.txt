Ingredients:
2 cups low-fat coconut milk, regular dairy milk, soy-milk or almond milk
1/2 cup roughly diced pineapple
1/2 cup roughly diced mango
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
1/2 cup chia seeds
1 tablespoon agave syrup or honey (optional)
2-3 tablespoons additional chopped fruit (we used pineapple, mango, and strawberries)

Directions:
Combine coconut milk, pineapple, mango and coconut flakes in a blender or food processor until smooth.
In a medium bowl, combine chia seeds, coconut milk mixture, and agave syrup or honey (if using), and stir until fully combine. Cover and refrigerate for a couple hours or overnight.
When ready to serve, garnish with additional diced fruit.

Description: 
This chia seed pudding lets you indulge your sweet tooth in a healthy, natural, no-sugar-added way. Fresh pineapple and mango sweeten things naturally, while the chia seeds thicken up so this dessert is satisfying enough to also be a snack or breakfast.
I enjoy making it the night before and taking it as a breakfast or mid-day snack. The seeds will swell up and look almost like tapioca pearls. Play around using whatever fresh fruit is in season. I have used kiwi, peaches, plums, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, mango, papaya, bananas, melons, coconut, strawberry or apples.
