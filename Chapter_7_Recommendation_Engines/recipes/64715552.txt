Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
2 Italian Sausages, casings removed and crumbled
2 chopped crimini mushrooms
3 tomatoes, diced
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 18 ounce package multi-color cheese tortellini
2 tablespoons flour
3/4 cup milk
3/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup finely shredded Italian cheese blend

Directions:
1.  In a 12-inch pan, heat the olive oil to medium-high.
2.  Add the garlic and onion. Saute until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. In a separate pan on medium-high heat, brown the Italian sausage, about 10 minutes.
4. Add mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, salt, pepper, and basil to the garlic and onion. Lower heat to a simmer and stir as needed.
5. Boil 2 quarts of water in a 5-quart pot. When boiling, add the tortellini and cook per directions, about 6 minutes. Drain the tortellini and set aside.
6. While waiting for the tortellini water to boil, mix the flour, milk, heavy cream, and shredded cheese in a bowl. Add to the tomato & onion pan. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally and allowing it to reduce, about 15 minutes.
7. Mix sauce and tortellini and serve.
