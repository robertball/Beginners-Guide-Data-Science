Ingredients:
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons honey mustard
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pound pork chops
2 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup apple cider

Directions:
Mix brown sugar, honey mustard, mustard powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder together in a small bowl; rub onto pork chops and let sit on a plate for flavors to dissolve into pork chops, about 10 minutes.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add apple cider. Arrange coated pork chops in the skillet; cook until pork chops are browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a recipe I created using the idea that pork and apples go splendidly together! The seasonings give the pork a sweet and slightly spicy taste. The apple cider adds to the sweetness, while bringing a unique tartness as it is absorbed into the meat. Serve with applesauce, if desired. Hope you enjoy!
