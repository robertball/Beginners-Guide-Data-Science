Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, or as needed
2 medium apples - peeled, cored, and cubed
3 teaspoons honey, divided
1 whole clove
6 slices bread, cubed
1 cup milk
2 eggs
2 drops vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 9x2-inch round baking dish.
Place apples into a bowl and cover with hot water. Add 1 teaspoon honey and clove. Let soak for 10 minutes.
Place bread cubes into a bowl and add remaining honey, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly.
Take apples out of water and let excess drip off; add apples and cinnamon to the bread mixture and mix slowly. Pour mixture into the prepared dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve warm.
