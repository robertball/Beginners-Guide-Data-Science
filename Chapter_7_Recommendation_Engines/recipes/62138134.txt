https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb package of your favorite spaghetti noodles or pasta.  I like the 3x the fiber pastas that are now being offered as a great staple.
1 can of Italian seasoned tomatoes.  Garlic seasonings work quite well.
2 cans of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup.
2 Campbellâ€™s soup cans of milk.
1 package of your favorite seasoned precooked chicken breast strips.
Dash Worcestershire Sauce (to your taste)

Directions:
Cook your pasta according to package directions.
When pasta is finished rinse in warm water and drain well.
Meanwhile in pan combine all other ingredients.   Mix well.  As ingredients start to warm over, stir in pasta.
Pairs well with fresh dinner salads and crusty bread.
For a thicker sauce, adjust milk to your taste.
For a spicier variation change the Italian seasoned tomatoes for Rotel and the Cheddar Cheese soup for Campbell's Jack Cheese soup. Use fajita seasoned chicken strips.. YUM!
