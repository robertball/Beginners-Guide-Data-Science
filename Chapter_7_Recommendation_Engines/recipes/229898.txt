Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package light cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup apple butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place cream cheese, apple butter, vanilla, and cinnamon in the container of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process until just smooth, about 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the container and process again until combined, if necessary.
Scrape the spread into a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 30 minutes.
