Ingredients:
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips (3 ounces)
3/4 cup skinned hazelnuts, toasted (about 4 ounces)
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk, such as Eagle Brand
1 tablespoon honey
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
Toasted baguette slices
Sliced fruit, such as apples, pears, pineapple and/or bananas
Directions
Cook's Note: To toast the hazelnuts, arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F oven for 15 to 18 minutes until lightly toasted. Cool completely before using.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Place the chocolate chips in a small bowl and place over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature.
Grind the nuts in a food processor until pasty (the nuts will be stuck to the sides of work bowl), 1 minute. Scrape down the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the condensed milk, honey and salt. Blend well, scraping down the bowl as needed. Add the cooled chocolate and pulse until combined. Transfer the spread to a small bowl.
Serve with the toasts and sliced fruit.
Cook's Note: The chocolate can also be melted in a microwave. Microwave the chocolate chips in a small microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals until the chocolate is very soft. Stir until melted and smooth.
