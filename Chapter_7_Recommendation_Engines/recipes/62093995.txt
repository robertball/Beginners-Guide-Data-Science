Ingredients:
8 whole cobs corn, NOT shucked but with silks removed
1/2 cup salt
Water
Bucket, at least 2 gallon capacity

Directions:
If you haven't already, tug the silks out of the corn but do not shuck the cobs -- leave them whole.  Put corn in a bucket and pour salt over.  Add enough water to cover and leave to soak for a few hours.
Meanwhile, prepare your grill.  Ideal temperature, if you have a thermometer, is about 350 - 400 (medium-hot)degrees.    Once fire is ready, put whole cobs on the fire and cook for about 15 minutes.  Remove and serve whole, making sure you've given your guests someplace to put the crisped shucks.  Serve with butter and traditional accompaniments.
