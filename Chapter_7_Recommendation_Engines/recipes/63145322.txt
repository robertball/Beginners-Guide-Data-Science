Description: 
I have always been a baker that has loved to bake cakes from scratch, then one day I had a chocolate cake box mix to use up and well the rest is history.  I first invented this cake for a work's pot luck and it was so well received that I was given orders to bake for their own personal enjoyment (maybe I should be keeping this recipe a secret !!) You will be so surprised just how good this recipe is considering it started life in two boxes!
