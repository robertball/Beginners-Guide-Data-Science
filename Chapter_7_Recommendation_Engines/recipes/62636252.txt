Ingredients:
1/4 cup warm water (105F to 115F)
2 packages active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
5 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 eggs
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
oil

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl.
In a saucepan, combine the milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon and butter.
(Cut the butter into small pieces for easier melting.).
Heat to 110F or lukewarm but not too hot for the yeast mixture.
Add milk mixture with the eggs and 2 cups flour to the dissolved yeast.
Beat until smooth.
Beat in the remaining flour.
The dough will be soft and sticky.
Let rise for about 1 hour.
Stir down.
Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface.
Roll in flour to coat.
Gently roll into an 8 by 24-inch rectange.
With a sharp, floured knife cut into 1-inch crosswise strips.
Bring ends of strips together and twist strands loosely.
Let rise on floured board or pan for 20 to 30 minutes until almost doubled.
Heat 1-inch oil in a skillet to 350Â°F Fry on both sides, about 3 minutes total.
Drain.
Coat in sugar and spice mixture.
