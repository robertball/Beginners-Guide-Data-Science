Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups skim milk
2 egg, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons melted butter
cooking spray
1/4 cup strawberry jam

Directions:
Combine oats, flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Set bowl aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the skim milk, eggs, peanut butter, and melted butter. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in the wet ingredients, being careful not to over mix the batter.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles appear on the surface. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes per side. Serve with strawberry jam.
