Ingredients:
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 Tablespoons cold butter
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup fresh cranberries
Raw/Turbinado sugar as desired for topping

Directions:
Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
Add cold butter, slice by slice, mixing as you go.  It's easiest with a pastry cutter.
Stir in yogurt and then cranberries.
Form dough into a ball.  Place on greased baking sheet.  Pat down into a circle about 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick.
Sprinkle with sugar and cut into 8 segments.
Bake at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes or until edges are slightly crisp and top is browned.
Once removed from oven, redefine the cut marks.
