Ingredients:
1 stick butter
4 ounces unsweetened baking chocolate
2 large eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4-1/2 cup Nutella

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F and spray an 8×8-inch pan with nonstick spray. In a medium saucepan, melt butter and chocolate over medium heat, stirring until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool.
Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl until thick and pale; beat in the chocolate mixture, vanilla and salt. Add flour and beat on low speed or stir just until blended.
Pour batter into the prepared pan. Heat the Nutella for about 20 seconds in a small bowl in the microwave, just enough to soften it enough to swirl over the batter. Drop by the spoonful over the batter, swirling it a bit with the spoon or the tip of a knife. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until just set and the edges are starting to pull away from the sides of the pan. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.
