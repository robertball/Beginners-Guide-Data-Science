Ingredients:
4 T Almond meal (sometimes called Almond flour)
2 T Jojoba oil
4 T Honey
5 drops of Peppermint essential oil

Directions:
In a 4 oz cobalt or amber glass jar (preferably) pour in the Almond meal and Jojoba oil.  Stir well.  Then mix in the Honey and Peppermint essential oil.  Keep stirring until the mixture is completely mixed.
To use: Cleanse skin first.  Apply about a teaspoon amount of the scrub to a moistened face.  Mix with water to make it a more fluid application (do not add water to the jar).  Scrub the skin gently, letting the almond meal do the work (harder pressure will only damage capillaries!).  Massage every square inch of skin except the delicate eye tissue.  Remove with a warm washcloth.  Be careful to remove every bit of the scrub.  Apply a tonic or hydrosol with a cotton ball to remove any excess product.  Finish by applying your moisturizer.  Use about once a week to help keep the skin soft and smooth and relieve surface tension.
