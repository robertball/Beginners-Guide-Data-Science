Description: 
INDIANA--'When I think of food and summer, I think of our county fair in July. My three sons and I have competed in a lot of 4-H cooking contests. I enter 15 or more food items every year in the open show. 'I've found Taste of Home to be a great source for prize winning recipes. My recipe for Sky-High Biscuits (below) never fails to win a ribbon. They're moist, high and flaky, with a wonderful wheat flavor.'                                                    --Ruth Burrus, Zionsville
