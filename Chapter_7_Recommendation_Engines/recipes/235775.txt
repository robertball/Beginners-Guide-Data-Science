Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup eggnog
3 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (6 ounce) package butterscotch chips
2 tablespoons cold butter

Directions:
Line 9-inch square pan with aluminum foil and spray foil with cooking spray. Prepare insides of a large saucepan with cooking spray.
Stir eggnog and sugar together in prepared saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a rolling boil while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Boil mixture for 2 minutes.
Fold marshmallows and nutmeg into the eggnog mixture. Bring mixture again to a boil, stirring continually; boil for 6 minutes, remove immediately from heat, and add butterscotch chips and butter. Beat the mixture rapidly with a whisk or a hand mixer until thoroughly mixed and loses its gloss; pour into the prepared saucepan.
Set fudge aside at room temperature until set, at least 15 minutes.
