Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed Cheddar cheese soup
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons dried minced onion flakes
1 (16 ounce) package little smokie sausages
8 ounces processed cheese, cubed
1 cup frozen diced carrots

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, bring to a boil, and stir in the macaroni. Return to a boil and cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well.
Whisk together the soup, milk, and onion flakes in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Bring to a simmer, and stir in the sausage links, cheese, and carrots. Bring the mixture back to a boil, stirring frequently, until the cheese has melted and the mixture is bubbling.
Stir in the hot cooked macaroni, and serve.
