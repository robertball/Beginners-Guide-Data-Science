Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breasts baked and diced.
3 tbsps fresh tarragon chopped finely
2 celery stalks chopped finely
1 tbsp red vinegar
1-2 tbsp sugar
salt & pepper to taste
Homemade Mayo
1 egg
2 egg yolks
2 tsp dry mustard
1 tbsp red vinegar
Juice of lemon
2 cups oil (can use vegetable, canoloa, or if using olive oil mix 1/2 and 1/2)

Directions:
In a large bowl mix together the chicken, tarragon, celery, red vinegar, sugar, and salt/pepper.
To prepare the homemade Mayo you will use a blender or food processer.  You can also adapt using a fork or whip.
Blend together the egg, egg yolks, dry mustard, red vinegar, and lemon juice.  Slowly drizzle in oil while continuing to blend.  Once the mayo has emulsified, taste it.  You may choose to add more lemon or vinegar at this point depending on your taste.
Mayo will hold in the refridgerator for 2-3 weeks.  Use 1/2 of the mayo and add to the chicken mixture.  Toss to coat.  Refridgerate for 1 or more hours to allow flavors to combine.

Description: 
New flavor infused with an old favorite.  Homemade mayonnaise really brings this up a notch.  Of course to save time you can always use your store bought favorite.  However, there is a big difference between homemade mayo and store bought.

You can speed up the prep time on this by using store bought rotissere chicken in place of cooking your own.
