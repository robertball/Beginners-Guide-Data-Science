Description: 
My grandmother would pan-fry beet greens with garlic and olive oil. Following her example, I added sun-dried tomatoes and capers for a little more pop! The kids love it and it's quick and easy. Please note, although I have measurements listed, I am a 'pinch here and pinch there' type of cook. You may need to adjust for your personal taste.
