1/2 teaspoon mustard seed

2 large English cucumbers, thinly sliced
1 large onion, diced

Directions:
Stir sugar and vinegar in a large microwave-safe bowl until sugar has dissolved; mix in salt, mustard seed, celery seed, and turmeric. Stir cucumbers and onion into the pickling mixture.

Description: 
Like a bread and butter pickle and really super easy. You can even play with the proportions a bit. I like to increase the vinegar, salt and spices a bit but you could make it sweeter too. Be prepared to make this one over and over if you have any pickle lovers in the house.
