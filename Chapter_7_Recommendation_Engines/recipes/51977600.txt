Ingredients:
2 cups organic all-purpose flour (I generally use whole wheat pastry flour)
2 cups organic sugar (leave out some if desire less sweetness)
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt (optional, or to taste)
1 cup water
4 T coconut oil  + 1 cup organic applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
*vegan chocolate chips for middle layer (optional)
* chopped walnuts or favorite nut for middle layer (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Use coconut oil or pan spray on pan.
In a food processor mix water, coconut oil, applesauce and vanilla until well blended.
Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt to the liquid mixture.  Process until blended.  Spread evenly in a 9x13 inch baking pan.
*If using chocolate chips, nuts--spread half of the batter in the pan, add the chocolate chips, nuts in a layer, pour rest of batter over them and spread it evenly.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the top is no longer shiny. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into squares.

MMMMM...Vegan Brownies!!!!  These are very gooey, which is a good thing in my book. However, if you want your brownies a little more solid you'll need to cook them longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies too!Modified from: Vegan Brownies
