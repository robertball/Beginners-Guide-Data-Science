Ingredients:
1 yuca (cassava) root
olive oil for frying

Directions:
Peel most of the yuca, trimming off the tough end. Cut yuca in thirds. Stand each section on its end and carefully cut lengthwise into quarters.
Place yuca in a saucepan of cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium and simmer until just barely tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain yuca on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool to room temperature.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add yuca and fry until golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and let rest for a few minutes before serving.

Description: 
Thanks to their superior fiber content and lower glycemic index, these crispy yuca fries are often presented as a healthier alternative to fried potatoes, but you might find the roles reversed. They really are that good and do a great job of bridging the gap between regular fried potatoes and sweet potato fries. Serve with ketchup or any kind of aioli.
