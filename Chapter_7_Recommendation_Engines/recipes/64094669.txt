Ingredients:
4 large bone-in chicken thighs, with skin (about 1 1/2 pounds)
2 Tbl grainy French mustard
2 Tbl stone ground mustard
1 tsp brown sugar
1 clove minced garlic
1/2 tsp dried marjoram
2 Tbl maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
Rinse chicken and pat dry. Combine mustard, garlic, marjoram, brown sugar and maple syrup in a small bowl. Spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons mustard mixture evenly on top of each chicken thigh, being careful to cover as much of the surface as possible to form a "crust." Arrange chicken in a glass baking dish. Bake for 10 minutes then reduce temperature to 375 degrees and bake an additional 35 minutes.  Broil 2 more minutes until mustard mixture has formed a crust and is slightly hardened, and juices run clear when the chicken is pierced.
