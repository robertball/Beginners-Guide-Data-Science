Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups flour (plus I toss in more, maybe about another 1/4 to 1/3 cup)
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt (I measure this on the slight side)
1/2 cup shortening (usually use butter flavor)
1/2 cup softened margarine (Gretchen cheats and uses butter, I think)
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup sugar
2 tsp vanilla (I am very heavy handed when I measure this)
2 eggs
12 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips (dark chocolate is best)

Directions:
Measure and mix the dry ingredients.
Beat sugars, margarine and shortening until light and fluffy.
Beat in eggs, and then vanilla.
Add the dry ingredients to the sugar/ shortening mixture.
Stir in chocolate chips.
Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 375 for 12 minutes.
