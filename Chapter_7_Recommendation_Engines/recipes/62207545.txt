Ingredients:
1 cup softened butter
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, beat together butter and sugars until fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well.
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oats, baking soda, and salt.
Add dry ingredients to wet and stir just until mixed.
Stir in cranberries, white chocolate chips, and pecans.
Chill dough for at least an hour.
Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until edges start to brown. Cool on baking sheets for five minutes, then remove to cool completely on wire racks.

Description: 
Cookies in a jar, without the jar. I love these cookies and am regularly asked for the recipe. This recipe includes all the ingredients as well as instructions for making the cookies in a more traditional way - no jar necessary.Modified from: Cranberry Hootycreeks
