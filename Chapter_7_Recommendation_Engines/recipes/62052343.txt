Ingredients:
1 large jar Prego Traditional spaghetti sauce
1 large container small curd cottage cheese
1 package deli sliced swiss cheese
1/2 package shredded mozzaralla cheese
1-2 pounds ground beef
1-2 cloves garlic (minced)
1 small onion (minced)
1/2 box lasagna noodles (cooked)
Parmesan Cheese (optional)

Directions:
Saute ground beef with onion & garlic. (My family won't eat onion so it doesn't hurt if you leave it out)
Add jar of spaghetti sauce, heat till warm
Spray a 9 x 13 pan with cooking spray and layer one row of cooked noodles on bottom, continue with a layer of cottage cheese, swiss cheese, then meat sauce.  Continue layering in this order until pan is full.  Cover top of lasagna with swiss cheese, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan.  Cover with foil and bake at 350 for 30 minutes, remove foil and continue until cheese is bubbly and lasagna is heated through.

Description: 
Lasagna with a twist!  The swiss cheese makes all the difference I promise.  I make two pans at once and freeze one.  It really re-heats well.  I have also made it with homemade meat sauce and it's even better.  I typically make this to send when friends have a death in their family or to new moms.
