Ingredients:
3/4 cup peanut butter
1/3 cup shortening
2/3 cup white sugar
1 cup mashed very ripe banana
2 eggs
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 4x8-inch loaf pan.
Beat peanut butter and shortening in a bowl. Gradually add sugar, beating until light and fluffy. Beat one egg into peanut butter mixture until completely blended before beating in the second egg. Stir in mashed banana.
Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a bowl. Stir flour mixture into banana mixture alternately with buttermilk, mixing until batter is just blended. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour.
