Koji-Rubbed Steak Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
¾ cup koji rice
2  New York strip steaks
kosher salt to taste
2 tablespoons clarified butter

Directions:
Grind rice until not quite powdered using a food processor or mortar and pestle. Sprinkle rice over all surfaces of the steaks, pressing in to coat. Transfer to a rack on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate uncovered 2 to 3 days.
Using the back of a knife, scrape the koji rice from the steaks; discard. Season steaks with kosher salt.
Heat skillet over medium-heat. Melt clarified butter and place steak in skillet. Sear on one side for 2 minutes; turn and sear the other side. Continue cooking until steaks are firm and reddish-pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
Transfer steaks to a warm plate to let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I got the idea from an article in Bon Appetit where they showed how to use koji rice to simulate dry aging a steak. I tried it out, and had mixed results. The idea here is that the fungus on the koji rice, which breaks down the proteins in beans to make things like miso, would work the same magic on a steak. My steak was darker and it had that waxy look of dry aged meat; it was tasty, but didn't really taste like dry-aged beef.
