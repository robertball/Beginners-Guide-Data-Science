Directions for Meatballs
In your a KitchenAid®Stand Mixer add all ingredients and set to the stir setting and mix for about 1 minute. Just until all ingredients is incorporate. Lean over and smell the delicious mixture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F
Take a large baking sheet and line with foil (for easy clean up) and roll out meatballs to your desired size. I like a medium size (an ice cream scoop works well). Set on baking sheet and place in your preheated oven for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile prepare you tomato sauce and let simmer until meatballs are done.
Add meatballs into the sauce, lower to simmer for at least 30 minutes. If you can keep them longer that is even better. If you don’t want to leave on your stove top lower your oven to 200 degrees F and let them hang out for 1 hour.
In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet with fairly high sides, heat the oil over high heat until just smoking. Add the balls, a few at a time, and cook until they are uniformly golden brown. Remove with a spider or slotted spoon and keep warm while the remaining meatballs are cooked.
Serve the meatballs in the hot sauce, with the basil leaves sprinkled over as garnish.
Directions for Tomato Sauce
In a Le Creuset French Oven , heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Add in tomato paste, oregano, basil, parsley, salt and pepper stirring often. Lower the heat to simmer and wait to add in meatballs!

Description: 
Today I wanted to use my new KitchenAid®Stand Mixer and was planning on making meatballs. Then I spotted the fresh ricotta, beef and veal at D&D; Market 
I love to add either parmesan or romano to my meatball mixture! It is so easy grating a block of cheese with my Edgeware grater .
