Ingredients:
16 ounces cavatappi pasta
4 T olive oil
3 zucchini, cubed into 1/2" cubes
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1" cubes
1 teaspoon dried marjoram, crumbled
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups chicken broth
1 can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup frozen corn, thawed
4 thinly sliced green onions
12 ounces grated Pepper Jack Cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Drain.
Heat 2 T of olive oil into a large skillet over medium high heat.  Add zucchini and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Add salt to taste and toss well.  Transfer to small bowl with slotted spoon.
Add remaining 2 T of olive to skillet.  Add chicken and marjoram and saute 2 minutes.  Add garlic and reduce heat to medium and saute until chicken is thoroughly cooked. Salt to taste and then return heat to high.  Add chicken broth and bring to boil, scraping browned bits from pan.
Add pasta, zucchini, garbanzo beans and corn to chicken mixture.  Cook until pasta has absorbed most of the liquid, about 4 minutes.
Remove from heat and pour pasta mixture into a very large serving bowl.  Add green onions, grated cheese and Parmesan and mix well.  Cover and let stand one minute.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
My kids' favorite pasta recipe - tweaked over the years from a recipe I found in Bon Appetit.  The kids love the chicken, pasta and cheese, but also scarf up the vegetables.
