Ingredients:
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 medium yellow onion, diced (about 3/4 cups)
1 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground ancho chile pepper (plus more to make it spicier)
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried mexican oregano
1 15-ounce cans black beans, rinsed
1/2 cup chicken stock (or water)
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Add ground chile, cumin and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds more. Add beans, chicken stock, and tomato paste; stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are heated through and the sauce is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Serve warm.
