Ingredients:
8 pcs thinly sliced pork (shogayaki cut)
2 sliced cheese (singles)
8 pcs perilla leaves (shiso)
2-3 pcs pickled plum (umeboshi)
salt
pepper
8 pcs shumai wrappers
2 stalks celery
10 grams semi-dried baby sardines (shirasu)

Directions:
Wash the shiso then soak it in cold water. Take the seeds from the umeboshi then mash. Slice the cheese into 8 strips.
Lay flat the pork then spread some salt and pepper on it. Get a small amount if umeboshi then spread it over the pork. Put a slice of cheese and 1 piece of shiso on top then roll the pork.
Wrap the pork with the shumai wrapper then dampen the edges to enclose. This will prevent the pork rolls from opening during the cooking process. Do this process until you consume all the ingredients.
Slice thecelery thinly then arrange it at the bottom of a microwave-save plate/bowl. This will prevent the pork from sticking at the bottom of the plate after cooking. Spread the baby sardines on top.
Arrange the wrapped pork rolls on top and make sure that there's a space in between to prevent it from sticking together.
Cover or wrap the plate then put in the microwave and cook for 8 minutes using 600W. Keep it covered for 5 minutes before opening then you can serve.

Description: 
In Japan, pork, cheese and perilla leaves (shiso) are a common food combo. It can be cooked in many ways. I've tried rolling the ingredients together and wrapping it with some leftover shumai wrappers that I have on the fridge and steamed it in the microwave. The wrappers served as an agent so the pork rolls won't open while cooking and it worked well. It's delicious.
