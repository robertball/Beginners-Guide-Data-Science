Ingredients:
Spice Rub
2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
4-6 bone in, skin on chicken thighs, cleaned and thoroughly dried

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Sprinkle and rub spices on back and front of the chicken thighs.
Place in 9 x 13 x 3 cake pan, skin up with minimum of 1" space around each thigh.
If you're looking for a lower fat outcome, place thighs on a rack inside of the pan to keep the chicken from sitting in the rendered fat.
Bake for 45 minutes, basting once at 20 minutes.
