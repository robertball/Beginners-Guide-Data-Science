Ingredients:
1 lb. hamburger meat
cup shreaded carrots
1 small head cabbage or 1/2 large (shread or chop) (leave a little for topping)
1 can sloppy joe mix
salt & pepper to taste
Topping:
1/2 cup each, shreadded carrots & cabbage
1/2 cup shreadded cheese (we like american chesse the best)

Directions:
brown hamburger meat, drain and set aside.  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 1 1/2 quart square casserole dish, rub the bottom with a very small amount of shortening so the cabbage won't stick.  Layer 1/2 of the shreadded cabbage and 1 cup of shreadded carrots, making sure you have a decent layer of both.  Mix the sloppy joe mix with hamburger and pour on top. Salt and Pepper if desired.  Mix all topping ingredients and sprinkle on top of meat mixture.  Cover and bake for 30-40 minutes or until carrots and cabbage are tender to taste.
Helpful Hints:  Can use 2 full cans of sloppy joe mix depending on desired consistency and tangyness.  We also use more cheese and completely cover the top.  It's all a matter of your taste.  My husband loves it!

Description: 
Easy and delicious if you like cabbage.  I got this from a friend who threw this together one evening because she didn't have time to shop, she had this stuff on hand.  She used spaghetti sauce, I like canned sloppy joe mix.
