Ingredients:
3/4 cup stone-ground cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tsp. baking powder
2 tbsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 1/4 cup skim milk
1 1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek-style yogurt, divided
2 tbsp. vegetable or canola oil, plus more for the griddle
4 egg whites
1/4 cup honey, or more to taste
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, WHISK together the cornmeal, both flours, baking powder, sugar and salt.
In a medium bowl, WHISK together the milk, 1/4 cup of the yogurt and the oil.  ADD the dry ingredients and stir until blended.
In another medium bowl, use and electric mixer to BEAT the egg whites to stiff peaks.  Gently FOLD the egg whites into the batter.
Lightly oil a large, heavy nonstick skillet or griddle.  Heat the skillet or grill over medium.  Working in batches, use about a 1/4 cup of batter per pancake to make 12 pancakes.  Cook until browned and puffed, about 5 minutes per side.  Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.  Repeat with remaining batter.
Meanwhile, to make the topping, in a small bowl, whisk together the honey, cinnamon and remaining 1 cup of yogurt.
Serve the pancakes with the yogurt topping spooned on top.
