Place the smoked pork into a large pot and fill with enough water to cover. Season with salt and pepper, cover and  bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes.
Add the carrots, potato, cabbage and onions; cover and continue to simmer. Use kitchen string to tie the green beans into a bundle. Add them to the pot, cover and continue to cook until the carrots and potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes.
