Ingredients:
BBQ SAUCE FOR MEAT:
1 pound pork or chicken (suggest chops or breasts)
1/2 cup ketchup
2 T sugar
2 T vegetable oil
1 T Hoisin sauce
1 T sherry or white wine
pinch salt
1 clove garlic, minced
ING FOR MAIN DISH
3 T soy sauce
5 t rice vinegar
2 t sesame oil (scant)
1/4 t sugar
12 oz Chinese BBQ meat, (1/2 diced, 1/2 sliced)
1/2 cup frozen peas
1 carrot, diced
1 head baby bok choy, halved lengthwise then sliced crosswise
4 large eggs, lightly beaten
6 cups cold cooked rice
2 scallion, thinly sliced

Directions:
1.  Prepare BBQ sauce, add meat (recommend keeping whole), and let marinade at least 1 hr and up to 12. Cook as desired.  I used 2 large whole pork chops, then seared them, let them rest, and then prepared for stir fry recipe.
1. In a small bowl, stir the soy sauce with the rice vinegar, sesame oil and sugar.
2. Heat a very large skillet. Add the oil. Add the diced pork and stir-fry over high heat for 1 minute. Add the peas, carrot and bok choy and stir-fry until tender. Add the eggs and scramble just until set.
3. Stir in the cooked rice, scallions, soy sauce mixture and pepper and stir-fry until the rice is hot. Remove from the heat and season with salt.
4.  Spoon the fried rice into bowls, top with the sliced pork and pickled ginger and serve.

Description: 
Original recipe by Takashi Yagihashi - F&W Best New Chef 2000; My only change was having to make up my own recipe for BBQ meat.  He used BBQ pork, but may substitute chicken just as easily.  Recipe for BBQ sauce for meat of your choice included.  May alter veggies to mushrooms, bean sprouts, baby corn, etc.
