Ingredients:
3/4 cup vegan dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup aquafaba (chickpea water)
1 tablespoon white sugar

Directions:
Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
Beat aquafaba in a stand mixer on high speed until firm peaks form, 10 to 15 minutes. Add sugar gradually into the mixture while continuing to beat. Fold in cooled chocolate gently.
Spoon mousse into small glass cups and chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving.

Description: 
This is a delicious and light chocolate mousse that is simple to make. It's made with canned chickpea liquid but you wouldn't know it. There's no chickpea taste - just fluffy, smooth, chocolate goodness! Top chocolate mousse with chocolate chips, shaved chocolate, raspberries, pistachios, or whatever you like.
