Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) can Of Beer
3 pounds pork roast (Bone in)
1 Med Onion minced
2 cloves Garlic Minced
2 tablespoon fresh Rosemary (minced)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper
1/8 teaspoon of crushed red pepper
1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce
12 hamburger rolls

Directions:
Prepare your Roast by stabbing it several times with a Knife or Fork, and place in a 1 gal storage bag
Mince your onions, Rosemary and garlic (I use a food processor)
Place in the bag with the Roast, add salt, pepper and crushed red pepper
Pour the beer over the roast and seal the bag, Let it marinate in the fridge for 2-4 hrs (Over night is better)
Pour it all in the slow cooker and let it cook on low for 8-10 hrs, after 6hrs, remove the bone (My dog begs for it) if it is ready to pull apart you can pull it apart now and leave it in the juice, then let it finish cooking for 1-2 hrs..
Use your tongs to remove it to a serving dish, I normally add about 1/2 of the BBQ at this time mixing it in with my hands giving it time to soak in a little before eating
Save the broth to make sure it doesn't dry out
