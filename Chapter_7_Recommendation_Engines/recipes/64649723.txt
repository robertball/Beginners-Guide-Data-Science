Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup buttermilk powder (I use Bob's Red Mill)
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter (1/2 stick), melted
1 3/4 cups water or milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and buttermilk powder.
In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs and slowly trickle in the melted butter, then add the water or milk. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients all at once, stirring just to blend. The batter should be slightly lumpy and quite thick. Let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Pour 1/4-cup portions of batter onto the hot griddle, spacing them apart. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles cover the surface of the pancakes and their undersides are lightly browned. Gently turn them over and cook for about 2 minutes more, until the other sides are browned.
Makes 24 (4-inch) pancakes, serves 4

Description: 
I took inspiration from Bette's Oceanview Diner's buttermilk pancake recipe, but I use powdered buttermilk so I can make a batch of mix to use even when I don't have fresh buttermilk available.
