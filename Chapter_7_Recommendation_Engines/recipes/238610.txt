Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
8 ounces bulk mild Italian sausage
1/2 cup diced white onion
1 (24 ounce) jar ClassicoÂ® Fresh Four Cheese Sauce, divided
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously oil the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix together the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large bowl. Add onion, half of the jar of four-cheese red sauce, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and parsley. Mix until well blended.
Divide mixture into 4 oval mini loaves; place in prepared baking dish. Pour the remaining red sauce over tops of meat loaves.
Spray the underside of a large piece of foil with nonstick cooking spray; cover dish tightly.
Bake for 45 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle loaves with shredded mozzarella cheese.
