Ingredients:
4 poblano peppers
3 medium potatoes, chopped
1 large sweet onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup peanut butter
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
1 pinch dried oregano
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place the peppers on a plate, and cook in the microwave for about 5 minutes, until just pliable. Do not peel. Set aside to cool.
Place the potatoes and onion into a large glass or ceramic dish, and add a few tablespoons of water. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap, and cook in the microwave until the potatoes are beginning to soften and the onions are transparent, 8 to 10 minutes. Uncover, and stir. Set aside to cool slightly while you start the sauce.
In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes and peanut butter. Process until smooth, then pour into a saucepan. Stir in the garlic, cumin and oregano. Warm over low heat, and cover with a lid to avoid spattering. Cook for about 15 minutes to blend the flavors together.
Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.  Mix the cheese into the potatoes and onions. Slit the peppers down one side, and fill with the potato mixture. I like to leave the seeds in because the peppers have more flavor that way, but you can take them out if you like. Brush the peppers with olive oil.
Grill peppers for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the outsides are slightly charred. Cut in half to serve, and spoon the sauce over them.

Description: 
A loose interpretation of the wonderful Mexican dish, vegetarian and non-greasy but very savory. Totally lacking in heat for families, but drop a chipotle or two into the sauce if you're cooking for masochists.
