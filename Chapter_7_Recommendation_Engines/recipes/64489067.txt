Ingredients:
10 oz. Pasta (long pasta such as Spaghetti or Angel Hair)
½ Cup Gruyère Cheese (grated)
One Diced Tomato
¼ Cup Butter
¼ Cup All-purpose Flour
1¾ Cup Heavy Cream
Two Pots of Water
One Small Head of Broccoli
¼ tsp White Pepper (or to taste)
Two Shallots

Directions:
Slice the broccoli into florets and bring a pot of water to a boil. Once it is boiling, steam the broccoli florets with a steamer for about five minutes.
Bring another pot of water to a boil and add long pasta, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.
Melt the butter in another pot. Once the butter is melted, add the shallots and cook for a minute. After that, add the flour; stirring the whole time.
Once the flour and butter are cooked for about a minute, add the heavy cream in one stream. Continue stirring! Once you have an even white sauce mixture, add the grated Gruyère cheese and melt it in.
Dice the tomato and set it aside. When the pasta is done (depending on the shape of pasta you use, the cooking time will vary), strain it and put it into a bowl.
Once everything is done, add the steamed broccoli on the side of the bowl, add the diced tomatoes to the bowl, sprinkle white pepper into sauce, and pour sauce over everything.
Mix the sauce in well and then serve!

Description: 
I love pasta and I love cheesy sauces. While I don't think this is as good as my Simple Pasta Alfredo recipe, this is still really good and is a nice addition to any pasta dinner.
