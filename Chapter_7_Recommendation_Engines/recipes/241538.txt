1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup basmati rice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups chicken broth

1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup whole-kernel corn
2 teaspoons green onions, chopped
1 lime, zested

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir rice and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken broth, lime juice, and salt into rice; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Stir cilantro, corn, green onions, and lime zest into rice until well-mixed.
