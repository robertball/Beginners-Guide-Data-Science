Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 1/2 cups chicken broth, divided
1 head broccoli, chopped
1/2 cup fat-free half-and-half
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add butter and stir until melted. Add onion and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice and pour in 1 1/4 cup chicken broth or as much as needed to cover rice. Close and lock the lid. Select rice setting according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add chopped broccoli and stir to combine. If rice looks dry, add remaining 1/4 cup chicken broth. Close lid and seal the vent. Select steam and set the timer for 5 minutes.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Pour in half-and-half, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, pepper, and 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese. Stir to combine.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease an 8-inch square casserole dish.
Transfer broccoli mixture to the prepared casserole dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese. Broil until cheese is golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This delicious broccoli side dish cooks in the Instant Pot®. Although optional, I love transferring it to a casserole dish and broiling it to give it a crunchy golden cheese top. If you don't want to do this, then stir in all the cheese into the mixture.
