Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 cup corn syrup
2 cups peanut butter
6 cups corn flakes
1 cup semisweet chocolate morsels

Directions:
Place sugar, syrup and peanut butter in large bowl and microwave at full power for two minutes.  Remove and stir. Continue cooking and stirring at one minute intervals until mixture is smooth and sugar granules dissolved.
Immediately add corn flakes and stir until well coated. Drop by small spoonfuls on waxed paper.
Microwave chocolate chips just until melted. Poor melted chocolate into a pastry bag or improvise with a sturdy plastic bag with 1/8" snipped off the corner. Drizzle chocolate over peanut butter clusters.  Allow to cool; store in airtight container, preferably in the refrigerator.

Description: 
Cornflakes and peanut butter go beyond breakfast in these chewy, no-bake treats. The nuns at my Catholic school used to make this recipe as bars, but I find they're difficult to cut once cooled, so instead I drop the mixture in small clusters on waxed paper. Kids love them!
