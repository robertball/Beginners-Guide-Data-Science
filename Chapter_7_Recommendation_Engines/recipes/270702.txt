Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon chili crisp oil sauce
1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 teaspoon white sugar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large shallot, finely chopped
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped
6 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix shrimp with salt and baking soda; let sit for 15 minutes.
Combine mayonnaise, soy sauce, chili crisp, gochujang, and sugar in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Drain spaghetti. Rinse shrimp with cool water and pat dry with paper towels.
Warm oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Cook and stir shallot, garlic, and ginger for 1 minute. Add shrimp and cook until bright pink and opaque, 4 to 5 minutes. Add scallions and cook for 1 minute longer.
Pour the chili crisp sauce over the shrimp. Mix in the cooked spaghetti and toss until evenly coated.
