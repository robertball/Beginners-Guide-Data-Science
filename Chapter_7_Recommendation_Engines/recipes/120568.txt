Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
Dash salt
1 cup finely chopped pecans
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and cream cheese until light and fluffy. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, sugar and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture. Stir in pecans (dough will be crumbly).
Shape tablespoonfuls into 2-in. logs. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned. Carefully roll warm cookies in confectioners' sugar; cool on wire racks.

Description: 
These melt-in-your-mouth cookies are one of my mom's specialties. Made with cream cheese and butter, they're very rich...and the pecans add wonderful flavor. They're great with hot cup of coffee or a tall glass of milk.                                                                --Jeanne Voss                                                        Anaheim Hills, California
