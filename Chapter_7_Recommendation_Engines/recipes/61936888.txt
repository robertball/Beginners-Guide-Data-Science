Ingredients:
3 large leeks
1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
6 eggs
1/4 cup lowfat milk
2 Tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 tsp. salt
freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Cut the roots off the leeks. Cut off all but about 3 inches of the dark green part and discard. Make a vertical cut down the length of the leeks almost through to the back. Wash the leeks very thoroughly under cold running water, separating the leaves to reveal any hidden dirt. Pat the leeks dry, then thinly slice them, discarding any tough green part if necessary. You should have about 3 1/2 cups.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch pie plate and set aside.
Melt the tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and saute, stirring often, until tender, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Beat in the milk, cheese, salt, and pepper; then stir in the leeks. Pour this mixture into the pie plate.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or just until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Do not overcook. Serve immediately.
