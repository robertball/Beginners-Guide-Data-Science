Ingredients:
4 cups unbleached flour
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 egg, beaten
2 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup ice water

Directions:
Place flour in a large bowl. Cut in shortening and butter until mixture is crumbly.
In a separate bowl, mix together egg, sugar, salt, and lemon juice. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Pour in all of egg mixture and half of ice water. Stir gently with a fork, adding more water as needed, just until mixture forms a ball.
Turn dough onto a floured surface and cut into 4 equal portions. Knead each piece briefly and shape into a disc. Chill 1 hour before rolling out.
