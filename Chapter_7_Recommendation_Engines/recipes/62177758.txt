Ingredients:
1 green bell peppers
salt to taste
1/4 pound ground beef
chopped onion to taste
salt and pepper to taste
1 Tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup instant rice
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 small can tomatoe sauce
water as needed

Directions:
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off  the peppers, and remove the seeds. Cook peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain. Sprinkle salt inside each pepper, and set aside.
In a large skillet, saute beef, garlic and onions for 5 minutes, or until beef is browned. Drain off excess fat, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in 1/2 can tomatoe sauce, rice, and Worcestershire sauce. Remove from heat, and stir in the cheese.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (175 degrees C). Stuff each pepper with the beef and rice mixture, and place peppers open side up in a baking dish.    Combine remaining tomato sauce with just enough water to make the soup a gravy consistency. Pour over the peppers.
Bake covered for 25 to 35 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.
