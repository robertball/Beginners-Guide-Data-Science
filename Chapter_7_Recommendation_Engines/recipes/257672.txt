Ingredients:
1 1/3 pounds veal medallions
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup Marsala wine
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface; pound to 1/4-inch thickness with the smooth side of a meat mallet. Pat dry with a paper towel and dust with flour on both sides.
Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it starts to foam. Add veal; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Season with salt. Transfer veal to a plate. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Pour Marsala wine into the same skillet. Stir to scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes.
Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until cornstarch dissolves. Stir into the Marsala wine in the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
Return veal to the skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve topped with sauce.
