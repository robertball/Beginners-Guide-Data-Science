Ingredients:
2+ lbs of Country Style Pork Ribs, Loin Chops (pork FAT is Good!)
8 C H2O
2 1/2 C Steel Cut (John McCann Steel Cut Irish Oats - in the white tin)
20+ Bay Leaves (it's ALL about the Bay Leaves!)
1 large Onion
2 tsp Salt
2-3 tsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper

Directions:
In a 4 Qt Dutch Oven (or heavy pot with a tight fitting lid) Gently boil the pork in 8 C. H2O and 10 Bay Leaves.
Cool and remove Pork, discard Bay Leaves.
Strain Liquid for particulate matter.
Add Salt and Pepper.
Add 10 NEW Bay Leaves and the Oatmeal.
Bring to a rolling boil on the stove and boil for 10-20 mins. Stir constantly.
Cover and move to a 250F Oven.
Finely grind (food processor) onion and add to Oats
Add Salt & Pepper.
In a food mill, Grind the cooked pork (with ALL the fat) and reserve.
After 1 hr, the Oatmeal will be thick and glisen from the fat.
Stir in all the ground Pork.
Adjust seasonings - Salt and pepper.  (Go Easy on the Salt!)
Cook until the Oats are fully cooked (2-3 hrs.)
Cool and PACK into loaf pans.
Chill and slice (1/4") and fry in Canola Oil (here's the "healthy" part!) until Golden Brown.
Resist turning too soon!  The Goetta will fall apart and make a BIG mess in the frying pan.
Freezes well, either whole loaves or sliced.
