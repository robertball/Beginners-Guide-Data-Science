Ingredients:
1 1/2 Lbs. ground round ( 85% )
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 rounded tsp. jar minced garlic
1 28 oz. can plum tomatoes
2  16 oz. cans Brooks hot chili beans
1 Tbsp. salt
1 1/2 tsp. chili powder
1/2 tsp. cumin
Uncle Ben's whole grain brown rice (8.8 microwave)

Directions:
Saute onion in a little olive oil till tender. Add garlic and hamburger and brown meat. Drain at least 1/2
of liquid or more,(you decide). Drain liquid from the can of tomatoes into pot and add meat mixture. Chop tomatoes fine and add to pot. Start to heat pot on medium and add both cans of beans. stir in salt, chili powder and cumin. Microwave rice per instructions and add 1/2 of package to the pot. Chili should be simmering by now, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 2 hrs. I always reheat in crock pot next day as I believe chili always tastes better the 2nd day. Serve with any sides you prefer, cheese, fritos. crackers, sour cream
