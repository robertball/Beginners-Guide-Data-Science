Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground black pepper
1 medium head cabbage, shredded
1 cup grated Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, blend milk, flour, butter, salt and pepper. Stir constantly until a thick white sauce has formed.
In a separate medium saucepan over boiling water, steam cabbage until tender but firm.
In a small baking dish, alternate layers of sauce, cabbage and Romano cheese.
Bake approximately 30 minutes, until sauce and cheese are bubbly.
