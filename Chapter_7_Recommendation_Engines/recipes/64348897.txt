Ingredients:
1 package Extra Firm Tofu
2 Tbls Lemon Juice
1 Tbls Red Wine Vinegar
1 clove garlic
1/4 tsp salt
1-2 Tbls of water for consistency

Directions:
My box of Tofu was a 12oz package, you only need about 8oz for this recipe so cut off 1/4 of the block and save it for later use.  Drain the tofu well and add everything to a blender.  Be sure to stop and scrape down the sides occasionally.  If it seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of water until it reaches a sour cream-like consistency.
This should make about 1 cup of Tofu Sour Cream.
