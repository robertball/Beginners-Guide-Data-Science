Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/2 cup unsalted sunflower seeds
1 cup canned chickpeas, drained
1/4 cup diced red onion
1 beaten egg
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt-free herb seasoning blend
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 slices mild Cheddar cheese
1 pita bread round
1/4 cup prepared Ranch salad dressing
2 leaves romaine lettuce
1 medium tomato, thinly sliced
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced

Directions:
Place walnuts and sunflower seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
In a medium bowl, mash garbanzo beans with a fork, or chop in a food processor. Stir in the onion, egg, parsley, and toasted nuts. Season with pepper and seasoning blend, and mix well.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Divide the bean mixture into 2 patties, and fry in the hot oil for about 3 minutes on each side, or until well browned and heated through. Place a slice of cheese over each patty, and remove from heat.
Place the pita round in the same dry skillet the nuts were in, and heat for about 1 minute on each side. Cut the round in half, spread ranch dressing inside of each, and line the pockets with romaine leaves. Place a cheesy patty into each one, and top with sliced tomato and avocado. Serve with tortilla or potato chips.

Description: 
These no nonsense nut burgers are great. I have yet to find a recipe or a restaurant that makes as good of a version. Serve with chips... tortilla, blue corn, sweet potato, or other veggie chips. Use whichever types of nuts you like, or have handy such as pecans, walnut, hazelnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, or any combination of nuts you might like.
