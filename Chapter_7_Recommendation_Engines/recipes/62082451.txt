Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil or unsalted butter
1/2 small onion, 1 medium scallion, or 1 medium shallot, chopped fine
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves, basil, dill, tarragon or mint
2 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano, up to 1/3 cup, or any grated cheese (1/2 to 1 ounce)
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 large eggs, lightly beaten

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Heat oil or butter in 10-inch nonstick, ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Swirl skillet to distribute evenly over bottom and sides. Add onions and saut√© until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in herbs.
3. Meanwhile, stir cheese, salt, and pepper into eggs.
4. Pour mixture into skillet; stir lightly with fork until eggs start to set.  Once bottom is firm, use thin, nonmetallic spatula to lift frittata edge closest to you. Tilt skillet slightly toward you so that uncooked egg runs underneath. Return skillet to level position and swirl gently to evenly distribute egg. Continue cooking about 40 seconds, then lift edge again, repeating process until egg on top is no longer runny.
5. Transfer skillet to oven; bake until frittata top is set and dry to touch, 2 to 4 minutes, making sure to remove frittata as soon as top is just set.
6. Run spatula around skillet edge to loosen frittata; invert onto serving plate. Serve warm, at room temperature, or chilled.
