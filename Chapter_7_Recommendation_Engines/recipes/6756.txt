Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 tablespoons margarine, softened
1 1/2 tablespoons dried oregano
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Sprinkle yeast over water in large bowl.  Let stand a few minutes, then stir and dissolve yeast.  Add sugar, salt, margarine, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano and 3 cups of the flour.  Beat at slow speed for 2 minutes.  Beat in rest of flour; cover the bowl with a sheet of wax paper and a kitchen towel.  Let rise in a warm place 45 minutes, or until doubled in volume.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease one round, 2-quart casserole.  Set aside.
Stir batter down for 1/2 a minute.  Turn batter into casserole.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 minutes.
