Raspberry and Chocolate Jam Recipe

Ingredients:
3 pints fresh raspberries
3 c sugar
Juice of one lemon
9 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine

Directions:
In a large heavy pan or preserving pan, heat the raspberries and sugar until the sugar has dissolved.
Run the raspberry mixture through a food mill’s smallest disc, to rid the sauce of the seeds. Some will remain. C’est la vie.
Put the strained mixture back into the preserving pan, add the lemon, and heat it to just below boiling.
Add the chopped chocolate and stir well until the chocolate is melted. If you can, allow the mixture to sit for an hour or two or six.
Bring the mixture back up to a boil. Boil hard for five minutes. Do not stop stirring.
Turn off the heat, wait two or three minutes, and see if the surface wrinkles when pushed gently. If it’s not ready, turn the heat back on and test again after two minutes of a hard boil and another two minutes of resting. Continue to heat and rest and test until you get a soft set and it passes the wrinkle test.
Ladle into sterilized jars, place lids and rings, and process for ten minutes in a boiling water bath.
