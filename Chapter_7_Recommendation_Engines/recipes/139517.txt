Description: 
An Aeggekage is a traditional Danish oven pancake, usually served as a buffet item or as a dessert for a family holiday meal.  It is a light, cake-like dish that is not too sweet and absolutely delicious with fresh seasonal berries and fresh whipped cream! (Think of it as a sweetened Yorkshire pudding). Just make sure you serve immediately, this pancake does not do well cold nor is it a good leftover.  But chances are you won't have any remaining Aeggekage to worry about!
