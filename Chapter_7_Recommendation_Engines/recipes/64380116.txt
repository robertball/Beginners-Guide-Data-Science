Ingredients:
12 ounces of buttermilk biscuit dough
6 eggs
1 (2 3/4 ounce) package peppered gravy mix (makes 2 cups)
1 lb sausage, any flavor (I prefer sage or zesty Italian)
1 cup cheese, shredded (I like to use cheddar blend)
1/2 cup milk
salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F Take a 13 x 9 pan and spray with cooking spray (or smear with butter). Cut biscuit dough into 1" pieces and place evenly in the bottom of the pan.
Brown the sausage and drain. Scatter the browned sausage over the biscuit pieces, then top with shredded cheese.
Whisk the eggs and milk with a pinch of salt and pepper, then pour over the pan.
Make gravy according to instructions on package and pour over the pan. Bake for 30 - 45 minutes, depending on how hot your oven runs.
Cut and serve. It's delicious warm right out of the oven!
