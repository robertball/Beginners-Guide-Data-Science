Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1/2 cup warm water
Filling:
1 1/2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons garam masala
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon chile powder
1/2 cup corn, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup frozen peas, or to taste
1/4 cup coconut milk
1 cup vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Sift flour into a bowl. Add ghee and caraway seeds. Mix and gradually stir in enough water to form a firm dough. Knead on a floured surface until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for 30 minutes.
Heat ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chile powder. Cook and stir until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add corn, peas, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil. Remove filling from heat and cool to room temperature.
Roll dough on a floured surface to 1/16-inch thickness. Cut into 3 3/4-inch rounds and place a rounded teaspoon of filling into the center of each round. Brush edges with water and press together using your finger or a samosa presser.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Deep-fry samosas until browned, about 5 minutes per batch.

Description: 
A samosa presser is available from Asian grocery stores, but I use a dumpling press and it works just as well. I love these tasty treats and they are always gobbled up quickly.
