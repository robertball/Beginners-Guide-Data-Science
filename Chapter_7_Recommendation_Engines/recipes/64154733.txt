Ingredients:
5 pounds Small Fresh Beets
1 cup Water Reserved From Cooking Beets
2 cup Granulated Sugar
4 cups White Vinegar
1-½ teaspoon Pickling Salt
1/2 teaspoons Ground Cloves

Directions:
Sterilize canning jars and lids according to manufacturer’s directions.
Remove stems from beets and place in a large pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook until beets are tender, about 20-25 minutes depending on the size. Drain, reserving  the beet water. Cool, peel and slice the beets.
Fill each jar with beets, leaving about 1/2 inch head space.
Strain the beet water through a fine mesh strainer.
Combine 1 cup of  beet water, sugar, vinegar, pickling salt and cloves. Bring to a rapid boil. Pour the hot brine over the beets in the jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space.
Seal the jars with lids and rings just until hand tight. Process in a hot water bath canner for 30 minutes. Remove the jars from the canner and let sit undisturbed until cool. If any jars fail to seal, refrigerate for immediate use.
Makes about 5 pints.
For the best flavour, allow pickled beets to set for two weeks before eating.
This makes 6   16 ounce jars.

Beautifully coloured and not overly spicy. This is how my mom always made hers and I continue the tradition.
