Description: 
This sugar cookie recipe has been in my mother's family recipe book for years.  It is the only sugar cookie recipe that my family will eat.  I tried another recipe last year and heard nothing but complaints like Hey! This isn't Mom's recipe!  So here is the basic tried and true recipe that I will stick to.  I made hundreds of these every year to send out to every member of my family.
