Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef (95% lean)
1/4 cup low-fat or regular plain Greek-style yogurt

1 small sweet onion, thinly sliced
1 small zucchini, thinly sliced

4 whole-grain hamburger buns, split, toasted
Fresh spinach leaves

Directions:
Combine yogurt and 1/4 cup tapenade in small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Combine ground beef and remaining 1/4 cup tapenade in large bowl, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Lightly shape into four 1/2-inch thick patties.
Heat grill pan over medium heat until hot. Place patties in pan; cook 10 to 12 minutes until instant-read thermometer inserted horizontally into center registers 160 degrees F, turning occasionally. Season with pepper, as desired. Remove; keep warm.
