Ingredients:
2 Large carrots, peeled and diced
2 Large potatoes, peeled and diced
1 Medium Spanish onion diced
3 Stalks of celery, diced
1 or 2 Cloves of garlic, chopped fine
1 TBS Olive Oil
3- 14 1/2 oz cans Garden Vegetable Broth
2 Soy "chickenless" breast,(this can be left out or substituted with tofu), diced
1 1/2 C. Fresh green beans, cut into inch sized pieces
Handful of baby spinach
2 TBS Butter
3 TBS Flour
1 C. Whole milk
Salt and Pepper to taste

Directions:
Sweat the carrots, potatoes, celery and onion in the Olive Oil until translucent.
Add the garlic and saute it until you can smell it.
Add the vegetable stock and let simmer for approx. 15 mins until the carrots and potato are tender.
Add the diced "chicken" or tofu, green beans and spinach.
Continue simmering while making the roux.
Melt the butter and then add the flour.
Cook the roux for about a minute stirring constantly then add the cold milk.
Continuing cooking until the milk mixture until it comes to a boil and thickens,(use a wisk for this step).
Add the milk mixture to the soup and bring it back to a simmer.
Let simmer for about 10 more minutes and then add salt and pepper to taste.
This will thicken up more if put in the fridge overnight! It's even better the next day!

Description: 
I have 5 kids, but only one, (my oldest), is a vegetarian! I typically make her meals the same as ours, minus the meat. Here is a yummy recipe I created for her!
The reason I call it soup/stew is because the longer it sits, the thicker it gets!
