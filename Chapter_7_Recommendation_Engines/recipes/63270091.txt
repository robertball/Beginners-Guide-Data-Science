Chicken Cherry Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped scallions (sub. w/red onion)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or slivered almonds, toasted
1/2 cup dried tart cherries or dried cranberries
1/3 cup mayonnaise (more if desired)
1 TBS dried parsley (1/3 cup if using fresh)
1 TBS fresh lemon juice
1 tsp hot pepper sauce
1 tsp dry mustard
1 TBS tarragon
1/4 tsp curry
1/2 tsp cumin

Directions:
Cook chicken in boiling water and dice when cooled.  I bring the water to a boil with the chicken in it and remove from the heat when it comes to a boil.  I leave the chicken in the water 10 - 15 minutes then remove from the water to cool.  This method does cook the chicken but does not dry it out.
Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and let sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld and soften up the dried fruit.
Place a scoop of the salad on top of a piece of lettuce on a bun, bread or wrap it in a flour tortilla.  Enjoy!

Description: 
I took parts from three different chicken salad recipes and added a few of my own ingredients.  I always get compliments and asked for the recipe.  So, I finally decided to post it.
