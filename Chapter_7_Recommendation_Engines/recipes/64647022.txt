Ingredients:
1 cup quick oats
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 and 1/2 tsp cinnamon
scant 1/2 tsp kosher salt
2 tbsp butter, melted and cooled
1 tsp vanilla
1 large egg
1/2 cup honey
1/2 to 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper
Pull out two medium bowls, one for dry ingredients and one for wet.
In one bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
Melt the butter in the other bowl. Let it cool slightly.
Whisk in the vanilla, then the egg, then the honey.
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and use a wooden spoon to stir until they just come together.
Fold about half of the chocolate chips into the dough.
Freeze the dough for about 15 mins (or refrigerate for 30).
Use your hands to shape the dough into about 15 cookies and place on the tray.
At this point, the recipe says to put the cookies in then add the remaining chocolate chips after but I like to press the chocolate chips I have left into the dough now, before putting them in to cook. It is the chef's preference really.
Bake cookies for 12-13 mins or until they just start to brown on the edges.
Here is where you would press the chocolate chips in if you haven't already, immediately after removing the cookies from the oven.
Let cool on the pan before moving the cookies to a cooling rack
