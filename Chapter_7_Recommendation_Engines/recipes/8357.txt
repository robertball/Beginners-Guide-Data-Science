Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
8 egg yolks
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
2 cups chopped walnuts
2 cups chopped pecans
2 1/2 cups raisins
1 (14 ounce) package flaked coconut
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup hot water
2 egg whites

Directions:
Bake white cake mix, following package directions, in two layers (either 8 or 9 inch).
Filling: In a double boiler, combine egg yolks, flour, 2 cups sugar and butter. Cook, stirring, until thick.
Add walnuts, pecans, raisins and coconut. Mix well. Spread filling between layers, on sides and top of cooled cake.
Icing: Combine sugar and water in a saucepan; stir until well blended. Boil slowly without stirring until mixture will spin a long thread when a little is dropped from a spoon (hold the spoon high above saucepan), or reaches 238 - 242 degrees F (114 - 117 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat egg whites with a mixer until they are stiff, but still moist. Pour hot syrup slowly over egg whites while beating. Continue until mixture is very fluffy, and will hold its shape. Spread over cake.
