Ingredients:
• 3/4 pound of small, cleaned and shelled shrimp
• 1 small bag of organic baby spinach
• 3 medium green squash or zucchini, thinly sliced
• 1-2 tablespoons of steak seasoning, such as Lawry's
• 1/4 cup of canola or vegetable oil (used for frying the zucchini)
• 3-4 teeth of garlic, minced
• Zest of one lemon
• Juice of half a lemon
• 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar
• 3-4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
• 1 tablespoon of sea salt
• Pepper to taste

Directions:
1) Wash your spinach thoroughly and pat dry with a paper towel. You can also use pre-packaged, pre-washed, organic spinach and put that in a bowl after washing and drying.
2) Shell and clean the shrimp (de-vein) or (my suggestion) get shrimp that are already cleaned. Set aside.
3) Use a mandolin (a great chef's tool), food processor, or a knife to thinly slice the zucchini and season with steak/meat seasoning.
4) Fry the chips in the canola oil until brown. Set aside and pat dry with paper towel.
5) Heat up the olive oil in a saute pan. Add the shrimp and cook for approximately one minute on each side. Add the zest, lemon juice and garlic and cook for another minute.
5) Add the balsamic vinegar, toss the mixture with the spinach and season the salad with sea salt and pepper to taste.
