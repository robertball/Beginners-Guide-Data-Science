Ingredients:
2 tablespoons of olive oil
4-5 sweet onions, sliced
1 12 ounce bottle of chili sauce
1 14 ounce can of whole berry cranberry sauce
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 egg
1 teaspoon of seasoned salt
A pinch of pepper

Directions:
1.  Heat oil in a large pot or dutch oven.  Saute onions until translucent.
2.  Once onions are cooked, pour in chili sauce and cranberry sauce.  Stir, and then bring to a boil.  Once sauce is boiling, reduce heat to medium until sauce is liquified.
3.  While sauce is cooking, combine remaining ingredients in a bowl and mix well.
4.  Once sauce has liquified, form turkey mixture into balls (about the size of a tablespoon).  Place balls into pot with sauce one by one, making sure they are covered by the sauce.  Be careful that they do not break apart.
5.  Once all of the meatballs are formed and submerged in the sauce, cook on a low heat for 1-1 1/2 hours until meatballs are cooked through completely.

Description: 
One of the earliest recipes that my mom taught me to make.  Super easy and tons of flavor.  My mom uses ground beef, but I like to make it healthier with ground turkey.  Serve with rice.  Either way it tastes wonderful.  It is the perfect meal for a cold winter night when you need something to warm you up!
