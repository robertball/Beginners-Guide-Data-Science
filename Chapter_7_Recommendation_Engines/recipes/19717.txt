1 cup butter
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup cola-flavored carbonated beverage (such as Coca-Cola®)
2 cups white sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup buttermilk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup butter, softened
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup butter
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
6 tablespoons cola-flavored carbonated beverage (such as Coca-Cola®)
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 16x20-inch baking pan or casserole dish.
Bring 1 cup butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, and 1 cup cola-flavored carbonated beverage to a boil in a saucepan; stir until smooth. Combine white sugar and flour in a bowl.
Pour the hot butter mixture over the sugar and flour; stir until well blended. Mix buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, and vanilla extract into the mixture; fold in 1 cup pecans. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 35 minutes.
Melt 1/2 cup butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, and 6 tablespoons cola-flavored carbonated beverage together in a saucepan over low heat until smooth; remove from heat. Pour confectioners' sugar into a bowl. Stir butter mixture into confectioners' sugar until frosting is smooth; fold in 1/2 cup pecans. Spread frosting over the warm cake.
