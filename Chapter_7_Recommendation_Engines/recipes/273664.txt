Ingredients:
2 cups penne pasta
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup 1% milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 cup cubed rotisserie chicken

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and cook garlic for 1 minute. Whisk in flour until a paste forms. Pour in milk and cream, whisking continuously until smooth. Stir in 3/4 of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and nutmeg. Add drained penne pasta and cooked chicken; stir to combine. Pour mixture into a casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 10 to 12 minutes.
