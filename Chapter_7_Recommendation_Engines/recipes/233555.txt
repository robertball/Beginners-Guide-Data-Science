Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
1 1/2 cups white sugar, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 cup cold butter
2 cups blueberries
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine flour, oats, 1 cup sugar, cinnamon, and baking soda in a large bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve about 2 cups flour-butter mixture. Press remaining mixture into the prepared baking dish to form a crust.
Bring blueberries, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan, stirring constantly, until mixture is thickened, about 2 minutes. Spread blueberry mixture over crust and sprinkle with reserved oat mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is just browned, about 25 minutes. Cool before cutting and serving.

Description: 
These bars are always a big hit and are a great way to use those fresh summer berries--though frozen blueberries work just as well. They're especially great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top.
