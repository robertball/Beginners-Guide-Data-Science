Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
4 bananas, sliced
1 (18.25 ounce) package banana cake mix (if you cannot find banana cake mix, get a white cake mix and some banana extract.  Use 2 tsp of the extract in the cake batter)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (8 inch) pans. Combine butter and brown sugar, divide and spread evenly between the 2 pans. Sprinkle pecans evenly over both brown sugar mixtures, arrange banana slices evenly over each.
Prepare cake mix according to package instructions. Divide batter into the 2 pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. (Watch this time...mine did not take that long... it took about 30 minutes.) Cool the cake for about 15 minutes and then turn cakes upside down on a platter or plate, gently tap bottom and carefully remove pans, replacing caramel mixture that sticks to pan.
