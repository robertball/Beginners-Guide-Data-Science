Ingredients:
For the Dal:
1 Cup Masoor lentils
1/2 cup of Chana lentils
1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
Pinch of Hing powder
Pinch of sea salt
For the Tarka:
1 medium size brown or white onion
2 cloves of garlic
1 tablespoon of oil
2 tablespoons of Ghee (clarified butter)
1/2 teaspoon of Cumin
1/2 teaspoon of brown mustard
Garnish:
Fresh Cilantro
Lime wedges

Directions:
Wash and soak Chana Dal for at least two hours. Wash Masoor Dal. Put both types of lentils into a medium saucepan and pour into salted water. Water level should be about two inches over the lentils. Add turmeric and Hing powder. Cover and simmer 30 to 40 minutes.
While lentils are cooking, chop onion and garlic into fine pieces. Heat oil and ghee, add cumin and mustard. When it starts to pop, add onion and garlic. Stir constantly over medium heat. For an authentic taste, carmelize to a very dark brown. Stir constantly, and check on your lentils to make sure they're not burning or getting too dry. Add more water if needed. Consistency should be thick, but not clumpy.
Serve dal over basmati rice, and heap on the tarka (seasoned butter sauce.) Add lime wedges and fresh coriander to garnish.
