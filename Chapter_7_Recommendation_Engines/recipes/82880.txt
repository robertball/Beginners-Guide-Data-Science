Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons minced shallot
2 tablespoons lime juice
3 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
12  fresh oysters in shells
2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the butter, cilantro, garlic, shallot, 2 tablespoons of lime juice, and sriracha sauce. Spoon onto waxed paper and roll into a log. Place into the freezer until set.
Preheat a grill for high heat.
Place whole oysters on the hot grill for 3 to 5  minutes, or until almost done. Remove the top shell from the oysters, without spilling any liqueur, and return them to the grill. Slice the butter log into 1/4 inch slices, and place a slice on top of each oyster. Grill until the butter melts, then serve on a bed of rock salt for presentation.

Description: 
This is concoction was developed by my buddy and I during a block party. We had people standing in line. Be sure to use leather gloves when shucking hot oysters. Sounds like a pain, but well worth the work.
