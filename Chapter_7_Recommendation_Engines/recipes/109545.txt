Ingredients:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup crumbled feta cheese, divided
1 (12 inch) pre-baked Italian pizza crust

1 tablespoon oil from the sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1/2 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 450 degrees. Mix mayonnaise, garlic and 1/2 cup feta in a small bowl. Place pizza crust on a cookie sheet; spread mayonnaise mixture over pizza, then top with tomatoes, olives and oregano. Bake until heated through and crisp, about 10 minutes.
Toss spinach and onion with the 1 Tb. sun-dried tomato oil. Top hot pizza with spinach mixture and remaining 1/2 cup feta cheese. Return to oven and bake until cheese melts, about 2 minutes longer. Cut into 6 slices and serve.
