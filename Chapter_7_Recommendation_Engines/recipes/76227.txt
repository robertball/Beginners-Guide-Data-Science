Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups egg whites
1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1 cup sifted cake flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Add cream of tartar and vanilla extract. Beat at high speed with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking and light corn syrup.
Sift flour and cornstarch 2 times into another large mixing bowl.  Add 3/4 cup SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend for Baking to flour mixture, stirring until blended.
Sprinkle 1/4 of the flour mixture over the egg whites. Fold gently.  Repeat procedure three times with the remaining flour mixture.
Pour batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, spreading batter evenly in pan. Cut through batter with a knife to remove air bubbles.
Bake on lowest rack in oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until cake springs back when lightly touched.
Invert tube pan; cool cake in the pan for 30 to 40 minutes.
Loosen cake from sides of pan using a narrow metal spatula; remove cake from pan.
