Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
4 egg yolks
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons cold water
1/2 cup strong brewed coffee
1 cup coffee flavored liqueur, divided
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
4 egg whites
1 cup confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. In a large measuring cup dissolve baking soda in water, then add coffee, 1/2 cup of the coffee liqueur, and vanilla.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the cocoa, then the egg yolks one at a time. Alternately beat in the flour and the coffee mixture just until incorporated.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly but carefully fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
Pour batter into a 10 inch Bundt pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack. Pierce warm cake all over with a fork and drizzle glaze a spoonful at a time over cake until it is absorbed. Wrap cake tightly with plastic wrap to preserve moisture.
To make the glaze: In a small bowl combine confectioner's sugar and remaining 1/2 cup of coffee liqueur.

Description: 
An exceptionally rich and moist chocolate cake with coffee liqueur baked in. A wonderful special dessert. A non-alcoholic version can be made by replacing the liqueur with 3/4 cup chocolate syrup mixed with 1/4 cup warm water. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. A little of the glaze may be reserved to drizzle over the topping for a nice presentation.
