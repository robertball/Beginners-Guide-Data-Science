Ingredients:
3 Lamb Racks (8 ribs each) trimmed
1 cup Hoisin Sauce
Marinade:
1 cup Onions, finely chopped
2 tablespoons Garlic, minced
3 tablespoons Lemon Juice
½ cup Honey
3 tablespoons Curry Powder
1 ½ teaspoons Cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons Coleman’s Mustard Powder
2 teaspoons Black Pepper
2 tablespoons Salt
1 cup Water

Directions:
Combine marinade; place in plastic bag with lamb in refrigerator for 48 hours, turning occasionally.
Remove lamb from marinade and let stand at room temperature.
Place in shallow roasting pan and roast at 450 for 15 to 25 minutes for rare lamb (120 degrees), depending on size.
Hoisin sauce should not be brushed on until the last 5-7 minutes of cooking to avoid a ‘burnt’ flavor.
Let rest 6 or 7 minutes before carving.
