Ingredients:
1 cup gluten free flour blend (commercially bought or your own blend, any should work well)
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste)
1/2 tsp garlic powder
3/4 to 1 cup gluten free sorghum beer (such as Redbridge)
1 large sweet yellow onion
Canola oil for frying (deep fryer recommended)
Salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in deep fryer (recommended) or tall sided sauce pan.
In a medium size bowl mix flour blend, oregano, cayenne pepper and garlic powder.  Place 4 Tablespoons of this mix aside on a plate.  Add the beaten egg to the remaining flour mix in the bowl.  Slowly add the beer, stirring well until it gets to a "pancake batter consistency".
Cut the onion into 1/4" rings and separate.  Lightly roll the onion pieces in the dry flour mix on the plate to dry out the onion pieces.  Dip the onions in the batter and let excess drip off then place in hot oil.  Fry onions about 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crisp.  Remove the onion rings from oil and place on paper towels.  Salt immediately upon removing from fryer (to taste).
