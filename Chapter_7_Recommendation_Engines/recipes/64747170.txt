Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
1 pound ground veal
Day old bread (half a loaf of Italian bread)
Milk
A shit load of garlic
Fresh basil
3 eggs (I use 1 egg per pound of meat)
Parmesan and/or Pecorino cheese (grated, not shredded)
Kosher salt
Fresh cracked pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*
Grind the bread in a food processor.
Cover the bread in milk and let sit.
Put meat in a large mixing bowl and let come to room temperature.
Grind garlic, basil and some Parmesan or pecorino in food processor.
Lightly whisk the eggs.
Add eggs to meat.
Add soaked bread to the basil, cheese and garlic and grind in food processor again just to combine (should be wet).
Add bread/basil mixture to the meat.
Add salt.
Add pepper.
Gently mix meat until all ingredients are well combined. Do not over mix.
Make your balls whatever size you like.
Place on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Do not crowd.
Bake in oven for 20-30 minutes. If I make larger balls, I cook them for 30.
These meatballs are very moist so if they are not browned in the oven they will fall apart in the sauce.
Gently add to sauce.
Be careful not to break your balls while stirring the sauce.

Description: 
I’ve slightly adapted Grammy’s meatball recipe. Made some tweaks and combined methods to keep them moist and perfect.
You can buy the meat in a single package called a meatloaf or meatball mix or you can buy them each separately. I end up using anywhere between 3-4 pounds of meat.
The essential key to good meatballs is simple:
1. Use good quality meat.
2. Use fresh basil.
3. Use fresh garlic.
4. Do not over mix.
5. Season properly.
