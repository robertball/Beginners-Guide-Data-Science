Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup butter
1-1/2 Brown Sugar
1-1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
3-6 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 small can pumpkin
1 cup diced pineapple
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream or yogurt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1-1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons baking soda
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2-1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup chopped nuts - plain, toasted,
or candied (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) or 390 degrees - convection. Grease four 7x3 inch loaf pans or prepare cupcake pans, or mini-loaf pans. In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Dust pans lightly with cinnamon and sugar mixture. (I just make an entire sugar pour jar and make it part of my normal arsenal of spices).
In a large bowl, cream butter and 3 cups sugar. Mix in eggs, mashed bananas, sour cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Mix in salt, baking soda and flour. Stir in nuts.  Divide into prepared pans. Small Loaves-about 30 minutes, cupcakes-about 25 minutes.
Bake for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let product rest for about 1/2 hour before eating.

Description: 
This recipe originates from Esther Nelson's Banana Sour Cream Bread, and although her recipe is fantastic, I found I had additional ingredients that needed to be used up. I believe in using recipes as a base and adding your own flair. I hope you enjoy it! I have friends who practically run to my house for some...YUM!Modified from: Banana Sour Cream Bread
