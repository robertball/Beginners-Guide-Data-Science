Ingredients:
12 cups 1-inch cubes sourdough bread, crust on
3 Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
3 pounds sweet Italian sausage
12 Tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter
4 1/2 cups chopped onions
3 cups chopped fresh fennel
9 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
6 large eggs beaten to blend
1 1/2 cups half-and-half, divided
1 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup fresh parsley

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread bread cubes on 2 baking sheets, bake till toasted, 10 to 15 minutes.  Set aside.
2. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Working in batches, sauté the sausage until browned - 5 to 7 minutes per batch, using remaining oil. Transfer to a large bowl.
3.  Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, fennel, garlic, salt and pepper, and sauté until the onions are golden, 10 t0 12 minutes.  Transfer to the bowl with the sausage and mix in the bread cubes.
4. Whisk the eggs, 1 cup of half-and-half, Parmesan, broth and parsley in a medium bowl.  Pour over the sausage mixture and toss to coat.  Transfer to two 9X13 inch baking pans and drizzle with remaining half-and-half.
5 Bake, covered with foil, for 25 minutes, then remove foil and bake, uncovered, 20 minutes more.
