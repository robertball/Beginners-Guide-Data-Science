Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets catfish
2 cups buttermilk
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 tablespoon onion salt
1 tablespoon steak seasoning
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
In a medium bowl, place catfish fillets in buttermilk. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 45 minutes.
In a resealable plastic bag, mix cornmeal, onion salt, and steak seasoning. One at a time, drain catfish fillets and place in the bag to coat with the cornmeal mixture.
Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Fry each fillet 7-10 minutes per side, or until exterior is lightly browned and flesh is easily flaked with a fork. Drain on paper towels.
