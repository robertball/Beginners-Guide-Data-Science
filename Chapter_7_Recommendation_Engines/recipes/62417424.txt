Ingredients:
Lamb Burgers:
1 lb ground lamb
1/2  lb ground beef
2 heaping tbsp of mint (chopped)
1 tsp ginger (minced)
2 garlic cloves (minced)
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground pepper
Tzatziki sauce:
1 pint plain low-fat greek yogurt
1/2 a lemon zest
1 garlic clove minced
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Lamb burgers:
Place ingredients in a medium to large bowl, mix together with your hands (be sure not to over mix), and form into four patties. (Patties will look large, the lamb will shrink.)
Tzatziki Sauce:
Mix ingredients together, and place in fridge.
Place burgers on med-high heated grill and cook each side for approx 3-4 minutes.
Serve burgers on store bought Cibatta rolls, with tzatziki sauce, grilled green tomatoes, thick sliced grilled onions, feta cheese (optional), and baby arugula

Description: 
These burgers are juicy and full of flavor. Even people who don't really like lamb have enjoyed these burgers. 
You can double the recipe and freeze half of the patties in wax paper to eat at a later time. Fine to place on the grill frozen (just add to the cooking time).
