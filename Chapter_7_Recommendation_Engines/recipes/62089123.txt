Ingredients:
1 9 oz can chopped green chiles
1 1/2 tbsp chicken boullion
1 1/2 cups water
1 tsp onion powder
4 tbsp flour
ground cayenne pepper

Directions:
Puree green chiles in a blender or food processor until smooth.
Put the 1 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan with the boullion, add green chiles and bring to slow boil.
While broth is heating, place flour in a small bowl and add warm water while whisking with a fork until consistency is thin and no longer lumpy.
Once broth is boiling slowly add flour mixture, while stiring constantly until desired consistency is reached.
Add onion powder and add cayenne pepper to desired flavor. (I usually add about 1/8 tsp for a mildly spicy flavor)

Description: 
This is a mildly spicy, flavorful gravy you can pour over chicken, turkey or just plain mashed potatoes.  It is very similar to a certain fast food chains' cajun gravy.
