Ingredients:
1 package thin spaghetti
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp onion powder
1 tbsp red pepper flakes
½ lb. cooked chicken breast, chopped
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp onion powder
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp pepper
2 cans cream of mushroom
¼ cup ranch dressing
1 can Italian diced tomatoes, drained
3 garlic cloves, minced
6-8 whole medium mushrooms
½ tsp salt
2 tbsp parsley
½ tsp red pepper flakes

Directions:
Cook the spaghetti according to package while adding salt, onion powder and red pepper flakes to flavor the water. Cook to al dente. Drain spaghetti and set aside.
Put the chicken breast in a medium sauce pan while adding water 1 inch above the breasts. Add the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the saucepan and stir. Cook at low-medium heat with a lid until boiling. When it starts to boil, check the chicken to see if cooked through. Take cooked chicken and chop up into small pieces.
Get a medium bowl and mix together the cans of cream of mushroom, ranch, diced tomatoes, garlic, mushrooms, salt, parsley and red pepper flakes. Add chicken. Mix together thoroughly. Heat in a medium saucepan on the stove on medium heat for 10 minutes. Once sauce is heated, mix the sauce with the spaghetti. Serve warm.

Looking for a creamy spaghetti dish? This I created on a whim wanting to use chicken. This dish has a creamy parsley mushroom sauce with a hint of ranch. Leftover chicken can be used for this dish.
