Ingredients:
White Bean Chicken Chili
3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
3 cans white kidney beans (cannellini beans)
2 cans chicken broth
1 large onion, chopped
1 cup salsa (your desired heat)
1 ½ teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt
Mozzarella cheese
Sour cream
White rice

Directions:
Cook chicken and chop or shred (I shred).
In a large pot, add chicken, beans and broth.  Bring to a boil.
Stir in salsa (I typically throw in the whole jar which is more like 2 cups) and the next 5 ingredients.
Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Stir occasionally.
Thicken with cornstarch-water (1/4 cup water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch) mixture for desired consistency.
Let simmer another 20-30 minutes.
Spoon into bowls and top with cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  We sometimes serve it over white rice.

Description: 
This is one of my family's favorites.  It's also my go-to meal when I'm making dinner to give to friends.

It's also great for a party if you make it a day ahead and then warm it up in the crockpot!
