Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 packet dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
3/4 cup dried bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate.
In a large bowl, combine the beef, onion soup mix, water, hot sauce and bread crumbs. Mix together well and form into patties.
Grill patties over medium high heat for 10 to 20 minutes, or to desired doneness.

Description: 
These burgers are definitely crowd pleasers! Perfect for family get-togethers and summer cookouts. They are complimented nicely by baked beans and potato salad. Serve between sesame seed or whole wheat buns and, if desired, plenty of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. I also like to use Hickory flavored wood chips when I BBQ to add additional flavor to the meat. If you use wood chips, soak them in water for about an hour, then spread them over the hot coals just before grilling.
