Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 tablespoon salt
3 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 cup olive oil mayonnaise (such as Hellman'sÂ®), or more as needed
1/2 lime, juiced
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 onion, diced
freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 (6 ounce) cans small shrimp, drained

Directions:
Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Combine vinegar, sugar, dill, and parsley in a large bowl. Muddle the herbs with flat spatula and mix until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in mayonnaise, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon salt until creamy. Stir in celery and onion. Cover and refrigerate.
Rinse pasta under cold water. Fold pasta into the dressing until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate, folding salad occasionally so that dressing is evenly absorbed, 8 hours to overnight. Add more mayonnaise if pasta looks dry.
Gently fold in shrimp in the last fold before serving.

Description: 
This is a favorite recipe handed down from my Oma, who used to make this for the deli. She used elbow macaroni. I have altered her methods to decrease prep time without sacrificing flavor.
