Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) package prepared pizza crust
1/2 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
1/2 yellow onion, thinly sliced
1/2 bulb fennel, thinly sliced
1/2 cup baby spinach leaves
1/2 cup ricotta cheese
1/4 cup shaved Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Add olive oil. Add tomatoes, garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes have mostly broken down, about 5 minutes. Spread tomato mixture over the pizza crust.
Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook until browned, about 6 minutes. Remove cooked sausage from the pan and set aside, reserving grease in the pan. Add onion and fennel to the pan and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add spinach and cook until leaves begin to wilt, about 30 seconds.
Spread sausage and vegetable mixture over tomato-covered crust. Scatter dollops of ricotta cheese on top. Sprinkle with shaved Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and top is beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
