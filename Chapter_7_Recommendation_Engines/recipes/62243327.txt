Ingredients:
Pam Cooking Spray
1 small head cauliflower
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp table salt
1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400F. Coat a baking sheet with cooking spray. Cut cauliflower florets into bite-sized pieces. (There should be about 4 cups.) Place cauliflower in a medium bowl and add cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper; toss well to coat. Seasonings can be adjusted to your taste preference.
Spread cauliflower on prepared baking sheet in single layer and bake until cauliflower is tender, but not mushy, stirring halfway through, about 10 minutes.
