Ingredients:
3 cups plain flour
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp dry yeast
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp vinegar
1tbsp olive oil
250 ml lukewarm water
Extra flour for kneeing
Oil for deep frying

Directions:
Add all the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well.
Add the olive oil to the mixed ingredients
Add the vinegar to the water.
Slowly add the water to the mixture while mixing until you have a sticky dough.
Put down and spread some flour on a table top and drop the dough onto this.
Rub your hands with flour and kneed the dough until you have a consistency like clay.
The dough should recover when pressed with a finger and not stick to your skin.
Form a ball and rub with olive oil, then cover inside a bowl with a damp cloth.
Put the dough in a warm place for and hour or two until it has doubled in size.
Spread more flour on the table top and kneed the dough down, then with a rolling pin, roll it out until it is about 6mm thick.
With a round 100mm cookie cutter ring, press out several round pieces of dough.
Heat the cooking oil, test with a small piece of dough to check the temperature. Should not be hotter than frying french fries(170Â°C).
Carefully add one piece of dough at a time and turn it when it had puffed up.
Keep on turning to get a equal color on both sides.
Remove when it is a golden color and fry all the rest.
Make a small cut on side and fill with savory meat or any ingredient you like, like grated cheese and jam.
