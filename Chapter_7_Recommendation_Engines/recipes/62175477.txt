Combine mushrooms and the water in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat until liquid is at a simmer; cook, partially covered, until broth is a rich brown color, about 25 minutes.
Strain mixture through a fine sieve into a medium bowl (or large liquid measuring cup), pressing on mushrooms with a wooden spoon to remove as much liquid as possible; discard mushrooms. Stir soy sauce and vinegar into broth; divide evenly among four bowls. Add tofu, and garnish with scallion. Serve immediately.
