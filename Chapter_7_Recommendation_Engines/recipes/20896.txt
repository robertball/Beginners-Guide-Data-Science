Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
20 fresh jalapeno peppers, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
In a medium glass or enamel lined sauce pan over high heat, combine oil, peppers, garlic, onion and salt; saute for 4 minutes.  Add the water and cook for 20 minutes, stirring often.  Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room temperature.
Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth.  With the processor running, slowly add the vinegar.
Pour into a sterilized jar with a tight lid.  This sauce will keep for 6 months when stored in the refrigerator.
