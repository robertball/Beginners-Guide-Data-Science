Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 (30 ounce) package frozen country-style shredded hash brown potatoes
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 medium zucchini, cut in quarters and sliced
1 1/2 cups PaceÂ® Picante Sauce
1/3 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and press into the bottom of the skillet, forming a solid "pancake". Cook for 10 minutes or until the potato pancake is well browned on both sides, carefully turning the potato pancake over halfway through the cook time. Do not stir. Remove the potato pancake from the skillet and keep warm.
Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until well browned, stirring occasionally. Stir in the zucchini and picante sauce and cook until the zucchini is tender and the chicken is cooked through, stirring occasionally. Spoon the chicken mixture over the potato pancake. Sprinkle with the cheese.
