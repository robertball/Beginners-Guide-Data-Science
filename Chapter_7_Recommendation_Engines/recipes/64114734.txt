Ingredients:
10 Brats
1 Bottle Beer
3-4 TBS BBQ Sauce

Directions:
LIghtly brown the brats in a skillet over med high heat.  Once they are browned pour the beer and BBQ sauce over the brats and reduce the heat to med low.  Turn the brats every few minutes, watching for the sauce to begin reducing.  Once it starts getting thick, DO NOT LEAVE THE STOVE.  When the sauce has reduced to the consistency of the BBQ sauce, remove the brats from the pan (reserving any sauce) and put them on a med high grill.  Brown on one side and then turn and baste them with reserved sauce.  When browned on the second side baste with the reserved sauce and serve.

Description: 
There is no better way to do brats.  It takes a little more time than just throwing them on the grill, but the results are fantastic.
