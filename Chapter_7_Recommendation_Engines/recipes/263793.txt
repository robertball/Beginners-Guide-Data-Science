Ingredients:
1 pound flat iron steak, or to taste
2 teaspoons adobo seasoning
2 limes, cut into wedges, divided
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (8 ounce) package small soft tortillas
1 onion, chopped
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 (7 ounce) can salsa verde

Directions:
Season the steak all over with adobo seasoning. Squeeze 1 lime half onto the steak and rub garlic all over it. Place on a dish and refrigerate, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat oil in an ovenproof pan over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until a crust forms, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until crusty on the other side, about 5 minutes more.
Bake steak in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes. Allow steak to cool, about 15 minutes. Slice against the grain.
Place tortillas on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Heat in the microwave until fluffy and warm, about 1 minute.
Place a portion of steak slices on a tortilla, top with sliced onion and cilantro. Squeeze remaining lime juice on top and add some salsa verde. Repeat with remaining tortillas, steak, onion, and cilantro.

Description: 
This refreshing steak taco is best topped with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa verde. Paired with a good Mexican beer, it will make your evening. I prefer soft tortillas, but you can use hard tacos if you like.
