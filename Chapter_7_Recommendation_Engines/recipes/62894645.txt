Ingredients:
1 Pound Tamarindo, peeled and cleaned (rinsed)
5 Cups water
5 Cups sugar
Shaved Ice
Water to cover the tamarindo

Directions:
Peel the tamarindo really well, this step is important! You don't want hard shells in your yummy raspados.
In a large pan, put all the tamarindo and completely cover it in water. Boil it for 30- 45 minutes on the higher side of low heat. Stop boiling when it 1/4 of the water you added is gone.
In another large pan, strain the tamarindo extremely well. Take out all the seeds. Pour the 5 cups of water through the strainer to really get it thru.Trust me, you'll be able to get 90% of the pulp thru.
Feel for any hard unedible pits left. I prefer to throw the pulp back in but its up to you now.
Heat up the concentrate, but don't boil. Add the sugar and a little water if necessary.
Pour over the glass of shaved ice and enjoy!

Description: 
I am a mexican american and I have been craving a raspado! I live in New York and there a little hard to come by. So I decided to make them. Most american ices are made with sugar and lots of diluted flavor, yuck ! But raspados are with lots of flavor and real pulp. Trust me, this is authentic.
