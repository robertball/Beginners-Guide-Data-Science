Description: 
Cocktail wieners that are delicious and oh so easy to make for any occasion. My mom used to make this for all of our holidays. When my Mom told me it was made with grape jelly, I was speechless. Who Du Thunk! This recipe is so simple and easily allows for personal taste variations. Glad to see this recipe on this site but they used with cocktail sauce vs chili sauce. I grew up with and prefer the chili sauce instead.Modified from: Cocktail Wieners II
