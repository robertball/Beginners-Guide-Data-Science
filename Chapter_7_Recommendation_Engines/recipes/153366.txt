Ingredients:
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 pkg. (4 serving size) JELL-O Chocolate Flavor Instant Pudding & Pie Filling
1/3 cup boiling water
3 cups unsifted powdered sugar
8 squares BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate
2 squares BAKER'S Premium White Baking Chocolate (optional)

Directions:
Mix butter and dry pudding mix in large bowl. Gradually add boiling water, stirring until well blended. Stir in powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition until mixture forms a ball. Shape scant tablespoonfuls of the pudding mixture into 30 small eggs, each about 1-1/2 inches long. (If pudding mixture is too soft, refrigerate about 15 minutes to firm slightly before shaping.) Refrigerate 30 minutes or until eggs are firm.
Microwave semi-sweet chocolate in microwavable bowl on HIGH 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until slightly melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Dip eggs into chocolate. Refrigerate on wax paper-covered tray 15 minutes or until chocolate is firm. Meanwhile, microwave white chocolate in separate microwavable bowl on HIGH 1-1/2 to 2 minutes or until slightly melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted.
Drizzle white chocolate over eggs; let stand until set. Store in airtight container in refrigerator.
