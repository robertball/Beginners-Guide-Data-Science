Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) loaves frozen bread dough, thawed
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 envelope onion soup mix
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
Divide the bread dough into 20 portions; shape each into a ball. In a bowl, combine the Parmesan cheese and soup mix. Place butter in another bowl. Roll each ball in butter, then in the cheese mixture.  Arrange in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
