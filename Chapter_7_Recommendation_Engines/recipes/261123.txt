Ingredients:
4 country-style pork ribs, rinsed, or more as needed
1 dash seasoned salt, or to taste
1 dash garlic powder, or to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 yellow onion, cut into wedges
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)
1 cup mojo (citrus) marinade
1 cup chicken broth
1 splash orange juice (optional)

Directions:
Season ribs with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and black pepper.
Heat oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add cilantro. Add ribs; cook until browned on 1 side, about 3 minutes. Turn and cook until other side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in enough marinade to coat ribs; continue to brown, about 3 minutes more. Add chicken broth and orange juice to cover ribs.
Close cooker securely and place pressure regulator over vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Heat until steam escapes in a steady flow, about 5 minutes. Reduce pressure and cook until ribs are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Let pressure release naturally according to manufacturer's instructions, 5 to 10 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.

Description: 
Falling-off-the-bone-tender and rich with flavor. Ribs are browned, then pressure cooked in a garlic-citrus marinade.  Serve with rice and beans. I often vary the flavor by using prepared 30-minute marinades such as chipotle, Cuban lime, and honey-mustard.
