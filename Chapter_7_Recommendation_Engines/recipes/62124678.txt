Ingredients:
4 chicken breasts
4 slices of baby swiss cheese
4 slices of good bacon
1 TBSP garlic powder
1 TBSP pepper

Directions:
Slice the chicken breasts in half, but only cut 3/4 of the way through, like you would a sandwich roll.
Place 1 slice of cheese inside each piece of chicken.
Combine the pepper and garlic powder then sprinkle evenly on top of chicken breasts.
Wrap 1 bacon slice around each breast. Secure with toothpick, if necessary.
Cook on 375 degrees for about 40 mins or until cooked through.
