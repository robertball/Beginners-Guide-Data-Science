Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1/3 cup margarine
1/3 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons salt
3 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 cup dry potato flakes
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
10 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat milk in a large saucepan over low heat until it bubbles; stir in butter or margarine, sugar and salt, then cool until lukewarm. Add warm water and potatoes and sprinkle in yeast until it dissolves. Then stir in 6 cups of the flour and mix all together. Add the remaining 4 to 5 cups of flour and mix. Let rest 15 minutes.
Turn dough out on a floured surface and knead softly until dough is elastic and smooth. Lightly oil a large mixing bowl; add dough and turn to coat. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise 1 hour or until dough has doubled in volume.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
Punch down dough and divide into 3 to 4 sections. Shape into loaves and let rise, covered, until volume is nearly doubled.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 30 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.
