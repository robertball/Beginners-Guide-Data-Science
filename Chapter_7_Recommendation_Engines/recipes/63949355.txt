Ingredients:
6 slices Morningstar Farms bacon strips, chopped
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup softened butter
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder

1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Broil the bacon until crisp, turning once. Crumble.
Beat the sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer in a large bowl until fluffy and smooth. Stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, cayenne, and salt. Mix in the chocolate chips and bacon. Drop cookies by rounded spoonfuls onto Pam-ed cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Let stand 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
