Ingredients:
1 pound linguine
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
3/4 pound ground pork (*cough* bulk italian sausage *cough*)
Pinch dried rosemary, crushed
1/8-1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic powder
8oz. mushrooms, stems removed and sliced
1-2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely minced
8 sun-dried tomatoes (I used the oil-packed ones), sliced thin
1-9oz. bag spinach, coarsley chopped
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons lemon juice
Salt and pepper, to taste, optional
1-2.25oz. can sliced black olives, drained
1 cup pasta water, reserved
4 tablespoons honey
8 fresh basil leaves, sliced thin
(deducted the cabbage and the chicken)

Directions:
Cook linguine according to package directions, reserving 1 cup of pasta water; drain and set aside. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large skillet.
Add ground pork (*cough* sausage *cough*).
Season with rosemary, tarragon and garlic powder. Cook meat, breaking it up, until almost done, about 6-8 minutes.
Add mushrooms and jalapenos.
Continue cooking until mushrooms are tender.
Add sun-dried tomatoes and stir to coat.
Add spinach and stir until wilted, about 2-3 minutes.
Add brown sugar and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper, if desired.
Add olives and cook until just heated through, about 1-2 minutes.
Toss with pasta.
Add reserved pasta water, as needed to achieve desired "juiciness" (for a lack of a better word). At this point, you can also add a splash or two of extra olive oil if you wanna.
TO SERVE: Plate individual servings of pasta. Drizzle each serving with about 1 tablespoon of honey and top with the thinly sliced fresh basil. ENJOY!
