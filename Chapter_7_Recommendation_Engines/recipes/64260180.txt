Title:
Crockpot World's Best Chicken Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4-6 Chicken Thighs
1/2 cup Dijon Mustard
1/4 cup Maple Syrup
1 Tablespoon Red Wine Vinegar
2 tsp. Rosemary
Salt & Pepper

Directions:
Trim fat off your chicken thighs. (Donâ€™t worry about getting all the fat off. Chicken thighs are really fatty, but they are so cheap! They are perfect for the crock-pot because the fat melts off of them and by the time they are done they fall right off the bone.) You can substitute for chicken breasts if you prefer, but I have made them both ways and thighs always taste better in the crock-pot. Dump all ingredients into your freezer bags.
When ready to use, thaw bag just enough to dump into crock-pot. Cook on low for 8 hours. Serve with rice.
