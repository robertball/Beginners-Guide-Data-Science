Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white wine
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 (4 pound) leg of lamb

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix white wine, garlic, parsley, and salt in a bowl. Arrange leg of lamb in a large roasting pan; pour white wine mixture evenly over lamb.
Roast in the preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 90 minutes, flipping the lamb over halfway through. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
Easy with only 5 ingredients. This lamb recipe can be used with any part of the lamb, but it is my favorite with a big juicy leg.
