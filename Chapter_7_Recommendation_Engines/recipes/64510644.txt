Description: 
Saucy beef tips and mushrooms - delicious over brown rice or noodles.  For a thicker sauce, you can dredge the beef cubes in flour before browning - or - about 30 minutes before it's finished cooking, remove about 1/8 cup of liquid from the slow cooker, add 1 Tbs cornstarch and mix together. Add back to the slow cooker, stir, and cook on high until thickened.
