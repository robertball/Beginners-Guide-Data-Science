Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter for greasing, or as needed (optional)
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 eggs
3 bananas, mashed
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

1/4 cup ground flax
1/4 cup wheat germ
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup walnuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease 12 muffin cups with butter or line with paper muffin liners.
Stir sugar, oil, mayonnaise, and eggs together until creamy and light yellow. Mix in bananas until incorporated.
Stir flour, oats, flax, wheat germ, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into banana mixture until smooth. Mix in chocolate chips and walnuts. Spoon batter into prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Moist, delicious, and at least quasi-healthful. I was very pleased with how they turned out.
