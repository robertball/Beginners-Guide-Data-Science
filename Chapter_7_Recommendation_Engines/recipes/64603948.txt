Rotkraut Piquant (Sweet and Sour Red Kraut) Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
5 black or red plums, peeled, pitted and chopped
10 dried, pitted prunes, chopped
4 oz can waterchestnuts, chopped
4 granny smith apples, peeled, cored & chopped
1 clove minced garlic
1 small head red cabbage, shredded
2 Tablespoons brown sugar
2 Tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 cup apple cider or juice
1 cup beef or chicken stock

Directions:
Put all ingredients into a stock pot and mix gently.  Cover and simmer over medium heat for about an hour, stirring often.
After an hour, remove the lid and continue to stir frequently until a good amount of the liquid has evaporated and the kraut has reached a consistency you like.  (we like ours a little on the thicker side)
Serve with fresh Brats, Chicken and Apple sausage, thick pork loin chops, etc.  Enjoy with a crisp and cold pilsner and a slice of crusty bread!
(can also be made in a crock pot all day, use 1/2 cup stock if cooking in a crock pot)
