Ingredients:
4 Pickerel filets, skinned and boned
2 Tbsp. Salt
3 Cups milk
2 Tbsp. Lemon Juice
1 sleeve(about 50) UN-Salted Soda Crackers, finely crushed
2 Tbsp. Paprika
4 Tbsp. Olive Oil

Directions:
Dissolve the salt into a large bowl of cold water, add the pickerel filets and soak for 1 hour.
Drain water from bowl, remove filets and rinse. Add milk to the bowl along with the lemon juice and stir to mix well. Place filets back in the bowl with the milk and soak for another hour.
While fish is soaking, crush cracker crumbs finely with a rolling pin on a sheet of waxed paper.
Drain and rinse filets again and pat dry on paper towels.
Gently coat filets (both sides) with the cracker crumbs.
Place filets on a wire rack on top of a foil-wrapped cookie sheet.(Spray rack with Cooking Spray first)
Sprinkle Paprika generously over the filets to cover completely the side facing up.
Dot each filet with 1 tbsp. Olive Oil
Bake in a 400 F oven for approximately 25 minutes or until fish is opaque (thicker filets will need a longer time to cook)
