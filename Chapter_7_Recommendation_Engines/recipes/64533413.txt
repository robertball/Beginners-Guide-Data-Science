Ingredients:
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tsp cinnamon
1 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup almond flour
1/3 cup GF oat flour
1/4 cup Truvia brown baking sugar
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 degrees
Prepare a muffin tin with cooking spray or liners (or baking dish if making the bread version)
In a food processor, combine pumpkin, almond milk, apple cider vinegar, oats, sugar, honey & cinnamon and combine
To the mixture, add by hand baking soda, cornmeal, almond meal & salt and combine well
Let the batter sit 1 hour in the refrigerator to allow the batter to thicken, the cornmeal will absorb all the ingredients to make fluffier and thicker muffins (trust me!)
Pour the batter into the cavities
Bake 30 minutes until muffins appear golden & a toothpick can be inserted cleanly in the center
Cool muffins before serving
