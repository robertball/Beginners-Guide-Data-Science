Ingredients:
8 cups fat-free chicken broth
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (6 ounces)
1 medium carrots, peeled and cut into small pieces
1 medium celery stalk, sliced
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped spinach
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/4 tsp oregano
1 Tbsp chopped fresh basil
1 cup orzo
Juice of 1 medium lemon (about 1/4 cup)

Directions:
1.	Place all of the ingredients except the lemon juice in a 4-quart pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the orzo is cooked al dente.
2.	Remove the chicken breast from the soup, slice into strips, and return to the pot. Add the lemon juice, stirring well to mix. Remove and discard the bay leaf.
3.	Ladle the hot soup into individual bowls and serve immediately.
