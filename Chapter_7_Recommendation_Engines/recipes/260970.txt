Rice Crispy Wings Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound chicken wing sections (flats and drums)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
½ cup stone-ground rice flour
2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Place split chicken wings into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Toss to evenly coat pieces. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Place rice flour in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken wing pieces in small batches in the flour and transfer to a plate. Arrange pieces so there is some space between them; allow wings to sit out for 15 minutes before frying.
Line a baking sheet with paper towels; place a draining rack on the towels.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer wings to oil; fry until inside is crispy and golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove wings from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a rack placed over paper towels.

Description: 
The rice flour coating on these wings turned out to be light, crispy, and extremely sauce friendly. Traditional buffalo wings are fried without any coating and they're good-but these are better at holding onto a sauce. You can spice the flour any way you want!
