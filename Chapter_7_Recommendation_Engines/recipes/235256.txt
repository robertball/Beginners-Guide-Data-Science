Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 1/2 cups vegetable oil (such as CriscoÂ®), divided
1 cup finely chopped tomatoes
1/2 cup minced green onions
6 tablespoons chicken broth
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
12 wooden picks
1 cup shredded lettuce, or to taste
1/4 cup guacamole, or to taste

Directions:
Bring water to a simmer in a skillet over medium heat; add chicken. Cover skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from water and cool; shred with a fork.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, tomatoes, green onions, chicken broth, flour, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, and salt until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat remaining vegetable oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat; carefully dip tortillas in the hot oil to soften, about 1 minute. Remove tortillas with tongs and drain on paper towels, reserving oil. Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Spoon about 2 tablespoons chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Tightly roll each tortilla around the filling and secure with a wooden toothpick.
Fry rolled-up tortillas, working in batches, in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove taquitos with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve taquitos on a bed of shredded lettuce with guacamole on the side.
