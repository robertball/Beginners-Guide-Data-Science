Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon instant coffee powder (optional)
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
2 drops vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, instant coffee, and salt in a microwave-safe mug or small bowl. Mix in vegetable oil, water, and vanilla extract until mixture is smooth and glossy. Add more water, 1/4 teaspoon at a time, if mixture looks a little dry.
Microwave on high until top looks dry, about 1 minute.

Description: 
This is a great quick fix for a chocolate craving! Because it's microwaved it is different than traditional brownie and has a very moist, pudding-like texture. Enjoy with whipped cream or a scoop of ice cream.
