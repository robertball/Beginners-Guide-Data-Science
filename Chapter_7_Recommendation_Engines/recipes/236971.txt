Description: 
This is a quick and easy chocolate-fix that the kids and adults will love. It's easy to play around with the ingredients to suit. My family has been making it for years and it's still a fave! Ingredients can be switched up with great results. It's also great with white chocolate and cranberries or crushed peppermints. You can use any nuts in place of the almonds.
