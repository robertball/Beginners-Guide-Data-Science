Ingredients:
1 cup butter flavored shortening
6 tbsp water
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup cocoa powder
2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the shortening, water, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Mix in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt; stir into the batter just until blended, then mix in the chocolate chips so they are evenly distributed. Drop cookies by heaping teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets spacing 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to turn golden, 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
