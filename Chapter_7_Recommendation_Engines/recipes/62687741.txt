Ingredients:
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1 3/4 cup oats, divided
2 1/2 cup hot water
4 1/2 teaspoon rapid rise active dry yeast (2 packages)
5 to 6 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg (beaten lightly)

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar and 1 1/2 cups oats. Stir in hot water and let mixture stand until lukewarm. Sprinkle yeast over mixture and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Stir in 5 cups flour and salt, stirring until mixture forms a dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead dough for 10 minutes, adding as much of remaining cup of flour as necessary to form a smooth and elastic dough.   (Or use Kitchen Aid and leave in bowl for next step)
Let dough rest, covered with an inverted bowl for 15 minutes.
Lightly oil 2 (9x5x3) loaf pans. Form dough into 2 loaves and transfer to pans. Brush surface of dough with egg and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup oats. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
Bake bread in middle of oven 45-50 minutes, or until browned and bottoms sound hollow when tapped. Turn bread out onto racks to cool completely.
