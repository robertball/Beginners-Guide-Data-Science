Ingredients:
1 container fresh small mozarella balls (boccatini)
1 large bunch basil
8 small tomatoes approx. 2 inches in diameter
3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove
1/4 teaspoon cracked red pepper
kosher salt

Directions:
Cut off the bottoms of the tomatoes to get a flat surface and scoop out the some of inside to create a pocket for the mozarella. I find a metal 1/2 teaspoon works great for this.
Wrap a small basil leaf around a mozarella ball and stuff this inside the tomatoe. If you scooped out enough, they should be able to stand on a plate flat side down.  Repeat for the other tomatoes.
Heat the balsamic vinegar in a sauce pan and reduce to a light syrup, about 5-10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Add 1 large handful (about a cup) of basil to a blender.
Add garlic, red pepper, pinch of salt and 1/2 cup oil and blend.
With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the remaining  1/2 cup oil. Blend thoroughly. If you transfer this to a squirt bottle it makes plating easier and storing leftover oil easy.
Sprinkle a tiny pinch of salt on the cut side of each tomatoe.
Place 2 tomatoes down the center of each salad plate. Spoon some balsamic on the one side of the plate and squirt or spoon some oil on the other side.

Description: 
A new take on the classic.  This makes an elegant presentation and it's very easy.  Instead of using really expensive balsamic vinegar, I use a decent quality one from Trader Joe's and reduce it to a syrup.  This also makes it much sweeter. Try using different kinds of tomatoes to make it more interesting.
