Ingredients:
3 Tbsps. water for saut√©ing
2 medium yellow onions, chopped
3 garlic clove, minced
2 red bell peppers, seeded and cut into small squares
3 tsps. light brown sugar or sucanat
1 tsp. grated fresh ginger
1 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
3/4 cup natural peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)
3 sweet potatoes, peeled and diced into cubes
1 15 oz. can of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes
4 cups vegetable stock
1/2 tsp. sea salt, or to taste
1/2-1 cup unsalted, dry roasted peanuts, chopped
chopped fresh cilantro for garnish

Directions:
Heat the water in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the bell peppers, cover, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the brown sugar (sucanat), ginger, cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper, and cook stirring, for 30 seconds.
Stir in the peanut butter, and distribute it evenly throughout. You may want to thin out the peanut butter first by mixing it with some warm water in a small bowl before adding it to the pot. It will be much easier to incorporate it into the stew.
Add the sweet potatoes, kidney beans, and tomatoes, and stir to coat. Add the vegetable broth, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes.
Serve in bowl over your choice of steamed rice, and top with chopped peanuts and cilantro.
