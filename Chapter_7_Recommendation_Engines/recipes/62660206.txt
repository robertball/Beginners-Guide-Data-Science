Toss the onions, carrots, celery, turnips and Brussels sprouts, add a generous amount of the olive oil and season it with salt and pepper.  Pour the mixture into a roasting pan and place into a hot oven for 45 minutes or unitl caramelized, stirring and shaking the pan occasionally to prevent scorching and to make sure the vegetables cook evenly.
While the vegetables roast add the vegetable broth and chopped tomatoes to a large soup pot and bring to a boil.  Gently simmer for 15 minutes and then keep warm.
Add the parsley leaves, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and Parmesean cheese to a blender and puree till smooth.
