The Meatball that Fell Off the Table Recipe

Ingredients:
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 egg
1 pound ground beef chuck
1 cup plain dry bread crumbs
1/2 t. dry mustard
1 teaspoon garlic salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
ground black pepper to taste
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 Cup sour cream added to soup
A few granules beef gravy
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk the egg in a large bowl. Add the onion, ground beef, bread crumbs, garlic salt, coriander, nutmeg, parsley and pepper; mix well using your hands. Shape into meatballs using your hands or an ice cream scoop.
Place the meatballs into the skillet, and set over medium-high heat. Cover, and cook until browned on the bottom. Turn, and continue cooking covered, until meatballs are browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Drain on a paper towel, and pour excess grease out of the skillet,or bake at 400 for 10 minutes.  Turn and bake another 10-15 minutes longer.
Pour the cream of mushroom soup and sour cream  into the skillet, and stir in enough water so that it is still a fairly thick gravy. Return the meatballs to the skillet, and stir until coated.  Serve over potatoes or egg noodles.
