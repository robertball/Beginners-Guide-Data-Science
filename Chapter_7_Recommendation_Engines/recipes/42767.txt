Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 cup white wine
1 egg yolk, beaten
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and cinnamon. Using a fork, blend in the white wine. When dough forms a ball, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 15 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for about 2 hours.
Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees F). On a lightly floured surface, roll  1/3 of the dough out into a big circle as thin as paper. Cut into 8 (5-inch) circles. Wrap each circle around a cannoli form, and seal with egg yolk.
Fry 2 or 3 at a time until golden brown. remove with tongs to drain on paper towels. Carefully remove shells from forms while they are still hot, or they may become stuck.
