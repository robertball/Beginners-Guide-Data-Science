Ingredients:
Ingredients:
1 (14- to 16-pound) fresh turkey
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
For the beer and herb baste:
1 (12 oz) bottle of Hennepin Farmhouse Saison
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon minced fresh sage
1 tablespoon fresh minced thyme
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Discard the neck and gizzard (or save for stock). Save the heart and liver for the gravy. Rinse the turkey with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the skin and cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Truss the turkey and place it on a rack in a large roasting pan with a tight-fitting lid.
To make the baste: In a medium saucepan, heat the butter on low heat until almost fully melted. Add the beer and continue heating. Add the rosemary, sage and thyme, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and mustard. Keep the mixture warm on the stove as the turkey is roasting, using it to baste the turkey every 30 minutes.
Roast the turkey for 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting with the beer baste every 15 minutes. Remove the lid from the pan and roast for 1 to 1 ½ hours or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the inner thigh reads 175 to 180 degrees. If the turkey browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Let the bird rest for 20 to 30 minutes on a cutting board before carving.

The rich flavor of our Hennepin Farmhouse Saison paired with herbs and butter give this turkey a savory flavor, and the butter browns the skin beautifully.
