a palm full of celery seed (you wont find that in a cook book).

Description: 
Great sauce to put on pork, beef or chicken on a bun. These sandwiches are my favorite and they are all great. These sandwiches are covered in a secret relish that perfectly compliments the meats, soaks the bun, and turns the whole hot delicious mess into a work of art.
