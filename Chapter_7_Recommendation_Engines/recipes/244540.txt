Ingredients:
vegetable oil for frying
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, each cut into 8 triangles

Directions:
Pour 1/4 to 1/2 inch oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet; bring oil to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C) over medium-high heat, about 8 minutes.
Working in batches, gently arrange tortillas in the hot oil using a slotted spoon; cook, frequently turning tortillas with the slotted spoon, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove chips with slotted spoon and place a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

Description: 
We first had these while on vacation in the Caribbean. After returning, I had to figure out how to make them. We now prefer these to store-bought corn tortilla chips.
