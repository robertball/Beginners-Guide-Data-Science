Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

2 eggs
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup sunflower kernels

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and ginger. In another bowl, beat the eggs, butter and vanilla; stir in pineapple. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in carrot and sunflower kernels. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three fourths full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
Even though my children are grown, they still look for these muffins on Sunday mornings. I put the leftovers, if any, in my husband's lunch for a surprise treat.
