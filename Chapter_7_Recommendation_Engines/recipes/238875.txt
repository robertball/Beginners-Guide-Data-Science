Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup light cream
1 cup white sugar
1 cup chocolate chips
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Whisk cream, sugar, chocolate chips, eggs, oats, and blueberries together in a separate bowl until well mixed. Stir flour mixture into cream mixture until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool muffins in muffin tin for 10 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.
