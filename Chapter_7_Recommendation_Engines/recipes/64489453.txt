Description: 
Adapted from my favorite minestrone soup at a local restaurant, this has become a staple in my and several family members households.  It is quite healthy and low-calorie without sacrificing flavor. Like most soups, it is always better the second day.

Minestrone soup varies by season and region...often being made with seasonal vegetables and meat. This recipe is how I choose to make it, but feel free to adapt the ingredients based on your taste and/or whatever is on hand.
