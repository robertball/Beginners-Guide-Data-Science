Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil
2 chicken breasts, chopped in small pieces
2 andouille sausages, sliced
2 ribs celery, chopped
1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted tomatoes
2 teaspoons Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Rinse rice. Combine wet rice and chicken broth in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid and set valve to sealing. Choose Rice function. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer rice to a bowl and keep warm.
Rinse out pot liner and choose Saute function. Add grapeseed oil, chicken, and sausage; saute until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add celery, bell pepper, and onion. Saute 1 more minute. Add tomatoes, Creole seasoning, and Cajun seasoning. Add shrimp and cook just until tails curl up, 1 to 3 minutes. Serve jambalaya on top of or mixed into the cooked rice.
