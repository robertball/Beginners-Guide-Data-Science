Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed
4 cooked chicken breasts, cubed
1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon base (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (15 ounce) packages refrigerated pie crusts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Melt butter in a large deep-dish skillet over medium heat. Mix in flour to create a roux; brown lightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken broth. Add chicken, frozen vegetables, bouillon base, garlic, celery seed, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Continue to cook until sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, 10 to 15 minutes.
Cut rounds of pie crust to fit 4 small individual pie pans or ramekins; press 1 round into each pan. Spoon in filling and top with additional pie crust round.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 20 to 30 minutes.
