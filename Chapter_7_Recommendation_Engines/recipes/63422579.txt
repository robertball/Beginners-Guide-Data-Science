Directions:
Brew coffee at double strength (use half the amount of water but your usual amount of coffee grounds.  Let cool,.
Refrigerate half the brewed coffee and freeze the rest in a block form or in an angel food cake mold (the hole in the middle will help the coffee melt evenly).
To serve, place ice cubes in your dispenser, then pour the refrigerated coffee and place the block of frozen coffee on top.  Stir occasionally.
Have ice, milk, and/or half and half, and a liquid sweetener (such as simple syrup or agave nectar) available.
