Ingredients:
1 cup milk
6 tbsp butter
1 package dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp)
2 eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
4 cups flour
1 tsp salt
2 tbsp cinnamon
1/3 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cups raisins (optional)
Wash:
1 egg
1 tbsp milk
1 tbsp demerara sugar (optional)

Directions:
Microwave the milk and butter for 45 seconds. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and let sit for 10 minutes
Beat the eggs, salt and white sugar in a mixer bowl. Add the milk/yeast mixture and add flour, cup by cup until it's coming together as a dough.
Using the hook attachment on your mixer or by hand, knead the dough for 10 minutes.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it in plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until doubled (about an hour)
Roll dough out to a long rectangle and sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon and raisins (if using).
Roll up the dough, pinch the seams and place in a greased bread pan.  Cover and let rise again for at least an hour.
Beat the egg and milk and brush the top of the bread. Sprinkle with the sugar if using. Bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes.

Description: 
I've been making this bread for years and my family loves it. This loaf is buttery, light and sweet.  It makes exceptional French Toast too!
