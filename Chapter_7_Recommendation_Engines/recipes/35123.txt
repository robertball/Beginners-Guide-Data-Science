Ingredients:
2 quarts fresh gooseberries
6 cups white sugar
1/2 (6 fluid ounce) container liquid pectin

Directions:
Remove blossom and stem ends from gooseberries. Force berries through food mill. Measure 4 cups of the berry mash into a large pot. Stir in the sugar. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat, and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat, and stir in pectin at once. Skim off any foam with a large metal spoon.
Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 10 minutes. Take turns with skimming foam, and stirring the berry mixture for 5 minutes to let it cool slightly. Ladle into hot sterile jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace.

Description: 
This is a jam recipe was given to me by my mother in law. She made it every year and would send us a pint because we could not get gooseberries where we lived.
