Ingredients:
One can Betty Crocker Whipped Frosting, any flavor
1 Cup, plus 1 TBL. whole milk
1 tsp. vanilla
1/2 Cup, all purpose flour
1 TBL. butter, softened

Directions:
Heat the whole milk and vanilla in a heavy saucepan, over medium to medium high heat.  When the milk begins to steam, quickly wisk in the flour until the flour is incorporated and the mixture becomes very thick.  REMOVE from heat.  Allow the milk and flour mixture to COOL COMPLETELY.  Spoon the cooled mixture into a mixing bowl, add the butter, beat until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps--about 3 to 5 minutes on high.  Add the canned frosting to the bowl and beat on high an additional 3 to 5 minutes, until the frosting a smooth and light.  Enough to generously frost 24 cupcakes, a double layer cake or a sheet cake.  Refrigerate the dessert after icing.
