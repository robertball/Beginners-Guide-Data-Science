Ingredients:
Salt & Pepper
1 lb penne rigate pasta
2 firm zucchini
3 TB EVOO
1 fresno chile pepper, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 limes, juiced
2 TB butter
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/4 cup fresh mint
1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon or 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1 cup grated pecorino-romano cheese
1/2 cup finely chopped pistachio nuts, toasted

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it, add the pasta and cook until al dente.  Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.
While the pasta is working, halve the zucchini lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.  Thinly slice into 1/4-in by 2-in strips- think fat matchsticks.
In a large skillet, eat the EVOO, 3 turns of the pan, over medium-high heat.  Stir in the chile and garlic for a minute.  Add the zucchini, season with salt and pepper and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Add the lime juice to the zucchini and stir in the butter to melt.  Add the pasta, parsley, mint, tarragon (or basil), a handful of cheese and the reserved pasta cooking water.  Toss for 1 to minutes.  Top with more cheese and pistachios.
