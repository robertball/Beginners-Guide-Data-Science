Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
6 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 tablespoon salt
3/4 cup shortening
2 cups scalded milk, cooked

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in water; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups flour, salt, shortening, milk and yeast mixture. Beat well. Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic about 6-8 minutes. Dough should be soft. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl; cover and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and divide into four pieces. Divide three of the pieces into eight pieces each; shape into smooth balls and place on greased baking sheets. Divide remaining dough into 24 balls. Press 1 small ball atop each larger ball. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes or until golden.

Description: 
When Mother baked zweiback rolls--which means 'twice baked'--she'd guard them, lest they disappear quickly! She would bake them on Sundays when friends came by for 'fsapa' a meal of cold meat, cheese, jelly and coffee.
