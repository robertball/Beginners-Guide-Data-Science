Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) jar Pace® Thick & Chunky Salsa
2 cups orange juice
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger root
2 pounds beef flank steak
Hot cooked rice
Chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Mix the salsa, orange juice, oil, sugar, soy, mustard and ginger in a nonmetallic shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag. Add the steak and turn it to coat with marinade. Cover the dish or seal the plastic bag and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium. Grill steak until desired doneness, basting it frequently with marinade.
Heat the remaining marinade in a small saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes.
Slice the steak across the grain at a 45-degree angle to the cutting surface. Serve with the rice and the sauce. Top with the parsley.
