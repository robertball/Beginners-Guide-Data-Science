Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon grated orange zest
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
Beat sugar, eggs, oil, extracts, and orange zest together in a large bowl.
Combine flour and baking powder; stir into egg mixture to form a stiff dough. Stir in cranberries and walnuts. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Form each piece into a roll the length of your cookie sheet. Use the parchment paper to help flatten the roll to about 1/2-inch thickness.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet to cool onto a wire rack until safe to handle, 10 to 15 minutes.
Slice rolls crosswise into 1/2-inch slices. Place slices back on the cookie sheet, cut-side up, and continue baking until lightly toasted, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
