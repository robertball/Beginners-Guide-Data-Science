Ingredients:
5 medium zucchini
2 potatoes
1 large onion
1 (6 ounce) package Laughing CowÂ® Light Creamy Swiss wedges
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Clean and quarter zucchini and potatoes. Peel and chop onion. In a large pot boil zucchini, potatoes and onion in water (just covering them) until very tender. Drain vegetables, but retain stock.
In a blender, or with a hand blender, puree the cheese, zucchini, potatoes, onion and bouillon while adding stock, until desired consistency is reached. (If you're using a blender, do this in two batches.)
Pour mixture back into large pot and bring to a boil. Salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
I learned this excellent cream of zucchini soup recipe while living in Spain from a 75-year old woman in Madrid. It's excellent, easy, low-fat, and cheap, as well as a wonderful comfort food. Vary recipe by adding carrots or spinach or other vegetables. Increase potato volume for thicker soup. Garnish with croutons, paprika and chives. Delish!
