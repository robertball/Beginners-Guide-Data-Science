Ingredients:
1 tsp salt
2 cups boiling water
1 1/4 cups white cornmeal
Vegetable oil or bacon drippings (enough to fill skillet 1-inch deep)

Directions:
Add salt to boiling water and gradually sift in cornmeal and stir to combine. Cool the mixture in refrigerator  for 20 minutes. Shape into balls and then flatten to form patties about 2 inches long. Fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn once. Drain and serve hot.
TIP: Spray hands with nonstick cooking spray to prevent batter from sticking when shaping the balls.
