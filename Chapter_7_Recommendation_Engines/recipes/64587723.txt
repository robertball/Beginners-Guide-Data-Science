Ingredients:
1/2	cup cocoa powder, sifted
1/3	cup granulated sugar
1/4	cup packed dark brown sugar
pinch salt
2/3	cup whole milk
1½	cups heavy cream
1	teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3/4	cup marshmallow cream (e.g. Fluff®)
2	full graham cracker sheets, crushed
2	ounces milk chocolate (1/3 cup chips), melted and reserved at room temperature

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the cocoa, sugars and salt.
Add the milk and, using a hand mixer on low speed or a whisk, beat to combine until the cocoa and sugars are dissolved. Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla.
Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours, or overnight.
Turn on the Cuisinart® ice cream maker; pour the mixture into the frozen freezer bowl and let mix until thickened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Five minutes before mixing is completed, gradually add the marshmallow cream, one spoonful at a time.
Once mixed, add the crushed graham crackers and melted chocolate, one at a time, through the top and let mix in completely.
The ice cream will have a soft, creamy texture. If a firmer consistency is desired, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and place in freezer for about 2 hours.
Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving.
Tip: If marshmallow cream is too stiff, warm slightly in microwave before adding to freezer bowl.
