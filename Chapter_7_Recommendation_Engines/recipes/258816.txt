Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Combine chicken, mozzarella cheese, spinach, basil, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper with orzo pasta.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to let flavors mingle, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Light and simple. Orzo pasta with lemon juice, chicken, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and spinach. I typically use a rotisserie chicken, since they are typically packed with great flavor already.
