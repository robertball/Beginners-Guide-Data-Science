Ingredients:
9-10 lb. pumpkin
2 lb. ground beef
1/2 c. chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced (or more to taste)
1½ tsp. salt
½ tsp. cumin
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 6-oz. can tomato paste
1 14-oz. can tomatoes, chopped
1 can mexicali corn
1 can garbanzo beans
2 cans pinto beans
1 small can black olives

Directions:
Set oven shelf to lowest position. Preheat oven to 325°. Cut lid in top of pumpkin; set aside. Remove seeds and pith.
Brown ground beef with chopped onion and garlic, drain.  Add salt, cumin, chili powder, tomato paste and chopped tomatoes.  Let simmer a few minutes to blend spices. Set pumpkin on pizza pan or large cake pan. Place meat sauce in pumpkin shell. Stir in corn, garbanzo beans, pinto beans and olives, all with liquids. Replace pumpkin lid and place in oven. Bake 2½ hours, stirring every hour. (Juices may bubble out during cooking. Use turkey baster to save to add to chili later.) When serving, scrape some pumpkin from inside to add to bowl.
