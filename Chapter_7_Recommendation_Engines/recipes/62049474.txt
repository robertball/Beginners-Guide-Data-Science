Put 1/8 to 1/4 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your cole slaw, in a bowl.  Stir in just enough vinegar to melt the sugar.

Description: 
Ever since my sister gave me this recipe, I have never bothered to try another slaw.  The horseradish in the dressing makes it a little different and delicious. It is great on it's own or on a pulled pork sandwich.
