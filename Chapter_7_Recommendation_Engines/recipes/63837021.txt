Ingredients:
1 lb Sweet sausage
1 tbsp olive oil
1 lb Orzo pasta
3 tomatoes
bunch of basil, finely chopped
1 onion, finely diced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
4 shakes cayenne pepper
6 cubes of chicken bouillon (retain water from peeling tomatoes!)
1 cup of frozen sweet corn
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Score tomatoes for peeling and place in bowl with bouillon cubes. Cover with boiling water. Remove tomatoes after 10-15 seconds and peel. Discard peel and dice tomatoes.
Slice sausage into 1cm slices. Heat large skillet, and brown the sausage in the olive oil. Don't turn too much - allow to brown, so that sausage skin wraps tight, creating little sausage balls. Discard excess fat.
Cook Orzo al dente according to instructions on box. Meanwhile, add onions and garlic to sausage and sauté for one minute. Transfer all to large soup pot. Glaze the skillet with the tomatoes and add to soup pot. Add bouillon stock and cayenne pepper. Bring to gentle simmer. Add frozen corn, followed by Orzo, and basil
Add salt & pepper to taste. Serve hot.

We discussed this dish while waiting for our meal at David's. We talked about using the sausage in the freezer, and wanting to make something really fresh-tasting, right down to adding the basil at the last minute so its fragrance wasn't lost in the cooking... This really hit the spot! Delicious!
