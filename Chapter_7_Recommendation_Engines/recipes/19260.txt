Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 egg white
1 cup chopped pecans
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg yolk and vanilla until the mixture is smooth. Combine the flour and cinnamon, stir into the creamed mixture. Press the mixture evenly into the prepared pan until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Brush the top with egg white and sprinkle with chopped pecans. Lightly press the pecans down into the dough.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown at the edges. When cool, dust with confectioners' sugar and cut into squares.
