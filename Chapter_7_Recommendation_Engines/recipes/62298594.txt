Description: 
My mom and I love this recipe, fluffy and sweet chocolate chips pancakes.
The original recipe ingredients were replaced in order to my dad could have a couple of pancakes, he's diabetic, so i try to pour as little chocolate chips as possible on his serving.
The milk chocolate chips makes them so good, that if you eat them warm you won't want to add any type of syrup.
