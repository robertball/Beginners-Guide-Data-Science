Ingredients:
4 cups water
1/2 red onion, finely chopped
7 small fresh zucchini, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Bring water in a pot to a boil. Place finely chopped red onion in a sieve, submerge in boiling water, and blanch for 1 minute. Cool under running cold water and set aside.
Place zucchini slices into the boiling water and cook for 30 seconds. Remove and immediately cool in a bowl with ice water. Move zucchini around with a wooden spoon so they evenly cool. Drain and allow to drip dry.
Place zucchini in a salad bowl. Mix in mint and basil.
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl; pour over the salad and chill for 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
A lovely salad with thin slices of zucchini, red onion, fresh mint, and basil. Use a spiralizer or potato peeler to slice the zucchini as thinly as possible. I like to blanch the red onion but it's not completely necessary.
