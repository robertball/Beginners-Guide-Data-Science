Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups bread flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1 cup butter, melted
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup pecan pieces
12 individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped, or more as needed

Directions:
Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Mix brown sugar, butter, and white sugar together in a separate bowl; add egg, egg yolk, milk, and vanilla extract; stir until well mixed.
Slowly stir flour mixture into butter-sugar mixture until dough is thoroughly combined; fold in white chocolate chips and pecans. Refrigerate dough until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Scoop dough by rounded tablespoons onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes; rotate baking sheet and continue baking until cookies are golden brown, about 8 minutes more. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
Place caramels in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drizzle melted caramel over cooled cookies.
