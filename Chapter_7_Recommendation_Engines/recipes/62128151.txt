Ingredients:
1 (4 serving size) box of cranberry Jell-O
1 (4 serving size) box of strawberry Jell-O
2 cups of boiling water
1 (12 oz.) bottle COLD ginger ale
1 (11 oz.) can mandarin oranges, drained

Directions:
Stir boiling water into Jell-O in a 8-inch square pan for 2 minutes or until completely dissolved.  Stir in ginger ale.  Refrigerate for about 1 1/2 hours or until thickened (a spoon drawn thru the Jell-O leaves a definite impression).  Stir in mandarin oranges and refrigerate until firm.  Any combination of berry flavored jell-O will work.

Description: 
Two kinds of fruit flavored Jell-O made with cold ginger ale and mandarin oranges - tastes so much better than just plain old Jell-O.  Kids really like it & is easy to double.
