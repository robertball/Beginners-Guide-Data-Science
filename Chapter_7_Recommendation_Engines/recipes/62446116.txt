Ingredients:
Brownie
1	 bag (12 oz) miniature semisweet chocolate chips (2 cups)
2/3	 cup butter or margarine
1 1/2	 cups granulated sugar
1 1/2	 cups Gold Medal® all-purpose flour
1/2	 cup coarsely chopped nuts
1	 teaspoon baking powder
1	 teaspoon vanilla
1/2	 teaspoon salt
4	 eggs
Chocolate Chip Cream Frosting
2	 cups whipping cream
1/4	 cup powdered sugar
1	 teaspoon vanilla
2/3	 cup reserved miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. Line 15x10x1-inch pan with waxed paper or foil; grease with shortening. Reserve 1 cup of the chocolate chips for frosting and garnish.
In 3-quart saucepan, melt butter and remaining 1 cup chocolate chips over medium heat, stirring occasionally; remove from heat. Stir in granulated sugar, flour, nuts, baking powder, vanilla, salt and eggs. Spread evenly in pan.
Bake 18 to 23 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; turn upside down onto cooling rack. Carefully remove waxed paper. Cool brownie completely, about 1 hour.
In medium bowl, beat whipping cream, powdered sugar and vanilla with electric mixer on high speed until stiff. Stir in 2/3 cup chocolate chips.
Cut brownie crosswise into 4 equal pieces, 10x3 3/4 inches. Trim off stiff edges of brownie if necessary. Place 1 piece on serving plate; spread about 3/4 cup frosting over top. Repeat twice. Top with remaining brownie piece. Frost sides and top with remaining frosting. Garnish with reserved 1/3 cup chocolate chips. Cover; refrigerate at least 2 hours until chilled but no longer than 48 hours. Store covered in refrigerator.
