Ingredients:
12 Pounds Of Hamburger
1 Large 2 Pound Box Of Spaghetti
1 Cup Of Water
8 Envelope Packages McCormick Powdered Spaghetti Seasoning Mix
4 Tablespoons Of Butter
2 Orange Bell Peppers ( Washed & Cut In Squares )
2 Red Bell Peppers (Washed & Cut  Into Squares)
2 Gold Peppers (Washed * Cut Into Square Size Pieces)
1 Green Pepper
6 Small Onions (Chopped)
1 V-8 Juice (64 Ounce Bottle)
8 Cans Of Tomato Paste (6 Ounce Cans)
6 Cans Of Tomato Sauce (28 Ounce Cans)
3 Cans Of Diced Tomatoes (Basil & Oregano 28 Ounce Cans)
6 Tablespoons Of Sugar
1 Cup Of  Sweet Red Wine (Merlot)
2 Tablespoons Of Garlic Powder
12 Fresh Garlic Cloves Minced
10 Beef  Bouillon Cubes
10 Bay Leaves

Directions:
Cook Ground Beef (Being Sure To Drain The Fat Or Rinse The Meat In Hot Water After Cooking. Since This Is Such A Large Recipe I Usually Cook The Meat In 3-4 Different Batches And Reserve In The Fridge Until Its Time To Incorporate It Into The Pot. Bring 1 Cup Of Water  To A Boil With The Bay Leaves And Bouillon Cubes Until Bouillon Is Fully Dissolved, Strain Through Strainer Into Pot. Pour In Jug Of  V-8 Juice And Turn Heat To Medium. Pour In Seasoning Packets And Mix Well. (Sometimes I Use My Small Electric Handheld Mixer For This Part). Pour In Cans Of  Sauce. Spoon Cans Of Tomato Paste Into Mixture And Again Blend Well. Sauté Onions And Peppers On Medium Heat Until Soft With ½ Of The Minced Garlic And Butter. Put Other Half Into The Mixture. Pour Sugar And Garlic Powder Into Pot. Pour Wine In Pot And Mix. Pour In Diced Tomatoes And Meat At This Point And Fold In.  Let Simmer Slowly On Low Heat For 6-8 Hours Stirring Occasionally. The Longer The Sauce Simmers, The Better The Flavor Will Be. Pour Over Spaghetti And Enjoy With Garlic Bread And Garlic Salad.

Description: 
This Started Out As My Grandfathers Original Recipe And I Added Quite A Few  More Ingredients And Multiplied The Quantities Until I Got It Right,  Since I Have Such A Large Family That Loves THICK Spaghetti Sauce. They Always Complained No Matter What Version Was Bought Or Made They Didn’t Like The Flavor Or The Consistency. Everyone Loves And Has Settled On This FINAL Version.
