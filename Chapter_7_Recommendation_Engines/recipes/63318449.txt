Ingredients:
2 sticks salted butter (softened)
2 TBL pureed chipotle peppers
1 TBL fresh garlic (pressed)

1 tsp sea salt
1 tsp black pepper
1/4 cup fresh chopped flat leaf parsley

Directions:
Soften salted butter, add all ingredients and mix by hand, hand mixer or for best results, use paddle attachment on your KitchenAid Mixer.  Mix on mediium speed 7 or 8 minutes.  Scrape sides and mix for another 1 minute.  Ready to use.  Will hold in fridge for a month.  After it is whipped, it adds a wonderfully velvety flavor and texture to any protein.
