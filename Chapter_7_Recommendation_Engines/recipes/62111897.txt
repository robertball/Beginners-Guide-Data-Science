Ingredients:
1 lb. Hot breakfast sausage
Flour (approx 1/4-1/2 cup)
1 can evaporated milk
2 cans hot water
Salt
Pepper
Red Pepper flakes

Directions:
Scramble fry and brown sausage in skillet until done. Sprinkle in enough flour to absorb all the grease in the pan -- let brown and cook for about 5 mins to get the raw taste from the flour and brown well. Be sure to put enough flour that the grease is absorbed. Add 1 can evaporated milk and 2 cans hot water. Add the seasonings to taste. Stir well and simmer for at least 20 minutes allowing it to thicken and the flavors to meld. Add milk as needed to thin if it gets to thick in the simmering process. Serve over hot, baked biscuits. Can be multiplied easily depending on amount needed.
