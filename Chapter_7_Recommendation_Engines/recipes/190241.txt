Ingredients:
1 cup kimchi, drained and chopped
1/2 cup reserved juice from kimchi
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 green onion, chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
salt to taste
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon Korean chili pepper flakes (optional)
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Stir together the kimchi, kimchi juice, flour, eggs, and green onion in a bowl.
Heat vegetable oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Using about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake, pour into skillet, spreading as thin as possible. Cook pancakes until set and lightly browned, turning once, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Season to taste with salt.
Whisk together the rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, chili pepper flakes, and toasted sesame seeds. Serve with the pancakes.

Description: 
These Korean-style pancakes are served spicy, not sweet. They're great for getting rid of overly-fermented kimchi!
