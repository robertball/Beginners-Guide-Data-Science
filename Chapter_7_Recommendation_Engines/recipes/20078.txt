Ingredients:
3 zucchini
1 large onion
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Grate zucchini and onion into a medium bowl, and drain off excess juices. Stir in the oregano and salt and pepper to taste.
Heat a frying pan over medium high heat and melt butter in the pan. When butter has coated the pan, arrange the zucchini in a flat layer over the bottom of the pan. Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Serve warm.

Description: 
I like to grate & freeze zucchini. Just be sure to drain well before using. Also you can slice & freeze separate slices on a cookie sheet and then put into bags and they won't stick together.
