Description: 
Delicious crispy asparagus grilled on an open flame releases the flavor and makes kids love their veggies! You can add or reduce cook time to your liking. Less time will make the asparagus snap more easily, but cooking longer will make them extra crispy and delicious for dipping. Use 1/2 cup melted butter for dipping.
