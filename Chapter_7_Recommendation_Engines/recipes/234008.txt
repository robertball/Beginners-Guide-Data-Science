Ingredients:
2 hard bread cakes, such as PurityÂ®, split horizontally
1 pound salt cod steaks, skinned and cut into 1/2-inch strips
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound fatback, diced

Directions:
Place hard bread into a pot. Cover bread with several inches of cool water, place a lid on the pot, and soak 8 hours to overnight.
Rinse salt cod under running cool water; place into a pot. Cover fish with several inches of cold water, place a lid on the pot, and soak in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
Add salt to soaked bread and bring just to a simmer over medium-low heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Drain immediately; cover to keep warm.
Drain fish and cover with fresh water; bring to a boil. Cook until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain fish; remove any bones. Stir fish into prepared hard bread.
Cook and stir fatback in a frying pan over medium heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Pour fatback and drippings over fish and bread mixture. Stir gently just to combine; serve immediately.
