Ingredients:
1 cup MUSSELMAN'S® Apple Butter
1/2 cup hot sauce (use your favorite brand and level of heat)
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
2 pounds uncooked chicken wings, cut in 2 sections, or chicken drummettes (can also use fresh chicken tenders)
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
Mix together the apple butter, hot sauce, ketchup, and celery salt in a medium bowl. Reserve 3/4 cup of the sauce as a dip; cover and refrigerate.
Place the wings in plastic zip storage bag with the remaining sauce. Seal the bag and coat all the wings. Refrigerate 2 hours to overnight.
For easy cleanup, line baking pan (about 10x13-inch) with foil. Remove wings from the marinade bag and place in a single layer in the pan. Reserve the bag of marinade.
Bake wings for 30 minutes. Turn wings and baste with the remaining marinade. Bake an additional 30 minutes or until wings are fork-tender. Discard any remaining marinade in the bag.
Warm the 3/4 cup of reserved sauce with the melted butter and serve as a dipping sauce with wings.
