Ingredients:
8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (thighs work better in this recipe than breasts); about 2 pounds
2 tsp. vegetable oil
Glaze:
1/2 cup honey
1 Tbsp. cider vinegar
Rub:
2 tsp. granulated garlic
2 tsp. chili powder
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. coriander
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. cumin
1/2 tsp. chipotle chili powder

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium-high heat or about 400 degrees F.
Combine rub ingredients in a small bowl.
Trim any visable fat off the chicken thighs, rinse, and pat dry with a paper towel. Drizzle oil over chicken and rub it in with your hands. Rub the spice rub into the chicken thighs. Grill for 3-5 minutes on each side.
For the glze: while chicken is cooking, warm honey in the microwave for about 15 seconds. Whisk in vinegar. Reserve 2 tablespoons glaze and brush the rest on the chicken in the final moments of cooking. Remove chicken from the grill and allow to stand 3-5 minutes. Drizzle reserved 2 tablespoons of glaze over the chicken while it's standing.
