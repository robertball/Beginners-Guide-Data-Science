Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tbsp sugar
1/2 cup shortening, chilled
3 tablespoons ice water

Directions:
Whisk the flour, sugar and salt together in a medium size bowl.  With a pastry blender, cut in the cold shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Drizzle 2 to 3 tablespoons ice water over flour.  Toss mixture with a fork to moisten, adding more water a few drops at a time until the dough comes together.
Gently gather dough particles together into a ball.  Wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes before rolling.
Roll out dough, and put in a pie plate.  Fill with desired filling and bake.
