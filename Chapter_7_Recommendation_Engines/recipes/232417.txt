1 1/4 cups self-rising flour
1/2 cup white sugar

1 cup sweetened flaked coconut (optional)
2/3 cup miniature chocolate chips
1 unbaked frozen pie shell

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until foamy. Add flour, white sugar, and brown sugar; beat into the eggs. Blend butter, milk, and vanilla extract into the egg mixture. Stir walnuts, coconut, and chocolate chips into the egg mixture; pour into the pie shell. Place pie onto a baking sheet.

Description: 
The original concept is from Nestle®, but this is my version of the Toll House® pie. The original version was dense and greasy; mine is more cake-like. I strongly recommend using miniature chocolate chips, as when I tried it with full-sized ones, they melted and sank to the bottom of the pie and formed a large mass.
