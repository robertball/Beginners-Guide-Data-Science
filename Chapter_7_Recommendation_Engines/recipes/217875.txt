Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup chicken broth
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup onion, chopped
1 cup buttery round crackers, crushed
1 (8 ounce) can crabmeat
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
To make sauce: melt butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour until smooth, Cook and stir 5 minutes, then gradually stir in broth, milk and white wine. Cook on low until sauce thickens fully, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Mix together onion, cracker crumbs, crab meat, parsley, and 1/4 cup of the sauce.
Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. Spoon 1/4 of the crab mixture on the edge of each chicken breast; roll up. Place chicken rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish, fold side down, then top with remaining white sauce.
Cover dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or until chicken juices run clear, about 1 hour. Sprinkle with cheese and bake, uncovered, until the cheese is lightly browned, about 5 minutes more.
