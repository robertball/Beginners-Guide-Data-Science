Ingredients:
1 lb butter, melted
3 to 4 oz. (3/8 to 1/2 cup) worcestershire sauce
4 Tbsp. freshly cracked black pepper
1 tsp. dried rosemary
2 tsp. Hot Sauce (such as Tabasco)
2 tsp. salt
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 large lemons, or six of the smaller ones
5-6 lbs raw, medium, E-Z peel shrimp in shell

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Thinly slice two/three lemons and juice the other 2/3 lemons.  Set aside.
(If E-Z peel shrimp are not available, slit shrimp shells down the back with a paring knife or kitchen shears)
Devein shrimp under cold running water.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except for shrimp and SLICED lemons.
Pour about 1/2 cup (or enough to cover bottom) of previous sauce in bottom of a LARGE baking dish.
Place a layer of lemon slices on top of sauce, followed by a layer of shrimp.  Repeat until all lemon and shrimp is in the dish with about an inch head room left.
Pour remaining sauce over shrimp.
Bake at 400 degrees F, stirring once or twice for about 30 minutes, or until shrimp are done.
Serve family style with the baking dish in the center of the table, and bowls for the shells dispersed to guests.  Hot, crusty baguettes are a must for sopping the sauce.

Description: 
This spicy, buttery, and succulant shrimp may be messy to eat, but it's so good, you just won't care!  Served family style, it's a party in a pan.  Have plenty of hot, crusty baguettes for sopping the sauce!  I got the recipe from my mother's friend, Eddie Ann, and it's always a hit.
