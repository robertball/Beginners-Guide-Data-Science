Ingredients:
9 yellow bell peppers
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 egg
1 onion, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans tomato juice
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

Directions:
Cut the tops off the peppers and remove seeds and stems. Set aside.
Place rice in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then drain water. In a large bowl, mix together rice, ground beef, egg, onion, salt, and pepper.
Stuff each pepper with an equal amount of beef mixture, then place peppers in a pot large enough to hold them in a single layer. Pour tomato juice into pot. Cover pot and simmer over low heat for 90 minutes, until ground beef is fully cooked and rice is tender.
In a medium bowl, mix together sour cream and flour. Whisk in 1 cup of tomato juice from pot, then pour mixture back into pot. Allow to simmer an additional 5 minutes, then serve peppers with juice spooned over top.
