Ingredients:
1 pound sweet Italian sausage (or regular sausage)
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup minced onion
6 cloves garlic, crushed
2 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
4 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
4 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoons white sugar
3 teaspoons dried basil leaves
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.
Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tsp salt, pepper, and 4 tablespoons parsley.
Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Soak noodles in hot water for 20-30 minutes to soften.  (They will cook the rest of the way in the oven.)
In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
To assemble: (1) Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.  (2) Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.  (3) Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. (4) Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. (5) Sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  (6) Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
