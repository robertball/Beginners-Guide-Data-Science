Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 apple, cored and diced
1/2 cup fresh cranberries
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine water, apple, and cranberries together in a bowl; bring to a boil. Cook mixture until cranberries burst and apple is tender, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt into apple mixture. Cook, stirring continuously, until water is absorbed and oatmeal thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Top oatmeal with walnuts.

Description: 
I made this one morning in an effort to use up leftover cranberries from Thanksgiving. It's filling, healthy, and delicious! If you generally make oatmeal with milk instead of water, don't! The acid in the cranberries will make the milk separate. I tried it. It will still taste okay, but it won't look very pretty.
