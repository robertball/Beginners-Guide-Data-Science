Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
2 cups whipping cream
1 1/4 cups packed golden brown sugar
6 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Combine milk and cream in a heavy medium saucepan.  Bring just to a simmer; remove from heat.  Place sugar in a heavy large saucepan.  Stir over medium heat until sugar melts (some soft lumps will remain) and is deep brown, about 15 minutes.  Stir constantly, and don't leave the stove!  Whisk in hot milk mixture.  Stir over low heat until caramel bits melt, about 10 minutes (mixture may look curdled).  Whisk yolks in a large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk in brown sugar mixture.  Return mixture to same saucepan.  Stir over low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when a finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil).  Cool.  Mix in vanilla.
Puree custard in batches in blender until very smooth.  Refrigerate until cold; at least 1 hour or overnight.
Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions (mine takes about 20 minutes).  Transfer to container; cover and freeze until firm.

Description: 
This is an incredibly rich ice cream that is ALWAYS requested specially by some friends of mine when I ask them over for dinner.  It's simple to make, but be careful when melting the sugar; you might think it's never going to do anything, then it starts to go...QUICKLY.  Be sure to take it off heat as soon as its completely melted.  I've used dark brown sugar, too, but I don't think it made much of a difference.
