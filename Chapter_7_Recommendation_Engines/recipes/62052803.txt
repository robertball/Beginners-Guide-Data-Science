Ingredients:
4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
2 cups sour cream & onion potato chips (crushed)
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
Non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425Â°.
Crush potato chips either by hand with a rolling pin or in a blender/food processor.
In a small bowl, place the milk and egg and beat lightly.
On a piece of wax paper, place potato chip crumbs, thyme and pepper. Line a shallow baking pan with foil and spray with vegetable cooking spray.
Dip each chicken breast in egg-milk mixture; then roll in seasoned crumbs and arrange in a single layer on foil-lined baking pan. Repeat until all chicken is arranged in the pan.
Let sit 15 minutes. Drizzle melted butter or margarine over the chicken and bake for 30 minutes, or until the coating is crunchy and the chicken is cooked through.
