Ingredients:
Sriracha Mayo:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce
Pickle Chips:
1 (16 ounce) jar dill pickle chips
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt

1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
cooking spray

Directions:
Mix mayonnaise and sriracha sauce together in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Heat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Drain pickles and dry them on paper towels.
Mix egg and milk together in a bowl. Mix flour, cornmeal, seasoned salt, paprika, garlic powder, and black pepper together in another bowl.
Dip pickle chips in egg mixture, then in flour mixture, coating both sides and lightly pressing flour mixture into chips.
Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place pickle chips in the basket in a single layer; split into 2 batches if necessary.
Cook for 4 minutes; carefully flip chips. Cook until desired brownness, about 4 minutes more. Serve with sriracha mayo.

Description: 
This crispy and satisfying appetizer is a lower-guilt alternative to deep-fried pickle chips. Using pre-sliced pickle chips is a shortcut that makes this quick to prepare. You can reduce the sriracha sauce to 1 tablespoon if you like a milder sauce.
