Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground pork
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers, or as needed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cooked chicken breast, shredded
1 1/4 quarts chicken broth
1 small head bok choy, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Mix pork, shrimp, water chestnuts, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Reserve 1/3 of the filling mixture for the soup. Wrap about 1 tablespoon of the remaining filling in a wonton wrapper. Repeat until all of the filling is used up.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken and the reserved filling. Mix well. Add chicken broth; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Drop the filled wontons into the soup one by one. Boil until wontons float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bok choy; boil until tender, about 2 minute more. Garnish with green onions.

Description: 
Despite its name, this Pinoy pancit dish has no noodles, just wonton-like dumplings in place of the noodles. It is a soup dish served as a snack or as an appetizer before lunch or dinner. Use my recipe for homemade wonton wrappers (see Footnote).
