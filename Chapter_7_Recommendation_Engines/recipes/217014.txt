Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons grapefruit juice
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon grated grapefruit zest
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup grapefruit juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
Mix 1 1/2 teaspoon of grapefruit juice into milk in a small bowl, and set aside for about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mash the butter with 3/4 cup of sugar until creamy and well combined, and beat in the egg and grapefruit zest until thoroughly combined. Beat the milk into the butter mixture about 2 tablespoons at a time, alternating with the flour mixture, until the dough is smooth. Drop by teaspoons onto ungreased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until set and very lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on racks.
Make glaze by mixing 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup grapefruit juice. Brush glaze onto cooled cookies; let stand until glaze is set.

Description: 
My mother originally made these in her culinary arts class in high school in 1975 and they were made with lemon. I love the lemon but I wanted to make these and realized I didn't have any lemons so I used what I did have, grapefruit. They turned out wonderful! I bet they would be good made with oranges too. The glaze is different from your regular iced cookie with the granulated sugar giving a nice texture on top. Yummy!
