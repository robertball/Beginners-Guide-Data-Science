Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp brown sugar

Directions:
Place the diced sweet potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water. Boil until the potatoes are fork tender and still firm, about 12-15 minutes. Drain and cool the cooked potatoes slightly.
In a sauce pan melt butter. Stir in sugar, brandy and salt until sugar dissolves.
Add potatoes; stir over low heat until potatoes are well glazed and heated through.

Description: 
my mother has used this recipe for 40 years. Substituted fresh sweet potatoes in place of the frozen or canned sweet potatoes the original recipe called for. We make this for the holiday dinners every year.
