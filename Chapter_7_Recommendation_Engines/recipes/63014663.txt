Ingredients:
2-1/4 cups (11 1/4 oz) all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1-1/2 cups (10 1/2 oz) sugar, plus 1/3 cup for rolling
2 oz. cream cheese, cut into 8 pieces
1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut, chopped fine
1 teaspoon lime zest
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and still warm
1/3 cup vegetable (or canola) oil
1 large egg
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon lime juice

Directions:
1.	Preheat oven to 350 F.
2.	In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, coconut, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
3.	In a large bowl add 1 1/2 cups of sugar, the lime zest, and cream cheese yet. Put the remaining 1/3 cup sugar in a pie plate and set aside.
4.	Pour the warm butter over the cream cheese mixture and whisk to combine - the mixture won't be completely smooth yet, that's fine.
5.	Add the oil, egg, milk and lime juice. Mix until smooth.
6.	Use a rubber spatula to fold the dry ingredients into the wet, until a soft dough comes together.
7.	Using a small cookie scoop form the dough into balls, roll in the reserved sugar and place on cookies sheets. When cookie sheet is full, use the bottom of a drinking glass to gently flatten cookies down into a disk. Try to work quickly as handling the dough too will produce flatter cookies
8.	Bake the cookies, 1 tray at a time, for about 11-13 minutes, or until the edges are set and beginning to brown. The tops will be puffy and slightly cracked.
9.	Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes then transfer them to the rack to cool completely.
