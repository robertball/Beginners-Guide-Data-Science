Ingredients:
1 1/2 cup almond butter and/or peanut butter
2/3 cup coconut oil
1 cup honey and/or agave syrup
3 cups gluten free oats
1 1/2 cup gluten free rice crisp cereal
1/3 cup unsweetened dried coconut
1 cup chopped raw almonds and/or cashews
1/2 cup raw sesame seeds
1/2 cup chia seeds
1/2 cup flax seed meal
1/2 cup cocoa nibs
1 cup dried cranberries and/or wild blueberries
2/3 cup chocolate or carob chips (vegan)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees
In either a sauce pan on low heat or in a microwave in a ceramic bowl, melt the almond butter, coconut oil, and honey/agave syrups until softened and easily blended.  Be careful to blend the coconut oil fully as it has a tendency to have little balls of unmelted oil remaining.
In a large mixing bowl, toss all the remaining ingredients with the melted portion until fully mixed.
In a large cookie sheet pan (10 x 15") with at least a 1/2 inch rim, place a layer of aluminum foil so that there is ample foil laying over the lengthwise handles/ends with which to pull out the cooked bars at the end. Spray the foil liberally with pan coating. With moistened hands, press the mixture into every space of the sheet pan until it is very compact.
Bake at 300 degrees for 15 minutes.  Allow to cool before pulling out the granola block and slicing into 30 bars.

Description: 
Tired of overpaying for gluten free or vegan foods, but you don't want to spend hours cooking?  This was what I came up with in very little time from various heart healthy ingredients in my cupboard.  That my children eat them was testimony that kids love healthy foods, especially if they're part of the cooking process. A home run: easy, healthy, and delicious.
