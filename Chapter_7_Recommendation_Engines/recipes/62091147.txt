1 1/3 cups heavy cream
2 cups Raspberry Jam
1 carton Cool Whip
1 teaspoon real vanilla extract

Preheat oven according to instructions on cake mix.
Grease a 9/13 inch pan.
Prepare Cake mix as directed on box; BUT substitute the water with the heavy whipping cream.  Mix with an electric mixer just until combined (batter will be very thick).
Bake for 23-25 minutes until edges are slightly brown and middle of cake springs back when touched.
Immediately poke holes with a large skewer.
Warm jam in microwave just until liquefied, pour it all over the top of the cake while the cake is still warm.
Add vanilla and pudding mix to cool whip and fold in until well combined.
Cover and refrigerate the cool whip mixture over night and cover cake once it's cooled and allow to sit overnight.  Frost cake with the cool whip mixture and keep cake refrigerated until ready to serve.

Description: 
I came up with this refreshing, rich, delicious cake for a friend's birthday and have been asked to bring it to many functions since then.  The subsitution of heavy cream in the cake mix and the pudding added to make an easy frosting makes it taste like a from scratch cake, yet it's so easy.  Hope you enjoy it!!
