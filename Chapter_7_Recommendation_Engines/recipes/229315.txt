Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 small onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
¼ cup peanut butter
1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
8  flour tortillas
¼ cup sour cream, or as needed
¼ cup salsa, or as needed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in peanut butter until melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Mash sweet potatoes into onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through and creamy, about 5 minutes. Fold in cilantro and black beans.
Stack tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a paper towel; cook in microwave until just warmed, about 30 seconds. Spread sweet potato mixture onto each tortilla; fold each tortilla around the filling, creating an envelope shape. Top each with a dollop of sour cream. Cut each roll-up in half; serve with salsa.

Description: 
Great recipe idea for 'Meatless Mondays!' Don't let the ingredient list fool you. The flavor combination is awesome. Plate these up with the fold-side down and they will travel better! I never bring any of these home from a potluck.
