Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
10 ounces ground chicken
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons curry powder
2 pounds pumpkin, seeded and diced
1 large onion, diced
1  green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1  red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1  carrot, peeled and diced
3 cups water
2 tablespoons chicken broth powder
3 tablespoons ketchup
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large nonstick pot over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.
Stir flour and curry powder into the pot, mixing until well-blended with the chicken. Add pumpkin, onion, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and carrot. Stir in water, chicken broth powder, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce; mix until curry is well-combined.
Cover pot. Reduce heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry is thick and stew-like, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This is a stew-like Japanese-style curry that don't use a curry or roux block. 
Since my relative grows a huge amount of summer veggies every year, I came up with this recipe!
 My husband and his co-workers really adore this curry so much that he hates roux-based curry now.
 You only need one nonstick pot to make this, so clean-up is easy! To serve Japanese-style, serve in a deep plate next to a scoop of rice. You can also this with pasta.
