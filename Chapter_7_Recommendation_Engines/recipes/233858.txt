Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 tablespoon melted butter, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 green onions, finely chopped
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Unroll crescent roll dough on the prepared baking sheet. Spread butter over dough and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese and green onion. Season with garlic powder.
Roll dough back to its original shape. Cut dough with a sharp knife into 8 even slices. Arrange slices cut-side up on the baking sheet about 1 inch apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 9 to 12 minutes.
