Ingredients:
?1 (18.25-ounce) box white cake mix
?1 (3-ounce) box strawberry-flavored instant gelatin
?1 (15-ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed and pureed
?4 large eggs
?½ cup vegetable oil
?¼ cup water
?Strawberry cream cheese frosting, recipe follows
?Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting
?¼ cup butter, softened
?1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
?1 (10-ounce) package frozen strawberries in syrup, thawed and pureed
?½ teaspoon strawberry extract
?7 cups confectioners’ sugar
?Freshly sliced strawberries, for garnish, optional

Directions:
2.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.
3.In a large bowl, combine cake mix and gelatin. Add pureed strawberries, eggs, oil, and water; beat at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour into prepared pans, and bake for 20 minutes, or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
4.Let cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans, and cool completely on wire racks.
5.For the frosting:
6.In a large bowl, beat butter and cream cheese at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. Beat in ¼ cup of the strawberry puree and the strawberry extract. (The rest of the puree is leftover but can be used in smoothies or on ice cream for a delicious treat.) Gradually add confectioners’ sugar, beating until smooth.
7.Spread frosting in between layers and on top and sides of cake. Garnish with sliced fresh strawberries, if desired.
