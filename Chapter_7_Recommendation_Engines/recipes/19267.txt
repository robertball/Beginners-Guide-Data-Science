Ingredients:
1 cup shortening
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon orange zest
3/8 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the orange juice, vanilla and orange zest. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into shapes with cookie cutters or stamps. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto an unprepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
