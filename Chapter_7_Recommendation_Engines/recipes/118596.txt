Ingredients:
1 small eggplant, peeled and coarsely chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (8 ounce) can no-salt-added tomato sauce
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
1 cup reduced-fat ricotta cheese
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, divided
1/2 cup egg substitute
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
6 manicotti shells, cooked, rinsed and drained

Directions:
In a large skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook and stir the eggplant, onion, garlic, tarragon and thyme until vegetables are tender. Add tomatoes and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 3-4 minutes. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the spinach, ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella, egg substitute, Parmesan and parsley; mix well. Stuff into manicotti shells. Place in an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon eggplant sauce over manicotti; sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until heated through.
