Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups warm milk
1 1/2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening
1 tablespoon salt
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup fruit preserves

Directions:
Pour warm milk over yeast, and let dissolve.  Then add sugar, shortening, salt, eggs, egg yolks, and flour.  Stir until well combined.  Remove dough to a well oiled bowl, and turn once to coat the surface.  Cover, and place in a warm spot.  Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Dish out dough with a tablespoon, and roll into balls.  Brush each with shortening, and let rise until doubled in bulk.
Flatten the balls, and make a depression in the centers.  Fill with fruit preserves.  Allow to rise.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
