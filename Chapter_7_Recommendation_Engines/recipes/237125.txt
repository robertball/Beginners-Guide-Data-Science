Ingredients:
4 tilapia fillets
1 1/2 cups orange juice
6 tablespoons butter, softened
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
3 tablespoons orange juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil
1/2 cup orange juice

Directions:
Pour 1 1/2 cups orange juice into a resealable plastic bag. Add tilapia fillets, coat with the juice, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 3 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Whisk butter, panko bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons orange juice, garlic, and basil together in a bowl.
Remove tilapia from the orange juice and shake to remove excess liquid; arrange fillets in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Discard marinade.
Pour 1/2 cup orange juice over the tilapia fillets. Spread butter mixture over the top of the filets to cover each completely.
Bake in preheated oven until the liquid is bubbling and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
