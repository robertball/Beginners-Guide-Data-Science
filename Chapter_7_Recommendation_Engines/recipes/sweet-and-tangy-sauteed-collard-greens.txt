Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 Vidalia or other sweet onion, sliced
1 1/2 pounds collard greens - rinsed, trimmed and chopped
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
5 tablespoons melted butter
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.  Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in collard greens, in batches if necessary, until they wilt slightly and all fit in the skillet.  Pour in water and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, regulating heat to prevent burning. Drain.
Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, honey, ginger and butter together in a serving bowl for dressing.  Add greens to bowl and toss with dressing.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; serve warm.
