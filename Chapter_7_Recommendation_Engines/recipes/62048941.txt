Ingredients:
1 stick butter
1 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 lb. Velveeta cheese, cubed
2 cups cheddar cheese, grated
1/2 cup thick and chunky salsa
1/2 cup thick and chunky sals verde or 2 4oz. cans diced green chilies
1 can Rotel tomatoes, diced
5 - 10 drops Tabasco
1/2 cup milk to adjust consistancy

Directions:
Melt butter and saute onions in large saucepan.  Add Velveeta stir constantly until melted.  Add cheddar cheese; stirring until melted.  Add remaining ingredients except milk.  Heat through; remove from heat; adjust consistancy with milk.  Do not over heat after milk is added.  Milk will curdle.

Description: 
I concocted this recipe because I couldn't find one without red chili included.  Goes great over Chimichangas or use as a dip.  It can be as thick or thin as you like by adjusting consistancy with milk.
