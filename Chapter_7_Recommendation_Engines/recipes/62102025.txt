Ingredients:
2 - 32 oz. boxes of good chicken broth/stock
1 med. yellow onion, halved and sliced thin
2-3 stalks celery, sliced thin
2 carrots, peeled, halved, sliced thin
1 heaping tsp. minced garlic
1 can white chicken meat, drained
3 T. good sherry
1 T. dried parsley flakes
1/4 tsp. ground pepper
1/2 tsp. salt (or to taste)
1-2 cups "Kluski" noodles, broken up a bit

Directions:
In a med. size pot, heat chicken broth/stock.
Add celery, carrots, onions, garlic, sherry, parsley, salt and pepper.
Simmer for 35-40 minutes.
Then add Kluski noodles (I never use wide egg noodles as they take up too much of the broth, but use what you have on hand)and increase heat to med. high so noodles will cook faster. Kluski noodles are a bit thicker and require more time to cook - about 15 minutes. If using wide egg noodles, don't adjust heat - just let them simmer till tender.
