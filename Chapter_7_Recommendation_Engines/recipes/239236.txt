Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 dash vanilla extract, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl; make a well in the center. Beat milk, egg, 2 tablespoons oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into the well in the flour mixture and stir until batter is smooth.
Drop about 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

No! It's French toast pancakes! 

A family favorite as we can never decide on French toast or pancakes. Great for holiday breakfasts to keep the kids from snitching.
