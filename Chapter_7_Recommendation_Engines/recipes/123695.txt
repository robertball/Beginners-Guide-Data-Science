Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold butter or margarine
1/2 cup sour milk*
1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
Additional sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add milk and lemon peel, stirring just until mixed. Turn onto a floured surface; knead gently six times. Shape into a ball. On a greased baking sheet, pat dough into a circle about 1/2 in thick and 8-1/2 in. in diameter. Using a sharp knife, cut wedges in the dough, being careful not to cut all the way through. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.

Description: 
These delicate scones are the perfect lightly sweet treat to serve with coffee or tea at any holiday get-together. It's a simple bread since, like biscuits, it doesn't require much kneading and there's no need to let the dough rise.
