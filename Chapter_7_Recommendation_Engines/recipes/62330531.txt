Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/4 cups warm water
4 tsp. active dry yeast
1 T. oil
1 T. instant coffee
1 T. caraway seeds
1 1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup rye flour
1/3 cup cocoa
1/2 cup molasses
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour

Directions:
Combine whole wheat flour, yeast and water in small bowl.  Let froth and bubble for about 10 minutes.  This proofing ensures that the yeast is active.
Combine oil, instant coffee, caraway seeds, salt, rye flour, cocoa and molasses in large bowl, add proofed yeast mixture.  Add all purpose flour.
Turn onto floured board, knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.  Place dough in greased bowl.  Cover with warm damp towel or plastic wrap, let rise until doubled, about one hour.
Heat oven to 450. Bring 1 gallon water to boil.
Divide dough into 13 pieces, shape in balls.  Press hole in center, pull dough out to form 1" inner hole, keeping dough about 1/2" thick.  Drop dough pieces into boiling water, flip to other side after 45 seconds, remove after other side has been in boiling water for 45 seconds. Drain for 1 minute.  Place on greased cookie sheet.
Bake for 8-10 minutes, until just starting to brown on bottom.
