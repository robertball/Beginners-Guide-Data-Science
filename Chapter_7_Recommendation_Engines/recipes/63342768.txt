Ingredients:
1/2 cup diced onion
4 cloves minced garlic
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup minced fresh basil
1/2 lb. Al Fresco Roasted Red Pepper and Asiago Sausage, cut into 1/2 inch dice
3 small tomatoes
1 cup shredded mozzarella, divided
1 cup yellow corn meal
1 cup all purpose flour
2 Tbs. sugar
4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Spray muffin tin with cooking spray.  In a small skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add onions, sauteing for 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute another 2 minutes.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.  Slice tomatoes crossways into 4 slices each.  Place on a paper towel to drain, and press lightly on the tops to absorb moisture, and set aside.
Combine yellow corn meal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, pepper, and pepper flakes in a bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk egg into milk.  Add egg mixture, cooked onions, garlic and oil to dry ingredients.  Stir to combine.  Add 1/2 cup mozzarella and basil.  Divide batter evenly into prepared muffin pan.  Top each muffin with a tomato slice, and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.
Bake 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cool in the pan 5 minutes, then serve.
