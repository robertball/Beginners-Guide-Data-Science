2 cups all purpose flour
1 tbs baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1/8 cup vegetable oil
10oz real fruit jam-refrigerated

Directions:
In large bowl, mix flour, salt and baking powder, set aside. In medium mixing bowl, cream sugar, oil and butter together. Add egg and mix in. Add cream and mix well. Add to flour mixture, all at once. Mix together just until blended. Add jam (this is important, the jam must be cold or you will end up with a mess!!) cut jam into smallish chunks while mixing into batter. Divide into 12 muffin tins. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until sides of muffins pull away from sides slightly. Let cool 10 minutes on baking rack before taking out of pan. Enjoy!

Description: 
Tender, buttery, jam filled muffins. These muffins taste like buttered jelly biscuits and are very delicate. If you expect a typical muffin, these aren't for you. also, please, do not review if you are just looking to get your own recipe out there. If you start out with mine and then make a bunch of changes, then enter your own recipe. If you actually made my recipe, then please review it! I want to know how you liked it!
