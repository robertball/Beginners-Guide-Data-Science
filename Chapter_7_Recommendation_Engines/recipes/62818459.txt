Jeweled Pancake Muffins - Puffins Recipe

Ingredients:
1 cup Bread Flour
1 teaspoon Baking Powder
1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
1/4 teaspoon Salt
2 tablespoons Sugar
2/3 cup Buttermilk [ or 2/3 cup regular Milk with 1 Tbsp of White Vinegar let sit for 5-10 minutes]
1 Large Egg
2 tablespoons Pure Maple Syrup [Optional]
2 tablespoons melted Butter
1/2 cup Reese's Pieces [ or any other mix in you prefer, we also really like to add coined maple breakfast sausage its like little pigs in a blanket]

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a mini muffin tin [ I use the kind of baking spray with flour in it]
Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar in a medium bowl. Sire together with a wire whisk.
In another bowl, stir buttermilk [or buttermilk substitute], egg, maple syrup[optional], and melted butter until just combined.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until combined. You want to make sure no lumps are left.
Stir in Reese's Pieces or your choice of mix-in. Reserve a few pieces to sprinkle on the tops.  [If you put in coined sausages try sprinkling a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top]
Bake for 9-12 minutes. Or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cool slightly  about 3 minutes and remove from the pan.
Serve immediately.  These are really good with a side of maple syrup, or even melted butter; however, plain is good too. I really like them without the mix-ins and peanut butter on top.
ENJOY!

Description: 
I love pancakes, I hate everyone else eating fresh pancakes while i am still flipping them.  Especially if the ones left for me are the first ones i made... i.e cold. This recipe ensures that all the Puffins are done at once. You can add a plethora of mix ins like fresh fruit or a staple in our house Reese's Pieces.
