Ingredients:
3 Tbsp ground turmeric
1 cup honey
1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1 Tbsp coconut oil

Directions:
In a sealable jar add all the ingredients and mix well with a butter knife until thoroughly combined. Add 1 tsp or more to taste to any hot beverage. Add about 1 Tbsp per person to any soup, stew or any savoury dish. Always allow the paste to heat for at least 5 minutes in any of these before consuming.
Keep any leftovers in the refrigerator up to two weeks. Just give it a stir every other day to help the flavours meld.
