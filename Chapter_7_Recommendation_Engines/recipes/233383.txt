Ingredients:
14 anchovy fillets, finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh rosemary
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
6 cloves garlic, minced
4 (1-inch thick) bone-in pork chops
coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste
butter-flavored cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)

Directions:
Whisk anchovies, rosemary, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic together in a large bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag.
Season pork chops with coarse salt and ground black pepper; add to the plastic bag with the marinade, squeeze out as much air from bag as possible, and seal. Turn bag a few times to assure chops are coated in marinade.
Marinate chops in refrigerator at least 2 hours.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Prepare a jelly roll pan with cooking spray.
Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade.
Cook under the broiler until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
This unusual pairing caught my eye one day in an old cookbook of my mother's which I was reading. I love those three ingredients but I wasn't too sure I'd like them together. Well, I'll leave that to you but my finicky husband asked me what made those chops taste soooo good!
