Ingredients:
1 ripe pear - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1 clove garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1/4 cup white balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup olive oil

Directions:
Blend the pear, white wine, garlic, Dijon mustard, white balsamic vinegar, black pepper, and sea salt in a blender until well combined; drizzle the olive oil into the mixture in a thin, steady stream while continuing to blend. Blend a few seconds longer until the salad dressing is thick and creamy.

Description: 
This is a light and lovely salad dressing that lends itself well to a simple and elegant salad. I love to use it on a salad of butter lettuce, arugula, goat cheese, and caramelized pecans - simply delicious!
