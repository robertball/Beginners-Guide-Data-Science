Ingredients:
2 tablespoons chocolate syrup (such as Hershey's®)
ice
1/2 cup vodka (such as Absolut®)
1 fluid ounce chocolate liqueur (such as Godiva®)
1 fluid ounce white creme de cacao
2 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Drizzle the chocolate syrup into two martini glasses, start 2/3 of the way up the side of the glass, and let the chocolate run to the bottom; set aside.
Place the ice into a cocktail shaker. Pour in the vodka, chocolate liqueur, and creme de cacao. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the prepared martini glasses. Garnish with maraschino cherries to serve.

Description: 
These chocolate martinis are served in martini glasses coated with chocolate syrup and garnished with maraschino cherries. Use the cherries to slowly stir the chocolate syrup into the drink. It is delicious! I served this with a chocolate-bacon bruschetta.
