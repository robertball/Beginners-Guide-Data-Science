Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds thin asparagus, trimmed and cut into 4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound mixed salad greens
1 apple - peeled, cored, and sliced thin
1/4 pound shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Arrange asparagus pieces on a baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil over the asparagus; toss gently to coat and spread into a single layer.
Roast asparagus in preheated oven until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.
Combine honey, white wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and garlic in a jar; seal tightly and shake vigorously to blend into a salad dressing.
Arrange salad greens onto a large platter; top with apple slices, shredded white Cheddar cheese, and cooled asparagus.
Drizzle the salad dressing over the salad greens and toppings.
