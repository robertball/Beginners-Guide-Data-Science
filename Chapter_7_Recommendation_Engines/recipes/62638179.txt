Ingredients:
1 pkg dry yeast
1 1/4 cup 120 degree water
1 tsp salt
t tbs sugar
3 cups King Arthur Bread flour
3 tbs olive oil

Directions:
Pour 1 1/4 cups of 120 degree water into a large bowl (I use a glass bowl).  Add yeast and mix well to dissolve (about 1 minute).  Add salt and sugar, and half the flour.  Mix well with a sturdy spoon.  Add flour slowly until it is no longer sticky.  Dump mixture out onto a floured surface and knead in remaining flour.   Keep flour on hand to dust surface, and knead for 8 minutes.  If it gets too sticky, add a little more flour.  After 8+ minutes, it should be smooth and of an elastic texture.  Add olive oil to mixing bowl.  Form into a nice round ball, making the surface as smooth as possible and place back into the mixing bowl and turn turn gently to cover the dough in the oil.  Cover with plastic wrap and a clean dry town, place in a warm place for 30-45 minutes.  Dough should double in size.  Remove from bowl and punch down, divide into two equal sized portions, and form as before.  I place them now on a cookie sheet, and cover them again to allow them to rise another 30 minutes.
After second rising, they will stretch nicely and evenly.  I cook my pizzas on a stone for 20 minutes at 400 deg.
