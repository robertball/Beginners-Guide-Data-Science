1 tablespoon sunflower oil
1  onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
4 cups peeled and cubed sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon mild curry powder
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook onion, garlic, and ginger, stirring often, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sweet potatoes and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Dust with curry powder and cook for 30 seconds.
Stir tomatoes and their juices into the pot. Add vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until sweet potatoes are soft, 12 to 15 minutes.
