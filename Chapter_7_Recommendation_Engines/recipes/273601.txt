Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (6 ounce) can evaporated milk
6 ounces milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 cups day-old 12-grain bread (such as Oroweat®), cut into 1-inch cubes
3/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup raisins
2 ounces Neufchatel cheese, cubed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Mix sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add bread cubes and stir until well incorporated. Let sit for 5 minutes so bread will absorb some of the liquid. Add walnuts and raisins and stir to combine.
Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish. Dot with Neufchatel cheese, pressing down.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Got stale bread? Don't toss it! Make tres leches bread pudding. Made with three different types of milk this recipe is perfect for day-old, dried up, stale bread. I used Oroweat® 12-grain bread which added a nuttier taste but white bread will also work. This is also egg-less!
