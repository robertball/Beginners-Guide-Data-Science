Ingredients:
2  10oz. Packages frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and squeezed dry (may use 16oz. Packages for a less cheesy version)
16 oz. cottage cheese
4 oz. butter, cubed (use unsalted for a less salty version)
3 eggs, beaten
1 1/2 Cups American cheese, cubed
1/4 Cup flour
1 teaspoon salt (use 3/4 teaspoon for a less salty version)

Directions:
Grease a 4 1/2 quart slow cooker. In a large bowl, mix together the spinach, cottage cheese, butter, American cheese, eggs, flour and salt until everything is evenly distributed. Transfer to the greased slow cooker.
Cook on high for one hour, then reduce heat to low, and continue to cook for 4 to 5 hours.
