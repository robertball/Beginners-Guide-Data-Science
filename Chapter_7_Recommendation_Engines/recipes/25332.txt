Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
2 cups chopped broccoli
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups nonfat milk
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper to taste
5 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided
1/3 cup dry bread crumbs
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 butter flavored cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.  Stir in broccoli, mushrooms and green pepper, and cook 6 to 8 minutes more, or until pasta is al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Saute onions and garlic for 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in flour and milk; cook 5 minutes, or until mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish combine pasta, vegetables, milk mixture and 4 tablespoons basil.  Sprinkle with bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon basil.  Coat with butter flavored cooking spray.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
