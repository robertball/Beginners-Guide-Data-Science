Description: 
Caramelization gives a lovely flavor to vegetables. Using the air fryer gives great caramelization, without overcooking the veggies or heating your whole house, as you would with a traditional oven. Try them as a side for your favorite entree, or toss them with greens and your favorite vinaigrette for a different salad.
