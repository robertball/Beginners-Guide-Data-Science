Ingredients:
3 medium potatoes Chopped
1/2 cup fresh parsley chopped
3 3/4 cups water
1/2 package bacon (250g)
1 small onion chopped (or half of large onion)
1 1/2 tbs butter
1/2 cup All-Purpose flour
3 cups skim milk
3 4-oz cans minced clams
1 tsp pepper
1 1/2 tsp salt
paprika (optional)

Directions:
Add water, parsley and potatoes to Slow Cooker and turn it on. Begin timing here. Cook bacon in a skillet, when done, remove bacon and pour out excess grease. Add onions to the pan and saute until slightly browned. Chop up bacon and add bacon and onions to slow cooker. Cover and cook for 5-7 hours on low, or 2-3 hours on high, or until potatoes are done.
Meanwhile, in a large pot, melt butter. Add 3 tbs of the flour and mix well. Add milk and bring to a boil while stirring with whisk. Add remaining flour slowly while stirring with a whisk constantly. When all the flour has uniformly been mixed, add clams (including liquid). Boil for another 10 minutes while stirring. Add to slow cooker and stir. Add salt and pepper and serve. Optional: Sprinkle paprika on top.
