Ingredients:
1 precooked 9” focaccia flatbread
1 hachiya persimmon (the firm, seedless type)
4 tsp olive oil, divided
1/2 tsp salt
125g burrata cheese
2 sprigs fresh rosemary

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 175°C. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Peel the persimmon. Slice it into 1/4 inch rounds. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle with two teaspoons olive oil and sprinkle salt.  Remove the leaves from one of the rosemary sprigs. Sprinkle over the persimmon slices. Roast for 20 minutes. Turn over the slices. Roast for another 10 minutes.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Raise the temperature to 200°C. Bake the focaccia for about 5 minutes to warm it. Remove and place the roasted slices on top of the focaccia. Tear the burrata with your hands laying the pieces evenly over the focaccia but not over the persimmon.  Add more rosemary reserving some leaves for garnish. Bake until the focaccia has warmed and the cheese has melted slightly. About 5 minutes.
Top with fresh rosemary leaves and 2 tsp olive oil. Slice and serve hot.
