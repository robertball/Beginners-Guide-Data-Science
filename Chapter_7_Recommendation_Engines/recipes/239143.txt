Ingredients:
2 pounds baking potatoes, each cut into six wedges
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Arrange potato wedges on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the wedges; season with thyme, pepper, and salt. Turn wedges with a spatula to coat with oil and seasonings.
Roast potato wedges for 15 minutes, turn, and continue roasting until soft in the center, about 15 minutes more. Transfer wedges to a platter and sprinkle cheese over them.

Description: 
This is a great recipe to get kids started learning how to cook. Take a day, take a week, teach them new things each day. We used this for our 'at-home' camp week. Taught the kids how to cook one new thing each day for an entire week.
