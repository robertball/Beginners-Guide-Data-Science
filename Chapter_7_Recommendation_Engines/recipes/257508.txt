Ingredients:
1 pound pork spare ribs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice wine, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoons Chinese black vinegar

Directions:
Combine pork ribs, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon rice wine, and salt in a large bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
Heat oil in a wok or deep saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook ribs in the hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes.
Bring remaining 1 teaspoon rice wine, sugar, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in ribs; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Stir in black vinegar. Increase heat to high; cook and stir until sauce thickens and coats the ribs, 1 to 2 minutes.
