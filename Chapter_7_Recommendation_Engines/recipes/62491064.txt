Ingredients:
2 large baking potatoes
4 strips of bacon
4 jalapenos, chopped (seeded optional)
1 clove of garlic
1/4 c milk
2 oz cream cheese
4 oz sharp cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Wrap potatoes in aluminum foil and bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes, until you can easily push into potato with your finger.  Let cool.
Slice potato lengthwise.  Scoop out insides of potatoes into a bowl using a spoon, leaving the skins intact like a bowl.
Meanwhile, cook bacon in pan over medium high heat until crispy.  Remove bacon from pan and let cool on paper towel.  Reduce heat of the pan to very low.  Add jalapeno and garlic to bacon grease in pan and cook for 5 minutes, until softened.
Add the jalapenos, garlic and bacon grease to bowl with potatoes.  Cut the cooked bacon into bite sized pieces and add 3/4 of bacon to bowl.  Add milk, cream cheese, salt and pepper, and 3/4 of chedder cheese and mix well.  If the mixture looks dry, add a bit more milk.
Spoon mixture into potato bowls.  Top the potatoes with remaining bacon and then remaining chedder cheese.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
