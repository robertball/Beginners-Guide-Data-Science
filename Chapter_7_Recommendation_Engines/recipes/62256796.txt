Ingredients:
1/2 cup almonds
1/2 cup dry oatmeal
4 tablespoons cocoa butter
3 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Process the almonds in a blender or coffee grinder until coarsely ground.
In a bowl, combine oatmeal, cocoa butter, honey and ground nuts.
Rub into your hands and feet, cover with cotton gloves and socks, and leave on overnight.
The next morning, remove the gloves and socks and rinse. You'll be delighted with your incredibly smooth skin. This remedy is ideal for soothing hard-working hands and feet because it gently exfoliates old, dead skin and nourishes new cells.
