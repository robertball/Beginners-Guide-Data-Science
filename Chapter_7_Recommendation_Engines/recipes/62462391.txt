Ingredients:
2 Tbsp lukewarm water
1 tsp dry yeast or 2 tsps cake yeast
5 Cups all purpose white flour
1/4 Cup sugar
3 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp fine sea salt
1 cup vegetable shortening chilled and cut into pieces
2 cups chilled buttermilk

Directions:
Combine water and yeast in small bowl. Let stand a few minutes and stir to dissolve. Set aside.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl. Using a pastry blender cut in the shortening until mixture is like coarse crumbs. Add the dissolved yeast and the buttermilk; stir just until well combined. Knead lightly in bowl to form a soft dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Knead dough briefly on floured surface to revive the yeast. Roll dough out to 1/2 thickness. Cut out with biscuit or cookie cutter and set 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Combine scraps, re-roll and cut out until all the dough is used.
Bake 12-15 mins until just barely golden. These are wonderful served hot.

Description: 
This recipe is from the book Bread Alone by Daniel Leader. I cut them thick and they bake up beautifully and have a rich flavor. The only change I have ever made is sometimes to use a mixture of white and wheat flours. I use a 20% mix (1 cup wheat mixed with 4 cups white) that I substitute in alot of my baking just to increase health factor.
