Ingredients:
Pancakes:
2C Original Bisquick mix (or however you make your own pancakes)
1/2tsp ground cinnamon
1/4tsp ground nutmeg
1C peeled and diced Granny Smith apple
1C milk
2 eggs
Streusel Topping:
1/4C + 2TBSP packed brown sugar
1/4C all-purpose flour
1/4C quick-cooking oats
2TBSP+2TSP cold butter

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix brown sugar, flour, oats, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
Cut in butter using a pastry blender or fork until mixture is crumbly, and set aside.
In a large bowl, stir all pancake ingredients until well blended.
Heat a non-stick griddle to 350F or a 12in skillet over medium-high heat. Brush lightly with veg oil or spray with cooking spray before heating to prevent streusel topping from sticking.
For each pancake, pour 1/4C of batter onto hot griddle. Sprinkle each pancake evenly with 2TBSP of streusel mixture.
Cook 2-3 minutes or until bubbly on top, and dry around edges. Flip; cook other side until light golden brown around the edges about 1 minute to 1 1/2minutes.
Scrape off griddle in between batches.
To serve, serve streusel side up and top as desired.
