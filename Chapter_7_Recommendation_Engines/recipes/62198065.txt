Description: 
Simple salad of greens, candided walnuts, green onions and blue cheese dressed with a festive and tasty light pink cranberry vinaigrette. Sometimes I like to toss in fresh roasted beets or orange slices to give the salad a different presentation.Modified from: Cranberry Vinaigrette on tossed Green Salad
