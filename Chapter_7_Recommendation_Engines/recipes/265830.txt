Ingredients:
12 frozen bite-size potato nuggets (such as Tater TotsÂ®)
2 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons salsa
1 tablespoon milk
cooking spray
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 ounce grated Cheddar cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread potato nuggets on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Turn potato nuggets and bake until crispy, 8 minutes more.
While potatoes bake, combine eggs, salsa, and milk in a bowl and whisk to combine.
Heat a skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Add egg mixture. Scramble until partially set, about 2 minutes. Add green onion and bell pepper. Cook until eggs are set, about 5 minutes more. Transfer eggs to a plate.
Place cooked potato nuggets in a large bowl and top with scrambled eggs and grated Cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper.

Description: 
Potato tots topped with spicy eggs scrambled with green onions and bell pepper are then topped with Cheddar cheese. I usually cook for one, so this egg bowl recipe is small. It can easily be doubled or tripled for more servings. I enjoy it with ketchup.
