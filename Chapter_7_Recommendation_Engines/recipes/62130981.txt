Ingredients:
2 cups cooked basmati rice
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tilapia fillets
3 pinches salt
1/2 cup reserved green olive juice
4 cloves garlic
2 small hot peppers (Thai peppers or others) or 1 tsp red pepper flakes
1 small sweet red or orange pepper
1/2 tsp fresh cracked black pepper
6 Kalamata olives
6 Italian marinated green olives
5 red cherry tomatoes
5 yellow cherry tomatoes
1/2 cup finely chopped lemon balm

Directions:
1. Slice olives and dice other ingredients except fish before cooking but do not mix together.
2. Cook the rice and set aside where it can remain warm.
3. Heat the olive oil over medium high heat.  Place the tilapia in the oil and toss in a pinch of salt.  Heat for 2 minutes or just until the upper side is beginning to whiten on the edges.  Flip and cook 1 minute with another pinch of salt.  Remove and set aside where it can remain warm (use a bowl to cover fillets).
4. Add olive juice garlic and hot peppers to the pan to deglaze.  Reduce for about 1 minute.  Add sweet peppers and and stir with remaining salt and pepper.  Saute for 30 seconds.  Add the olives and stir for another 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes, stir in the lemon balm, and when just heated through, remove from heat.
5. Divide the rice per plate and top with one fillet and some of the tomato olive mixture.

Description: 
This is a brilliant summer favorite - light, easy, and bold all in one.  A quick saute of vegetables straight from the garden and the wallop of flavor from the olives and garlic male this a family favorite.  And, btw, it takes longer to collect the ingredients than it does to cook.
