Ingredients:
2/3 cup uncooked orzo pasta
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups chopped fully cooked ham
1 cup diced red onion
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup halved cherry or grape tomatoes

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water in a colander set in the sink.
Whisk together the mayonnaise, sour cream, cider vinegar, Dijon and yellow mustard, chives, sugar, black pepper, and salt in a bowl.
Place the cooked and cooled pasta, ham, red onion, green pepper, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Toss together with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving.
