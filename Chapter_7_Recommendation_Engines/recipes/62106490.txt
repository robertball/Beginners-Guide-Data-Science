Ingredients:
1 medium to large eggplant
3 large cloves of garlic
1 tablespoon of natural yogurt
1 tablespoon of mayonaise
juice from 1/2 of a lemon
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 F.
Place the eggplant on a baking rack and put in the oven for 30 minutes, ensuring  to turn the eggplant every 10 minutes.
In the last 10 minute of roasting the eggplant, put the garlic on the baking rack to roast.
Remove the eggplant from the oven and place in a bowl of cold water ~ this will bubble the skin up to make it easier  to peel.
Remove the skin from the eggplant and place into a food processor with roasted garlic, mayo, yogurt and lemon juice.
Process until smooth.
