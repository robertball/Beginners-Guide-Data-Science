Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef (or pork/buffalo meat)
1/2 onion, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 can crushed tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) jar salsa (I use a little more)
4 tablespoons chili seasoning mix
1 (15 ounce) can pinto or chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the ground beef and the onion and saute for 10 minutes, or until meat is browned and onion is tender. Drain grease, if desired.
Add the ground black pepper, garlic salt, tomato sauce, salsa, chili seasoning mix and kidney beans. Mix well, reduce heat to low and simmer for at least an hour.
