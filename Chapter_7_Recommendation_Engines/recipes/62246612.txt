1 1/2 to 3 lbs. pork tenderloin (fat trimmed)
*One 16 oz. jar sliced hot banana peppers or sliced pepperoncini peppers
*Or one 16 oz. jar mild banana peppers
1 Can of beer
Chicken Stock

Directions:
Place tenderloin in slow cooker and season with garlic and onion powders and black pepper.
*If using mild banana peppers add entire jar with liquid.
*If using hot banana peppers or pepperoncini add entire jar of the peppers and just enough of the liquid to taste, according to the amount of heat you desire.
Add enough chicken stock to just cover the tenderloin.
Cook on high for four hours. At the end of the four hours remove meat from slow cooker, let cool a bit and shred.
Strain and save liquid and place peppers in with the meat. Place meat and peppers into a serving bowl and add one ladle full of the reserved juice and lightly mix.
Place reserved juice into a bowl for dipping and serve meat on French rolls or roll of your choice.
If desired, place a few slices of pepperjack cheese on top on the meat and heat in microwave just until cheese is melted.
