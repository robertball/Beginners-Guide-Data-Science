Ingredients:
4 cups coconut milk
1 1/2 cups of coconut cream
1 1/2 cups of evaporated milk
1 cup of milk
1 cup of cornstarch
2/3 cup of sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1 teaspoon of orange blossom water
1/2 teaspoon of lime zest
ground cinnamon for garnish

Directions:
In a large saucepan combine the coconut milk, cream and evaporated milk. Add the spices and whisk together until well blended.
Dissolve the cornstarch in the 1 cup of regular milk. Once dissolved add the rest of the coconut milk mixture.
Add the remaing sugar, salt, flavorings and zest to the mixture.
Cook at medium heat stirring constantly until the mixture reaches a simmer. As it thickens, lower heat until it thickens.
Pour right away into an 8 cup jello mold ring, a deep 9 inch cake pan or individual ramekins.
Cool for 30 minutes before covering and refrigerating. Chill at least four hours, preferrably overnight.
Remove from refrigerator ten minutes before serving. Dip bottom of pan or mold in warm water for a minute. Carefully separate the tembleque from the mold using a thin knife. Turn it over unto a serving dish.
Sprinkle with cinnamon prior to serving.
