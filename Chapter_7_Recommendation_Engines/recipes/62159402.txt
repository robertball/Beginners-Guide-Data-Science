https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
7 large golden potatoes
1 cup of diced onions
2 1/2 cup diced celery
1 1/2 cups of mayonaise
1 cruet of mixed Good Seasonings Herb & Garlic OR Italian dressing
1 tspn garlic powder
1 tablespoon lemon & pepper seasoning
1 tspn Mrs. Dash Original seasoning

Directions:
Stab potatoes with a fork (prevents them from 'exploding' while cooking)
Cook potatoes with skins ON until done (easily pierced with fork)
While potatoes cook, dice onion and celery
When potatoes are done, drain off water
With butter knife, scrape off skin off HOT potatoes and slice into 3/8" slices into large sealable bowl
Add onions and mixed salad dressing, and cover, allowing salad dressing to absorb into potatoes (flipping over bowl occasionally so that dressing penetrates all potatoes)
Once dressing is mostly absorbed (about 2 hours), add celery, garlic powder, lemon & pepper seasoning and Mrs. Dash seasoning to potato and onion mixture, stirring gently to mix.
Gradually add mayonaise until desired consistency achieved.
Cover and refrigerate until chilled, approximately 3 hours.
Enjoy!

Description: 
A tangy potato salad passed down from my great grandmother...with a few shortcuts!  Great with fried chicken and ham, or just on it's own.
