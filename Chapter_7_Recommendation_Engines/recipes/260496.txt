Ingredients:
3/4 cup cashews
Crust:
1 1/2 cups ground almonds
2 tablespoons coconut sugar
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1 teaspoon maple syrup
Lemon Topping:
1 (8 ounce) can coconut cream
4 lemons, zested and juiced
1 lemon, zested
2 tablespoons arrowroot starch
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Place cashews in a bowl of boiling water; soak for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 8x10-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
Combine ground almonds and coconut sugar in a bowl. Add coconut oil and maple syrup; mix well until a dough is formed. Press dough evenly into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes.
Drain cashews. Place in a blender with coconut cream, lemon juice, lemon zest, arrowroot starch, and honey; pulse until well combined and a thick cream is formed. Spread over the baked almond base.
Bake in the oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes; chill in the refrigerator before slicing, about 4 hours.
