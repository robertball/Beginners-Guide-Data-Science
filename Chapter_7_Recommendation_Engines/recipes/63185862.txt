Ingredients:
1 teaspoon sea salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon thyme
6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth
4 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
On a dinner plate, mix together first 7 ingredients. Sprinkle mixture on both sides of chicken breasts (or double the spice mixture if you like it a little spicier).
In a skillet heat butter and olive oil together over medium high heat. Saute chicken until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes on either side. Remove chicken and add lime juice and chicken broth to the pan, whisking up the browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Keep cooking until sauce has reduced slightly. Add chicken back to the pan to thoroughly coat and serve.
