Ingredients:
6 leaves basil
2 slices prosciutto
2 (4 ounce) fillets halibut
1/2 teaspoon adobo seasoning
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Lay 3 basil leaves on each slice of prosciutto. Season the halibut fillets with Adobo seasoning, place them on one side of the prepared slices of prosciutto, and wrap the fish fillets with the prosciutto and basil.
Set an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, pour in the olive oil and place the wrapped halibut fillets in the pan.
Cook the fillets until the prosciutto is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Flip the fillets over and move the pan into the preheated oven. Bake until the fish is firm to the touch and cooked through, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is one simple and tasty recipe. I had something similar at a restaurant recently and decided to try to make it at home. I can't believe how easy it was to recreate in my cast iron skillet!
