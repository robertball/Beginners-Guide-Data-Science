Ingredients:
1/4 cup walnuts
1/4 cup almonds
2 cups water
1 cup fonio grains
4 dates, pitted and chopped
1 cup milk
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup fresh blueberries
6 tablespoons milk
6 tablespoons shredded coconut
6 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Toast walnuts and almonds in a skillet over medium-low heat, 4 to 5 minutes. Chop into big pieces and set aside.
Pour water and fonio into a medium saucepan. Stir to eliminate any lumps. Add dates. Bring to a low boil, stirring often while crushing the date pieces. Reduce heat to a simmer when dates begin to dissolve. Add 1 cup milk, raisins, and cranberries. Continue to simmer, stirring often, until fonio absorbs all the liquid, about 8 minutes.
Divide the porridge into 6 bowls. Serve topped with equal amounts of toasted nuts, blueberries, 6 tablespoons milk, coconut, and cinnamon.
