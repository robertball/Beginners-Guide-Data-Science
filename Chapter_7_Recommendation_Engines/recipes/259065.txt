Ingredients:
4 1/2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce
4 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
2 teaspoons sambal oelek
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
12 ounces pork tenderloin, trimmed and thinly sliced
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1 cup shaved carrot strips
1/4 cup diagonally sliced green onions
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 whole wheat hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sambal oelek, sesame oil, and ginger together in a large bowl. Add pork; toss well to coat. Let stand at room temperature, about 15 minutes.
Whisk rice vinegar, 1 teaspoon oil, and white sugar together in a bowl. Add carrot strips, green onions, and cilantro; toss to coat.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place buns on a baking sheet, cut sides up.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork; cook, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
Broil buns in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Top bottom halves of buns evenly with pork and carrot mixture. Cover with top halves of buns.
