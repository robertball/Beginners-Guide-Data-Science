Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
Salt and pepper to taste
2 pieces cornbread, crumbled
2 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
2 tablespoons minced celery
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 tablespoons butter, melted
¼ cup chicken stock
⅓ cup chicken stock
⅓ cup plum jam

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Using a paring knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast. Place into skillet and sear until lightly browned on both sides, but not cooked through. Set aside.
Combine cornbread, bacon, celery, onion, butter, and 1/4 cup chicken stock; mix until well combined. Stuff each breast with cornbread mixture.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
While the chicken is baking, bring 1/3 cup chicken stock to a simmer. Whisk in plum jam, and simmer over medium-low heat until most of the chicken stock has evaporated.
Pour plum glaze over chicken breasts, and cook for an additional 10 minutes and the center of the stuffed breast reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
