Ingredients:
2 white fish filets (like tilapia) or boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup
6 oz. angel hair pasta or fettuccine
1/2 cup butter or your preferred substitute
1 4 oz. can mushrooms, drained
3 cloves crushed garlic
1 tsp dry basil
1 tsp dry oregano
1 tsp crushed black pepper
dash of lawry's seasoning salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Line 8x8 casserole with foil. Start water boiling for pasta.
Empty soup into small saucepan.  Add butter, mushrooms, garlic, basil, oregano, pepper and seasoning salt.  Mix well.
Place fish or chicken in the foil-lined casserole and sprinkle with basil, oregano and pepper to taste.  Bake in pre-heated oven for 7-10 minutes for fish or until flaky, or approx. 30 for chicken, or until juices run clear.
While meat is cooking, place sauce mix over med-low heat and heat till simmering, stirring often or it will get a skin.
While heating the sauce, cook pasta according to directions.
When meat and pasta are cooked, divide pasta between two plates, top with fish or chicken, then soak with the sauce.
Best with garlic toast and a salad, like all good pasta dishes!!
Note: the fish is best with the angel hair and the  chicken goes better with the fettuccine.  Adding some white wine to the sauce may be good, too.... hmmm...

Description: 
Fast, filling and oh so yummy! Pulled this together out of stuff I had lying around: canned soup, frozen fish, angel hair pasta, prepared salad and garlic bread. You can do whatever you want with this recipe!! Few dishes mean easy cleanup. Use fish or chicken.
