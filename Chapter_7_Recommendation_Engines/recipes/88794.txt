Ingredients:
1 pound sliced bacon
1 (8 ounce) package dry bread stuffing mix
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
ground black pepper to taste
garlic powder to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cook bacon in the microwave, or in a large skillet until about halfway done. Set aside.
Prepare the stuffing mix according to package directions. Do not bake. Place the bacon on a clean flat surface. Arrange sets of three slices with two going across, and one up and down.
Place a piece of chicken on top. Separate the stuffing into 6 portions, and shape each one into a log. Place one in the center of each piece of  chicken. Pull chicken around the stuffing to cover, bringing the bacon around with it. Secure with string or toothpicks. Season with pepper and garlic powder. Place the chicken bundles in a roasting pan, and cover loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the foil, and cook until bacon is crisp and chicken is no longer pink, about 10 more minutes. Serve as is or with gravy.
