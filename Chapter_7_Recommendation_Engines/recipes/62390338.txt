2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450.
Cream butter until fluffy and sugar, beat in  eggs one at a time. Add water, extract, baking powder, cinnamon and salt, then add flour 1 cup at a time.
Refrigerate dough for about 20 minutes.
Mix the remaining cinnamon, white sugar and salt in a small bowl.
With clean, wet hands, pinch off walnut sized pieces of dough, roll into balls.
Roll the cookie balls in the cinnamon sugar and place about 2 inches apart on a greased cookie sheet.
Using a spatula or a glass, flatten the cookie balls.
Bake 8 minutes, or until the edges are brown.
