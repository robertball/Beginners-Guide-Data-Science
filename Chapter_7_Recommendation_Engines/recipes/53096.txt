Ingredients:
4 1/2 pounds chuck roast
2 cups water
2 cups ketchup
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 large potatoes, peeled and halved
1 large onion, sliced
6 carrots, peeled and sliced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the roast in a roasting pan. Cover with the 2 cups water, ketchup, chili powder, sugar, and salt. Cook 1 hour in the preheated oven.
Place the potatoes, onion, and carrots in the roasting pan with the roast and liquid. Continue cooking 1 hour, or until the vegetables are tender and the internal temperature of the meat has reached a minimum of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove the roast and vegetables from the pan, and drain the remaining liquid into a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the flour and water. Stir into the remaining roast liquid to make gravy.
