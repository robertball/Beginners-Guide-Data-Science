Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 to 1/2 jalapeno pepper to taste
2 tsp. sesame oil
1 cup toasted sunflower seeds
1 cup toasted sesame seeds
1 head napa cabbage, thinly sliced
1 bunch green onions, sliced
1/2 c. cilantro, minced
1/4 c. fresh mint, minced (opt)
1/2 c. craisins, opt.

Directions:
In a bowl, whisk together sesame oil (or use the oil for toasting the seeds in a skillet), sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce until the sugar has dissolved. Add jalapeno (add whites & seeds if like it hot, otherwise just the green).
While toasting seeds, watch carefully to prevent burning. Allow mixture to cool.
Thinly slice cabbage, across the leaves, using most of the white. Grate or thinly julienne carrots (I used my faithful Oskar food processor for carrot and cilantro and mint)
Just before serving, mix together the napa cabbage and green onions with toasted seed mixture in a salad bowl until thoroughly combined; toss with the dressing.
