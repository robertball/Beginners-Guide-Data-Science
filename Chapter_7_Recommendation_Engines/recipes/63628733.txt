Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 Tbsp ground ginger
4 stalks of celery
1/2 red bell pepper
1/2 yellow bell pepper
10-16 uncooked prawns (peeled)
1/2 a fresh lemon or 1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice
2 (200g) packages fresh udon noodles
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Put the soy sauce, 1/2 cup water, brown sugar, and ginger into a small pot. Allow to simmer on a low heat, stirring occasionally. While the sauce is simmering, cut the celery in half lengthwise and then into (aprox.) 2 inch sticks. Slice the bell peppers into thin strips. Put the celery and peppers into a small saucepan with 1/2 cup water and cover. Cook over a medium heat for about 10 minutes. (No need to stir or lift lid.) At the same time, put the udon noodles into a large saucepan with the remaining cup of water, cover, and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Drain the water from the noodles and add 1/3-1/2 of the sauce. (Replace the remaining over the low heat.) Stir the sauce into the noodles and let cook for 3-4 minutes. Drain the vegetables and take off the heat, keeping them covered. Move the noodles to one side of the pan and add the prawns. Cook them until pink/white throughout. Divide the noodles evenly into two bowls, sprinkle the prawns with lemon juice (while still in the pan) and stir to coat evenly. Divide the vegetables, placing them on top of the noodles and then divide the prawns on top of the vegetables. Spoon a little of the remaining sauce onto each and serve.

Description: 
This is my own creation. It's fast, easy, healthy, and affordable. Great for dinner on a weeknight when everyone is busy. I will halve the recipe when I'm only cooking for myself or double it when I am cooking for my whole family because it converts easily. Also, one recipe will feed four children as portion sizes are generous.
