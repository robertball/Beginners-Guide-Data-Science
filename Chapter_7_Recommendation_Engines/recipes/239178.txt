Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk, or more to taste, divided
1 (4 ounce) package chive and onion-flavored goat cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat; add onion and season with a pinch of salt. Cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir flour with the onion; cook, stirring continually, for 1 minute.
Pour 1 cup milk into the saucepan while stirring; add goat cheese and stir to melt. Stir remaining milk into the mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, and cook until you reach your desired texture, 5 to 10 minutes more; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper.

Description: 
I really wanted my husband to try goat cheese, so the other night I asked him if he wanted scalloped potatoes in a cheese sauce; he said 'yes,' and this is what I made. Afterwards he said I would definitely need to make this again, as he had four helpings. When I told him that it was goat cheese all he could say was 'REALLY?' and kept eating. I would say this was a winner; how about you? Just pour finished sauce over your choice of pasta, potatoes, or whatever you like.
