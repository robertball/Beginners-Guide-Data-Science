Ingredients:
1/4 cup dried brown lentils, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can artichoke hearts in water
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, divided
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 pound thin spaghetti
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the lentils, tomatoes and artichokes (with the liquid from the cans), 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and the water into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low and simmer until lentils are tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Return pasta to pot and cover to keep warm.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat and cook green onions for about 3 minutes. Add 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and sesame seeds and cook until the seeds are lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Set aside.
Add the lentil mixture to the pot of pasta and toss to distribute evenly. Add the green onion mixture and toss lightly again. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
