Ingredients:
6 ears corn on the cob, husks and silk removed
1/2 cup lime juice
1 tablespoon chili powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Soak husked ears of corn in a bowl of water for 5 to 10 minutes. Mix lime juice, chili powder, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl.
Remove corn from water and grill, turning often, until corn is golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Brush ears with seasoned lime juice as you turn the corn.

Description: 
The perfect grilled corn for a summer barbeque! Always a huge success because it is the perfect mix of spicy and tangy. It is also a great option for the grill because there is no need to smother the corn in butter to make it taste good. Goes great with barbequed steaks or chicken.
