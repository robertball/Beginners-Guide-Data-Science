Ingredients:
For Meatballs and Pasta:
1/3 cup cracker or bread crumbs
2 Tbsp. milk
1 lb. ground turkey
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 onion, grated
3 garlic cloves, grated
1 egg, lightly beaten
6 fresh basil leaves, chopped
½ tsp. kosher salt
¼ tsp. black pepper
Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 lb. cooked spaghetti
For Tomato Sauce:
1 Tbsp. olive oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
¼ cup grated onion
Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
1 28-oz. can crushed tomatoes
8 fresh basil leaves, chopped
½ tsp. kosher salt
1/8 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
In a bowl, combine cracker crumbs and milk. Add turkey, parmesan, onion, garlic, egg, basil, salt, pepper and red pepper. Use your hands to combine-do not overmix. Divide turkey into a dozen ball, and place on a baking sheet. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.
In a large skillet, heat oil over med-high. Brown meatballs about 3 minutes on each side, then place on paper towels.
In the same skillet wiped clean, combine olive oil, garlic, onion and red pepper over medium heat, and cook 2-3 minutes, stirring. Add tomatoes, basil, salt and pepper. Bring to low simmer; add meatballs to pan. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, turning once. Add spaghetti and toss. Serve with grated Parmesan and fresh basil.
