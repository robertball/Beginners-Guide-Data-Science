Ingredients:
1 medium onions, peeled chopped
2 celery sticks, chopped
2 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 yellow pepper, cored, deseeded and chopped
1 ½ - 2 cups chopped tomatoes
2 ½ - 3 cups fish or chicken stock
1 zucchini
1lb. cod fillets, skinned and cut into 3/4"pieces
10 olives cut lengthwise
2 tbsp. olive oil
1 bay leaf
1 tbsp. dry cilantro or parsley
sea salt and black pepper
5 parsley springs

Directions:
All vegetables have to be chopped the same size, about 1/2" cubes, except onion. Chop onion as small as possible.
In a heavy-based pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add onions, celery, carrots and cook for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add yellow pepper, zucchini and sauté for 6 minutes until the vegetables are lightly golden.
Add chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook for 3 more minutes. Add salt, pepper, bay leaf, dry cilantro and pour in the stock. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Then lower heat and simmer for about 8-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
Add cod fillets and olives and simmer for the final 3-4 minutes.
Serve with chopped parsley.
