Ingredients:
3 large chicken breast (I use them frozen)
3 or 4 cans Northern Beans
2 cups chicken broth
1 4.25 oz diced green chilies
2 T. dried minced onion
1 tsp. ground cumin
1/2 tsp. cayenne
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
2 T. salsa (if desired)

Directions:
Place all ingredients into crock pot, except for the salsa. Turn on low heat for 7 hours. Once the chicken is cooked it will shred very easily. You may need to thicken the chili, so drain and mash the 4th can of beans and add to the chili.
Top with salsa jack shredded cheese and some sour cream!
