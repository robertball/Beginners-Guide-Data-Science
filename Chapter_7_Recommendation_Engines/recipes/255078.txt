Ingredients:
1 red potato
1 (4 ounce) link sausage (such as JohnsonvilleÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste

Directions:
Cut red potato into spirals using a spiralizer. Dip into a bowl of cold water; rinse and transfer to a microwave-safe bowl.
Cook potato spirals in the microwave on high for 1 minute. Blot with paper towels to remove any moisture.
Remove sausage from its casing and shape into 2 balls; press into round discs.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 2 round piles of potato spirals. Season with salt and pepper. Top each pile with a sausage disc and press down firmly with a spatula to make thin patties. Cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Garnish with chives.
