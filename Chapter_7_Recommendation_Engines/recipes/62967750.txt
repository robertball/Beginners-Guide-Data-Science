Description: 
Awsome, simple recipe. Got this from Lisa, one of my non cooking sisters. She claims she don't cook but, she just don't want to. She will however, happily do all the dirty work. Make all the sides, prep the meat, and give someone else all the credit. Never ate anything she made that wasn't good. Usually very good! Recipe source: Lisa Posinski Guekler, who got Graany Guelkers recipe passed down to her from Aunt Lois. Picture posted is one made by: Samantha Guelker (8yrs) and Gabriel Travino (3yrs) that they made one their own! Nov. 12, 2011 Yummy!
