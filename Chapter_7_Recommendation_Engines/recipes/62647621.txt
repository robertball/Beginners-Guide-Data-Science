Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup white corn syrup
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup whole pecans
1/2 Cup raw cashews
1 cup almonds
1 (12 ounce) package crispy corn and rice cereal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Spray a large roasting pan with non-stick cooking spray.
In a medium-size microwave safe bowl, mix butter, white corn syrup and brown sugar. Place the mixture in the microwave and cook 2 minutes, or until butter melts.
Place the cereal, pecans, cashews and almonds into the prepared roasting pan. Pour the melted butter mixture over the cereal and nuts and mix gently until the cereal and nuts are coated.
Bake for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
When cool, pull out three cookie sheets and put Silpat sheets on them.  Put mix on the sheets, stir once and let cool.  Works great.
Store in airtight container.
