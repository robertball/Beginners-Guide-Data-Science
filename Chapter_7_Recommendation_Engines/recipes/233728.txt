Description: 
A very easy '1, 2, 3' recipe you can whip together in no time with no baking. My grandma taught me how to make this, it is very enjoyable after a spicy dinner, on a hot day, or for those who love a tart and tangy dessert. You can add whipped cream if you like, or even beat sugar into the whites from the above mentioned eggs to make meringue.
