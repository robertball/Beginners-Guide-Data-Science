Ingredients:
Ingredients
•1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
•1/4 cup sake, or dry white wine or Junmai
•1/4 cup mirin, (see Note)
•2 tablespoons sugar
•3 tablespoons coarsely chopped scallions
•3 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh ginger
•4 5-ounce wild salmon fillets, or steaks, 3/4-1 inch thick, skin on
•1 small lemon, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preparation
1.Soak a grilling plank in water for 2 to 4 hours.
2.Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, sake (or white wine), mirin, sugar, scallions and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.
3.Place salmon in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Place lemon slices on top. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes but no more than 2 hours, turning the fish once or twice.
4.Preheat grill to medium-high.
5.Place the soaked plank over direct heat on the grill and heat for 2 minutes. Move the plank so it’s over indirect heat (see Kitchen Tip, below). Remove the salmon from the marinade, place it skin-side down (if using fillets) on the hot plank and replace the lemon slices on top. Close the lid and cook until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Use the plank as the serving platter, if desired.
