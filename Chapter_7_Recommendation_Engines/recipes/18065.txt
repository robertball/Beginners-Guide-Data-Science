Ingredients:
2 tablespoons refried beans
2 tablespoons salsa
3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
4 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1 1/2 cups shredded lettuce

Directions:
Stir the beans and salsa together in a small bowl until smooth. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour beaten eggs into pan and allow bottom to set, approximately 1 minute. Spread bean mixture onto one half of eggs and flip other half over to make a half-circle. Continue to cook until eggs are set.
Spread an equal amount of mayonnaise onto each tortilla. Cut eggs into 4 equal pieces and place one piece on each tortilla. Cover each with shredded lettuce. Roll up tortillas and serve.
