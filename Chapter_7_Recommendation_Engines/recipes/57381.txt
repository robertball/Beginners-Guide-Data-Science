Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles
6 eggs, beaten
8 ounces butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
2 (1 ounce) envelopes dry onion soup mix
1 teaspoon black pepper
4 (10 ounce) boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water; bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta until cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Combine the eggs, melted butter, sour cream, soup mix, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the cooked noodles, and drained spinach. Spoon into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until hot and golden brown, about 60 minutes. Cover dish with aluminum foil if kugel begins to brown too quickly.
