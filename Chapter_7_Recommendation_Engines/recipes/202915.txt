Ingredients:
4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground allspice
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 cups pecan halves
¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
⅓ cup maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the salt, white pepper, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Add the pecans and toss to coat. Drizzle the melted butter over the pecans; pour onto a jelly roll pan and spread into a single layer.
Stirring occasionally, bake in the preheated oven until slightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Drizzle the maple syrup over the nuts and stir to coat, bake until the nuts are glossy and slightly dark, about 10 minutes more. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before scraping into a bowl to serve.
