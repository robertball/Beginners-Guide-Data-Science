Description: 
This recipe is very simple and very delicious also. I can prepare it, and I am a 14 year old boy! This recipe only takes a few minutes to prepare and only a bit longer in the broiler. This goes good with some mashed potatoes with butter and green beans with lemon squeezed on top. This is good, trust me!
