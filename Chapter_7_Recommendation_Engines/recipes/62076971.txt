Ingredients:
1 large bulb garlic
1/2 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons hot sauce

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
Remove outer skin of the bulb of garlic, but leave the cloves intact.  Wrap garlic in foil and place in the oven for one hour.  Remove, and let cool for 10 minutes.
Place mayonnaise, sour cream, parmesan cheese, and hot sauce in a food processor.  Carefully squeeze the garlic until the pulp escapes; place in the processor with the rest of the ingredients.  Blend until incorporated and smooth.
Pour into a small saucepan and heat through.  Transfer to a small bowl and serve warm with crackers or toasted ravioli.
