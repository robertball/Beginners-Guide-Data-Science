Ingredients:
aluminum foil
nonstick cooking spray
4 cups crispy rice cereal squares (such as Rice Chex®)
3 cups crispy corn cereal squares (such as Corn Chex®)
3 cups hot and spicy cheese-flavored crackers (such as Cheez-Its®)
2 cups Buffalo-flavored pretzel pieces
6 tablespoons butter, melted
3 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot®)
1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch dressing mix
3/4 teaspoon celery seed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
Combine rice and corn cereal squares, cheese-flavored crackers, and pretzel pieces in a large bowl.
Mix melted butter, hot sauce, ranch dressing mix, and celery seed together in a small bowl until smooth and well combined. Pour over cereal mixture and stir until evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, until crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely.

Description: 
My son, Gabe, wanted to try something different than the usual snack mix. He loves anything Buffalo-flavored, so this is what we came up with. This is not super spicy, but a really nice balance of flavors, enjoy! Store in an airtight container.
