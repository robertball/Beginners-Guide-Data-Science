Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
1/2 cup oat bran
1/2 cup sliced almonds
cooking spray
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup apple juice concentrate
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup crispy rice cereal
1/2 cup toasted wheat germ
1/2 cup chopped dried apples
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed 10x15-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil. Grease with cooking spray.
Combine oats, oat bran, and almonds in a large bowl. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet; coat with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until toasted and fragrant, about 20 minutes.
Combine honey, apple juice concentrate, and oil in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cinnamon and nutmeg.
Stir rice cereal, wheat germ, and apples into the oat mixture. Drizzle honey mixture on top. Stir to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in raisins. Place baking sheet on a wire rack to cool. Break granola into pieces.

Description: 
My family loves granola, so I've been experimenting with my recipe to create new variations. This tasty granola gets its sweet flavor from dried apples and apple juice concentrate. Store in an airtight container.
