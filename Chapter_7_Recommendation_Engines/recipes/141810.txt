Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon meat tenderizer
1 tablespoon seasoning salt
2 pounds rib-eye steak, 1/4 inch thick
1 onion, sliced
1 (12 ounce) bottle beer
1 1/4 cups fresh lime juice

Directions:
Mix together the garlic powder, onion powder, meat tenderizer, and seasoning salt in a small bowl. Rub the seasoning blend into both sides of the steaks.
Arrange 1/4 of the sliced onions in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan, lay steaks across the onions, top with more onions and pour 1/4 cup of lime juice and 1/4 of the bottle of beer over the top; repeat these layers until you run out of steaks, pouring all remaining lime juice and beer over the top. Cover and refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes. Do not marinate the steaks for longer than an hour, because the acid from the lime juice in the marinade will begin to cook the meat.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Place steaks on the grill and discard the marinade.
Grill the steaks to your desired degree of doneness, or about 2 minutes per side for well done. Remove from the grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving with warm tortillas.

Description: 
This cut of meat is sold in most Mexican or Cuban groceries but can also be found or asked for at any butcher. It is a really thin cut (1/4 inch thick) of boneless rib eye, taken from the small end of the rib roast, you can pan fry it, but I suggest grilling it. I think it is best when taken straight off the grill, sliced and served with a warm tortilla.
