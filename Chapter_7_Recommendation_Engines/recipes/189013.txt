1/2 cup cooked small shrimp, chopped
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Morton® Nature's Seasons® Seasoning Blend)

Description: 
An award winning dip that's festive and a big hit with avocado fans. Most feedback was based on the shrimp. It threw everyone for a loop and added an unexpected flavor and texture.  Try substituting canned shredded crab meat if you're a crab lover. You can vary the ingredients to taste and based on how large the avocados are. My dip has never come out the same way twice, but always a big hit!
