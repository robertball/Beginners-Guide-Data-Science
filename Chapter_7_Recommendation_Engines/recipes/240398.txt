Ingredients:
3 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/4 pound butter, melted
1/4 cup sherry
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup bread crumbs, or to taste
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces, or more to taste

Directions:
Place parsnips into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat parsnips, melted butter, sherry, heavy whipping cream, salt, and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Spoon into a baking dish and top with bread crumbs; dot with butter pieces.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
