Ingredients:
5 medium sized potatoes, scrubbed and sliced about 1/8” thick (I used Yukon Gold Potatoes)
1 16oz bag frozen spinach, thawed and drained
1 cup fat free feta cheese
1/2 cup liquid egg substitute
2 tbsp light butter (I used Brummel & Brown)
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp paprika, plus more to taste
2 cups fat free milk
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Spray a baking/casserole dish with non-fat cooking spray.
Squeeze out as much water from the spinach as possible.
Layer half the potato slices in the baking dish (it’s ok to overlap them a bit). Season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Top with the spinach and feta cheese. Then cover with the remaining slices of potatoes. Season these potato slices with salt, pepper, and paprika.
In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together egg substitute, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and the 1 tsp paprika.
Pour mixture over the potatoes. Dollop butter evenly over the top (I just placed little pieces of the butter all over the top, and then spread it a bit with a spoon).
Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Remove foil and bake for another 30-40 minutes, or until top of au gratin is golden.
Remove from oven and let cool about 10-15 minutes before serving. Cut into 6 equally sized portions.
