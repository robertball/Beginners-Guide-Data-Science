Ingredients:
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 egg
1 cup panko crumbs
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Sea Salt
1/4 teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Garlic Powder
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Onion Powder
1/4 cup Mazola® Corn Oil

Directions:
Pound chicken breasts, one at a time in a resealable freezer bag, until about 1/2-inch thick. Lightly beat egg in a shallow bowl. Combine panko crumbs, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken breasts in egg until coated, drip off excess and dip in panko mixture. Press chicken into crumbs until fully coated.
Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat. Transfer chicken to pan and cook about 2 to 3 minutes per side or until chicken is brown, crispy and fully cooked.
