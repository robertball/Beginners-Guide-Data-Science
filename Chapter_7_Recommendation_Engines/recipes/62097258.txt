Ingredients:
- 2 lbs. ground beef hamburger
- 2 eggs (1 per lb.)
- 4 tbsp. onion powder
- 4 tbsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 c. ketchup
- 2 slices of bread (1 per lb.)
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Mix the hamburger and eggs together in a medium bowl.
Wet the slices of bread under water and "wring" out until just moist and add to the mixture.
Add all of the spices and the ketchup and mix VERY WELL with your hands for about 4 minutes.
Form the mixture into a loaf shape and put into a dutch oven or a noodle pot with a metal lid.  (Just an ordinary oven safe pot with a lid would do, but I use an all metal pot with a lid, that I would use on the stovepot).
Add about 1 cup of water to the pot and cover.
Bake for 2 hours (1 per lb.)
Remove from the pot and serve.

Description: 
This meatloaf is wonderful and holds together beautifully!  My grandmother used to make this for as long as I could remember.  I think the way that she cooked it was how it came out so wonderful and moist!  You'll never forget this meatloaf!
