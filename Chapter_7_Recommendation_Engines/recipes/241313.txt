Ingredients:
1/4 pound bacon
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup sliced stuffed olives
1/4 pound ham, diced
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated crusty French loaf dough
1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels until cooled. Cut bacon into small pieces.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine bacon pieces, raisins, olives, ham, and cloves in a bowl. Roll dough onto a work surface and spread bacon mixture evenly over the top. Roll dough around the bacon filling, ensuring the edges match up to form a loaf-shape again. Place dough, seam-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Cool bread for 10 minutes; slice into 1/2-inch pieces.
Place apricot preserves in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave, stirring at 30 second intervals, until melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Serve preserves on the side or drizzle over bread.
