Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
⅔ cup diced onion
1 ⅓ cups ketchup
⅔ cup apple cider vinegar
⅓ cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon ground dry mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x8-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Place the chicken breasts into the prepared baking dish.
Stir together the onion, ketchup, cider vinegar, brown sugar, ground mustard, ginger, and salt and pepper in a saucepan until the mixture is well combined. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes, stirring frequently.
Pour the sauce over the chicken, cover the dish with foil, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake the chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, and the sauce is slightly browned and bubbling, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
Fast, easy and so tasty, this chicken is sweet, tangy and moist.  I serve with rice, but mashed potatoes are good too.  Comfort food from my grandma.
