Ingredients:
2 quarts beef broth
3/4 to 1 cup uncooked barley
2 large carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
1 zucchini, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans ( I usually leave this out as I don't like garbanzo beans)
1 onion, chopped
3 bay leaves
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoon dried parsley
2 teaspoon curry powder
2 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Pour the beef broth into a large pot. Add the barley, carrots, celery, tomatoes, zucchini, garbanzo beans, onion, and bay leaves. Season with garlic powder, sugar, salt, pepper, parsley, curry powder, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 90 minutes. The soup will be very thick. You may adjust by adding more broth or less barley if desired. Remove bay leaves before serving.
You can add meat to this soup alwo.
