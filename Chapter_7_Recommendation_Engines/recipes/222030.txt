Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons olive oil
2/3 cup chopped green onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
2 (3 ounce) fillets catfish
1 teaspoon brown sugar

Directions:
Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir green onions, garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in the hot oil until vegetables are softened, about 2 minutes. Stir lemon juice and 1/4 cup brown sugar into green onion mixture, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes more.
Place catfish fillets into the skillet; cook until catfish easily flakes with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer catfish to a plate and pour remaining lemon juice sauce on top. Sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.
