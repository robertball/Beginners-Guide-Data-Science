2 tablespoons melted butter
1 bunch fresh spinach
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup tomato sauce

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Thoroughly clean the spinach. Remove stems, and chop. Steam until wilted. Stir fry mushrooms in oil over high heat until browned.
Cut all 4 pieces of phyllo in half.  Brush each sheet with melted butter, and put in two piles.  In the center of each stack, place first 1/2 of  the spinach followed by 1/2 of the feta, mushrooms, and tomato sauce.  Bring the sides of phyllo dough around, and to the top of the bundles.  Place on baking sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
