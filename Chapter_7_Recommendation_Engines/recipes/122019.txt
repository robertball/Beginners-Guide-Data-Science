Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
7 tablespoons sesame seeds
6 tablespoons apricot jam

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in extract. Combine the flour and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture.
Roll into 1-in. balls, then roll in sesame seeds. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make an indentation in the center of each ball. Fill with jam. Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
This recipe is a favorite of mine to make for special occasions. The cookies freeze beautifully, so they can conveniently be made ahead of time. Substitute peach, strawberry or raspberry jam if you like.
