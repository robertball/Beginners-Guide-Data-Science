Ingredients:
vegetable cooking spray
½ cup all-purpose flour
2  egg whites
2 tablespoons water
1 (4 ounce) packet saltine crackers, crushed
¾ cup ground pecans
2 tablespoons paprika
1 ½ teaspoons ground cayenne pepper (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken tenders

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spray a wire rack with cooking spray and set on top of a baking sheet.
Pour flour into a wide bowl.
Whisk egg whites with water in a separate bowl until foamy.
Mix saltine crackers, pecans, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper together in a shallow bowl.
Dredge chicken tenders in flour, dip in egg whites, then coat with cracker mixture. Arrange on the wire rack. Spray chicken tenders lightly with cooking spray; flip and spray the second side.
Roast in the preheated oven, turning once halfway through, until crisp, 18 to 20 minutes.
