Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon almond extract
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 (12 ounce) jar raspberry jam

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in extract. Combine flour and baking powder; gradually add to the creamed mixture.
Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. With a moistened finger, make diagonal indentations every 2 in. in both directions, about 1/3 in. deep. Fill indentations with jam. Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.
