Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3-4 bananas, mashed
3/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten (or 2)
1/3 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon (for top)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, nuts, vanilla, spices, and salt. In another bowl, beat together bananas, white sugar, egg, and melted butter. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. Cut in 1 tablespoon butter until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle topping over muffins.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
