Directions:
Start with the sauce.
Dice and sautee the vegetables in a stock pot.  While they're cooking, add your TVP into the beef broth.  Go stir your veggies.  Start browning your ground turkey.
Combine the turkey and TVP into the veggies.  Add the tomato and spices.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer.
While that's simmering, make your pasta.
Combine the semolina and the flour.  Make a little well in the flour.  Crack in your eggs and knead into a heavy dough.  Crank into the pasta machine and churn out noodles.  Boil them till they float.
Now you can make your baked spaghetti:
Preheat the oven to 350F
Layer noodles, cottage cheese, sauce, and mozzarella in a large lasagna dish.  Repeat twice.  Top with parmesan.
Cover and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  Uncover and bake another 20-25 minutes until the cheese is melted and browned.
