Ingredients:
1 cup red enchilada sauce (homemade or canned)
1 tsp coconut oil (opt)
2 1/2 cups peeled butternut squash, cut 1/2-inch-dice
salt and pepper, to taste
1 small onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno, seeded and diced
10 oz can Rotel tomatoes with green chilies
1 1/2 cups canned black beans, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup cilantro
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/4 cup water
8 medium gf flour tortillas
1 cup vegan cheese sauce or shredded non-dairy cheese (opt)
2 tbsp chopped scallions, for garnish
non-dairy sour cream, for serving (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
Place 1/4 cup enchilada sauce on the bottom of a large baking dish.
Heat oil over medium-high heat in large skillet. Add onions, garlic, and jalapeno and cook 2-3 minutes until onions become translucent and garlic is fragrant. Add cubed butternut, Rotel tomatoes, black beans, water,  cilantro, cumin and chili powder and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender, about 30 to 35 minutes.
Place about a generous 1/3 cup filling in the center of each tortilla and roll, place on the baking dish seam side down. Repeat with the remaining filling. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese and bake, covered with foil until hot and the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Top with scallions and eat with sour cream if desired.
