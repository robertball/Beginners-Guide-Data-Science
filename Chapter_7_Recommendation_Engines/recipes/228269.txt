Description: 
Fresh summer flavors that make an excellent topper for salads or sides with a bbq meal. Add a little cilantro for an extra fresh pop if you like. You could also spice it up with some fresh jalapeno. I designed this recipe myself, and my family loved it. I truly hope that you will try it and love it too!
