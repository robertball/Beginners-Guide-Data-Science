Ingredients:
1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon vanilla
6 (8 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
1. Spoon about one heaping quarter cup of pie filling evenly down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle with cinnamon and roll up, tucking in edges; and place seam side down in prepared dish.
2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar and water. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes, remove from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla.
3. Pour sauce over enchiladas and let stand 45 minutes.
Note: Don't rush the 45 minute resting time for the sauce on the enchiladas before baking, this step helps to magically transform the flour tortillas into a faux pasty dough.
4. Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes, or until golden.
