Ingredients:
Rice:
1 1/4 cups chicken broth
1 cup jasmine rice
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 bay leaf
Sushi:
1/2 cucumber, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 pinch salt, or as needed
4 ounces imitation crabmeat, shredded
1/2 zucchini, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1/2 yellow squash, cut into matchstick-size pieces
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, rice, ginger, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and bay leaf in a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer until rice is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove pot from heat and allow rice to cool, at least 30 minutes.
Place cucumber in a bowl and sprinkle 1 pinch salt over cucumber.
Mix crabmeat, cucumber, zucchini, squash, and sesame seeds into rice mixture.

Description: 
Love California roll sushi, but don't have the nori or rolling mat? Try this simple and fast rice salad. It's easy to swap out ingredients to make it to your liking. Try avocado, ahi tuna, smoked fish, or even strips of salami to customize the recipe. Serve sushi with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger.
