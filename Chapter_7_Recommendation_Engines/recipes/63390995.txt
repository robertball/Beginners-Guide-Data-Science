Ingredients:
3 lbs. pork spareribs
10 cloves of garlic
3 tbsp. Hoisin sauce
2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
1 tbsp. honey
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
1/4 cup flour or cornstarch
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Wash, dry and trim the spare ribs then cut them into 1-rib pieces.
Coat each rib in flour or corn starch, shaking to remove excess.
Heat the oil in a frying pan and shallow fry the ribs for several minutes, until browned and crispy on the exterior.
Drain on paper towels and set aside. The ribs should still be rare inside but they'll finish cooking in the slow cooker.
Peel the garlic and grate them finely. You can also do a fine mince.
In a bowl, combine the Hoisin sauce, soy sauce, garlic, honey, balsamic vinegar and water.
Arrange the spareribs in the slow cooker neatly then pour the sauce over it. Cook on low for 4 hours.
Remove the spareribs and place in a serving dish.
Run the sauce through a fat separator or use a spoon to skim all the fat off the top layer.
Pour the sauce over the ribs and serve immediately.

Description: 
Garlicky Asian style spare ribs that are savory and fall-off-the bone tender. They are best served with steamed rice to soak up the garlic sauce.
