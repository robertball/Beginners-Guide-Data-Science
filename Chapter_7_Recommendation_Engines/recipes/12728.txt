Heat olive oil in paella pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and pepper; cook and stir for a few minutes.  Add chorizo sausage, diced chicken, and rice; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 3 1/2 cups stock, wine, thyme leaves, and saffron. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes; stir occasionally.
