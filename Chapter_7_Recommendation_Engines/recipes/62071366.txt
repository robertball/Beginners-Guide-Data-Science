Ingredients:
4 medium chicken breasts, boneless, skinless
1 tbsp olive oil
8-9 cloves garlic finely minced
1/2 cup liquid honey
water (approx. 1/2 cup)

Directions:
I reccomend using a food processor to mince the garlic, as it should be quite finely chopped.
Saute garlic in oil, then add the chicken.
About halfway through, add honey. Add water, and allow to reduce. Honey will carmelize.
Add more water as required, to keep chicken from drying out.
