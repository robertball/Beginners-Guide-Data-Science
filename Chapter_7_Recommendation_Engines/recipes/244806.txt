Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
6 eggs
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 pound chopped cooked chicken
14 ounces shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
1 bunch green onions, chopped, divided
1/4 cup bacon bits
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place squash, cut-side down, onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Cool until easily handled.
Scrape spaghetti squash flesh into a large bowl using a fork. Whisk eggs, evaporated milk, garlic powder, salt, and oregano together in a separate bowl; pour over squash. Mix chicken, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 of the green onions, bacon bits, and black pepper into squash mixture; pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Top mixture with remaining Parmesan cheese and green onions.
Bake in the oven until cooked through and set, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is South Beach and Atkins Diet friendly. We have been eating high protein, low fat, low carb for quite some time and missed some of our favorite dishes, so I have been finding a way to remake them. This is a great recipe to utilize leftovers!
