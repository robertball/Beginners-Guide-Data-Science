Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 onion, finely chopped
4 fresh tomato, seeded and chopped
4 cups water
6 sprigs fresh mint, divided
3 zucchini, sliced
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste
2 sprigs fresh basil

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Pour water into the saucepan and bring to a boil. Add 4 sprigs of mint and zucchini. Reduce heat to low and simmer soup, covered, for 15 minutes. Remove mint.
Stir together cornstarch and cold water and add to the soup. Increase heat to medium and whisk cornstarch mixture so soup thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
Chill soup in the refrigerator until cold, about 2 hours. Before serving, add lemon juice and garnish with remaining mint, basil, and remaining olive oil.
