Ingredients:
12 ounces baby spinach leaves
2 Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced
8 ounces Cheddar cheese, cubed
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the spinach, apples, Cheddar cheese and walnuts.  Toss lightly to blend.
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, maple syrup and olive oil. Pour over the salad, and stir to coat. I like to use a bowl with a lid so I can shake the ingredients. Serve immediately.
