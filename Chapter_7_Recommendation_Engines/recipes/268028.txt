Ingredients:
2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), divided
1 red onion, minced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
3 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained
1/3 cup homemade mayonnaise
1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk
1/4 cup almond flour, divided
1/4 cup nutritional yeast, divided
1/2 (8 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay速)
lemon, juiced
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat 1 tablespoon ghee; saute red onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and salt until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in crabmeat, mayonnaise, coconut milk, 1/2 of the almond flour and nutritional yeast, and spinach.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine remaining almond flour and nutritional yeast with remaining 1 tablespoon ghee.
Unlock and remove pressure cooker lid. Transfer dip to an oven-proof serving dish; top with the almond flour mixture and green onions.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Using an Instant Pot速 speeds up this easy dip that is delicious! I may or may not have eaten the leftovers (which I squirreled away from my kiddos) for breakfast. This dip is also paleo and Whole30速 friendly! For dipping, serve with cucumber, red and yellow peppers, plantain chips, or radishes. The final baking step is optional.
