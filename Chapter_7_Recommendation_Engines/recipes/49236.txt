Ingredients:
12 slices bacon, cut in half
2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped
1 1/2 medium onions, chopped
6 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
6 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
In a large deep skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Remove bacon to paper towels, and reserve drippings in the skillet.
Place fresh green beans in a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover the bottom by 1 inch. Cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until bright green and tender. Drain.
Place the green beans into a 2 quart casserole dish. Spread the onions in a layer over the green beans. Place bacon strips in a layer over the onions. Sprinkle almonds over the top. Heat the reserved drippings in the skillet over medium heat. Stir in vinegar and sugar, heating just until sugar is dissolved; drizzle over everything in the dish. Cover, and chill for at least one hour, but overnight is best.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake uncovered, for 45 minutes, until the onions are tender, and the almonds are toasted. Check after 30 minutes, and cover if necessary.

Description: 
A different twist to the usual green bean casserole. Given to me years ago by my ex-mother-in-law, this is a tasty, fresh, sweet and tangy new way to serve green beans and it's sure to become a family favorite! Prepare the night before and marinate overnight for the best results. Enjoy!
