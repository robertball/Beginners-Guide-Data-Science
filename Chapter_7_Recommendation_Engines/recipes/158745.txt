Ingredients:
2 acorn squash, halved and seeded
1 (8 ounce) package low fat cream cheese
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons brown sugar substitute (e.g., SplendaÂ®)
1/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; place squash cut-side down onto foil.
Bake squash in preheated oven until tender when pierced with a fork, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.
Scoop the cooked squash into the bowl of an electric mixer. Add the cream cheese, then sprinkle with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar substitute. Beat until smooth, then scoop the squash mixture into a 2 quart baking dish and sprinkle with chopped walnuts.
Return the squash to the preheated oven, and bake until hot, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I love acorn squash with butter and sugar, but since that doesn't go over very well with a low-fat, low-sugar diet I came up with this alternative.  Feel free to adjust the seasonings to suit your individual tastes.
