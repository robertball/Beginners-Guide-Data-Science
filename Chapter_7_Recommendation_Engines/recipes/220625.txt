Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, diced small
1/2 cup minced onion
1 clove garlic, crushed
1/2 cup yellow bell pepper, diced
1 cup diced potato
3/4 cup asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
8 ounces crabmeat
2 cups skim milk
1 cup half-and-half
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Cook and stir the bacon and onion in a saucepan over medium-high heat until the onion is translucent, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir the garlic and yellow bell pepper into the bacon mixture; cook and stir together another 2 minutes.
Mix the diced potato, asparagus, crabmeat, skim milk, half-and-half, salt, and black pepper into the bacon mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook until the potatoes are tender, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
Creamy soup with crab, potatoes, and asparagus. I made this on a whim one Sunday when crabmeat was on sale at the store. It comes together quickly and is very tasty! You could easily replace the asparagus with another vegetable with equally good results.
