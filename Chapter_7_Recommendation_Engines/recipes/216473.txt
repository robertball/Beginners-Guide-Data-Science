Ingredients:
1 celeriac (celery root), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/3 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Place the celeriac cubes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 12 minutes. Add the potatoes, and continue boiling until the vegetables are very tender, about 15 minutes more. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
Return the vegetables to the pot, and stir over medium-high heat until liquid is no longer pooling from the vegetables. Remove from the heat, and pour in the cream and butter. Mash with a potato masher until almost smooth.

Description: 
An easy, delicious way to use celeriac or even make mashed potatoes a little more exciting. Can make a low fat version by using low fat milk and cutting back on the butter. Adapted from Bon Appetite.
