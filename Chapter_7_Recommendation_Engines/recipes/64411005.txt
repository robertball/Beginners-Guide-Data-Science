2 tablespoons/30 mL ground black pepper
1/4 cup/60 mL granulated garlic

Description: 
There's a big shaker of Magic Dust next to the salt and pepper in my own kitchen and at all my restaurants. I wish I could figure out a way to attach the bottle to the restaurant tables because, at my restaurants, it's the most frequently stolen item!
