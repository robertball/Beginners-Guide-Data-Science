Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
10 ounces beef sirloin steak
salt and black pepper to taste
1 nectarine, pitted and thinly sliced
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 (4 ounce) package mixed spring greens
1/2 ounce basil, thinly sliced
1 ounce crumbled feta
1 ounce pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season steak on all sides with salt and pepper. Sear steak in the hot skillet until evenly browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until cooked to desired doneness, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove steak from oven; set aside to rest for 5 minutes.
Place nectarines in the same skillet over high heat. Sear until caramelized and charred on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes.
Whisk together shallot, red wine vinegar, and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large salad bowl to make vinaigrette. Season with salt and pepper. Add spring mix and basil to the vinaigrette; toss to combine.
Thinly slice steak against the grain on a cutting board. Arrange steak, nectarines, feta, and pecans over salad.
