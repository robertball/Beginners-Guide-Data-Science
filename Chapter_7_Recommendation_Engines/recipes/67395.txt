Ingredients:
1 cup shelled macadamia nuts
1 cup shelled pistachio nuts
1 cup shelled walnuts
1 cup slivered almonds
1 pound pork sausage
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 cups chopped yellow onion
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced celery
1 1/2 cups peeled, diced carrots
2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
2 (16 ounce) packages dry bread stuffing mix
2 1/2 tablespoons dried sage
salt and pepper to taste
5 cups chicken stock

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a large baking dish.
Spread macadamia nuts, pistachios, walnuts, and almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake 5 to 10 minutes, stirring often, until lightly toasted.
Place sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Set aside, and drain skillet. Melt butter in the skillet, and cook the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic until tender.
In a large bowl, toss together the dry bread stuffing mix, roasted nuts, sausage, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic. Season with sage, salt, and pepper. Mix in 3 cups chicken stock. Gradually add remaining chicken stock as needed to make the mixture evenly moist. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. (Or use to stuff the turkey just before roasting.)
Bake stuffing 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until crisp and golden brown.
