Ingredients:
1/2 cup raw honey
3 tablespoons coconut cream (not milk)

Directions:
Prepare a timer.
In a medium saucepan, whisk together the 2 ingredients.
Heat over medium-high (7 on an induction stove) and stir constantly until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Set the timer for 4 minutes, stirring constantly scraping down the sides. The bubbles will be airy yet high, so continue stirring and scraping down the sides of the pot.
After precisely four minutes, remove from the heat source. The caramel at this point is scorching hot, do not touch yet. Allow to cool for about 3 minutes before using. The caramel will thicken as it cools. Use immediately or put in a covered container and store in the refrigerator up to 3 days.
A note about coconut cream: purchase coconut cream or buy a can of coconut milk, turn it upside down and refrigerate for 24 hours. Turn upright, skim the cream off the top of the can, the liquid at the bottom can be used in other recipes. Be warned that many brands of coconut cream will add thickeners (natural and not) to get a thick consistency. Making your own coconut milk (a recipe on this website) is a more natural solution and what I used with this recipe.
