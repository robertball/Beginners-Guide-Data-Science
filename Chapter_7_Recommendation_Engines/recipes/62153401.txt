Ingredients:
1/4 c. sundried tomatoes -- chopped or sliced
1/4 c. toasted almonds -- sliced
1/4 c. fresh mozzarella -- cubed
3 cloves roasted garlic -- sliced
fresh greens (I use Belgium Endive, a little Radiccio, Baby Spinach and red leaf lettuce)
Italian Dressing (I like Chiavetta's, which is strong and pungent)

Directions:
Roast the garlic -- 20 seconds on high in a microwave is a quick and easy alternative to baking. Keep peel on while baking or microwaving (peel and slice after cloves cool)
Meanwhile, combine sundried tomatoes, almonds, mozzarella and leaf lettuce. Add roasted garlic and lightly toss.
Top with an Italian-style dressing and enjoy!
