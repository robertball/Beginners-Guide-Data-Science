Ingredients:
4 egg yolks
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 ounces dried linguine
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage, bias-sliced 1/2-inch thick
1 clove garlic, minced
2 cups coarsely chopped spinach
1/4 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, milk, 1/2 cup cheese, lemon zest, and black pepper. Set aside.
In a 4-quart Dutch oven, cook linguine in a large amount of boiling salted water according to package directions, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Return linguine to Dutch oven.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook sausage over medium heat for 5 minutes or until browned, adding garlic in the last minute of cooking.
Pour egg yolk mixture over linguine in Dutch oven. Add sausage and spinach; toss to coat. The heat from the pan and the linguine cooks and thickens the egg yolk, making a silky sauce. If needed, stir in enough reserved pasta cooking water to reach desired consistency. Toss with parsley.
Serve immediately. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
