Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 cup brown sugar
2 tsp vanilla essence
½ cup butter, very soft
2 cups milk
½ cup plain flour
1 cup desiccated coconut

Directions:
Beat the eggs with hand mixer until foamy.
Add remaining ingredients, mix briefly until combined.
Pour mixture into a greased pie shape and bake for about 60 minutes in the oven at 180°C.
Cool the pie, then carefully run a knife around the edge to gently separate it from the side of the dish.  Nudge the pie a bit with the knife to get it lose enough to move around a tiny bit in the dish. Place a plate on the pie and turn the dish upside down (bottom is at the top now, so you have to repeat the process with a serving dish).
Before serving sprinkle with some desiccated coconut or powdered sugar.
