2 eggs
2 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda

Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Cream butter, brown sugar, and honey in large bowl.
Beat in applesauce and vanilla. Beat in eggs, one at a time.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in small bowl.
Add flour mixture to butter mixture one third at a time, stirring between each addition.
Add in oats, oat bran, walnuts, crasins, golden rasins, chocolate chips, coconut, and apples. Stir until mixture becomes like a thick cookie dough.
Cover a cookie sheet with a layer of parchment paper.
