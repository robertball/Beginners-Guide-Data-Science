Ingredients:
3-4 sliced fresh peaches
12	oz 	thawed frozen strawberries
1/3	c 	all-purpose flour
½  	c 	white sugar
½ 	c 	brown sugar
¼ 	c 	butter
¼ 	tsp 	nutmeg
1	tsp 	cinnamon
1 	T 	cornstarch
1 9” double piecrust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450º F. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugars, butter, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cornstarch until crumbly.
In a large bowl, stir together sliced peaches and thawed strawberries.
Place one piecrust in a 9” pie plate; lightly prick with fork to allow steam to escape. Line crust with a layer of peach and strawberry mixture. Layer crumble on top of peach-strawberry layer; repeat layers.
Top with remaining piecrust, forming a lattice crust out of strips, if desired.
Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350ºF; continue to bake 30 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Turn oven off. Let pie rest in oven 1 to 2 hours before removing. Let cool before slicing.
