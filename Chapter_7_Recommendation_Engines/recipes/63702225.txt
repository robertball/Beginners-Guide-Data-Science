Ingredients:
1 (16 oz.) box Pillsbury Sugar Free
Devil's Food cake mix
1 (15 oz.) can Libby's pure pumpkin
1 (8 oz.) pkg. Hershey's Sugar Free
chocolate chips, optional
12 (2 1/2") foil baking cups

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with the foil baking cups. Set aside.
Pour the cake mix into a large bowl. Add the can of pumpkin and stir until completely smooth and uniform. Batter will be very thick. DO NOT add any of the other ingredients mentioned on the cake box, not even water. Fold in the chocolate chips now, if desired.
Evenly distribute the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.
Store leftover muffins covered in the refrigerator.
