Ingredients:
2 lbs. Chicken Breast, boneless & skinless
1 box Chicken Stock
1 box water (ie: use the chicken stock box)
1 yellow onion
1 head of celery, including leaves
5 black pepper corns
1 bay leaf
3 carrots
2-3 table spoons of tomato paste
3 tsp. salt

Directions:
Trim and clean chicken breast and cut in half, trying to obtain pieces that are equal in weight.  Leave chicken on cutting board to allow it to come to room temperature while preparing the stock for poaching.
Add stock, water and all the ingredients, except for the chicken, to a pot. Ensure that the pot has a good lid.  Bring poaching liquid almost to a boil and then reduce to a strong simmer for 30-45 minutes checking for taste as you go.  The poaching liquid is done when the onion, carrots and celery have some softness to them.
Bring poaching liquid back to a boil and then add the chicken. If the chicken is not completely covered add more water.  Bring poaching liquid back to a boil.  Once a boil has been obtained remove the pot from the heat and cover for 15 minutes.  The chicken can then be removed from the poaching liquid and permitted to come down to room temperature and then refrigerated until needed.
