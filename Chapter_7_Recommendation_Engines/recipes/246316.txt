Ingredients:
10 wood or bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
1 head cauliflower, broken into 2-inch florets
1/2 cup ranch dressing
1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk together olive oil, salt and pepper in a mixing bowl large enough to hold the cauliflower. Add the cauliflower and toss until each piece is coated with the oil mixture.
Skewer cauliflower pieces on pre-soaked skewers. Place skewers on a roasting rack.
Roast in pre-heated oven for 30 minutes.
While cauliflower is roasting, mix dressing and hot sauce together in a small mixing bowl.
After 30 minutes, remove cauliflower from the oven and immediately paint them with the hot sauce mixture.
Top with the blue cheese and serve immediately.
