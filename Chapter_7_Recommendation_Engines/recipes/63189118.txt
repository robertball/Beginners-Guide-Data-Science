Ingredients:
1 Quart water
12 to 15 Tamarind pods shell skin remove1 break them into pieces about 1 seed per piece
Hobanero Pepper chopped seeds and all
2 Garlic cloves chopped
1 Tbsp Brown sugar
The juice of 1 lime
Fresh cilantro about 1/4 cup unchopped
1 Tbsp white vinegar
Salt to flavor
Fresh ground black Pepper

Directions:
In a sauce pan add the water and add the Tamarind pieces, Hobenero pepper and Garlic. Bring the water to a brisk boil and add salt and pepper.
Reduce the heat to a simmer and continue to cook stirring occasionally and add the sugar.
Simmer until the Tamarind breaks down and the seeds are coming out. The outer pods will thicken the water as it cooks down. I help it along by pressing it up against the side of the pot with a slotted spoon.
Try to remove the seeds as you go along and dis guard them.
When the sauce thickens to tomato soup or a bisque consistency add the lime juice + the vinegar and cilantro. Simmer about another minute or two and remove the pot from the flame.
Poor the sauce into a fine wire mesh sieve and gently but firmly push as much of everything through the sieve with a spoon as possible. At the end you should have just about a palm full of almost dry residual left. Scrape the bottom of the sieve of into the bowl. Dis guard the leftover residual in the sieve.
