Ingredients:
1/4 cup minced garlic
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoons garlic powder
3 tablespoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder (optional)
3 pounds ground moose
2 tablespoons canola oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir together the minced garlic, soy sauce, and honey together in a small saucepan.  Stir in garlic powder, onion powder, and chili powder.  Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and gently simmer for 15 minutes, then set aside.
While the sauce is simmering, roll the ground moose into meatballs in 2 tablespoon portions.  Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the meatballs in batches until well browned, and cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes; drain well.
Place the drained meatballs into a baking dish.  Pour on the sauce, and stir until well coated.  Bake in preheated oven for about 20 minutes so the meatballs absorb some of the sauce.
