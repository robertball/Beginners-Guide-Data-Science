Ingredients:
8 large red potatoes
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
1/2 gallon milk
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese (such as VelveetaÂ®), cubed
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon onion salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap potatoes in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool potatoes until easily handled and cut into cubes.
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble.
Combine milk, cream, sour cream, processed cheese, and Cheddar cheese in a large pot over medium heat; cook, stirring frequently, until cheeses are melted, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes and bacon to milk mixture and simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently, until potatoes begin to dissolve into soup, about 20 minutes; season with onion salt and black pepper.

Description: 
Everyone who has tried this soup loves it. It is a good soup for veggie haters. Baking the potatoes first gives them the perfect texture for this thick creamy soup. You won't be disappointed. I always serve this with crackers and top the soup with a bit more shredded Cheddar, crumbled bacon, and a dollop of sour cream.
