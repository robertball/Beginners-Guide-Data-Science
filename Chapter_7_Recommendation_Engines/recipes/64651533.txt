Prepare a warm bowl of water. Dip rice papers in the warm water and drain off excess.
Place between damp kitchen towels until ready to fill. Work with one at a time to prevent sticking. Or you can dip in warm water as you go to fill each wrapper.
In the center of a rice paper add 1/4 cup of the cabbage filling then top with cilantro and scallions.
To wrap â€“ Fold one edge over the filling, fold in sides, and roll up. Store in clear wrap until ready to use.

Description: 
The pickles do add great additional flavor to these Asian Pickle Spring Rolls and they go great with my Lemongrass and Pickle Chicken Stir Fry. I even added minced pickles to the dipping sauce.. Yum
