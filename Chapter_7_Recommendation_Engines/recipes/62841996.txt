Ingredients:
Any 1 box of Pilsbury cake mix
2 cups of cool whip thawed
1 egg whipped
crisco to grease the cookie sheet
1-1/2 cups of powdered sugar

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease cookie sheet with Crisco.
Place the cake mix, cool whip, and whipped egg in a bowl and mix well.
Roll the dough into balls (you might want to grese your hands in a little crisco and powdered sugar - it helps!) and roll it in the powdered sugar to coat.
Place the balls on the cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes.  You want them to still be pretty soft when they come out of the oven.  Transfer them to a cooling rack after about a minute of sitting on the cookie sheet.
Enjoy!
