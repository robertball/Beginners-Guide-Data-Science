Ingredients:
Catfish:
1 whole catfish
oil for deep frying
Salad:
1 cup matchstick-cut green mango pieces
1/2 cup shallots, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup peanuts
4 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons lime juice, or more to taste
3 Thai chiles, finely chopped, or to taste
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place catfish on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until flesh is opaque, 10 to 15 minutes. Flake into large pieces with a fork. Lay the flaked fish out on a plate to dry.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Fry fish in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Try not to break up the fish too much in the pan.
Toss mango, shallots, cilantro, green onions, peanuts, fish sauce, lime juice, Thai chiles, and sugar together in a large bowl. Toss in crispy catfish at the very last minute. Check the seasoning; the salad should taste sour, hot, and salty, with a slight sweetness at the end.
