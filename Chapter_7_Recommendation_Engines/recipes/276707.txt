Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bacon
6 cups broccoli florets
6 cups cauliflower florets
2 cups slivered almonds
1 1/2 cups golden raisins
1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
1 medium red onion, finely chopped
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
Dressing:
1 cup mayonnaise
1 cup sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels until cool enough to handle, then chop into small pieces.
Place bacon in a very large bowl with broccoli, cauliflower, almonds, raisins, Cheddar cheese, red onion, and celery.
Whisk together mayonnaise, sour cream, cream cheese, sugar, and lemon juice in a separate bowl until creamy. Pour over broccoli-cauliflower mixture; stir until well combined. Refrigerate until flavors have melded, at least 30 minutes.
