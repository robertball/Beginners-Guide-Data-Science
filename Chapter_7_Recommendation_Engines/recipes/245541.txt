Ingredients:
1 pound ground chicken
2 cups whole wheat bread crumbs
1 stalk celery, minced
1  egg
¼ cup melted butter
⅓ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
salt and ground black pepper to taste
cooking spray

Directions:
Combine ground chicken, bread crumbs, celery, and egg in a bowl.
Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat; stir in hot sauce. Pour into chicken mixture; knead until well incorporated. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spray a large baking dish with cooking spray.
Roll chicken mixture into 1-inch balls; place in a single layer on baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I bring these to several parties throughout the year with rave reviews. It's really a take on Buffalo chicken wings. I keep getting requests for them all the time. Serve with toothpicks and blue cheese dressing.
