Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs
1/3 cup butter, cubed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Streusel Topping:
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
3/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x11-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Place sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and measure 3 cups sweet potatoes; transfer back into the pot. Reserve remaining sweet potatoes for another use.
Mix white sugar, milk, eggs, cubed butter, and vanilla extract into sweet potatoes using an electric mixer until completely smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared dish.
Combine pecans, coconut, brown sugar, flour, and melted butter in a bowl until evenly mixed and crumbly; sprinkle evenly over sweet potato mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until topping is browned, 20 to 30 minutes.
