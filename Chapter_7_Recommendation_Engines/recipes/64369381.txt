Ingredients:
1 Cups Cake Flour
2 Cups Flour
2 tsp Baking Powder
? tsp Salt
¼ tsp Cloves, ground (optional)
¼ tsp Nutmeg, ground
6 oz. Butter, grated (3/4 cup, cold)
1/2 Cups Sugar
4 large Granny Smith apples
2 Eggs
3/4 cups Milk
2 T. Sugar + 1 tsp cinnamon mixed(for sprinkling on top of cake)

Directions:
Grease and flour an 8" or 9" round springform pan. (Using an 8" pan will give you a taller cake.)
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, cloves (if using) and nutmeg into a large mixing bowl. (Make sure the bowl is very large to allow room for the apples to be folded in.)
Cut the butter into the flour using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.
Add the 3/4 Cups sugar to the flour mixture and mix in.
Peel the apples and slice them into uniform pieces. This cake works best and gets that 'chunky apple look' if the slices are about ¼" wide and then cut into 3 pieces. (I cut them into 1/4 inch squares)
Toss the apples into the flour mixture and combine them thoroughly.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and milk together. Add to the apples and flour and mix in with a large spatula until just combined. Batter will be thick and dough-like.
Transfer the dough into the prepared cake pan and flatten the top surface using the back of your spatula.
Sprinkle the sugar & cinnamon over the top of the cake.
Bake for 45-50 minutes. Test the center for doneness. The top of the cake should be golden brown. Serve slices with custard sauce. (see recipe for custard sauce)
