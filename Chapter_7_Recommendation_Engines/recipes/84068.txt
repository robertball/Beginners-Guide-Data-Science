Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) packages Regular Flavor Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage, cooked, crumbled and drained
2 (8.5 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls
2 cups frozen hash brown potato cubes, thawed
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
6 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/3 cup diced green bell pepper (optional)
1/3 cup diced red bell pepper (optional)
1/3 cup diced yellow bell pepper (optional)
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 F. Separate crescent rolls into sixteen triangles. Place in two ungreased 12 inch rimmed pizza pans with points toward the center. In each pan, press rolls together, seal perforations and form a circle 1 inch larger in diameter than bottom of pan. Turn edges under to make a slight rim.
Sprinkle cooked sausage evenly over each crust. Top with potatoes; add peppers and/or green onions, if desired. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Combine eggs, milk, salt and pepper in small bowl: stir well. Pour half of the egg mixture evenly over each pizza. Sprinkle with Parmesan.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until eggs are set and crusts are golden.
