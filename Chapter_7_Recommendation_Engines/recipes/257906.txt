Ingredients:
8 lamb chops
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Mint Oil:
1/4 cup mint leaves
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Brush lamb chops with 1 tablespoon olive oil; season with rosemary, salt, and pepper. Marinate in the refrigerator, 15 minutes to 2 hours.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet. Cook lamb chops until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Combine mint leaves, 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a blender; blend until smooth. Drizzle over lamb chops.
