Ingredients:
1 pound beef shoulder center steaks (Ranch) or boneless top sirloin steak, cut 3/4 inch thick
2/3 cup reduced-fat non-creamy Caesar dressing, divided
4 whole wheat pita breads
3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Italian cheese blend, divided
6 cups loosely packed sliced romaine lettuce
1 cup diced seeded tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Cut beef steak lengthwise in half, then crosswise into 1/8-inch thick strips. Combine beef and 1/3 cup dressing in medium bowl; toss to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes.
Place pita breads slightly overlapping on metal baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons cheese on each pita. Bake in 350 degrees F oven 10 to 12 minutes or until pitas are toasted and cheese is melted.
Meanwhile, remove beef from marinade, draining well; discard marinade. Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add 1/2 of beef; stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or until outside surface of beef is no longer pink. Remove from skillet. Repeat with remaining beef.
Toss lettuce, tomatoes and remaining 1/2 cup cheese in large bowl. Add beef and remaining 1/3 cup dressing; toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Divide beef mixture evenly over pitas. Serve immediately.
