Ingredients:
1 pound dry ziti pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1/2 green pepper
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 pound ground italian sausage
2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
salt to taste
1 1/2 (16 ounce) packages shredded Italian blend cheese or mozzarella
1 16 oz container sour cream
1 16 oz container ricotta cheese
freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, pepper & garlic in oil until tender. Transfer to a small bowl.
Place ground beef and sausage in the skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Stir in the onion mixture and the spaghetti sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large baking dish, layer 1/2 of the cooked pasta, 1/3 of the shredded cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese, and 1/2 of the meat mixture. Then layer the rest of the pasta,  1/3 of the shredded cheese, remaining sour cream, ricotta cheese and meat mixture, top with rest of shredded cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until heated through and cheeses are melted. Serve with grated parmesan.
