Ingredients:
1 pound ground pork sausage
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
1 cup frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
5 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook and stir sausage in a hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Separate crescent roll dough into 8 triangles. Arrange triangles on an ungreased 12-inch pie pan with points turned toward the center. Press over the bottom and up the sides to form a crust, sealing perforations completely.
Spoon sausage over the crust. Sprinkle hash browns on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese.
Beat eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over the filling. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set and cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes.
