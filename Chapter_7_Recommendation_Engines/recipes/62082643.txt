Description: 
This is the most delicious wickedly chocolate mousse I've ever eaten!! You won't taste the tofu and your guests will never guess your secret ingredient. Make sure you use silken tofu (I use Nori Mu Brand). It sets up nice and firm and the mouuse can be filled in a graham cracker crust.
