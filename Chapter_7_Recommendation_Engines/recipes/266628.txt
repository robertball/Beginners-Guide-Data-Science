Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound (1/2-inch thick) pork chops
kosher salt to taste
freshly ground black pepper
1 cup barbeque sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 limes, juiced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Add pork chops to hot oil in the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, whisk barbecue sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, and garlic powder together in a bowl for the 'crack' sauce. Pour sauce over golden pork chops and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until pork shops are cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Garnish with parsley.
