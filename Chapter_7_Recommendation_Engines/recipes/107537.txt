Add cumin and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, broth, corn and black beans; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes to allow flavors to blend. Stir in cilantro and tortilla strips; adjust seasoning, including salt and pepper to taste. Ladle soup into bowls and serve with lime wedges.
