Ingredients:
3 eggs, separated
1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk (NOT evaporated milk)
1/2 cup lime juice
2 drops green food coloring (optional)
1 (9 inch) reduced fat graham cracker crust
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/3 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In medium bowl, beat egg yolks; stir in EAGLE BRAND(R), lime juice and food coloring (optional).  Pour into crust.
In medium bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on high speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar on medium speed, 1 tablespoon at a time; beat 4 minutes longer or until sugar is dissolved and stiff, glossy peaks form.
Spread meringue over pie, carefully sealing to edge of crust to prevent meringue from shrinking.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until meringue is lightly brown.  Cool.  Chill before serving.  Store leftovers covered in refrigerator.
