Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 carrots, quartered
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
Chocolate Sauce:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
6 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan and dust with flour.
Combine 2 cups sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and carrots in a blender; blend until very smooth, about 5 minutes.
Pour carrot mixture into a bowl; add flour and baking powder. Mix well to combine. Pour into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack to cool.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cocoa powder, milk, and butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce begins to bubble and thicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and quickly spread over cake.
