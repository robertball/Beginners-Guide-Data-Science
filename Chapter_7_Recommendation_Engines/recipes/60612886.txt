Description: 
This soup is a perfect way to use up leftover roasted chicken, if you don't have any leftovers use chicken thigh meat, is less expensive and adds great flavor to the soup.  I kept the flavors clean and simple using tomato sauce instead of enchilada sauce. Serve with slices of lime, cilantro and tortilla strips.Modified from: Slow-Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup
