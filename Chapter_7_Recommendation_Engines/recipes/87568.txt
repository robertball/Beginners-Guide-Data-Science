Ingredients:
1 pound fresh string beans, stem ends removed
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 teaspoon OLD BAYÂ® Blackened Seasoning
1/3 cup pecan pieces
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Add green beans, return to a boil and cook 1 minute; the beans should still be crisp. Drain the beans; don't rinse.
In a large skillet or wok, add oil. Heat until very hot (the skillet is ready when a drop of water in the oil sizzles). Add beans and cook about 1 minute, turning often with tongs or spatula. Sprinkle on pecans and Old Bay. Turn the beans and pecans to coat with oil and spices; cook about 2 minutes more, or until beans and nuts are slightly browned. Salt to taste and serve.
