Ingredients:
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Zest two medium-sized lemons (about 2 tablespoons zest). Be careful not to get the white pith under the yellow skin as it tends to be bitter.
Heat a small cast iron skillet over medium-high. Toss the zest into the skillet and heat for about 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the pan frequently to prevent the zest from burning. You'll know when it's done when the texture is like that of shredded coconut. There should be little to no moisture.
Transfer the zest to a spice mill and pulse several times until it is finely ground into a powder. Add the salt and pepper and pulse a few more times to mix throughout.
Store any unused zest in an small, airtight glass jar and refrigerate for up to a month.

Description: 
I live in the middle of Wisconsin country, so getting to the store isn't always easy in the wintertime. Things can get snowed in here in a hurry! Lemon pepper dishes are always to bright, happy, and reminiscent of warmer weather, and if I have a hankering for one and can't get out to get the seasoning, this all-natural recipe is very easy to make in a pinch. It only uses 3 ingredients, and takes all of 10 minutes.
