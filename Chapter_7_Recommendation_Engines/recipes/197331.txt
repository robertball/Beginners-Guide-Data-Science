2 ripe bananas, mashed

Description: 
This recipe makes 25 to 30 walnut-size crunchy treats, delicious when they begin to melt. Just divvy them into plastic sandwich bags and stick them in the freezer. Then, instead of reaching for a processed boxful of ingredients you can't even pronounce, you will be ready with a healthy, high-protein snack.
