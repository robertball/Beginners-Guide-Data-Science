Ingredients:
6 apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup cinnamon candies (such as Red Hots®)
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Combine apples and water in a large pot over medium heat; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir cinnamon candies and sugar into the apples and water; return mixture to a simmer and cook until the candies melt, about 15 minutes. Remove pot from heat and set aside until the mixture cools, about 15 minutes.
Mash apples with a potato masher until no large chunks remain. Alternately, you can blend the mixture with an immersion blender to get a smoother applesauce.
