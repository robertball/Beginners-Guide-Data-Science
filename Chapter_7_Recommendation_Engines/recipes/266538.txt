Ingredients:
Chicken Tenders:
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
2 pounds chicken tenders
1/2 cup coconut flour
1/2 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 1/2 cups shredded unsweetened coconut
3 eggs, beaten
avocado oil cooking spray
Passion Fruit Sauce:
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 firm ripe bananas, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 cup thinly sliced fresh pineapple
2 tablespoons cornstarch
4 tablespoons coconut milk
1 passion fruit, pulp scooped out

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Pour the can of coconut milk into a large bowl. Add chicken tenders and toss to coat.
Combine coconut flour, almond flour, salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, and turmeric on a large plate or in a shallow dish. Place shredded coconut and eggs in separate shallow bowls.
Roll each chicken tender in the flour mixture. Dip in the egg and roll in coconut. Place tenders on the prepared sheet pan; coat with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the largest chicken tender reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Broil until outsides are browned and toasted if desired, 1 to 2 minutes. Be sure to watch carefully to avoid scorching.
Melt butter in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sugar and salt; stir to dissolve. Add bananas and pineapple; cook, stirring gently, until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine cornstarch and coconut milk in a small bowl; stir into the skillet with the fruit mixture. Cook, stirring gently, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add passion fruit pulp. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes more. Serve sauce over the coconut chicken tenders.
