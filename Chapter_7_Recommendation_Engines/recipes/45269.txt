Ingredients:
6 medium eggplants
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
dried oregano
basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pierce eggplants several times with a fork, and place on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until completely softened. Cool completely. Remove skin and chop fine. Transfer to a large mixing bowl, and set aside.
In a skillet, cook garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat until lightly browned. Transfer to a small bowl. Stir  in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the vinegar, sugar, oregano, and basil until well blended and sugar is dissolved. Pour over the eggplant, and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss again. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour before serving.
