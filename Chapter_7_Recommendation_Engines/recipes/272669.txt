Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 ears corn, husked
1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
4 teaspoons white wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
2 large tomatoes, chopped
8 cups torn romaine lettuce
1 green onion, sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Sprinkle chicken breast with salt and pepper. Brush corn and asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Place chicken and corn on the grill; close the lid. Grill, turning chicken once and corn as needed, until chicken is no longer pink and corn is charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove to a cutting board. Add asparagus and grill, turning often, for 6 minutes.
Slice chicken diagonally. Cut corn from cobs; cut asparagus into 1-inch pieces.
Whisk vinegar, garlic, mustard, paprika, and remaining olive oil together. Season dressing with salt and pepper.
Toss chicken, corn, asparagus, tomatoes, lettuce, and green onion together in a large bowl with the dressing.
