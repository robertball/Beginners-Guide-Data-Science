Ingredients:
2.5 cups of broccoli, cut into pieces (can use fresh or frozen)
1 cup chopped onion
1 can of cream of mushroom/or cream of chicken, /or cream of onion soup (low sodium prefered)
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup fat free mayonnaise
1 1/2 cup shredded (low fat or 2%) cheddar cheese/or Swiss/or both
1 stick light butter, cut into pieces
black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F. Butter a casserole pan or mist with cooking spray.
If using fresh broccoli: steam broccoli until crisp-tender, 7 minutes then transfer to a bowl of ice water. If using frozen cook the broccoli 3/4 of the way.
Mix soup, eggs, mayonnaise, cheese, butter, onion and pepper in a saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and combined, the eggs will start to cook some.
Drain broccoli (if needed) ; spread evenly in the buttered baking pan. Pour cheese mixture, stirring once or twice to cover the broccoli. Bake for 30 minutes.
If desired can top with crushed crackers or French's crispy onions during the last 5-10 minutes of backing to make it more like a green bean casserole.
Makes approximately eight 3/4 cup servings.
