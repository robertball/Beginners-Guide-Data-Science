Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) lamb top sirloins
For the Wet Rub:
2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon kosher salt
For the Sauce:
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons freshly minced mint

Directions:
Cut 4 to 5 slashes, about 1/4-inch deep, in a crosshatch pattern on both sides of the lamb.
Pour 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil into a bowl. Add black pepper, coriander, paprika, cayenne pepper, and kosher salt. Whisk together; add enough olive oil to make a paste. Rub lamb pieces into the spice mixture until thoroughly coated. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place lamb on the grate. Grill to a doneness between medium and medium-well, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
Transfer lamb to a plate and let cool, about 5 minutes. Slice thinly. Mix yogurt, mustard, garlic, and mint together; serve sauce with the lamb.

Description: 
Will it pastrami? is what I wanted to know about lamb top sirloin, one of my favorite cuts. The answer is yes. The subtle gaminess of the meat works perfectly with the aromatic spices of this pastrami-inspired rub, which gets activated by the heat and smoke of the grill. Served over my Green Quinoa Tabbouleh with yogurt sauce and a sprig of mint.
