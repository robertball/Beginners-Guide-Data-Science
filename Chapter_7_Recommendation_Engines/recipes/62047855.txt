1 1/2 c. sugar

1/2 c. nuts (optional)

Directions:
- Preheat oven at 350 degrees
- Grease 8" square pan with butter, oil, or spray
- Melt chocolate and butter on double boiler or microwave (if using the microwave, stir after every 30 seconds until melted)
- Let chocolate cool for about 5 minutes.
- Place sugar in med. sized bowl.
- Pour in chocolate mixture.  Mix until blended with mixer on med. speed.  Scrape sides well while mixing.
- Add vanillla gradually.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing about 10 sec. after each egg.
- Scrape bowl and blend until velvety and smooth.
- Add flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds.  Finish mixing by hand, making sure to mix in flour from bottom of bowl.
- Stir in nuts,(optional) reserving about 2 Tablespoons.
- Spread batter into prepared pan, and sprinkle reserved nuts over batter.
- Bake 25-30 minutes.  Until thin crust forms on top and a knife inserted in middle comes out with moist crumbs.(not wet)
- Cool for about an hour before cutting. Ideally these are best if they sit overnight.
