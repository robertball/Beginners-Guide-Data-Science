Ingredients:
1 LB crabmeat (Backfin)
1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs
1 TBL fresh lemon juice
1 TBL fresh chopped garlic
1/4 cup fresh chopped flat leaf parsley
1 tsp sea salt
1 tsp WHITE pepper
1/4 cup mayo
2 tsp Ex Virgin Olive Oil

Directions:
Mix all ingerdients together and let stand for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.  I recommend clarified butter or Planter's Peanut Oil to pan sear.  Sear on both sides to a rich golden brown (3 1/2 minutes each side).  Let stand for 2 minutes or so and let carry-over heat finish cooking.    ENJOY ...

Description: 
This delicious crabcake mix is delicious and very simple to make.  I also have a Cajun Remoulade posted that accompanies this perfectly.  Canned crabmeat is fine.  White lump or backfin is the best.
