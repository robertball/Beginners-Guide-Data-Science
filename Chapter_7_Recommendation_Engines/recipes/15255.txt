Ingredients:
4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1 cup chopped pecans
¼ cup light corn syrup
¼ cup butter, melted
⅓ cup confectioners' sugar for decoration

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar and pecans. Make a well in the center and pour in the orange juice concentrate, corn syrup and melted butter. Mix well by hand until dough forms. Roll into 1 inch balls and roll the balls in confectioners' sugar. Store at room temperature in an airtight container. Put a sheet of waxed paper between layers to prevent sticking.
