Ingredients:
6 slices thick-cut bacon
1 1/2 cups whole milk
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup sliced almonds
3/4 teaspoon garlic-pepper seasoning
3/4 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions
4 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans (such as Del Monte® Fresh Cut®), drained
1/4 (6 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; break into 1-inch pieces.
Stir milk and cream of mushroom soup together in a large bowl. Add almonds, garlic pepper, and 3/4 can French-fried onion; stir to combine. Fold green beans carefully into mixture. Pour into a 9x9-inch ceramic or glass baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and bubbling, about 20 minutes. Top with remaining 1/4 can French-fried onions; bake until onions are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.

Description: 
This is my favorite version of green bean casserole. I never make a meatloaf without this on the side. It would just seem wrong! I'll always make this size of casserole because we have no problem eating the leftovers...when there are any! Enjoy!
