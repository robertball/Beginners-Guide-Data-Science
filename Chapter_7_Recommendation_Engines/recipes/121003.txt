Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm buttermilk* (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornmeal
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the buttermilk, butter, sugar, salt, baking soda and egg. Beat until blended. Stir in enough flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead for 5 minutes. Divide into 24 pieces. Shape each into a ball. Grease a 12-in. ovenproof skillet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Place rolls in prepared pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Drizzle butter over rolls. Bake at 375 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from skillet to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Baking these rolls in a skillet makes them soft and tender. My family requests them for most holiday dinners and other special occasions. I like them best split and spread with butter and black raspberry jelly.
