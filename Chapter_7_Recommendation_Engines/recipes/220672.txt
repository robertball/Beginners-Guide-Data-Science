Directions:
Dissolve 3 teaspoons chicken bouillon in 3 1/2 cups water in a rice cooker.
Stir rice, baby bok choy, green onions, carrot, and mushrooms into the bouillon and water mixture.
Start rice cooker and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 50 minutes.
Dissolve 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon and  1/4 cup water in a small bowl; transfer mixture to a blender.
Scoop about 1 cup of the rice mixture into the blender with the bouillon mixture; process until mixture becomes a thin paste, adding more water as needed.
Mix the rice paste with the remaining cooked vegetables and rice until thoroughly combined.

Description: 
This works with any veggies that are about to go bad and you need to get rid of. The ingredients are basic and the recipe is easy to make since you can do it in the rice cooker. My husband and I were very impressed with how good this turned out, especially since I hardly did any work at all!
