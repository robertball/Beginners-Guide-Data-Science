Ingredients:
2/3 cup low-fat sweetened condensed milk
1 cup cornflakes cereal
1 cup crisp rice cereal
3/4 cup flaked coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C ). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flaked corn cereal, crisp rice cereal, and the flaked coconut. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk until thoroughly combined.
Drop dough from a tablespoon onto the prepared cookie sheet. Cookies should be about 2 inches apart.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before removing to wire racks to cool completely.
