Ingredients:
3 pounds of chicken breast cut into bite-size pieces
3 cups chopped onions
6 minced garlic cloves
3 16 ounce cans fat-free, less sodium chicken broth
2 cups cubed peeled red potato (about one pound)
1 1/2 cups (1-inch thick) carrot slices
1/4 cup tomato paste
3 14.5 ounce cans no salt added diced tomatoes undrained
3 drained canned chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, finely chopped (only 3 chiles from 1 can)
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
chopped fresh cilantro to taste
low-fat shredded cheese (optional)
Low-fat sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Place chicken, onion, garlic and 1/2 cup or so of chicken broth and saute for 7 to 10 minutes in large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the rest of the chicken broth and the next seven ingredients (potato through salt) and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Stir in cilantro and serve. Top with cheese and sour cream.

Description: 
This is a great fall or winter stew that I have been making for several years and is also very healthy. It has a great southwestern flavor with a spicy kick to it, and is very easy to throw together as it all cooks in one pot. It is also good topped with cheese and/or sour cream after serving into bowls. Serve with a salad, rolls or tortilla chips.
