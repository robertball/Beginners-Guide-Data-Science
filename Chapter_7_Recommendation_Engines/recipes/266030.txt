Ingredients:
1 delicata squash - halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut into 3/4-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons maple syrup
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 1/2 pounds lacinato kale, ribs discarded and leaves cut into thin strips
1/4 medium head shredded red cabbage
1/4 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
salt and pepper to taste
1 apple, cored and sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir 2 tablespoons olive oil and cinnamon together in a cup. Place squash on a baking sheet and brush with the cinnamon oil on both sides of each slice.
Roast in the preheated oven until squash is soft and starting to brown at the edges, 30 to 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 1/2 cup olive oil, maple syrup, vinegar, and mustard in a jar, close, and shake well. Set dressing aside.
Combine kale, red cabbage, cranberries, and walnuts in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour dressing on top and mix well or massage with your hands. Mix in apple slices.
Arrange the roasted squash slices around the salad and serve.
