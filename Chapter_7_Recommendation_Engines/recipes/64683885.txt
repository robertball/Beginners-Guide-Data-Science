Description: 
I came up with this recipe basically because I had these ingredients in my kitchen. The almond flour was leftover from when we made french macrons. I haven't tried any substitutions yet but I could see milk for water, almond oil for butter, rum extract for almond extract, and almond paste for crushed almonds.
