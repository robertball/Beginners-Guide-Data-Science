Ingredients:
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons almond flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
1 pinch baking powder
2 drops vanilla extract
1 egg

Directions:
Whisk water, almond flour, vegetable oil, cream, baking powder, and vanilla extract together in a microwave-safe bowl.
Cook in the microwave on high until gooey batter forms, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.
Let batter rest until cooled slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in egg until well-blended.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
