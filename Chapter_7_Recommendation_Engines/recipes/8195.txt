Ingredients:
12 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2 cups unsalted butter, cubed
1 cup espresso coffee
1 cup packed brown sugar
8 eggs
3 (10 ounce) packages frozen raspberries, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line the bottom of a 9 inch round cake pan with parchment  paper.
Bring butter, espresso, and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring  to dissolve sugar.
Place chocolate in a large bowl, and add boiling hot espresso mixture.  Whisk until smooth.  Cool slightly.  Whisk in eggs.  Pour batter into prepared pan.
Place cake pan in a roasting pan.  Pour enough hot water into the roasting to come half way up the sides of the cake pan.  Bake until center of cake is set, and a tester inserted comes out clean with a few moist crumbs attached, about 1  hour.  Remove from water.  Chill overnight.
Puree raspberries in processor.  Chill.  Serve with chilled cake.
