Ingredients:
1/2 pound imported Swiss cheese, shredded
1/2 pound Gruyere cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 garlic clove, peeled
3/4 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
Pinch nutmeg

Directions:
In a small bowl, coat the cheeses with cornstarch and set aside. Rub the inside of the fondue pot with the peeled garlic, then discard.
Over medium heat, add the chicken stock, milk, and lemon juice and bring to a gentle simmer. Gradually stir the cheese into the simmering liquid. Melting the cheese gradually encourages a smooth fondue. Once smooth, stir in mustard and nutmeg.
Arrange an assortment of bite-sized dipping foods on a lazy Susan around fondue pot. Serve with chunks of French and pumpernickel breads. Some other suggestions are Granny Smith apples and blanched vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and asparagus. Spear with fondue forks or wooden skewers, dip, swirl and enjoy!
