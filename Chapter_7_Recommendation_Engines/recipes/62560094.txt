Ingredients:
1 cup gluten-free flour
1 cup oat flour
½ cup flax meal
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground ginger
½ cup coconut oil
¾ cup agave nectar
¾ cup rice milk
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups zucchini, shredded
1 cup carrot, shredded
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt unsweetened

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper lines or nonstick cooking spray.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, flax meal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and ginger.
Add the oil, agave nectar, rice milk, and vanilla to the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth. Using a plastic spatula, gently fold in the zucchini and carrot.
Pour 1/3 cup batter into each prepared cup. Bake the muffins for 22 minutes. Finished muffins will bounce back slightly when pressed, and a toothpick will come out clean when inserted in the center.
Let the muffins stand in the tin for 15 minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature for up to 3 days.
