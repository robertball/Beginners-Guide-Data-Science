3) Add the shredded cheese to the dry ingredients and mix until cheese is coated with mix well blended
2) In separate bowl beat the two eggs and add the oil, milk, vanilla, jalapenos.
3) Make a "well" in the dry ingredients and add the liquids and stir until just combined.  Do not over mix the batter, it should be slightly lumpy

5) Fill each cup 2/3 full with batter
6) Bake approximately 11-12 minutes

Description: 
These are perfect for making 3 dozen mini-muffins to take to a potluck.  Basting the muffin tin with melted butter and dusting with cornmeal are an essential step to getting a marvelous crispy exterior to the muffins. To add more kick do not seed the jalapenos and add an extra one.
