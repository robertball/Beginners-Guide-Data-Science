Description: 
WHEN I prepare this delicious carrot recipe, I'm reminded of a fabulous church supper our family attended back in 1942. I had never seen so much delicious food before - truly Southern cooking in full flower. These carrots were one of the side dishes served. -Billie Scoggins, Long Beach, Mississippi
