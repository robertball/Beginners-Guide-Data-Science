Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for the counter
2 teaspoons granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon table salt
1 1/2 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Place oven rack in the upper-middle position and preheat oven to 425ยบ. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
Stir in 1 1/4 cups of cream with a wooden spoon until a dough forms, about 30 seconds.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter, leaving behind any flour left in the bottom of the bowl. Use the remaining 1/4 cup of cream to moisten any flour left in the bowl and add to the dough.
Gather into a ball and knead for about 30 seconds or until smooth.
Using your hands, shape the dough into a 3/4-inch thick circle. Using a 2 1/2-inch floured cutter, cut the biscuits into rounds and place on prepared baking sheet. Reshape the dough once to cut additional biscuits. (If desired, the baking sheet can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 hours before baking.)
Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes, making sure to rotate halfway through baking.
