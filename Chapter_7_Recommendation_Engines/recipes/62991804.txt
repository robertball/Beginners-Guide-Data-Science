Ingredients:
1 quart heavy whipping cream (or, half-and-half)
8 egg yolks (save the whites for Angel Food Cake!)
8 oz. sugar
2-3 tbs. vanilla extract
2-3 heaping tbs. corn starch plus 5-6 tbs. cold water
2 cups vodka, or 2 cups milk

Directions:
Heat the heavy whipping cream in the microwave oven. Dissolve the cornstarch in cold water, and whisk it in the hot cream.
Put back in the microwave oven for about 2 minutes, stir in every 30 seconds. It will have a soup-like consistence.
Mix the egg yolks, sugar and vanilla extract. Whisk the mixture in the hot cream.
Let it cool for few minutes, than whisk in the vodka, or milk.
Strain it, and chill in a closed bottle (very important, because warm alcohol evaporates).
Enjoy!

Description: 
This is an original, European Eggnog recipe. 
The secret of this recipe is how to get rid of the alcohol-taste in an alcoholic drink, and how to make a non-alcoholic version for kids. 
Pouring the alcohol or milk in the hot egg mixture speeds up the aging process (would be 2-3 days in the fridge!). 
When it chilled together, it is ready in a couple of hours!
