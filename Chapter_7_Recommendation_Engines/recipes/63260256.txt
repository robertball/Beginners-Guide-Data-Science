3 cloves garlic, peeled
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and halved

Description: 
This creamy sauce - made from fresh avocado, tomatillos, sour cream, and seasonings - is extremely similar to a very well known Mexican restaurant's sauce. Serve with salsa and tortilla chips. Better double the recipe because this dip goes fast!Modified from: Ali's Green Sauce
