Ingredients:
2 (6 inch) flour tortillas, cut into 1/2 inch strips
Butter-flavored nonstick cooking spray
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 teaspoon olive oil
6 cups ready-to-serve salad greens
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups chopped tomatoes, divided
1 medium green pepper, diced
1/2 cup cubed peeled jicama or sliced water chestnuts
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
2/3 cup fat-free ranch salad dressing
4 teaspoons barbecue sauce

Directions:
Place tortilla strips on a baking sheet; spritz both sides of strips with butter-flavored cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 4-5 minutes or until crisp. Meanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, cook chicken in oil over medium heat until no longer pink; set aside.
Combine the salad greens, corn, beans, 1 cup tomatoes, green pepper, jicama and onions; arrange on a serving platter. Place chicken in center of salad; sprinkle with cheese and remaining tomatoes. Arrange tortilla strips around chicken. In a small bowl, combine the ranch dressing and barbecue sauce; serve with salad.
