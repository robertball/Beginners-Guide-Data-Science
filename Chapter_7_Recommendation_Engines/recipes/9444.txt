Ingredients:
4 cups white sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup butter
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme
3/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. Set aside.
In a medium saucepan combine sugar, condensed milk, butter and chocolate chips.  Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.
Remove chocolate mixture from heat and add  marshmallow and nuts. Pour the fudge into the prepared pan, and let set.

Description: 
This was my Grandmother's recipe for fudge that she sold in her candy shop. It is the best fudge I have had and it is very easy to make. If pecans aren't your forte, substitute walnuts or almonds!
