Ingredients:
12 ounces sweet Italian sausage links
1 cup water
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 (16 ounce) package fresh tortellini

Directions:
Combine sausage links and water in a large skillet and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until juices run clear, about 15 minutes. Drain off water and cook links in the skillet, stirring frequently, until browned, 2 to 4 minutes more. Remove from skillet, allow to cool, and cut into 1/2-inch diagonal slices. Wipe skillet clean using a paper towel.
Place skillet over medium heat and add olive oil. Add onion to hot oil and cook until tender but not brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, oregano, and red pepper. Add cooked sausage and bell pepper to the skillet. Bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and cover. Simmer to desired thickness, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a saucepan, about 5 minutes. Add tortellini, reduce heat slightly and boil until pasta is tender but still firm to the bite, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the warm saucepan. Stir parsley into the sausage mixture, pour over pasta, and serve immediately.
