Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked 9-inch pie crust
1 cup ricotta cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (16 ounce) can solid-pack pumpkin
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 (5.3 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press pie crust into a pie plate.
Beat ricotta cheese into lightly beaten eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Stir pumpkin, brown sugar, evaporated milk, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and salt into the cheese mixture until smooth; pour into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
