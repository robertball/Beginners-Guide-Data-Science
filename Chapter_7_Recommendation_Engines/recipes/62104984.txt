Ingredients:
Salad
2 green bell peppers
2 red bell peppers
2 large onions
1 cup of grape tomatoes
2 cans cannellini beans
1 small bunch of basil
Cooking spray
Dressing
1/4 cup red wine or balsamic vinegar
2 cloves minced garlic
1 tsp minced fresh oregano (1/2 tsp dried)
1 tsp sea or kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly cracked pepper
1/3 cup olive oil

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425.  (I use the convection setting).  Line two cookie sheets with foil and spray with olive oil cooking spray.
2.Halve green and red peppers and remove seeds.  Lie cut side down on cookie sheet.
3. Slice onions about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  Pile on the other cookie sheet.  They do not need to be spread out in a single layer.  On this cookie sheet also put the whole grape tomatoes.
4. Spray  all of the vegetables with cooking spray.  Roast both sheets until the peppers are brown.  In a convection setting this should take about 20 minutes.
5. While the vegetables are roasting, make the dressing.  Combine all the indredients listed for the dressing and let sit.
6. Clean basil and cut into ribbons.
7. Remove vegetables from the oven and put the peppers in a paper bag to cool for 10 minutes.
8. Chop the onions and place in a bowl along with the whole grape tomatoes.  Remove skins from peppers and chop.  Add to the onions and tomatoes.
9. Rinse and drain beans.  Add them to the bowl along with the basil.
10. Toss with the dressing and serve.  You may wish to add additional salt or pepper to taste.
