Ingredients:
Crumb mixture:
3/4 cup melted shortening
1 cup brown sugar
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups old fashioned oatmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
Apricot filling:
1 cup pitted dates (Medjool) cut into small pieces
1 8oz. package dried apricots cut into small pieces
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup Kern's apricot nectar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Crumb mixture:
In a large bowl blend shortening and sugar.  Sift flour and soda and add to bowl.  Add the oatmeal. Add the vanilla; work well with hands.  Press 1/2 the mixture on medium greased cookie sheet, pressing down firmly.
Apricot filling:
Put the pitted dates, dried apricots, brown sugar, and apricot nectar in a saucepan and cook for about 5 minutes, on medium heat, until thick.  Sir constantly as it can easily burn.  The apricot nectar will evaporate as you cook the mixture.  Cool the mixture slightly before spreading it on top of the oatmeal mixture.  Once slightly cool, pour the mixture over the oatmeal mixture and spread with a knife.  Top with the rest of the crumb mixture, pressing down firmly.  Bake 30 minutes or until the top is brown.  Cool before serving.
