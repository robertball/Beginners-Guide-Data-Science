Ingredients:
1 cup fresh raspberries
14 tablespoons sugar, divided
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup half-and-half cream
1 cup finely chopped vanilla or white chips
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, toss raspberries with 1/4 cup sugar; set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and 1/2 cup sugar. Beat in egg and extracts. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with cream. Stir in chips and reserved raspberries.
Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Combine brown sugar and remaining sugar; sprinkle over batter. Bake at 375 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.

Description: 
'It took me a couple of batches to perfect these muffins,' writes Stephanie Moon of Nampa, Idaho, 'but my family thinks this version is the best! And since they always gobble them up fast, I have to agree.' TIP: Gently stir the raspberries into the batter, so they don't break apart.
