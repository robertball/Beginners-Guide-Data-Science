Ingredients:
1 1/2 c. flour
1 1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp high quality salt (like Maldon)
1/4 c. brown sugar
1/4 c. sugar
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
3 large overripe bananas, mashed with a fork
3 tbsp  unsweetened applesauce
2 tbsp plus 1 tsp canola oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.
In a small mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, combine brown sugar, sugar and cinnamon.  Beat in the egg, vanilla, bananas, applesauce and canola oil.
Pour the flour mixture into the wet mixture a little at a time and stir until evenly moistened.  Do not over mix.
Pour mixture into a greased loaf pan.
Bake 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Description: 
This recipe was inspired by a number of banana bread recipes I've used in the past.  I cut fat by using applesauce--but not so much that it tastes like apples.  You can adjust the sugar depending on how ripe the bananas are (add a little more if your bananas are less ripe).
