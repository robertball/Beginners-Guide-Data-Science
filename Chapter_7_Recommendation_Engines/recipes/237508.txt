Ingredients:
1 pound dried pinto beans
1/2 pound bacon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark lager-style beer (such as Shiner BockÂ®)
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 fresh jalapeno pepper

Directions:
Place pinto beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water. Soak beans 8 hours to overnight.
Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon slices to a plate lined with paper towel to drain, reserving the bacon drippings. Chop the bacon.
Drain and rinse pinto beans; transfer to a large pot. Pour enough water over the beans to cover by several inches Stir salt and garlic powder into the water; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Add bacon, reserved bacon drippings, beer, cilantro, green onions, diced tomatoes, and jalapeno pepper to the water; bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the beans are completely tender, 90 minutes to 2 hours.
