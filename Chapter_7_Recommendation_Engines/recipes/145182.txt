Ingredients:
1 cup canola oil
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 15 minutes
2 pounds cubed beef
8 (1 inch thick) slices French bread

Directions:
In a large resealable bag, combine the canola oil, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, parsley, onion powder, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Place the beef cubes into the marinade, seal and shake to mix and coat the beef. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or for up to 3 days.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Thread the beef cubes onto 8 skewers, dividing evenly. Discard the marinade.
Cook the meat on the grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked to your liking (you can make a test skewer if you want). To serve, place a whole skewer of beef on a slice of French bread. Hold onto the meat using the bread, and pull the skewer out.
