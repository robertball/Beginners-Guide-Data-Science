Description: 
This salad was served at a traditional Lebanese restaurant, and I could not wait to go home and duplicate the taste.  It is definitely a twist on the traditional salad, and my Lebanese brother-in-law insists it should not be called 'tabbouleh.' All I know is that it is very tasty and has the majority of the ingredients of a 'traditional' tabbouleh salad.
