Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
4 (4 ounce) fillets halibut
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
8 large whole basil leaves
8 tomato slices
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place an oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source. Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Arrange halibut on prepared baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip fillets, season with salt and black pepper, and continue cooking until flesh is opaque, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Top each fillet with a mozzarella cheese slice, a basil leaf, and a tomato slice, respectively; repeat layers.
Return halibut to oven and bake until cheese begins to melt, about 2 minutes.
Whisk balsamic vinegar and olive oil together in a bowl; soon over halibut portions. Garnish with chopped basil to serve.

Description: 
Quick, easy, and delicious! Low carb, high flavor. The fresh basil, tomatoes, and balsamic beautifully complement the halibut. I serve on a bed of brown rice.
