Ingredients:
10 ounces dry fettuccini noodles
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound peeled, seeded and grated pumpkin
2 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
4 tablespoons lite sour cream
1 teaspoon chili powder

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve.
In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil and cook pumpkin for about 10 minutes or until it begins to break apart.
Add tomato paste, sour cream and chili powder to taste; mix well. The mixture should be mushy and an even golden-orange color.
Scoop spoonfuls of the pumpkin mixture over the pasta; mix well to coat and serve.

This one's so quick and easy, and its understated class makes it a fantastic entree at a dinner party. It's done the rounds between all my friends, and we love it as a quick and gorgeous dinner! This pasta tastes divine, it's quick, simple, looks beautiful, and if that's not enough, it's also incredibly budget-and waistline-friendly! Goes well visually and palatably with a fresh green salad.
