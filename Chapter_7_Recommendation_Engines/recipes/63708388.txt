Ingredients:
46 oz tomato juice
3 Tbsp chili powder, or to taste
4 C mild cheddar cheese, shredded
1 large yellow onion, minced
20 8" flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Add chili powder to tomato juice in a large frying pan and whisk to combine.  Heat until juice is bubbly and slightly thickened.
Add tortillas to sauce one at a time.  Leave tortilla in sauce for a few seconds until just softened.  Transfer tortilla to a 9"x13" baking dish.  Sprinkle tortilla with about 1 1/2 Tbsp cheese and 1 Tbsp onion.  Roll tortilla tightly to form enchilada.  Repeat with rest of tortillas, placing enchiladas up against one another in pan.
When all enchiladas have been assembled, spread remaining sauce on top of enchiladas and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Cover baking dish with foil and bake for about 20 minutes, removing foil for last 5 minutes of baking.  Serve hot.

Description: 
After college, my mother was a VISTA (Volunteer In Service To America).  She lived in a small farming community in Nebraska, where she learned how to make the most amazing Mexican food I've ever tasted.  I grew up on her enchiladas and now love making them for my own friends and family.  Over the years she has adapted the recipe to make them a little healthier, but they are just as tasty as ever!
