Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine chickpeas and vinegar in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let stand for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with foil.
Drain chickpeas well, discarding vinegar. Spread on the roasting pan and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle salt on top and toss to coat.
Roast chickpeas, shaking the pan every 8 to 10 minutes, until they are slightly soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, about 30 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve warm or at room temperature.
