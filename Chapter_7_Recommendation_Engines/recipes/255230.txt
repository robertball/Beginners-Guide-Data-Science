Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
4 eggs, divided
2 cups baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
1 1/3 cups milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.
Beat 3 eggs in a small bowl until smooth; pour into the hot skillet. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until scrambled and set, about 5 minutes.
Preheat a cake pop maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
Combine remaining egg, baking mix, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl to make pancake batter.
Fold crumbled bacon, scrambled eggs, and Cheddar cheese gently into the batter.
Fill wells of preheated cake pop machine with batter. Cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

I wanted to make a quick-and-easy-to-eat brunch item and this was perfect! They are moist and packed full of flavor. This will be a crowd-pleaser for sure and great for brunch potlucks! You can also freeze the leftovers and heat up for a quick morning breakfast, great for kids! Dip balls into maple or blue agave syrup and top with confectioners' sugar or country gravy.
