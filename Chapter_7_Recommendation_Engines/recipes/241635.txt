Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/3 cup white sugar
2/3 cup water
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup bread flour
1/4 cup corn oil
2 teaspoons salt
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Dissolve yeast and sugar in water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Mix 2 cups all-purpose flour, bread flour, corn oil, and salt together in a bowl; add yeast mixture and knead on a work surface using about 1/2 all-purpose flour until well mixed. Let dough rise in a warm area until doubled in size; about 2 hours.
