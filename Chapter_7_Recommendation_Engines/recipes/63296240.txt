Ingredients:
2 teaspoons cinnamon, divided
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon hot chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 peeled granny smith apples, diced
1/2 cup pitted whole dates, sliced

Directions:
Combine 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, chili powder and salt in a ziploc bag. Place the chicken in the bag and shake to coat. This can be done the night before to enhance the flavor.
In a large non-stick pan, heat olive oil and saute the chicken over medium heat for about 5 minutes per side. When done, remove from the pan and keep warm.
Place the apples and dates in the hot pan and cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle the remaining cinnamon over the mixture and toss to coat. Serve over chicken.
