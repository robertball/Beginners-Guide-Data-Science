Description: 
There's a side of the Low Country that folks just love to experience -- the unspoiled beauty of the tidal islands, the wide expanse of marsh which is a nesting ground for shore birds and marine creatures.  This is an old recipe best served on a Sunday afternoon and a sit on the porch.
