Ingredients:
4 quarts boiling water
3 cups white sugar, divided
1/2 pound ginger root with skin, grated
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup lime juice
1 cup fresh brewers' yeast

Directions:
Remove 1/2 cup of the boiling water and set aside to cool to lukewarm.
Combine remaining boiling water, 2 cups sugar, ginger, honey, and lime juice in a large plastic container.
Mix the 1/2 cup lukewarm water, 1 cup sugar, and yeast together in a separate bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy paste, about 5 minutes; stir into ginger mixture. Cover container and let sit for 3 days. Skim foam from top, strain liquid, and pour ginger beer into clean storage containers; chill.

Description: 
My friend from St. Kitts says to skip the yeast to avoid the carbonated alcohol. He laughs at America's fascination with bubbles in their drinks. For Mel Torme I added the 'tiny bubbles'. Add flavors of your choice (vanilla, almond, bay leaves, cloves, allspice, etc.).
