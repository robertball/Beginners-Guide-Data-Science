Take Tortilla and place into a taco salad form and deep fry for 3 mins. when you take the tortilla out allow the oil to drain back into the deep fryer, and place on some paper towels. The shell will puff up like taco bell gorditas.

Description: 
Me and my wife like taco salads, but we always share one. this time I decided to make two mini taco salads, and they turned out to be the perfect size for us. For this recipe I also used cheddar and Gruyere cheese. I only used Gruyere cheese because I had some left over from hamburgers we had a few days earlier, but it was good also. You can omit Gruyere cheese or just use any cheese you want. Mexican Queso Fresco crumble cheese is also a good topping cheese. I fried the tortillas using a taco salad deep fryer form that you can buy from Amazon.com
