Description: 
This is truly an 'oldie', dating back to a Swedish woman born in 1877! her daughter, Esther Davis, shared the recipe with me and she came up with all the exact measurements, since the original cookies were mixed by 'feel' and taste. These are my favorite cookies and I hope they'll become yours as well.
