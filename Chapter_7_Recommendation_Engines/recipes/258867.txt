Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 slices dry bread, diced
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1/4 cup milk
1 pound ground lamb
1 egg
4 cloves minced garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup tomato sauce
5 leaves fresh mint, finely chopped
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with oil.
Place bread and milk in a small bowl. Press bread with a fork to soak up the milk.
Combine lamb, egg, garlic, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, lemon zest, coriander, basil, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add soaked bread; discard the leftover milk. Mix with hands until well combined. Transfer meatloaf to the prepared pan.
Combine tomato sauce and mint; spread evenly over the meatloaf. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
