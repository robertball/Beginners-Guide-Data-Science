Ingredients:
2 prepared, unbaked pie crust, thawed
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
2/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup brandy
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk together the eggs, pumpkin, milk, brown sugar, brandy, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl until smooth. Pour the mixture into the pie crusts. Cover the outside edge of each pie with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes; remove foil. Continue to bake until a knife inserted near the center of a pie comes out clean, about 25 minutes more.
Cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store unused portion in refrigerator.

Description: 
This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. All you have to do is try it once and you're sure to be hooked, just like my family is.  I found this recipe a few years ago, and we have enjoyed it ever since! Serve with whipped topping.
