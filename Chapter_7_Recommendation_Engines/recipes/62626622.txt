Description: 
Meyer lemons, a cross between a lemon and an orange, have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than the more common lemon.  If you have to use a regular lemon add a little extra sugar to taste.  For the ultimate martini use good quality vodka and orange liqueur.  I should have named this the come to mama martini!
