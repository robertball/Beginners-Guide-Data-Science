Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
1 yellow onion, diced
2 cups chopped carrots
2 cups chopped celery
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (32 ounce) carton unsalted chicken stock
2 1/2 cups water
2 teaspoons browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®)
1 head green cabbage, coarsely chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
4 dashes Louisiana-style hot sauce
1 bay leaf
1 pinch Cajun seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's), or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Saute until vegetables are tender and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in chicken stock, water, and browning sauce.
Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat to low. Add cabbage, diced tomatoes, hot sauce, bay leaf, and Cajun seasoning. Simmer until cabbage is tender and liquid is reduced by half, 25 to 30 minutes. Adjust seasoning as needed.
