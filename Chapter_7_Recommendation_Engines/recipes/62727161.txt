Description: 
I've used this recipe for many years varying the fruits that I include.  I often add apples, bananas, and/or blueberries.  Though there are specific measurements in the recipe, there is no need to carefully measure each ingredient--just approximate the quantities of your favorite fruits to have a beautiful and delicious salad.  I have frequently served this Christmas morning.
