Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups cauliflower florets, broken into bite size pieces
2 cups spinach leaves
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 spreadable cheese wedges (such as The Laughing Cow® Creamy Swiss Garlic & Herb)

Directions:
Run cauliflower through a food processor to get 2 cups of cauliflower grounds a bit larger than the consistency of grits.
Combine cauliflower, spinach, butter, and salt in a large pot over low heat. Cover and cook until cauliflower is soft and spinach has wilted, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in cheese wedges until the cauliflower and spinach are coated and no cheese clumps remain.
