Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup canola oil
1/2 cup applesauce
2 cups grated, drained zucchini
1-1/2 cups all-purpose white flour
1-1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup pineapple tidbits, drain well and chop lightly

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 325 degree F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9X5X3 loaf pans and sprinkle the bottoms with a light coating of plain, fine bread crumbs (to help prevent the bottom of the breads from sticking).
In a large bowl mix together the eggs, sugar, vanilla, oil, applesauce and zucchini.
In a separate bowl mix together the flour, soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Add to the zucchini batter and mix well. Stir in nuts, and pineapple until just blended. Pour into the loaf pans.
Bake for one hour (check after 40 minutes if using a convection oven) or until browned.
