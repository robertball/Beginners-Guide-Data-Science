Ingredients:
1 package, 4 serving size, instant vanilla pudding and pie filling
1 C (1/2 pint) sour cream or Greek yogurt
Â¼ C milk
2 T grated orange or lemon rind
16 ounces thawed whipped topping, divided
1 pint strawberries, all but 1-3 pretty ones (for garnish) hulled
1, 9-inch, graham cracker crust

Directions:
Combine the pie filling mix, sour cream, milk, rind, and 2 Cups of the whipped topping in a large bowl.  Beat with a wire whisk until well blended.  Spoon into the pie shell
Arrange the strawberries, tops down, in the pie filling and gently press down until they just touch the pie crust. If your berries are extremely large, you may need to cut some of them into smaller pieces to make them fit.
If you want it to set quickly, freeze the pie for 1 hour, then before serving top with the remaining whipped topping and garnish with the reserved berries.  If it will be a few hours before serving, spread the whipped topping over the pie and garnish with the strawberries, then chill at least 3 hours.

Description: 
I have been making this recipe for so many years that I honestly can't remember where I got it.  It's been one of our family favorites for over a quarter of a century!  It looks so pretty when you cut through the berries to serve it.
