Ingredients:
8 ears corn in the husk
1 large sweet red bell pepper chopped
2 cups cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 small red onion finely chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
Dressing
1/2 cup olive oil (You can use Canola oil for heart health if you want)
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 Tbsp. Lime juice
1-1/4 tsp. Salt
1 clove garlic minced (or 1/2 tsp. garlic powder)
1/2 tsp. grated lime zest
1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
1.Trim corn husk of any long hanging parts, and excess silk. Place in water to soak for one hour. Preheat outdoor grill to 300 degrees. Every 6 minutes turn corn 1/4 turn until all 4 sides have been grilled. Allow to cool enough to peel and cut corn off of cob into serving bowl. (Cooking in the husk makes corn sweeter. The silk breaks down and gives it a taste that needs no seasoning)Add red pepper, tomatoes, and onion.
2.In a small bowl combine all dressing ingredients, and whisk until well blended. Pour over corn mixture, toss to coat. Cover, and refrigerate a minimum of one hour. The longer it refrigerates, the better it tastes.
