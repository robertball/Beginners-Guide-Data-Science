Ingredients:
3 pounds ground beef
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 large onions, diced, or more to taste
2 large green bell peppers, diced, or more to taste
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
4 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon beef bouillon (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Beef Base)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 (28 ounce) cans diced petite-cut tomatoes
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in two batches in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper while browning. Drain and discard grease; transfer beef to a slow cooker.
Add bell peppers and onion to the slow cooker. Add diced tomatoes and green chiles, tomato paste, chili powder, beef bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot sauce, salt, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Stir with a heavy spoon until well mixed. Pour in diced tomatoes and stir well. Add as much crushed tomatoes as you can fit into the slow cooker, keeping in mind it will expand a bit while cooking. Stir well.
Cover the slow cooker and cook on Low until flavors blend, 8 to 10 hours.
