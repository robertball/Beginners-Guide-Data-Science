Ingredients:
3 chicken leg quarters, cut into thighs and drumsticks
2 cups buttermilk, or as needed to cover
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon granulated onion
1 teaspoon granulated garlic
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG) (optional)
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 egg whites, beaten until foamy
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Place chicken drumsticks and thighs in a bowl and pour enough buttermilk over chicken to cover. Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
Combine flour, cornmeal, granulated onion, granulated garlic, thyme, salt, paprika, monosodium glutamate, baking powder, and cayenne pepper in a large, wide bowl.
Remove chicken from buttermilk and shake off excess. Discard buttermilk. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.
Dip chicken into egg whites and press into flour mixture. Allow coated chicken to rest on a wire rack for 20 to 30 minutes.
Fill a cast-iron skillet or deep fryer with vegetable oil about 1/3 full. Heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Fry chicken in hot oil in batches until golden brown and no longer pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes per side. Thighs may take longer to fry than drumsticks. Transfer fried chicken to a wire rack or a paper towel-lined tray to drain. Keep chicken warm in preheated oven while frying remaining pieces.
