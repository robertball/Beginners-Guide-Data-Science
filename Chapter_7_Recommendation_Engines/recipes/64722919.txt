Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Olive Oil
4 tablespoons Butter
1 cup Chopped Onion
1/2 cup Chopped Celery
2 cloves Garlic
1/4 cup All-Purpose Flour
1 quart Half and Half
14 oz Chicken Broth
1 cup Cooked Chicken, cubed
1/2 teaspoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoons salt
1 cup Carrots, julienned
1 package of Sweet Potato Gnocchi
2 handfuls of Baby Spinach (roughly chopped)

Directions:
Heat oil and butter over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, and garlic. Saute until onions and celery are soft.
Drop in flour and stir until consistency of paste. Continue to stir and cook for one minute.
Slowly whisk in the half and half. Allow to simmer until the mixture starts to thicken.
Whisk in the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add cooked chicken along with spices and carrots. Simmer for 5 minutes.
Add gnocchi and spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes or until gnocchi are done.
NOTE: I used Trader Joe's Frozen Sweet Potato Gnocchi. Any type of gnocchi will work. The sweet potato give it an additional nutritional punch and a slightly sweet balance to the spinach.

I took a knock-off restaurant recipe and altered to make this my own. It's very filling and the perfect comfort food on a chilly night.
