Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 tablespoons butter
1 (10 ounce) package miniature marshmallows
5 cups pumpkin spice-flavored toasted oat cereal (such as Pumpkin Spice Cheerios®)
1/2 cup candy corn, or to taste

Directions:
Spray a 9-inch square baking dish and a large spoon with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add marshmallows; cook, stirring constantly, until melted, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in cereal gently. Pour mixture into the prepared pan. Arrange candy corn on top. Press mixture evenly into the pan using the sprayed spoon. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Cut mixture into bars.

Description: 
A super easy treat to whip up, similar to Rice Krispies Treats®. I love how they have a Halloween vibe with the marshmallow spread around like a cobweb. Wrap individually in plastic wrap or enjoy immediately!
