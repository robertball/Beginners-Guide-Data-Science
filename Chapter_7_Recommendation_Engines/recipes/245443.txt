Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) whole turkey, thawed if frozen, neck and giblets removed
3/4 cup kosher salt
3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Place turkey in a roasting pan. Rub salt all over and inside turkey. Let sit for 1 hour.
Preheat smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). If your smoker is equipped with a water pan, fill it.
Rinse salt off turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Return to roasting pan and baste with melted better. Cover with aluminum foil and place in smoker.
Cook for about 3 hours; remove aluminum foil. Continue to cook, uncovered, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the turkey thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
Remove turkey from the smoker and tent with aluminum foil. Let it rest in a warm area before slicing, 45 to 60 minutes.
