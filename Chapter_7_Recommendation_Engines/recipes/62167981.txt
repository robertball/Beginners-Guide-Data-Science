Ingredients:
1/2 lb. Okra
7-10 Cherry Tomatoes
Olive Oil
Kosher Salt (no more than 1 Tbs.)
Black Pepper
Garlic Powder
1/2 cup Panko Breadcrumbs (regular or wheat)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425.
Cut okra into 1/2-inch slices (to make circles).
Cut tomatoes in half.
Put okra pieces and tomato halves into large mixing bowl.
Drizzle olive oil to coat, stirring to ensure each piece gets some oil.
Sprinkle with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder, stirring for even seasoning.
Add in panko and stir.
Dump the contents of the mixing bowl onto a lightly greased or foil-lined baking sheet.
Bake at 425 for 13-15 min.  Tomatoes should be soft and a few pieces of okra should be a slightly browned.
Enjoy!!

Description: 
Roasting the okra with tomatoes keeps it from being slimey, and a dusting of panko adds a touch of crunch to mimick fried okra without the added fat from frying.
