Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup dry red wine
1 (12 ounce) package fresh cranberries, rinsed and sorted
1 cinnamon stick
2 tablespoons orange zest, cut into slivers

Directions:
Combine sugar with red wine in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add the cranberries, cinnamon stick and orange peel.  Bring the mixture back to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, for 10 to 15 minutes, until most of the cranberries have burst.
Remove from heat, allow relish to cool slightly, and spoon into sterilized glass jelly jars with tight-fitting lids.  Store in refrigerator.
