Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chilies, such as rotel
1 (28 ounce) can whole tomatoes with juice
1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves (or more to taste)
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1 whole jalapeno, quartered and sliced thin, with seeds and membrane ( seeds= spicier, no seeds= less spice)
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 whole lime, juiced
1/2 cup chopped bell pepper

Directions:
Combine the diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes, cilantro, onions, garlic, jalapeno, cumin, salt, sugar and lime juice in a blender or food processor. (This is a very large batch-I recommend using a 12-cup food processor, or you can process the ingredients in batches and then mix everything together in a large mixing bowl). Pulse until you get the salsa to the consistency you'd like. I do about 10 to 15 pulses. Test seasonings with a tortilla chip and adjust as needed.
Cook the ingredients o the stove until juices are simmered down and salsa is cooked to liking.  Refrigerate over night and serve!
Note: I use less cilantro less than 1/8 cup, I used 3 more cans petite diced tomatoes, Don't put some of the tomatoes in the food processor if you like the salsa a little chunky. Add a little extra onion to the salsa and don't put this in a food processor.  Don't add bell pepper into food processor. I also like to double the lime!
