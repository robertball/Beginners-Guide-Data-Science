Ingredients:
1 cup almond milk
2 eggs
3 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1 tablespoon honey

3/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup sweet rice flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch square pan.
Whisk almond milk, eggs, coconut oil, and honey together in a small bowl.
Stir cornmeal, cornstarch, sweet rice flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add almond milk mixture and whisk until combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
A friend showed me this recipe, which her father used when she was forced to eat gluten free. This is one of the easiest and best-tasting gluten-free recipes around. If you forget to mention it to those that are not gluten free-they will never know! Success! I have also used this for cornbread stuffing around the holidays, and it is always a favorite!
