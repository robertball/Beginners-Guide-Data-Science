Ingredients:
1 cup orange juice concentrate
2/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup honey
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons grated lime peel
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
2 garlic cloves, minced
10 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a 4-cup measuring cup, combine the first nine ingredients. Pour 2 cups into a large resealable plastic bag; add chicken. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2-4 hours. Cover and refrigerate remaining marinade for basting.
Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill. Drain and discard marinade from chicken. Grill chicken, covered, over medium heat for 4-6 minutes on each side or until juices run clear, basting frequently with the reserved marinade.

Description: 
The marinade adds a zesty taste and makes the chicken very tender. I think this is the perfect recipe for a summer picnic.   --Coleen Martin
