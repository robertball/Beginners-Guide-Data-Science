Ingredients:
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour
3 tbsp icing sugar
1 tbsp poppy seeds
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon zest
Lemon glaze:
1/2 cup icing sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
milk, as needed to make of drizzling consistency

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Using the mixing paddle on a stand mixer, cream sugar and lemon zest into butter. Add in flour and continue mixing, on low, until well combined. Add in poppy seeds and mix until starting to form a dough (this may take a minute).
Place dough on an ungreased baking sheet, and pat into an approximately 5 inch circle, roughly 3/4 inch thick. Using a fork, press gently all around outside edges. Cut into 8 wedges, but leave the wedges in a circle.
Bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until just starting to brown on bottoms. Allow to cool slightly on cookie sheet, then cut along score lines again. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely. In a small bowl, combine sugar, lemon juice and milk. Drizzle over shortbread wedges.
