Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup white quinoa
1 cup red quinoa
1 1/2 large red onions, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
12 grinds black pepper from a grinder
1/4 cup olive oil
2 limes, juiced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a pot; add white quinoa and red quinoa. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until water is absorbed, 15 minutes. Set quinoa aside to cool while you complete the remaining steps.
Combine red onions, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, sea salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir in white and red quinoa.
Whisk olive oil and lime juice together in a separate bowl; pour over quinoa mixture. Stir to coat. Add cilantro and stir to incorporate. Cover salad and refrigerate for flavors to blend, at least 4 hours.
