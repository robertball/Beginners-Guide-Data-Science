Ingredients:
2 ears corn
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1/2 yellow onion, diced
3 cups water
2 cups milk
1 cup cornmeal
salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Grill corn in the husks, or roast in the oven; cut kernels from cob.
In a heavy 4-quart saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onions; reduce heat to low and cook until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in water and milk and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Slowly stir in cornmeal, whisking thoroughly.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking and burning. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 15 minutes more.
When mixture is thick and the cornmeal is tender, stir in corn, sage and Parmesan cheese. Transfer to a large bowl to serve.
