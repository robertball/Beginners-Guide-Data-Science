Ingredients:
1 19 oz can enchilada sauce
1 1/2 pounds ground beef or turkey
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 (16 ounce) can pinto beans
1 small can roasted green peppers
1 (12 oz) package corn tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup crushed up tortilla chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large skillet, brown the ground beef with garlic salt and onion powder; drain fat. Mix pinto beans and 1/2 cup of the prepared enchilada sauce with the meat.
Pour about 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce in dish for dipping tortillas.
Dip enough corn tortillas to cover the bottom of a 9 x 13 lasagna dish (about 6) in the enchilada sauce. Arrange tortillas in the dish. Spoon in half of the meat mixture, covering the tortillas. Spread half of the Cheddar cheese over the meat. Cover with another layer tortillas dipped in enchilada sauce. Spoon in remaining meat mixture and top with a final layer of tortillas dipped in enchilada sauce. Pour any remaining sauce over the layers and top with remaining cheese and crushed tortillas.
Cover and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
