Ingredients:
1 egg
1 egg white
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon sugar
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
8 ounces boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips

Directions:
Whisk egg, egg white, heavy cream, and garlic salt together in a small bowl.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, and cinnamon sugar in a separate small bowl.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place half of the chicken into the egg mixture; let sit for 2 minutes. Remove chicken from egg mixture and place in the flour mixture, turning to coat all sides. Place the coated chicken pieces onto a paper towel. Repeat dipping the the remaining chicken in the egg mixture and the flour mixture.
Gently place the first batch of coated chicken in the hot oil; fry until chicken is cooked through and floats to the top, about 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to a plate lined with fresh paper towels. Repeat frying with the second batch of chicken. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes before eating.

Description: 
I actually came up with this standing in the kitchen, deciding on what to eat. It was phenomenal! I paired mine with bacon-seared corn and brown rice. If you need a sauce for dipping, try a sweeter sauce (caramel-infused BBQ sauce comes to mind).
