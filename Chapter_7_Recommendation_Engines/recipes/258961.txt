Ingredients:
1 ½ pounds ground chicken
1 ¾ cups chicken wing sauce, divided
2 (4 ounce) packages crumbled blue cheese, divided
1 (8 ounce) bottle chunky blue cheese dressing
2  carrots, minced
2 stalks celery, minced

Directions:
Mix ground chicken and 1 cup wing sauce together in a bowl. Shape the mixture into 10 thin patties. Spread 1 package crumbled blue cheese over the center of 5 patties. Cap with the remaining 5 patties to seal in the blue cheese.
Cook patties until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Combine the remaining 3/4 cup wing sauce, the remaining 1 package crumbled blue cheese, and blue cheese dressing in a bowl. Spread over the cooked patties. Top burgers with carrots and celery.

Description: 
I got the idea for this recipe when challenged to a burger cook-off. The whole lot of us like chicken wings, so I figured I'd translate that into a burger. I was was not only the winner, but also the only one to use chicken.
