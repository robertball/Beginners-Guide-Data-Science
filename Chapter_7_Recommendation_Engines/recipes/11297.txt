Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup carob powder
1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds, ground
1/4 cup ground sunflower seeds
1/2 cup honey
2 cups chopped walnuts

Directions:
Combine the oats, carob powder, ground sesame seeds, ground sunflower seeds, honey and chopped nuts. Mix well and press into the bottom of one 8 inch square dish.
Chill and cut into 2 inch squares to serve. These tend to be a little on the crumbly side.

Description: 
These are no-bake brownies that have carob powder instead of cocoa. They're much healthier than regular brownies. Good for hyperactive children and very easy to make.
