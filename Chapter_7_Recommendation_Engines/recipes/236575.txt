Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
4 cups lukewarm milk
2 large eggs, whisked
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Pour flour into a large bowl; slowly stir milk into flour. Add whisked eggs, butter, and oil and mix to form a smooth pancake batter. Stir vanilla extract, yeast, and salt into batter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, set bowl in a warm place, and let rise until doubled in volume, 1 to 3 hours.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cup onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Pretty much all pancake recipes use baking soda, which does give them a distinctive taste, plus they are usually good only fresh off the griddle. For a new type of pancakes, try this recipe that uses yeast instead of bicarbonate. It takes a bit longer to get the batter ready. Ever since my mother, who is from Romania, said 'Why do you add bicarbonate in this? Let me make my good old recipe with yeast!', we abandoned the other recipes and the kids only want this type of pancakes. One could see this as a combination between a pancake, a crepe, or a naan bread.
