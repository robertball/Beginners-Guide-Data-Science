Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
lemons, juiced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds swordfish steaks

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, mustard, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Arrange swordfish steaks on a rimmed baking sheet and pour marinade over fish. Refrigerate up to 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place swordfish on the preheated grill rack. Cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve immediately.
