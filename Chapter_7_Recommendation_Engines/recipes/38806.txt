Ingredients:
5 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 1/2 cups warm milk
3 egg, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups raisins
1 quart oil for frying
1 teaspoon melted butter
1 teaspoon warm water
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Dissolve the yeast in warm water. Stir the yeast mixture, milk, and eggs into the dry ingredients until just combined. Fold in the raisins. Cover and let rise for about 2 hours.
Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
To prepare the glaze, mix the melted butter and 1 teaspoon warm water in a small bowl. Stir in the confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, cream, and vanilla.
Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil. Cook 2 to 5 minutes, until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and cool slightly. Dip each cookie into the glaze and set aside to completely cool.

Description: 
Wonderful homemade doughnut taste from my Mennonite mother-in-law. It is an all morning project but very worth the time and effort!
