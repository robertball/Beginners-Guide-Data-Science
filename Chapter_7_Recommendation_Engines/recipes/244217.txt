Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into small dice
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
2 large cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 French baguette, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
1 tablespoon high-quality balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Stir tomatoes, basil, 3 tablespoons olive oil, red onion, garlic, red wine vinegar, and pepper together in a bowl; let tomato mixture stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, then place in the refrigerator to marinate for 45 minutes.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Brush one side of each slice of bread with remaining olive oil. Place bread slices, oiled-side-up, onto a baking sheet.
Broil until golden brown, about 2 minutes; remove from oven. Spoon tomato mixture evenly over the top of toasted bread slices; drizzle balsamic vinegar evenly over tomato mixture. Serve immediately.
