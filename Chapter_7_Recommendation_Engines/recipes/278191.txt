Ingredients:
nonstick cooking spray
1 cup almond flour
1 tablespoon almond flour
1 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
4 tablespoons erythritol confectioners' sweetener (such as SwerveÂ®), divided
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the basket with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
Place almond flour, Greek yogurt, 2 tablespoons sweetener, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl and mix well. Use your hands to make dough come together.
Dust working area with flour and separate dough into 4 equal pieces, shape into balls. Cut each ball into 8 equal pieces using a bench scraper. Roll each piece in flour; roll in between your hands into a long, thin rope (the thinner the rope, the crispier they will be). Place all 8 ropes, one by one, in a circular mound into the prepared air fryer basket. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Spray each funnel cake with cooking spray.
Air fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip each funnel cake over, spray with cooking spray, and air fry an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sweetener.
