Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup shelled unsalted sunflower seeds
2 tablespoons rolled oats
2 tablespoons flax seeds
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 baking sheets.
Combine flour, sunflower seeds, oats, flax seeds, and baking powder in a large bowl.
Combine eggs and milk in a bowl and beat using an electric mixer until well combined. Add to the bowl with the flour and combine. Add chicken broth and olive oil and mix well.
Knead dough on a floured surface for 1 to 2 minutes. Roll out dough thinly using a rolling pin, and cut out cookies using your favorite cookie cutter. Place on prepared baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Turn oven off, but leave cookies in warm oven to crisp for 30 more minutes.
