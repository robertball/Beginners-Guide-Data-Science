Ingredients:
20 buttery round crackers
5 tablespoons pressurized canned Cheddar cheese spread
60 pretzel sticks
20 raisins

Directions:
Squirt 10 crackers evenly with about 1/2 tablespoon of cheese spread; top each cracker with another to make sandwiches. Poke 6 pretzel sticks into the cheese, 3 on each side, to make 6 legs. Squirt two dots of cheese onto the top of the sandwich, and stick 2 raisin eyes on each snack.
