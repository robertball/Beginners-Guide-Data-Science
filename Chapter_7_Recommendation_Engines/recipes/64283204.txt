Ingredients:
9 or 12 asparagus spears, depending on size
1/2 (16-ounce) package frozen phyllo dough sheets, thawed
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Melt butter and press clove of garlic into butter.
Cut off the tough ends of the asparagus. Unwrap the phyllo and cut the stack in half lengthwise. Cover the phyllo with a damp towel to keep it from drying out.
Take 1 sheet of phyllo and brush lightly with  melted garlic butter. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Place 3 to 4 asparagus spears on the short end of the sheet. Roll up, jelly-roll style.
Place each roll, seam side down, on a baking sheet. Brush with more melted garlic butter and sprinkle with more Parmesan.
Repeat until all the asparagus spears are used up.
Place baking sheet in oven and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.
