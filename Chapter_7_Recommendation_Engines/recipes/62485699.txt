Ingredients:
2 2lb pork tenderloin
5 cloves of garlic, finely diced
2 1/2 tbsp of chopped sun-dried tomatoes (ones in oil)
1/3 cup of shredded or crumbled feta cheese
1 small yellow onion, finely diced
3/4 cup of Kraft Greek salad dressing
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Butterfly the pork tenderloin.
In a bowl mix the feta, sun dried tomatoes, garlic and onions and fill the middles of each tenderloin.
Close them up with toothpicks and pour the Greek dressing over top.
Cover and let marinade for 4-6 hours. Turn it a couple times.
Heat oven to 375F. Place tenderloins on middle rack and cook for about 35-45 minutes until an internal temperature reads 165.
Slice and serve.

I am always looking for different ways to cook this cut of meat and had some ingredients on hand that inspired me to make a Greek flavoured pork tenderloin. Love those recipes that come out of no where and turn out great!
