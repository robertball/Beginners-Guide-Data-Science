Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds small new red potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 ounces thin French-style green beans, trimmed
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse-ground Dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (6 ounce) cod fillets
3 tablespoons prepared black olive tapenade
6 lemon wedges, or to taste
1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line an extra-large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Coat parchment with cooking spray.
Toss potatoes in a bowl with 1 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes.
Toss green beans in bowl with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, mustard, remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Push potatoes to one side of the baking sheet. Lay beans and fish separately on the other side. Spread 3/4 tablespoon tapenade on each fillet.
Bake until cod is no longer translucent and flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. If vegetables need more time, transfer cod to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Roast vegetables 5 to 10 minutes more.
Serve with lemon wedges, tomatoes, and parsley.
