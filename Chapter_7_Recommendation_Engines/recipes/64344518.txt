2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more
1 15.5-ounce can chickpeas, rinsed
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
1 small bunch mustard greens, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon honey
4 6-ounce skinless salmon fillets
Vinaigrette and assembly:
1/2 small shallot, very finely chopped
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon honey
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
