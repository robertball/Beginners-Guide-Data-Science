1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp corn starch
1 can crushed or chunk pineapple, juices saved
1/4 cup juice from canned pineapple
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1/4 cup tomato ketchup
1/2 tsp salt
2-3 tbsp brown sugar (sweetness preference)
1-2 tsp powdered ginger (preference)

1/2 white onion, chopped

Directions:
Marinate cubed chicken in egg white, salt, and corn startch for a minimum of 15 minutes.
In the meantime mix in a medium bowl, the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, brown sugar, and the powdered ginger.
Heat pan on high for several minutes. Add oil, then add chicken. DO NOT STIR, let cook on each side until white, but not cooked through, remove from pan once seared.
Turn the heat to medium, add oil, sautee your veggies, at least 5 minutes. Once onions start to turn clear, add sauce, chicken, and pineapple into the pan. Turn the heat back to high, and when mixture comes to a boil for 1-2 minutes, turn heat back down and let simmer for several minutes longer until sauce thickens.
Serve over rice.

Description: 
This healthier version of the chinese-american favorite is just as delightful without the heavy fried breading, without missing on flavor. I enjoy using crushed pineapple to give the sauce more texture. Best served on a bed of white rice. The marinade on the chicken may seem weird, but is worth it!
