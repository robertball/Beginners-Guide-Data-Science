Ingredients:
1 pot roast cut into large cubes
½ big onion, chopped
½ green bell pepper chopped
2 big cloves garlic, minced
½ can of black seedless olives
½ cup fresh parsley
Sauce:
1 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
½ tablespoons Dijon mustard
¼ teaspoon chili powder
1 tablespoon salt
½ tablespoon black pepper
½ cup water

Directions:
First of all prepare the sauce: In a bowl, combine the vinegar, brown sugar, mustard, salt, pepper, chili powder and Worcestershire sauce. With a whisk mix all ingredients, and finally add the ketchup water. Reserve.
In a pressure cooker (or slow cooker), on medium-high heat, fry the meat (already cut into large cubes) in oil for 2 minutes, but be careful not to brown the meat. Add the onion, green pepper and garlic and saute until soft and mix the sauce into the meat. Cover the saucepan and stir over high heat until get pressure. (The sauce will seem very thick, but it is enough to cook the meat.) After getting pressure, cook on low heat for 45 minutes. Release the pressure slowly, open the pot and add the olives and parsley mix and close for another 15 minutes, then shred the meat roughly.
You need to remember that the time for the slow cooker going is going to be much higher than the pressure cooker.
