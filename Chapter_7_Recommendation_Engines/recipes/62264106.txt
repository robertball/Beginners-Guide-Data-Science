Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1 package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 tsp. sugar
1 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 tsp. salt
1 egg
**************
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted and divided
**************
1 cup chopped pecans
**************
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/2 c. brown sugar (light or dark, as you prefer)
1 T. cinnamon
***(Filling ingredients and amounts)***
While dough is rising prepare filling(s). In small saucepan combine 8 oz. chopped dates, 1 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup honey and juice of one orange. Heat slowly and stir until mixture is paste like. Turn off heat.  (Double ingredients if you want  2 dozen   Date Crispies or Pecan Cinnamon)
For Pecan Cinnamon Filling Combine ½ c. white sugar, ½ c. brown sugar (light or dark, as you prefer) 1 cup chopped pecans and 1 T. cinnamon.

Directions:
Proof yeast in 1/4 c. warm water with 1/2 tsp. sugar.
Heat  buttermilk,  sugar,  shortening  and salt, stirring to melt shortening.  I do this in the microwave in 30 second increments. It usually only takes about three tries, so a minute and a half total.  Allow to cool a bit so mixture doesn't kill your yeast.  (  less than 120 degrees.)
In large mixer bowl combine 2 cups of flour and the yeast.  Stir in buttermilk mixture, add egg.  Beat at low speed with mixer for 1/2 min, scraping sides of bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. *(If you don't have a mixer, this can be done by hand. Good upper body workout!)*   By  hand, stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough. (DO NOT KNEAD) Shape into a ball. Do not over handle.  Place dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning to grease surface. Cover and let rise in a warm place until double (1 1/2 - 2 hrs.) It may start slow.  Be patient.  If your yeast proofed and your milk mixture was not too hot (>120 degrees), it will go.
Prepare pans. I use parchment paper. To bake the full recipe you will need to plan strategically how you’ll lay them all out. If you do not use parchment paper, grease sheets of aluminum foil with shortening. I make 6 Crispies per sheet. (Continued in Footnotes.)

Description: 
I found this recipe in a in a 37 yr old magazine cookbook. I've altered it somewhat and included three different fillings. Each filling recipe makes 12 rolls. The dough recipe makes 2 dozen.
