1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

3/4 cup raisins
2 cups quick-cooking oats
Additional Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened

In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients; set aside. In a 1-qt. glass container, layer brown sugar, sugar, raisins and oats, packing well between each layer. Top with reserved flour mixture. Cover and store in a cool dry place for up to 6 months.
To prepare cookies: In a mixing bowl, cream the butter. Beat in egg and vanilla. Add cookie mix and mix well. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.
