Hearty Beef and Beans Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
¼ cup chopped green pepper
1 (15.5 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained
1 cup pizza sauce
1 (4 ounce) jar mushroom pieces and stems, drained
1 tablespoon dry onion soup mix
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated flaky biscuit dough
10 (1/2 inch) cubes Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine ground beef and green bell pepper in a large skillet; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add red kidney beans, pizza sauce, mushrooms, onion soup mix, and garlic powder; cook and stir until hot and bubbly, about 5 minutes.
Pour beef mixture into a 9x12-inch baking dish.
Separate biscuit dough into 10 pieces. Place 1 cube Cheddar cheese in the center of each piece; fold up dough to cover cheese completely. Arrange dough pieces over beef mixture in the baking dish.
Brush each piece of dough with butter; sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
