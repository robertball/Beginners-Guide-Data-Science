Ingredients:
4 parsnips, peeled and cut into large sticks
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon honey
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
ground black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Place the parsnips into a mixing bowl and toss with the olive oil. Sprinkle in the garlic, honey, salt, and black pepper to taste. Toss until evenly coated, and spread out evenly onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the parsnips are tender, about 30 minutes. Scrape into a mixing bowl, and toss with the mint and sage.
