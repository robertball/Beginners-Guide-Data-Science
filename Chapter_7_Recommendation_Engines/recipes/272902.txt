Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle with salt. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add greens; toss to coat with olive oil and garlic mixture. Cook until bright green and wilted, 4 to 6 minutes.

Description: 
This is my go-to recipe for just about any green I receive in my vegetable co-op box. According to my picky son, even vegetables are good sauteed with garlic and Parmesan!
