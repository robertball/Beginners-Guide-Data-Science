Â¼ teaspoon kosher salt

Description: 
I love the combination of tarragon and Italian parsley, but I've used herbs like basil and thyme, which worked wonderfully as well. As far as the fish goes, a center-cut salmon filet is a perfect thickness for this, but other similarly shaped seafood will work.
