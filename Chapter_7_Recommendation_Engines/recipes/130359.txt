Description: 
We made this recipe in third grade and the teacher sent a copy of the recipe home. I loved it so much I insisted my Mom make it, too. Ever since then it's become a Thanksgiving tradition each year. It has lasted the test of time because now I'm a mother of a third grader and we still make it! The pie requires no baking! And kids love it because it's made of ice cream.
