Ingredients:
2 Italian sausages, removed from casings and crumbled
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tomatoes, diced
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
2 cremini mushrooms, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup finely shredded Italian cheese blend
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 (9 ounce) packages tri-colored cheese-filled tortellini

Directions:
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned, about 10 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat; add tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, stirring as needed.
Combine cream, milk, cheese, and flour in a bowl. Add to the tomato mixture and return to a simmer. Stir occasionally until reduced, about 15 minutes.
While the sauce is reducing, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add tortellini and boil gently until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain the tortellini. Mix with the tomato sauce and serve.
