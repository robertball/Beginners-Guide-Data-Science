Ingredients:
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 cups of very hot water
2 1/2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 of 1/3 of a cup of oil
2 cups of Milk
10 cups of all purpose flour
Cooking oil spray
2 packs of hot dogs (your favorite brand)
2 1/2 teaspoons of salt, split up
2 teaspoons of baking soda
coarse salt - enough for sprinkling finished pretzels

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, put two cups of of hot water. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of yeast over the top of the water, the stir in the sugar, and allow it two sit 20 minutes to proof (It will start to look like a creamy foam on top).
2. Heat the two cups of milk in the microwave and add to yeast mixture. Add oil and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
3. Start adding in flour, try three or four cups at a time. Slowly add in more flour as it will become very thick and hard to stir. Once all the flour is added you will have a moderately stiff, slightly sticky dough.
4. At this time you want to spray it lightly with cooking oil spray and cover with plastic wrap or a light dish cloth and put your bowl aside so the dough can rise for 45 minutes.
5. Start a pot of hot water on the stove top, about 8 cups, and add in 1 teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of baking soda. Bring it to a solid rolling boil.
6. Pull golf ball sized chunks of dough off the main ball and roll into 12in long strips about 1 1/2in thick (like a snake, as my kids say). Repeat for all dough until you have 20 strips.
7. Preheat oven to 375 degrees
8. Dip a strip into boiling water,count to five, then pull out, dry for just a second on a couple of paper towels, then roll around a hot dog, and place side by side on a lightly greased baking sheet. Leave a little room for expansion in between each one. I usually use TWO baking sheets.
9. Sprinkle with coarse salt while still damp.
10. Repeat this process until you have completed this for all hot dogs and strips.
11. Bake in oven at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes until they are golden brown!

So good and better than the ones you get at the mall that cost $5 and were made four hours ago! These are a family favorite that even my pickiest eater goes back for seconds (and sometimes thirds!)
