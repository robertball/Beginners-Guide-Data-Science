2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced thin
1 quart buttermilk
5 tablespoons kosher salt
3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 9x12 inch glass or ceramic dish with olive oil.
Layer potatoes on the bottom of the dish.  Pour 1/3 of the buttermilk over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/3 of the salt, pepper and cheese.  Repeat 2 more times, ending with cheese on top.
