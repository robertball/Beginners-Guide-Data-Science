Ingredients:
4 red potatoes, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons flour
1 1/2 cup water
1/2 sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
3/4-1 cup shredded cheese
paprika to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Lightly grease a 13"x9" casserole dish. Arrange 1/3 of the potato slices in the bottom of the dish, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour over them. Repeat to form three layers of potatoes.
Sprinkle paprika over the potatoes as desired.
Gently pour water over potatoes. Sprinkle cheese over potatoes. Add the sour cream to the casserole dish and stir to distribute throughout.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hr, or longer as needed.
