Ingredients:
1 whole sirloin steak, 3/4 to 1 pound
kosher salt to taste
3/4 cups ponzo or regular soy sauce
3 tbs pure sesame oil
2 tbs olive oil
2 tbs rice wine vinegar
1 tsp hot chili oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced finely
2 tsp minced ginger
2 tbs packed brown sugar
1/2 cups sliced green onion
8 oz thin spaghetti
cilantro leaves

Directions:
Season both sides of the sirloin with salt.  Grill on an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan until medium rare.  Remove from heat and set aside.  In a bowl, combine ponzu (or soy), sesame oil, olive oil, rice wine vinegar, hot chili oil, garlic, ginger, and brown sugar.  Mix combine, then taste and adjust flavors/seasonings to your taste.  When steak is cool enough , place in a large plastic storage bag.  Add 3 tbs of dressing.  Seal bag tightly and place in fridge until needed.
Cook pasta according to package directions.  Drain and place in a bowl.  Pour remaining dressing over the top and toss to combine.  Finally, toss in green onions.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least a couple of hours or until cool.  You can make the steak and noodles well in advance of when you want to serve.
To serve, remove steak from storage bag and slice against the grain into thin strips.  Drizzle a little ponzu over noodles just to give it a little flavor boost, throw in plenty of cilantro leaves, and toss to combine.  Serve strips of beef over mound of noodles, or thrown it all into a bowl together.  Serve with chopsticks if you have them.
