Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
3/4 cup dry lentils
1/2 cup grated carrots
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Combine water and lentils in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover saucepan, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add carrots, onion, jalapeno pepper, and garlic to lentils; cook until lentils are tender, about 15 minutes more. Remove saucepan from heat and slightly cool lentil mixture.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease an oven-proof wire rack.
Mix bread crumbs, eggs, olive oil, salt, and Italian seasoning in a bowl; add lentil mixture and stir until well combined. Form mixture into 6 to 8 patties and place on the prepared wire rack; refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Place wire rack with patties onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until burgers are firm, about 20 minutes.
