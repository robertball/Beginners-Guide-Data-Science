Ingredients:
1 cup butter
7 ounces dark chocolate
4 eggs
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules
1 cup self-rising flour

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil liners.
Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and let cool.
Blend the eggs and sugar with a mixer in a large bowl.  Stir the cooled melted chocolate into the egg mixture.  Add the vanilla extract and instant coffee.  Sift in self-rising flour and stir until well combined.  Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 to 18 minutes.

Description: 
This is by far the richest chocolate cupcake I've ever made! Adapted this recipe from a brownie recipe I found on the internet and tweaked it a bit to fit my taste.
