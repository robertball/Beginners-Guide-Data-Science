Ingredients:
1 pkg. Goya: 10 small, round, discs, defrosted (if previously frozen. can be found in Hispanic groc. stores)
1 lb. ground beef (cooked)
2-3 Tblsp Sofrito
1- 8 oz can tomato sauce
1 pkt Sazon
Adobo seasoning or salt/pepper to taste
Vegetable oil for frying
1/4 c. water

Directions:
In a medium skillet, thouroughly cook ground beef (drain fat, but keep just enough so the rest of ingredients can saute in it).  On low heat, saute beef, sofrito, tomato sauce, sazon, and adobo.  Let it simmer for a bit, so the flavors can enhance the meat.
Meanwhile in another skillet, add enough oil to fill it 1/2 way and heat to 350.  Open pkg of discs, removing one disc at a time (so they don't dry out), place it on a piece of wax paper, and moisten edges w/water, then add beef filling in center.  Fold disc in half, then press and seal edges together w/fork.  Fry each side of the empanadilla, until golden brown.  About 2 min ea side.  Drain on paper towel. Repeat.
