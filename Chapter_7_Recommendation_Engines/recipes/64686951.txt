Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups sweetened flake coconut
1 14-15 oz can full fat coconut milk
1 cup half and half
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
3/4 cups white sugar
1/3 cup corn starch
2 Tbsp flour
1/4 tsp salt
1 tsp  vanilla
1 tsp coconut extract
9" shortcrust pie shell, blind baked
3 cups heavy whipping cream
1/3 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread 1/3 of the coconut on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown. (Check on it frequently as it can go from golden to black very quickly.)
Combine the coconut milk, half-and-half, eggs, egg yolk, sugar, corn starch, flour, and salt in a medium saucepan.
Bring to a boil over low heat, stirring constantly.
Once boiling, cook for 2  more minutes .
Remove from the heat, and stir in 2/3 of the coconut (untoasted), coconut extract, and vanilla.
Pour the filling into the pie shell and chill until firm (3-4 hours).
In a mixer and using a whisk attachment, beat the heavy whipping cream with the powdered sugar until soft peaks form.
Top the pie with the cream and sprinkle the toasted coconut over the top.
