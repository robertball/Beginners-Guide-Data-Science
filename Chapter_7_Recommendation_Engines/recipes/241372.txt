Ingredients:
1 onion, finely chopped
1 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 thin pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 440 degrees F (227 degrees C).
Whisk onion, ketchup, vinegar, honey, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until barbeque sauce is smooth.
Place pork chops on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Top each pork chop with 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
If you love BBQ sauce, this is a tasty and easy dish to whip up when you're short on time. We like these BBQ chops with long grain rice mixed with turmeric and peas.
