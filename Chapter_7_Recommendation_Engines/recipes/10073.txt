Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup cottage cheese, creamed
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 egg whites
2 cups chopped walnuts
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
In large bowl, beat together butter or margarine and cottage cheese til light and fluffy.  Add flour until dough forms a ball.
Divide dough into 3 equal portions.  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and grease cookie sheets.
To Make Filling:  Combine egg whites, nuts, water, and ground cinammon.  Mix well and set aside.
On a floured surface roll 1 portion of dough into a 10 inch circle. Spread circle with 1/3 of the filling to within approximately 1/2 inch of the edge.
Cut circle into 24 pie-shaped wedges. Beginning at outer edge roll up each wedge tightly. Place point side down on cookie sheet 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake 13-15 minutes or until golden (be sure to watch carefully as these cookies burn easily).
Remove to rack to cool. Repeat process with each remaining portion of dough and filling.

Description: 
These cookies need time to make as the dough needs to cool and rest for several hours. They are worth the effort.
