Ingredients:
4 oz. steak, uncooked
1 medium potato
2 tbsp. chopped scallions
1 tsp. minced garlic
2 tbsp. oyster sauce
1 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce
1 tsp. olive oil

Directions:
Place steak in freezer for about 15 minutes. Cut potato into small cubes; put to side. Take steak out of freezer and thinly slice; put to side.
Preheat stir-fry pan on medium heat. Once pan is heated to proper temperature put olive oil in the pan. Drop a little of the minced garlic in the heated oil – if the garlic begins to sizzle the pan is hot enough to stir-fry.
Add the rest of the garlic to the pan, along with the slices of steak. Stir fry the steak for about 2 minutes. Add in the potato cubes, stir well and cover for about 5 minutes.
Add oyster sauce and soy sauce to pan; thoroughly mix. Cover for another 3-5 minutes. Turn down the heat to medium low and add in the chopped scallions. Mix well, turn off the heat and cover for 5 minutes. Serve.
