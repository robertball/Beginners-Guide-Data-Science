Ingredients:
1/4 c butter
3 bunches of scallions, cleaned
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 tbsp flour
4 c vegetable stock
1/2 c white wine
1 (12 oz) package baby bella mushrooms (or any variety on hand)
1/2 c cream
1/4 tsp nutmeg

Directions:
Mince cleaned scallions, using both green and white parts. (I just threw mine in the food processor) In a large stockpot, melt butter. Add onions, salt, and pepper. Saute onions over medium high heat for 8-10 minutes, until soft. Do not brown. Stir in flour, saute for 1 minute. Whisk in stock and wine, then bring to a boil. Add mushrooms, lower heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in cream and nutmeg.
Using an immersion blender, blend soup to desired texture.

Description: 
I make this in bulk and then freeze it in 1 1/2 cup quantities to use in recipes.  I like it better than the canned variety, and it's a lot less expensive if you live where fresh mushrooms are cheap.
