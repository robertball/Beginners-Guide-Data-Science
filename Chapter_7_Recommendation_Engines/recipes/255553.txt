Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
Â¼ cup finely chopped green onion, or to taste
1  jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8  chicken tenders
8 slices bacon
8  toothpicks
6 tablespoons pepper jelly

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.
Mix cream cheese, green onion, jalapeno pepper, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Pound chicken tenders into a rectangular shape with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Place 3 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture in the middle of each tender; fold into a pouch.
Wrap a slice of bacon around each pouch and secure with a toothpick. Top with some pepper jelly. Arrange on the wire rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and chicken juices run clear, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe to have with friends and family, or for a buffet line. I love to invite a few friends over and serve this with a few other appetizers. A friend brought me a version of this recipe and through a little tweaking we were able to come up with this great dish.
