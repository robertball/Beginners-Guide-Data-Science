Ingredients:
1 8 lb chicken, rinsed and pat dry (inside and outside)
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup dijon mustard
1 small onion, quartered
kosher or sea salt
fresh cracked pepper
thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Place the onion quarters inside the cavity.   In a small bowl, mix the honey and the mustard until creamy and smooth.  On a cutting surface, baste the chicken skin liberally with the honey-mustard blend.  Try to baste the underside of the chicken as best as you can.  Sprinkle herbs liberally on the chicken skin or to taste.  Transfer to a rack inside a baking pan.  Place in the back of the preheated oven.  Baste with remaining honey-mustard mixture every 30 minutes.  Cover lightly with foil only if your skin is becoming darker than a toasty brown.  Chicken is done when juices run clear when a knife is inserted into the chicken thigh, or 180 degrees in the thigh meat.
