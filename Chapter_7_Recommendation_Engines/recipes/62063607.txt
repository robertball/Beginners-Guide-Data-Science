Ingredients:
2 slices of bread of your choice
1-2 oz of sliced fontina
1 small onion - sliced
1 t butter

Directions:
Preheat skillet over medium heat. Melt butter in skillet.  Add onions and cook until transulcent.  Lower heat to simmer.  Continue cooking onions without stirring.  Caramalizing takes place without stirring onions too often. You want the onions to emit their sugars.  Only stir once every few minutes to prevent burning.  After about 15 mins the onions should be a nice dark brown and reduced in size.  Remove from heat and reserve the onions.
Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side-down onto skillet bottom and add cheese.  Top cheese with some of the onions.  Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side-up on top of sandwich. Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese is melted.

Description: 
A cross between a panini and gourmet grilled cheese.  I like to make the caramelized onions and store them so that I can make sandwiches for a couple of days.
