Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
4 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 large red bell pepper, diced
1/2 large green bell pepper, diced
1/2 medium onion, diced
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
12 ounces condensed butter masala cooking sauce
1 cup raisins
1 cup water

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic to hot butter and cook for 1 minute. Add mushrooms, bell peppers, and onion; cook for about 2 minutes more. Stir in chicken, diced tomatoes, masala sauce, raisins, and water. Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, about 5 minutes. Cover and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I like masala chicken, but I wanted to jazz it up a bit. So, I diced some peppers and onions and added raisins for this Indian-inspired dish.
