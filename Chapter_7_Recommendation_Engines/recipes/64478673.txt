Ingredients:
1/4 cup nutritional yeast flakes
1/4 cup almond meal, fine
1 pinch of sea salt, optional

Directions:
Add the yeast flakes and almond meal (and salt if using) to a blender. Using short pulses, blend the ingredients just enough to combine together. Do not blend too long or it will become a paste. Use the "cheese" to top pasta, add to pesto, or try it on popcorn. Anywhere grated, aged Italian cheese is needed, this will do perfectly. Enjoy.

Description: 
Almonds and nutritional yeast blend together to replace aged Italian cheese for those who don't eat real cheese. The taste is so similar, when used in pesto or on top of pasta, it is hard to tell the difference. This combination is chock full of nutrients too!
