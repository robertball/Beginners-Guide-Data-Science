Ingredients:
2 tbsp canola or olive oil
1/3 cup of white onion
1/4 cup of red bell peppers (green bell peppers can be substituted)
1/2 to 1 tsp of salt to taste
2 cups of water
1 cup of white Jasmine Rice (preferably), Long-Grain Rice, or Brown Jasmine Rice

Directions:
1. Set 2-3 cups of water aside to boil in the microwave or in a pot.
2. Cut a small onion to make 1/3 cup of finely diced onion. Cut a slice of red bell pepper to make 1/4 cup and set aside.
3. In a medium pan with lid heat the 2 tbsp of oil over medium-low heat.
4. Add 1/3 cup white onions into the oil and cook until translucent.
5. Add the white Jasmine rice and fry the rice for about 3 minutes stirring constantly, being careful to not brown the rice but just slightly toast it.
6. Add the 2 cups of boiling water and 1/4 cup of red bell peppers to the rice making sure there is about a fingernail's length of water above the rice. Add the salt to taste.
7. Set pan to low-medium and cover with lid or if you don't have a lid you can use foil.
8. Cook for 15 minutes and let set for 15 minutes. Do not open the lid/foil to check on the rice.
