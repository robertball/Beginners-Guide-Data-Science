Ingredients:
2 pounds hamburger
4 slices of Kraft singles cheese or a cheese of choice!
2 eggs
2 cloves of garlic minced
1 medium onion chopped finely
2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. pepper
small amount of olive oil or Pam Grill cooking spray
4 Hamburger buns

Directions:
Start your grill!
Mix together hamburger, onion, garlic, salt & pepper.
In seperate bowl beat two eggs until smooth - then add to meat mixture and blend well using your hands.
Form 4 smaller sized hamburger patties about 5-6" round but not too thick. (Don't worry:the eggs will prevent them from falling apart) Place the well formed hamburger patties on a clean lightly greased plate and create 4 additional similar sized hamburger patties and set aside.
Place a slice of cheese on each of the four patties on the lightly greased plate - then gently place the other patty on top of the cheese and gently pinch the entire side of the hamburger patties together. This will provide you with 4 hamburgers with cheese in the middle! Grill to your liking and enjoy! This is great on a grill toasted sesame hamburger bun! To grill your hamburger buns - lightly brush each side with olive oil and place on grill during the last minute of cooking - to get a perfect toasted bun.
