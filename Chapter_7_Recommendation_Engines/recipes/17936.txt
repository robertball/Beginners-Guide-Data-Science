Ingredients:
4 potatoes - peeled and cubed
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/8 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1/8 teaspoon dried dill weed
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 cup milk

Directions:
In a large pot over high heat, boil the potatoes in the broth for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are tender. Carefully separate the potatoes from the broth and transfer to a blender or food processor.
Add 3/4 cup of the broth to the potatoes and puree for 5 seconds or more depending on how smooth you want the soup to be. Add remaining broth and set aside.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the salt, ground black pepper, onion and dill weed to the butter, stir and saute for 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the flour and stir well.
Pour in the milk and heat until the mixture starts to thicken, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the pureed potato mixture. Allow to heat through and serve.

This is the quickest cream of potato soup you will ever make. Just thirty minutes from peeling the potatoes to serving the soup. My family loves it.
