Description: 
Now that summer is winding down, I'm planning ahead to ensure that our weeknights go as smoothly as possible. I know that my days are going to be very busy. One thing I don't negotiate, even when our schedule is crazy, is having dinner together with my family. Dinner can sometimes be overwhelming, but with Knorr® Sides, I spend less time in the kitchen and more time with my family.
