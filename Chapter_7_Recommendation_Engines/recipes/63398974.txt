Ingredients:
2 c all purpose flour
1 c butter, softened
3/4 c confectioners sugar
1 1/2 t vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350'.  In a medium sized bowl, mix all the ingredients together with your fingers until the dough is smooth and holds together.  Divide the dough in half.  Press each ahlf into an ungreased 8 inch round tin (be sure to spread the dough evenly and smooth out the top).  Using the tines of a fork, make a decorative border around the edges.  Then, using a sharp knife cut the shortbread into 8 wedges.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges begin to lightly brown.  Remove the shortbread from the oven and immediately re-cut the 8 wedges with the sharp knife.  Cool in the pan for 30 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool thoroughly.  Makes 16 pieces.
