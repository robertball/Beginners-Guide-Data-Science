Ingredients:
4 or 5 cups of your left over rice from this morning when your made Cream of Rice Breakfast Cereal, recipe on site.
3 eggs, beaten, depending on the amount of rice, 4 eggs may be necessary

1/2 TBS corn starch, disolved in the milk
Sugar
Seasonings; Put any or all of the seasonings, it's your choice;
Vanilla or another flavoring,
cinnamon
allspice
ground cloves
nutmeg
salt if you wish but I don't add any salt.
Other things can be added to the rice such as:
Raisins,
Craisins,
Maple syrup,
diced apples.
I have with great results used Rum or Brandy flavoring.
Optional; Caramel syrup for topping

Directions:
Stir left over rice in the pan
Add everything you are going to add EXCEPT THE EGGS.
Stir the rice to fully incorporate all the ingredients.
Taste of it, how does it taste? Does it need more spices, is it sweet enough? Well, add a little at a time.
When you get the pudding tasting exactlly like you want, add the beaten eggs and stir to incorporate.
Spray or butter a baking dish, round or flat, your choice and pour in the rice mixture.
Bake on 350* until rice has set and is sort of dry on top.
Serve plain or with milk poured over the rice or drizzle with caramel ice cream syrup.
You can add whatever toppings you like such as whipped cream and sprinkle with nuts, it's up to your imagination.
