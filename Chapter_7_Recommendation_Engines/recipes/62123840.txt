French Bread Bowls Recipe

Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 tablespoons of sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 egg white
1 tablespoon water
1 table spoon of butter
About 1 tablespoon of cooking oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, yeast, sugar, salt and 2 cups flour. Stir in 2 cups warm water, and beat until well blended.
Add the rest of the flour 1/2 cup at a time to the mixture.
On a lightly floured surface, knead in enough flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic. You should be able to hold the dough without any of it sticking to your hands and fingers. Knead for about 8 to 10 minutes total.
Divide in half. Shape into balls.
Using the cooking oil, light oil the large bowls. Put the dough balls into seperate bowls. Turn to coat. Cover with damp cloths and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Melt the butter, and mix it in a small bowl with the egg white and the water. Set Aside.
Punch dough down, and divide in half again. Roll into balls. With a sharp kinfe make a cut about 1/4 inch deep across the top of each ball. Dip the dough balls into the egg mixture so that the cut side is well coated. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet, DO NOT COVER, and allow to rise until almost doubled.
Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 20 minutes.
