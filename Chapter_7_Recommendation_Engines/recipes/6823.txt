Directions:
In a large bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and lemon peel.
With a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Mix in all but 2 tablespoons of the nuts and the raisins.  Mix in buttermilk with fork.
Gather the dough into a ball and knead for about 2 minutes on lightly floured board.
Roll or pat out 3/4 inch thick.  With a chef's knife cut into 3 inch triangles.  Place, spaced 1inch apart, on a greased baking sheet.  Brush tops with remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk; sprinkle with the remaining sugar and the nuts.
Bake in center of 425 degree F (220 degrees C) oven about 15 minutes or until nicely browned.  Serve warm with butter or jam.
