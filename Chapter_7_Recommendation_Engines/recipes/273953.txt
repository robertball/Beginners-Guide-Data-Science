Ingredients:
6 slices center-cut bacon
4 slices lightly toasted bread, divided
2 tablespoons basil pesto
1 tomato, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons light mayonnaise

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Set aside on a paper towel to drain.
Spread 1 tablespoon pesto on the bottom slice of toast. Layer tomato slices and 3 slices bacon over each. Season with salt and pepper. Spread 1 teaspoon mayonnaise on remaining bread slices and place on top of the sandwiches. Cut sandwiches in half to serve.

Description: 
If you're tired of a BLT, try a BBPT. The basil pesto is a wonderful complement to the bacon and tomato on this sandwich. During summer, when you have more basil than you know what to do with, make your own pesto. You can freeze pesto in ice cube trays for a real treat in the winter. And go ahead and pick one of those fresh tomatoes in your garden to slice down for this sandwich.
