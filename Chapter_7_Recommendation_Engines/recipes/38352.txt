Ingredients:
1 large watermelon
1 (750 milliliter) bottle vodka

Directions:
With a small, sharp knife, carve a hole in the top of the watermelon big enough for the end of the bottle. Open the bottle of vodka, and place it upside-down in the hole. Refrigerate overnight.
To serve, place watermelon on a tray to catch the juice, and cut into pieces.
