Description: 
(Based on Terry Thompson's Jezebel sauce)
Jezebel sauce is typically pour over cream cheese. This recipe combines the two to create a thinner consistency schmear. This is also great as a dip for crackers and potato chips.
Adjust the amount of mustard, horseradish, & black pepper to your personal taste.
