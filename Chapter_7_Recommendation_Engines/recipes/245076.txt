Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discarded
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 ¾ cups Swanson(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Chicken Stock
3 tablespoons red curry paste (such as Thai Kitchen(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
1 tablespoon sriracha hot chile sauce, or to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon fish sauce (optional)
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
Place the wings on a baking rack and set on prepared baking sheet. Bake until wing pieces are crispy and golden brown, 60 to 70 minutes.
Whisk cornstarch and Swanson(R) Chicken Stock together in a bowl until smooth. Pour sauce mixture into a saucepan and bring to a simmer; add red curry paste, sriracha, brown sugar, fish sauce, and garlic powder. Whisk until smooth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce reaches your desired thickness, about 10 minutes.
Toss wings in sauce, garnish with cilantro, and serve immediately.
