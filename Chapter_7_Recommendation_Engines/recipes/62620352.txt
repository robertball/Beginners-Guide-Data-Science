Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 Tbs. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
3 large eggs, separated
2 Tbs. granulated sugar
1-3/4 cups milk
1 to 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla extract (use more if using imitation extract)
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
In a large bowl, sift or whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt to blend thoroughly.  Set aside.
In mixer bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form.  Add sugar and continue beating just until stiff peaks form.  Set aside.
Whisk together egg yolks, milk, and vanilla.  Using a rubber spatula, stir milk mixture into the flour mixture, blending just until dry ingredients are moistened.  There should still be small lumps.  Don't over-mix.  Stir in the melted butter and then fold in the beaten egg whites.
Pour batter onto hot, greased waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Remove to a cooling rack for a few minutes prior to placing waffles on serving plates.  This allows any residual steam to escape, ensuring a crispy waffle.

Description: 
These vanilla-scented waffles are light and fluffy on the inside, but have a nice crispy crust because of the cornstarch in the batter.
