Pull Apart Pizza Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 Cans of Pizza Dough or Biscuits
2 cups Mozzarella cheese
1 cup Parmesean cheese
2 tablespoons of parsley flakes
1/3 cup olive oil
1 – 6 oz package of pepperoni (we used the turkey and only used 1/2 package)
1 teaspoon minced garlic

Directions:
Cut pizza dough or biscuits into quarter pieces. Cut the pepperoni into smaller pieces. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and toss so that the oil is spread evenly. Put into greased baking dish and spread evenly. Bake for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees (or until the top is brown and the center is thoroughly cooked).
TIP: Be sure to check it in the middle before you pull it out. If the middle is still not cooked thoroughly, be sure to continue baking and check it every 5 minutes until it’s done. Flip over on to a plate while it’s still hot. Can use a Bundt cake pan or a regular 9×13 baking dish as well. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping if desired.
