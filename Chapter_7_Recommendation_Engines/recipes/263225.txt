Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 teaspoons lemon juice, divided
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 (8 ounce) fillets wild salmon fillets
1/2 teaspoon Himalayan salt, or to taste
1/2 cup finely crushed almonds
1 (6 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
1 cup cherry tomatoes

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Grease a baking pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Mix remaining olive oil, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl to form the salad dressing.
Brush salmon fillets with remaining 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Sprinkle with Himalayan salt and black pepper. Cover top and sides of salmon with almonds. Place salmon skin-side down in the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle any remaining almonds on top, pressing gently to adhere.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. Let cool; cut each fillet in half.
Place spinach and tomatoes in a bowl. Add dressing; toss to coat. Serve alongside the salmon.
