Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons dry potato flakes
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 cup chilled club soda
2 cups panko bread crumbs, or as needed
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
2 large onions, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and separated into rings
fine salt to taste

Directions:
Whisk together flour, cornstarch, dry potato flakes, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Whisk in club soda to make a smooth batter.
Place panko bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place a few onion rings at a time into the bowl of batter and turn to coat all sides with batter.
Remove onion rings from batter and place into pan of panko bread crumbs; turn to coat completely with crumbs.
Cook a few rings at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Transfer to a cooling rack set over paper towels to drain. Season with salt to taste and serve.
