Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cups shredded and chopped cooked corned beef
4 ounces spinach, chopped
3 eggs, lightly whisked
5 cups cooked rice
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add corned beef; cook and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add spinach; cook and stir until wilted, about 2 minutes.
Push beef and spinach to the sides of the work; pour eggs into the center; cook, stirring frequently, until eggs are scrambled, about 3 minutes. Stir in rice; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with garlic powder and salt.

Description: 
You can use leftover corned beef. We love this fried rice so much that I actually cook corned beef (by slow-cooking pre-marinated meat) just for this! 
Adjust the amount of each ingredient to your taste. I like the combination of the colors as well as the nutrition balance.
