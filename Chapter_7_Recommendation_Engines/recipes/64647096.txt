Ingredients:
Butter, for greasing dish
2-3 tablespoons Olive Oil
1 medium eggplant, cubed
2 cloves Garlic, coarsely chopped
3 cups Bolognese
6 oz Ricotta Cheese
1 1/2 cup small pasta
2 tablespoons dried Parsley
1 teaspoon dried Basil
1 teaspoon dried Oregano
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 teaspoon sea salt (divided)
1 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (divided)
4 to 5 very ripe, extra-large or beefsteak tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
Freshly shredded parmesan cheese

Directions:
Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Butter an 8 by 8-inch glass baking dish. Set aside.
In a large sauté pan add olive oil and set to medium heat. Add eggplant and season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Sauté for about 15 minutes until eggplant is browned and soft.
In a medium bowl combine the remainder of ingredients together (except for the tomatoes)
Line the bottom and sides of the baking dish with tomato slices. Pour the entire mixture into the pan and spread evenly. Arrange the remaining tomato slices in an overlapping layer on top of the pasta mixture, making sure the mixture is completely covered. Bake for about 1 hour or until the tomatoes become brown and soft.
Take out of the oven and sprinkle the parmesan cheese and let sit for 10 minutes before you slice into your delicious tomato bake!

This is a great bake that could be made ahead of time and be kept in the fridge and then popped into the oven when it's time for dinner!
