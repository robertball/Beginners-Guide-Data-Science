Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup blueberries, fresh or frozen
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Blend flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder together in a bowl. Make a well in the center; add eggs, maple syrup, applesauce, and coconut oil. Stir by hand until just combined. Add bananas, blueberries, and walnuts. Mix until just incorporated. Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven, 6 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes more.
Cool muffins in tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.
