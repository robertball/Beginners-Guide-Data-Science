Description: 
I combined two of my friends' guacamole recipes for Cinco de Mayo and woah! What a tasty guacamole it made! My friends and family raved! It's now on my list of potluck recipes. It's absolutely delicious as a fajita topping too!

 Enjoy! This recipe makes a medium-sized bowl of guac, so use more or less avocados for your party.
