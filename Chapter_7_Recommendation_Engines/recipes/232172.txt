Ingredients:
2 cups ketchup
2 cups cola-flavored carbonated beverage (such as Coca-ColaÂ®)
2 cups Italian-style salad dressing
5 pounds beef sirloin tips

Directions:
Mix ketchup, cola, and Italian salad dressing in a large bowl. Coat beef tips with the mixture  and marinate in refrigerator for at least 12 hours, stirring occasionally.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain beef tips, discarding used marinade.
Grill beef tips on the preheated grill until browned and slightly pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).

Description: 
Thanks to friends in college, I picked up an excellent family-style/party-style recipe while camping. This is a delicious dish to be savored over some brews! Best if grilled medium-rare to medium and served with fresh corn on the cob and homemade potato salad!
