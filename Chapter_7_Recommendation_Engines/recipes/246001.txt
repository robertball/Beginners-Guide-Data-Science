Ingredients:
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 head broccoli, cut into small florets
1/2 bunch kale, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 cup sliced black olives
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add quinoa; cook and stir until quinoa is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour in chicken broth slowly. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until most of the chicken broth is absorbed, about 12 minutes.
Layer broccoli, kale, and red bell pepper over quinoa in the skillet. Cover and cook until quinoa is tender, about 8 minutes more. Fluff quinoa with a fork. Sprinkle cilantro and olives on top. Season with salt and black pepper and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
