Ingredients:
1 teaspoon avocado oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
10 ounces Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthwise
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons crumbled cooked bacon (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Add Brussels sprouts and turn to coat.
Air fry for 5 minutes, shake the sprouts, and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
Transfer sprouts to a serving dish and sprinkle with balsamic vinegar; turn to coat. Sprinkle with bacon.

Description: 
Sweet and tart balsamic vinegar pairs well with the bitterness of Brussels sprouts; the bacon adds a smokey flavor. After 10 minutes, there's still some bite to the sprouts; add a few more minutes for a softer texture, if desired.
