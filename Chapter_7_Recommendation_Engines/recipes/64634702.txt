Ingredients:
1 pound perciatelli (or bucatini pasta, can substitute linguine)
1/2 pounds fresh asparagus (trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces)
1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil
3 garlic cloves (minced)
1 pinch chili flakes (crushed red)
3/4 cups dry white wine
3/4 pounds large shrimp (peeled and deveined)
12 sun-dried tomatoes (thinly sliced)
1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese (finely, plus more for serving)
1/4 cups flat leaf parsley (packed chopped)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente. During the last minute of cooking, add the asparagus. Drain the pasta and asparagus into a colander.
While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add garlic and red chili flakes and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Pour in white wine and cook at a rapid simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Add shrimp and simmer until just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 12 thinly sliced sun-dried tomatoes, salt, and pepper.
Add the pasta and asparagus and toss with the shrimp and sauce. Add Parmesan cheese and parsley, and toss again. Serve immediately and top with additional grated Parmesan cheese.
