Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) thick salmon fillets
1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat, divided
4 slices smoked Gouda cheese
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 lemons, juiced - divided
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill
1 (2 ounce) jar capers in brine, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim the salmon fillets, if necessary, to remove thin portion; with a very sharp knife, cut the fillets horizontally through the center but leave one end uncut so the fillet opens like a book. Place 1/4 of the lump crabmeat onto each opened fillet, and top crab with a slice of smoked Gouda; close the fillets. Place each fillet into a single-serving baking dish. Mix the melted butter and juice of 1 lemon in a small bowl, and drizzle the lemon butter over all the salmon fillets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon is opaque and flakes easily, 30 minutes or as needed.
In a bowl, mix the juice of the 2nd lemon with sour cream and dill; spoon sour cream mixture over each baked fillet, and sprinkle liberally with capers. Serve immediately.

Description: 
After eating this at a restaurant in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, I was surprised that the chef was willing to give me the recipe.  My favorite way of preparing salmon. A suitable meal for special company.  Excellent with Pinot Grigio - our favorite is Ecco DomaniÂ®.  We usually serve it with baked rice with pine nuts.
