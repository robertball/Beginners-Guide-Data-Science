Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/2 cup packed splenda blend brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 1/2 teaspoons cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small onion, chopped
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
3/4 cup whole wheat bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
In a mixing bowl, mix thoroughly all remaining ingredients and shape into a loaf. I make 2 smaller loaves to decrease cooking time.
Bake covered in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until juices are clear.
Mix the ketchup and brown sugar together.
Remove from oven (I usually discard the fat in the bottom of the dish at this point) put the mixture on top and put it back into the oven uncovered for about 10 minutes until it bubbles and gets darker.
