Pilaf-Style Rice Recipe

Ingredients:
2 teaspoons unsalted butter , vegetable or olive oil
1 cup long grain white rice (not converted)
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon table salt

Directions:
Heat oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add rice; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 3 minutes, depending on desired amount of nutty flavor. Add water and salt; bring to boil, swirling pot to blend ingredients.
Reduce heat to low, cover with tight lid lined with a towel, and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minute
Turn off heat; let rice stand on burner, still covered, to finish cooking, about 15 minutes longer. Fluff with fork and serve.
NOTE: This recipe is designed for one cup of raw rice in a tight-lidded pot. As you cook more rice, you should reduce the proportion of water. With two cups of rice, you can get these results with two and one-half to two and three-quarters cups of water. But it is very hard to get a reliable result with less than a cup of rice, so do not halve this recipe
