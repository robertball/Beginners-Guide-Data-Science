Ingredients:
3 teaspoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
1 (14 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley, or to taste
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, or more to taste
2 tablespoons finely chopped capers
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup almond meal, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil and place in the preheating oven.
Mix salmon, red pepper, parsley, Dijon mustard, capers, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Stir in almond meal until mixture begins to bind together. Form into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.
Add patties to the preheated baking sheet. Drizzle tops with remaining olive oil. Bake until heated through and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
