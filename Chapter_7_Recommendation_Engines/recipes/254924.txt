Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup coconut sugar
3 cups almond flour
1 cup tapioca flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 large eggs at room temperature
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush a cast iron skillet with melted coconut oil.
Place butter into a large mixing bowl; spread with the back of a wooden spoon. Add coconut sugar; mix together with a fork until well incorporated. Pour in almond flour, tapioca flour, baking soda, and sea salt; stir, first with a fork then switch to a wooden spoon, until combined.
Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a bowl until evenly blended. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour egg mixture into well and stir until dough is combined. Fold in chocolate chips. Pour into skillet; spread evenly with a wooden spoon.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I just love my cast iron pan for many of my recipes. We were invited to our friends for dinner, and since it was on my stove top, I decided to make a dessert! Plus it looks great to bring the pan with the dessert in it to a friends house. My pan is a 12-inch so I made a really big cookie. We just warmed it in the oven while we were eating, then topped it with ice cream and melted chocolate. Yum!
