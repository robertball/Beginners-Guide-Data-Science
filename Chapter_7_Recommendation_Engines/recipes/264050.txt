Description: 
I usually make this Thai-inspired soup in the slow cooker, but you can make it on the stove as well. It's a delicious alternative to normal winter veggie soups. You can serve it to a family with thick consistency as a meal along with naan bread or crusty loaf (my kids ages 2-11 love it!) or serve it to grown-up friends along with a glass of wine! I think it's a very versatile and delicious dish.
