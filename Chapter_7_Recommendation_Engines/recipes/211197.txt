Ingredients:
3 cups milk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter
salt and pepper to taste
4 pork chops
4 large potatoes, shredded, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish.
Whisk together the milk, flour, butter, salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring until the mixture thickens, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove the white sauce from the heat.
Heat a skillet over medium heat, and sear the pork chops on both sides in the hot skillet just until browned, about 5 minutes. Set the pork chops aside.
Place about 2/3 of the shredded potatoes into the prepared baking dish. Potatoes should fill about 2/3 of the dish. Top with the seared pork chops, and top with the remaining shredded potatoes. Pour the white sauce over the casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours.

Description: 
I got this recipe from my mother and just love it.  The pork chops just melt in your mouth, and you can jazz up the potatoes with whatever you like.  My favorite is to layer some shredded cheddar cheese with the potatoes.
