Ingredients:
1 pound Italian link sausage
1 (13.25 ounce) package spaghettini (thin spaghetti)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 pounds roma (plum) tomatoes, seeded and diced
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook the Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and no longer pink inside, 10 to 12 minutes.
Transfer sausages to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices and set aside.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghettini at a boil until tender yet firm, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir asparagus pieces in the hot oil until they start to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
Mix in diced roma tomatoes, garlic salt, and black pepper; cook and stir until the tomatoes soften slightly, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove vegetables from heat.
Toss the sliced sausage in the skillet with the asparagus and tomatoes to combine; lightly mix in the spaghettini.
Sprinkle the spaghettini and vegetables with Parmesan cheese.
