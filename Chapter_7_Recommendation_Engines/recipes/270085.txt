Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/2 medium onions, minced
2 1/2 cups diced potatoes

Add remaining 4 tablespoons of butter to the same pot. Add flour and whisk constantly over medium heat until roux becomes light brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in seafood broth, whisking constantly to make sure soup stays smooth.
