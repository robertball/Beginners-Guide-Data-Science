Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups red wine vinegar
3/4 cup red wine
7 cloves garlic, crushed
3 bay leaves
8 whole cloves, or to taste
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (3 pound) boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk red wine vinegar, red wine, garlic, bay leaves, cloves, black pepper, salt, and thyme together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 to 4 days, turning occasionally.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drain the pork, reserving 1/2 cup of marinade. Put pork and reserved marinade in a baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until the pork is completely warmed, about 20 minutes. Drain as much liquid from the pork as possible.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the pork to the skillet in batches to prevent crowding; cook and stir in hot oil until completely browned and no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Ahh, 'Vina Dosh,' a Portuguese dish and tradition of my family during Christmas. It started getting passed down more than 80 years ago when my grandparents came to America from the Azore Islands! Easy to make, but lots of patience to wait for the marinade to make its magic. But, oh so worth the wait! As it was passed down to me, I share it with you. Serve with Portuguese Linguica, a pot of semi-sweet, bacon-laced baked beans, and some Portuguese sweet bread. Hawaiian sweet bread works in a pinch. You can use white wine or red wine in the marinade.
