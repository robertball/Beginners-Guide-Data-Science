Ingredients:
1/2 head cauliflower florets
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil and cook cauliflower until tender but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Combine Cheddar cheese, cream, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Arrange cauliflower in a casserole dish and cover with cheese mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Cauliflower in a creamy cheese sauce is a perfect keto recipe and delicious to boot! Make sure you season well with salt and pepper (nutmeg tastes great as well) otherwise it will taste too bland.
