Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar (my addition)
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
cracked black pepper
Garnish
10 fresh lemon verbena leaves, cut into ribbons (NOT dried!)

Directions:
Place the salad ingredients on a lettuce-lined platter and drizzle with the dressing.
Garnish with the lemon verbena leaves.
Tip: do not garnish the salad with the verbena leaves until just before serving. Cut lemon verbena leaves wilt very quickly. Keep cut verbena leaves fresh by placing them in a bowl of water until ready to garnish.
