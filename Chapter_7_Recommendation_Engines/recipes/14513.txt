Ingredients:
2 cups plain yogurt
3 tablespoons garam masala
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
6  pita breads

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat.
In a large bowl, mix yogurt and tandoori spice. Reserve 1/2 cup for basting. Add chicken to remaining sauce, and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Brush oil over grate to prevent sticking, and place chicken on the grill.  Cook chicken for 5 to 6 minutes per side, basting with reserved yogurt marinade frequently. Serve hot.
