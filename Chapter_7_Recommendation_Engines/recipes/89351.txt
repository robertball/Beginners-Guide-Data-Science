Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons baking soda
1 3/4 cups white sugar
3 eggs
3/4 cup maraschino cherries, drained and halved
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup butter, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch Bundt pan.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking power, baking soda, sugar, eggs, cherries, pineapple and walnuts. Stir by hand with a sturdy spoon just until blended. Spoon into the prepared pan, and spread evenly.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. Cool, then invert onto a serving plate. While the cake cools, mix together the butter, confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Stir in the cream cheese, and beat until smooth. Frost cake with the icing when completely cool.

Description: 
This is a recipe I made up in 1979. I wanted to make something quick and easy. Took me quite a few tries before it turned out though. I entered it in the county fair and took first place plus the gold ribbon which entitled me to enter the State Fair. So I entered the State Fair and came in second. I was told that if I had told the judges it was an original recipe, I would have taken first place. This was the very first time I had ever entered anything like this before, for both fairs and I guess you could say I was wet behind the ears. Oh well, I sure did have fun.
