Ingredients:
1 Cup butter
1 Cup granulated Sugar
1 Cup blanched almonds chopped and divided
1/2 lb. melting milk chocolate

Directions:
Grease 2 large baking sheets. Melt chocolate in double boiler.
Heat heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat until hot. Water will skitter across bottom when it's ready. Melt butter and add sugar, stirring until dissolved,	and continue cooking until light brown. Keep stirring until candy peels away from the sides (approximately 10 minutes).  Quickly pour onto baking sheet. Cool slightly.
Smooth 1/2 of melting chocolate over candy and sprinkle 1/2 of ground almonds over top. Place 2nd baking sheet over the 1st and flip candy over.
Spread other half of chocolate over candy and sprinkle remaining nuts. Let stand overnight or at least until well cooled and hardened before breaking into pieces.
