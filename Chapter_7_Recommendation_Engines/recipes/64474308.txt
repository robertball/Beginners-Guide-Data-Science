Ingredients:
1 lb Ground beef
1 Small onion, chopped
2 clove garlic, minced
1t Sea salt
1t black pepper
1 can enchilada sauce (or you can make your own)
1 Medium head of cabbage
2-4 Avocados

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large stock pot bring several cups of water to a boil (enough to leave room for the head of cabbage).
Remove core from the cabbage and carefully submerge the cabbage in the boiling water. Turn off the heat and let the cabbage leaves soften (you'll need 10-12 leaves)
Brown ground beef with seasoning in a skillet. Remove from heat and let cool.
Remove softened cabbage leaves carefully.
Take one cabbage leaf and place 1/3c to 1/4c of meat mixture in the middle, roll the leaf carefully not to tear it, like a burrito.
Place rolls in a glass baking dish.
Cover with enchilada sauce.
Bake for 20 minutes.
