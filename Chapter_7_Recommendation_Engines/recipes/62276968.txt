Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves - chopped (approx. 2 cups)
1 package (4 links) Adele's Andouille sausage thinly sliced
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons minced garlic
10 cups (80 oz.) low sodium chicken broth
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
6 stalks celery, diced
4 roma (plum) tomatoes, diced
1 sweet onion, diced
1 (10 ounce) can Original Rotel
1 jalepeno, seeded, deveined, minced
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
1/4 cup McCormick's Cajun seasoning
1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
Prepared white rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat, and cook chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear. Stir in sausage, and cook until evenly browned. Set aside.
In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, melt butter and blend flour to create a roux. Stir constantly until browned (a little darker than peanut butter but don't burn it, if you see black specks start over) and bubbly (can take up to 1/2 hour, be patient). Mix in garlic, and cook about 1 minute.
Gradually stir chicken broth and beer into the roux mixture. Bring to a boil, and mix in celery, tomatoes, sweet onion, Rotel, jalepeno, parsley, and Cajun seasoning. Reduce heat, and simmer about 40 minutes, stirring often.
Mix chicken, sausage, and shrimp into the broth mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, about 20 minutes.
To serve:  Scoop a cup of rice into a bowl and ladle Gumbo over the top.

Description: 
Loved the original Bourdreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo but every recipe in my kitchen gets customized!  Switched out olive oil for unsalted butter, a little less chicken broth, a little more meat, etc.  Try it, you'll like it, but watch out, this recipe makes a TON!Modified from: Boudreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo
