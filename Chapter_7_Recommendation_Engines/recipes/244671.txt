Description: 
Remember those days when your mom made you your favorite lunch sandwich that incorporated peanut butter and marshmallow? Well, it's still pretty darn good, but change it up and have it as your shake. This is a VERY tasty treat. I also like to mix it up by using different flavors of ice cream (such as chocolate, or peanut ripple, etc.). Hope you enjoy!
