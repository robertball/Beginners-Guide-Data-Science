Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package 10-inch pie crusts
1 (28 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups brown sugar
4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 1/2 teaspoons maple-flavored extract
1 teaspoon rum-flavored extract
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups maple syrup
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 1/4 cups evaporated milk
6 large eggs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 deep-dish pie plates with crusts.
Mix pumpkin puree, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, maple extract, rum extract, and salt together in a large bowl until well blended. Stir in maple syrup. Sprinkle flour over mixture. Pour in evaporated milk and stir to fully blend.
Whisk eggs together in a medium bowl for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk eggs thoroughly into the pumpkin mixture, but do not beat. Pour pie filling into the crusts.
Bake in the center of the preheated oven until centers appear set and no longer jiggle, 60 to 70 minutes. Allow to cool thoroughly before serving.

Delicious and rich perfect ending to any fall feast. This recipe makes two 10-inch deep dish pies or three 9-inch pies that are just oh so yummy. When baking, they make your house smell like Thanksgiving's on its way for sure and the taste will definitely hit the spot for those pumpkin pie lovers around the table. Serve with your favorite toppings like whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or candied pecans, or if you're like me, plain and simple: a piece of pie and a fork.
