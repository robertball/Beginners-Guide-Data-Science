Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup melted butter
Fruit Layer:
2 eggs
1/3 cup milk
2 cups diced rhubarb
2 cups diced strawberries
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir 1 cup flour, brown sugar, oats, and melted butter together in a bowl. Press 1/2 to 3/4 of the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch square baking dish.
Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl until smooth. Stir rhubarb, strawberries, white sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and allspice into the egg mixture until the flour and sugar dissolve completely; pour over the crust. Sprinkle remaining crust mixture over the top of the fruit layer.
Bake in preheated oven until the filling is set, 45 to 60 minutes.

My Grandma's rhubarb crisp recipe which we have been using for years, but tweaked to make it a strawberry-rhubarb crisp! Is especially good warmed with one scoop of vanilla ice cream! Yummy!
