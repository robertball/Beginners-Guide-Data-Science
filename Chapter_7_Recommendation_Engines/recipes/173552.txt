Ingredients:
2 cups water
3/4 cup white sugar
1 sprig rosemary, leaves stripped and chopped
2 cups lemon juice
12 cups cubed seeded watermelon
8 cups ice cubes

Directions:
Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in the rosemary, and set aside to steep for 1 hour.
Place half of the lemon juice, and half of the watermelon into a blender. Strain the rosemary syrup through a mesh strainer into the blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Strain into a pitcher, then puree the remaining lemon juice and watermelon. Stir the lemonade before serving over ice.

Description: 
This is a recipe I created in an effort to duplicate my favorite lemonade from a cafe in downtown L.A. called, well, 'Lemonade'. I don't like it too sweet, so if you want to add more sugar, cool. But I think that this recipe is perfect. It also makes a great martini served in a sugar-rimmed glass with a garnish of watermelon wedge and a twist of lemon! Simply fabulous!
