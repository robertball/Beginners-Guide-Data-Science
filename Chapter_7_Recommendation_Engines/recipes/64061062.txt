Ingredients:
4 country ribs, about 3 pounds
Kosher salt
Vegetable oil
barbecue sauce, your choice of flavor but sweet-spicy works best.

Directions:
Slice ribs in half so each piece is about 6 inches long, they'll be easier to handle. Coat the ribs in oil and then salt them well, useing more salt than you think you should.
To cook the ribs, slow-roast them in a gas grill (covered) with half the burners turned off (put them on the side that is not over direct flame). Let the ribs cook untouched for 90 minutes. At the 90-minute mark, turn them and paint them with your barbecue sauce.
Every 30 minutes or so, turn ribs and paint them again with the sauce. At the 3 hour mark, or when the meat begins to fall apart – you’ll notice this when you turn the rib – you’re ready for the final step.  Paint the ribs one more time and then move them to the hot side of the grill.
You really, really want to slow-cook the ribs because they are pretty fatty. The slower you cook them, the more fat renders out and the smoother your ribs will be. Take your time.
