2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil

Salt to taste
1/2 lb of Rigatoni pasta, cooked according to directions

Add everything except the tomatoes and cook until aromatics are translucent.
Add the tomatoes, a generous pinch of salt and turn the heat to low and cover.
Cook the sauce 1-2 hours over low heat, stirring every 15 minutes to prevent burning.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees f when the sauce has 15 minutes left of cooking.
Mix finished sauce, 1 cup of Sargento's Six Cheese Italian Blend, and cooked pasta together in a large bowl.
Pour half of the mixture into an oven safe dish and top with 1/2 cup of the Sargento's Six Cheese Italian Blend.
Pour the other half of the mixture and top with the remaining cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes, or until cheese on top is completely melted and just starting to turn brown.
