Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds octopus
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon mixed spice
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup red wine
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 (8 ounce) can peas, drained
2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
10 whole pitted ripe olives
4 bay leaves
1 teaspoon white sugar

Directions:
Place the octopus into a large pot and fill with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and then simmer over medium heat until octopus is opaque, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly; cut into bite-size pieces.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, mint leaves, curry powder and mixed spice; cook and stir until onion is soft. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix in the octopus pieces, wine, lemon zest and orange zest. Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes to blend the flavors, then stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, peas, potatoes, olives and bay leaves. Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes and octopus are tender, about 45 minutes.
