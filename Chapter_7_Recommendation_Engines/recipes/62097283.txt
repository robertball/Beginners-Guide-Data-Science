Ingredients:
1 large stalk broccoli OR 1 medium head cauliflower OR 2 - 3 medium russet potatoes
1/4 C. butter or margarine
2/3 C. chopped onion
2 T. flour
2 C. chicken broth
1 12 oz. can evaporated milk (or more to taste, up to 2 C.)
1/2 tsp. Worchestershire sauce
3/4 tsp. salt (to taste)
1 C. Velveeta or American processed cheese

Directions:
Chop and cook vegetable in boiling salted water until soft.  Drain, reserving liquid!  In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium high heat.  Cook onions until soft.  Add flour and stir to break up lumps.  Cook briefly to season flour.  Add chicken broth slowly, stirring to break up lumps.  Stir constantly until mixture comes to a boil.  Stir in 1 C. reserved vegetable liquid (add water if necessary to make 1 C.), evaporated milk, and Worchestershire sauce.  Reduce heat to low and add cooked vegetables.  Break cheese into smaller chunks and add to soup, stirring constantly to avoid sticking and burning.  Taste and add salt if necessary before serving.
