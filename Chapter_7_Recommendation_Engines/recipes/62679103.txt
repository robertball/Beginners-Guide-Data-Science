Ingredients:
6 eggs
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
4 slices cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a bowl, beat eggs and seasonings.
Melt butter in a large skillet. Add egg mixture and cook over medium heat.
As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.
Place cheese over half of the eggs. Fold in half and transfer to a warm platter. Put a lid on the platter to melt cheese, or microwave for 30 seconds.
