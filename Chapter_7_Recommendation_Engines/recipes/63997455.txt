Ingredients:
1 (15-oz) can chickpeas (or 1.5 cups cooked chickpeas)
1/2 cup chopped celery
2 tbsp chopped red onion
3 tbsp chopped dill pickle (~1 pickle)
1 tbsp minced fresh dill
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 tsp regular mustard
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup toasted sunflower seeds (or pecans/walnuts)
salt/herbamare and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325F and toast the sunflower seeds for about 11 minutes.
Mix everything into a bowl, mashing up the chickpeas slightly with a fork, and season with salt (I used Herbamare) and pepper, to taste. Stuff into a wrap or pita, or enjoy with crackers or rice cakes.
