Ingredients:
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 tablespoon prepared horseradish
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (8 ounce) steaks beef tenderloin steaks
salt to taste

Directions:
Stir mustard, horseradish, basil, thyme, tarragon, and black pepper together in a small bowl; spread evenly over one side and around the edges of the steaks. Wrap steaks individually with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 24 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and set a roasting rack into the dish.
Remove steak from plastic wrap; season with salt. Put steaks onto the roasting rack.
Cook the steaks until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).
