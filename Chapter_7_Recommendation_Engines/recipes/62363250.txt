Ingredients:
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon vinegar
3 eggs
1/2 cup flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 pinch salt
2 tablespoons oil
fruit (optional)
whipped cream (optional)
nutella (optional)

Directions:
Add the vinegar to the milk to sour it. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, until it becomes to curdle.
Add the sour milk to all other ingredients.
The batter will be very runny.
Heat a non-stick skillet to medium heat.(not hot enough to smoke.)
Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan. When bubbles form and pop, turn over. Let cook another couple of minutes (peek under to see that it is light brown).
Serve with whipped cream, fruit, sausages, nutella, whatever you choose. It is traditionally eaten with your hands.
