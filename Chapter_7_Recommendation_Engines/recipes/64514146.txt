Ingredients:
1 ham bone with meat
Leftover ham slices (cut in chunks)
2- 14 oz cans of diced tomato
4- chicken bouillon cubes
8- cups of water
1 can of kidney beans (or beans of your choice---rinsed of course)
4 potatoes
1 onion, diced
1 box elbows pasta

Directions:
Dissolve your water and bouillon cubes
Add all ingredients to slow cooker (except pasta)
Ham bone and all!
Set on low 8hrs, or simmer on stovetop until ham is coming off the bone.
If too salty for your taste just add another cup of water.
Cook pasta separately so it doesn't mush up or take broth from your soup. You probably won't use the whole lb.
Enjoy!
