Ingredients:
12  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1 cup soy sauce
1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder

Directions:
To Make Marinade: In a medium bowl combine the oil, lemon-lime beverage, soy sauce and garlic powder. Stir thoroughly until you have a good mixture.
Put chicken and marinate together in a plastic container and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 18 hours (6 to 9 hours if using skinless, boneless chicken breasts) before barbequing.
Barbeque slowly - don't overcook. Turn frequently, basting with marinade with each turn. Cook until meat is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear. Discard any remaining marinade after use.

Description: 
This chicken is marinated for 12 to 18 hours, then cooked on a grill. It is so tender and flavorful, you won't want to stop at just one piece! The marinade is easy to double if you need to make more! Note: This recipe calls for chicken breasts, but you can use any chicken parts you like. If you're using skinless, boneless chicken breasts as per this recipe, cut marinating time in half (6 to 9 hours)!
