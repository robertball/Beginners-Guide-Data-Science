Ingredients:
12 lb Conecuh Hickory Smoked Sausage (baby links), cut in 1/4-1/2" pieces
20 lb boneless skinless Chicken Thighs, 1" chunks
12 Onion, chopped
3 stalks Celery, chopped
6 Green Bell Peppers, chopped
1/2 cup minced Garlic
12 qts Chicken Stock
6 qts Rice
2 Tbs Salt
1 teasp Cayenne Pepper (or to taste)
1 teasp Paprika (or to taste)

Directions:
In the Jethro (80 qt) pot over medium high heat, brown the sausage to render fat and develop flavor.  When done, remove most of the sausage from the pot and add chicken to the pot and cook till almost done, but still juicy.  Remove all the meat from the pot.
Add enough oil to saute the vegetables (onion, celery, peppers and garlic)  till soft, not brown.  Add the meat back to the pot and mix thoroughly.
Add stock, rice, and half of the seasonings and mix again.  Raise heat to high, stirring occasionally, until until the stock begins to boil then reduce heat to a simmer and stir occasionally, till the rice absorbs the stock and the Jambalaya is still moist.
Taste for seasonings and adjust as needed.

Description: 
Billy says this is the 1978 world champion jambalaya recipe.  At our church it has won the Men's Ministry Soup-er Bowl Chili contest.  Yes, it's that good.  I'm convinced there are two keys to the good flavor of this dish and both have to due with the sausage. 1- always use Conecuh brand Hickory Smoked Sausage, 2- saute the sausage long and on a relatively high heat to develop plenty of carmelization and render the fat which flavors other ingredients.
