Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 lb ground turkey
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp pepper
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp dried oregano
¼ tsp cinnamon
1 cup diced red onion
3 3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 cup diced carrots
14 oz chopped whole tomatoes with juice
½ chipotle pepper in adobo, seeded and chopped, with 1/2 tsp. adobo sauce
3 cups water
1 tbsp cocoa powder
30 oz pinto beans (2 cans), drained and rinsed
½ cup chopped cilantro leaves + extra for garnish
1 pinch grated bittersweet chocolate
3 thinly sliced scallions, for serving
½ cup 1/2 cup non-fat sour cream, for serving

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add in the ground turkey, season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 3-4 minutes.
Add the chili powder, cumin, oregano, and cinnamon and continue cooking for 3-4 minutes until all the water evaporates from the turkey and it's sizzling.
Stir in the onion and garlic, cover, and cook until the onion has softened, about 7 minutes.
Add the carrots, tomatoes, chipotle pepper, water, and cocoa powder. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. Stir in the beans and cilantro and continue cooking for 15 more minutes.
Ladle into bowls, top with sour cream, grated chocolate, cilantro, and sliced scallions.
Serve and enjoy!!
