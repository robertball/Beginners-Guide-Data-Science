Description: 
I use a box dicing instrument that is marketed for chopping onions. Makes the job much easier and faster! But if you have good knife skills and patiece give it a go. Taste even better the next day after stored in the refrigerator. Good on torilla chips, eggs, potatoes, rice and a lot more.
