Ingredients:
32 ounce beef broth
1 can cream of celery
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 tablespoon butter
3 cans great northern beans
1 cup chopped ham with fat (leftovers work great)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon seasoning blend
1 tablespoon flour* (optional for thicker soup)

Directions:
Pour beef broth into pot and whisk in cream of celery. (If you plan on making a thicker soup, you should reserve a cup of broth for the roux.) Don't worry about lumps because it will smooth out when its cooked.
Meanwhile, place onions, ham, and butter into frying pan.  Cook on medium to med-high until onions and fat cook down.
*If you are looking for a thicker soup, go ahead and add the flour now, mixing into the ham and onion mixture.  Slowly add reserved broth whisking out the lumps until fairly smooth and thickened.
Pour into pot with broth mixture. Mix in beans and seasonings. Heat on med-high until bubbly, stirring occasionally  or let sit in the slow cooker for a few hours. Let cool and enjoy!

Description: 
As I was trying to figure out what to do with some leftover ham I had slow cooked, I decided to throw in whatever sounded good into a pot with minimal ingredients I had on hand.  It turned out so delicious! Everyone that tries it LOVES it, including picky, non-soup eating husbands, lol. You can boil it in a pot or throw it into a crock pot for several hours until nice and hot.
