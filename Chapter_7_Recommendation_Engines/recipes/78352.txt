Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, torn into small pieces
1 tablespoon rubbed sage, or to taste
2 egg whites, beaten
1/2 cup frozen cranberries, chopped
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup chopped almonds (optional)
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook celery in butter until almost tender. Add onions, and cook until lightly browned and tender. Set aside.
Place the pieces of bread into a large glass or ceramic bowl, and sprinkle liberally with rubbed sage. Heat bread in the microwave for 2 minutes, then heat for 10 seconds at a time until bread is crispy. Remove from the microwave, and add the egg whites, cranberries, walnuts, almonds and pecans toss lightly to distribute. Add the onion and celery with the butter, and toss lightly while moistening to your desired consistency with chicken broth.
Use this to stuff a turkey, or transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
