Ingredients:
1/4 teaspoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon honey
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1/3 teaspoon packed brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon sea salt, plus more for garnish
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for garnish
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Heat 1/4 teaspoon olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Saute garlic in hot oil until just beginning to brown.
Mix sauteed garlic, soy sauce, lemon juice, honey, 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, brown sugar, sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour into a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon fillets, turning to coat with the marinade, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Remove salmon from the marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Reserve 3 tablespoons marinade and discard remainder.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Arrange salmon fillets in the hot skillet, pour reserved marinade over the salmon, and place a lid on the skillet; cook until salmon is browned on each side and flakes easily with a fork, occasionally spooning liquid from the pan over the fillets, 2 to 3 minutes per side.  Garnish salmon with additional sea salt and black pepper.
