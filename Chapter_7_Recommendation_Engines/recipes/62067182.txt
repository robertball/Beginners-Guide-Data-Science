Ingredients:
Thick white sauce[2T butter, 2T flour, 1 C milk]
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 tsp garlic powder
1/8 – 1/4 tsp salt [or to taste]
1/8 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp pepper [or to taste]
½ tsp paprika
4 oz shredded Monterey jack cheese[Jalepeño or pepper jack is excellent]
4 oz shredded Swiss cheese
8 oz shredded cheddar cheese
¼ cup finely chopped red bell pepper sautéed with
2 Tbsp grated onion in ½ Tbsp olive oil in a separate pan
4 oz pkg frozen baby shrimp[thawed]
8 oz pkg frozen imitation crab[thawed, shredded and chopped]
1 hearty pinch of old bay seasoning

Directions:
Prepare white sauce with 2 T. butter melted in a heavy skillet on low heat, adding 2 T. flour and stirring with a fork til thick paste.  Add 1 c. milk, a half at a time stirring constantly til creamy consistency is acheived. When thickened, add wine in 4 parts stirring well after each addition til bubbly and smooth.  Add garlic powder, salt, nutmeg, pepper, paprika and simmer a few minutes, stirring well.(If you stopped right here, you’d have an awesome sauce to serve over pasta!  Taste it!)  While still hot, stir in cheeses until smooth.  Add peppers and onions, baby shrimp and imitation crab with a hearty pinch of old bay or crab boil seasoning and heat through on low, stirring constantly.  Serve in hollowed-out bread loaf with the removed part cut in chunks for dipping.  I make an onion soup mix bread in my bread machine that’s awesome.  Serve hot and watch the crowd go wild!

Description: 
I designed this recipe after enjoying a hot dip at a seafood chain restaurant, only I think mine is much better!  (And a heck of lot more economical)  Cheese-lovin, seafarers are in luck!  You can use the expensive ingredients like lobster, crab and scallops if you like for those special occasions, but simple salad shrimp and imitation crab are just as yummy!
