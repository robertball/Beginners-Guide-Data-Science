Ingredients:
2 fresh poblano chile peppers
2 serrano chile peppers
6 fresh tomatillos, husks removed
1 1/2-inch slice of white onion
2 cloves garlic
salt to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Lay the poblano peppers, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot grill, and cook, turning every 2 minutes, until the pepper skins are evenly charred and blackened, and the tomatillos have turned pale yellow and started to ooze juice, about 10 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the grill.
Scrape off most of the burned pepper skin, cut the stems off, cut the peppers in half the long way, and remove the seeds.
Place the onion and garlic in the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse about 4 times to chop. Drop in the peppers, pulse 4 times to roughly chop, and add the tomatillos and salt. Pulse 4 or more times to the desired smoothness, and stir in the cilantro.

Description: 
Roasted-pepper green salsa just like grandma makes it, well, minus the molcajete. It's just easier to make in a food processor. The heat of your salsa can be controlled by the amount of seeds and membrane you leave in the pepper pods.
