Ingredients:
6 ounces rotini pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup chopped scallion greens
1 clove garlic, crushed
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 Red Delicious apple, diced
1/2 cup white seedless grapes, halved
1/3 cup raisins
1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®)
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1 1/2 cups fat-free vanilla yogurt
2 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain pasta and place in a large bowl.
While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add scallion greens and garlic; saute for 1 minutes. Add chicken, salt, and pepper; cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Add chicken to the bowl with the pasta. Mix in apple, grapes raisins, sweetened dried cranberries, and almonds.
Combine yogurt and curry powder in a small bowl; pour over pasta mixture and toss to combine.

Description: 
Yogurt makes for a less fattening salad dressing while fruit adds a touch of sweetness. Great for a cool summer lunch, or leave out the chicken for a vegetarian side dish.
