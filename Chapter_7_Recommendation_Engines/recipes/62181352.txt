Ingredients:
1 rotisserie chicken or two cups shredded chicken
1/2 cup diced green chiles
8 oz. sour cream OR
8 oz. plain yogurt (see note below)
1 large tomato (diced)
1/2 cup diced onion
1 10 oz. can Rotel tomatoes (optional)
16 oz. Mexican 4-cheese blend (w/o seasonings)OR
16 oz. shredded sharp cheddar
1 box manicotti shells
3 cups chunky salsa

Directions:
Prepare the shells according to package directions.
Remove the meat from chicken and shred.  You should have about 2 cups of meat.
Combine all ingredients, except the shells and salsa, in a large bowl and fold gently.
Stuff the shells with the chicken mixture.
Spread 1 cup of salsa in the bottom of a large baking dish.
Place the stuffed shells on the salsa and top with the remaining salsa.
Cover and bake @ 350&#0176; for 20 minutes.  Remove cover and sprinkle remaining cheese over the top.
Return to oven uncovered and bake an additional 10-15 minutes until the shells are thoroughly heated and the cheese has melted.
NOTE:  To use plain yogurt in place of sour cream, drain the yogurt through a coffee filter placed in a large strainer.  It will improve the consistancy of the yogurt.
