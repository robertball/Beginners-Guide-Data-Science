Ingredients:
2 teaspoons margarine
2 slices white bread
1 ½ tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Spread 1 teaspoon of margarine onto one side of each slice of bread. Put the margarine sides together. This is to keep from getting margarine on your hands when spreading peanut butter. Spread peanut butter over one slice of bread, and sprinkle chocolate chips onto the peanut butter. Remove the other slice of bread from the back of the peanut butter slice, and place margarine side out over the peanut butter and chocolate chips.
Place a skillet over medium heat. Fry sandwich until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool slightly before cutting in half.

Description: 
A grilled peanut butter and chocolate sandwich. We used to make these camping in a pie iron over a campfire. It was one of our favorites. Modified it for home.
