Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package ButterballÂ® Smoked Turkey Dinner Sausage, halved lengthwise, and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
1 cup diced green onions, white and green parts
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
10 large eggs, slightly beaten
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
16 torn fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Fresh basil leaves (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook and stir sausage and onions in oil in heavy oven-proof 10-inch skillet on medium heat 5 minutes or until light golden brown.
Combine remaining ingredients in medium bowl. Stir egg mixture into skillet mixture. Cook on medium heat, lifting with a rubber spatula once or twice, to allow uncooked portion to flow underneath. Cook just until egg mixture begins to set, about 6 minutes.
Place skillet in oven. Bake 5 to 7 minutes or until egg mixture is firm to the touch and top is golden brown.
Remove skillet from oven. Carefully run a spatula around edge of frittata to loosen from skillet. Invert skillet onto serving platter. Cut frittata into quarters. Garnish each portion with Parmesan cheese and basil, if desired.
