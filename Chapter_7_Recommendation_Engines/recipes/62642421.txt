Ingredients:
6-8 chicken thighs
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup prepared mustard

1 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken pieces in a shallow baking pan, skin side up. Combine the melted butter or margarine, honey, mustard, salt and curry powder and pour the mixture over the chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/4 hours (75 minutes), basting every 15 minutes with pan drippings, until the chicken is nicely browned and tender and the juices run clear.
