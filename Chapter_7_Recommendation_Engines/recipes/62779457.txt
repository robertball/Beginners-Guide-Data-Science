Ingredients:
2 cups frozen corn
1/2 cup water
1 ripe avocado, diced
1 large tomato, diced
2 green onions, sliced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
1 clove garlic, smashed
1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen corn and water, season with salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer about 7 minutes, until corn is tender. Drain and set aside to cool.
Meanwhile, make the dressing. Whisk together the olive oil, lime juice, garlic, dijon, salt and pepper. Let the garlic hang out in the dressing until ready to use.
After the corn is cooled, toss together the corn, tomato, avocado, green onions and cilantro. Pour in dressing and toss again. Chill until ready to serve.
