Ingredients:
1 (18 ounce)  chocolate cake mix
1 (16 ounce) carton sour cream, I have used light, but not fat free
3 eggs
1 bag of miniature peanut butter cups, unwrapped and each cut in half
1/2 cup milk chocolate chips
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. If you're using a bundt pan that is dark /black, preheat oven to 325 degrees. Grease and flour and Bundt cake pan; set aside.
Do not use the cake mix directions.
In a large bowl, beat together the cake mix, sour cream and eggs until smooth.
Pour HALF of the batter into the prepared Bundt cake pan.
Evenly spread all of the halved pieces of mini peanut butter cups over the batter reserving about 20 halves for garnish on top.
Evenly top with remaining batter.
Bake at 350 degrees for about 50-60 minutes (or 325 for dark pans) or until toothpick tests done.
Allow to cool for 10 minutes and turn upside down and release the cake. Cool completely.
After completely cooled, place the choc chips and peanut butter in a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl. Melt over low heat stirring constantly (or microwave in bowl) until melted and smooth.
Drizzle over the cooled cake. When icing is cooled, garnish with the remaing peanut butter cup halves.
