Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons fruit preserves, any flavor

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together peanut butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Use a fork to make a criss-cross pattern on the top. Make a small hole in the top of each cookie using the handle of a wooden spoon. Fill the holes with preserves.
Bake for 8 to 11 minutes in preheated oven. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
