Description: 
This is my favorite cookie recipe; dense, moist and chewy! You can change it up with your choice of morsels, any kind of nuts, cranberries or other dried fruit...but this combo is my all-time most-requested and is great with espresso! Use high-quality and fresh ingredients for the best results. While this goes together quickly, the prep time below includes the required chilling time of the dough.
