Ingredients:
Lamb Skewers:
8 6-inch rosemary sprigs
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup sherry vinegar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 1/2 pounds lamb tenderloin, cut into 2-inch pieces
Salsa Verde:
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup Greek yogurt
1 crushed garlic clove
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
2 teaspoons chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano
1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon small capers
1 anchovy filet

Directions:
Soak the rosemary skewers in water for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, whisk together the garlic, thyme, olive oil, sherry vinegar, salt, and pepper in a glass bowl.  Toss the lamb pieces in the marinade, and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  After the lamb has marinated, thread onto the rosemary sprigs.
While the lamb is marinating, prepare the salsa verde by placing the lemon juice, olive oil, yogurt, garlic, salt, mint, oregano, parsley, capers, and anchovy filet into the bowl of a blender.  Blend until smooth, then pour into a serving dish and set aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
Cook the lamb skewers, turning occasionally, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes.  Serve with salsa verde.
