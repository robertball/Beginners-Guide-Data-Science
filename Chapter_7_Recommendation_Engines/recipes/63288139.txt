Ingredients:
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups all purpose flour
12 ounces semi sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Soften butter in the microwave.  I microwave each stick of butter 15 seconds then rotate 180 degrees and microwave for another 15 seconds.
Place sugars, butter, eggs, and vanilla in mixer bowl.  Mix until just mixed.
Sift together baking soda, salt and flour.
Gradually add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture over about 2-4 minutes.
Add chocolate chips, mix for 30 seconds.
Drop by rounded teaspoon on to greased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart.  Bake for 8-10 minutes, longer if you prefer crunchy cookies.
Let the cookies rest for 1 minute after removing from oven, then remove them and cool on wire racks.  Allow the bakign sheets to cool about 2 minutes before using them for the next batch.
