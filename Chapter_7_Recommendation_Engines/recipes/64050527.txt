Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs, beaten
1/3 C applesauce
1 t vanilla extract
16 ounces strawberries, halved and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease and flour two 9x5 inch loaf pans or 4 mini-loaf pans.
Sift together in a large bowl the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and baking soda. Mix and set aside.
In a medium bowl, combine oil, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla.  Add strawberries to oil/egg mixture and mix well.
Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the strawberry mixture.  Mix gently until just combined.
Spoon batter equally into prepared pans and spread evenly.
Bake large loaves in preheated oven for one hour, small loaves 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.  Cool slightly before removing from pans.

Description: 
After 22 years of having a very similar recipe to this one, I finally made it.  The recipe I found and tweaked gave me the amounts for missing ingredients and the comments gave the applesauce option to make it more moist.  It's a winner!Modified from: Strawberry Spice Loaf
