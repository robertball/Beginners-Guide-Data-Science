Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey sausage
4 eggs, lightly beaten
4 green onions, finely chopped
1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place turkey sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Place the hash brown potatoes in the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking pan.
In a bowl, stir together eggs, green onions and milk. Pour over the potatoes.
Layer with half the cheese, the sausage mixture, and the remaining cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove cover; return casserole to the oven and bake until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
