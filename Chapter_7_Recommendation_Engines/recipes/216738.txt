Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/4 large red onion, chopped
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup milk
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 1/2 cups tomato juice
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon granular no-calorie sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, bell pepper, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the blue cheese, cream cheese, heavy cream, and milk. Heat until the cheese is melted and the mixture is simmering, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato juice, basil, sweetener, and pepper. Continue to cook and stir until the soup is heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.
