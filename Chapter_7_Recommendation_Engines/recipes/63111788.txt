Description: 
Sometimes you have a sweet tooth to fulfill, but you don't want to be left with a half eaten batch of cupcakes, a stomach ache, and a guilty conscience. This recipe has just a subtle hint of coffee. I used prepackaged cream cheese frosting and mixed some instant coffee into it for a matching coffee flavored frosting. So use whatever you like to top your cupcake!
