Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1 cup applesauce
4 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 7 1/2 x 3 1/2-inch loaf pans.
In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, soda, salt, baking powder, sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. Stir well. Add applesauce, eggs, pumpkin, and water. Mix batter until well combined. Stir in nuts. Pour batter into prepared pans.
Bake until tester inserted in the center of each loaf comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
This is recipe that I modified several years ago to lower the calories and fat. Also, by using 3 medium loaf pans instead of one regular loaf pan, the bread is eaten before it dries out. I freeze the other two loaves.
