Ingredients:
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup sliced raw almonds
1/2 cup sunflower seed kernels
1/2 cup flax seeds
6 tablespoons pure maple syrup
6 tablespoons honey
1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
2 tablespoons warm water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a jelly roll pan with baking parchment.
Mix oats, almonds, sunflower seed kernels, and flax seeds together in a bowl.
Whisk syrup, honey, coconut oil, water, and salt together in a separate small bowl until smooth; pour over oats mixture and stir. Spread the resulting mixture onto the prepared pan in an even layer.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 60 to 90 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely.
Remove granola from pan by lifting parchment paper. Break granola into small pieces and put in a bowl; add raisins and toss by hand to mix. Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
This is great as a snack or for breakfast and also on top of yogurt. You won't be disappointed. Easy to vary the ingredients and substitute other nuts or flaked coconut, etc.  Also makes a great gift at the holidays. Just put in a small mason jar, attach a copy of the recipe, and wrap it up with a fun cereal bowl. My kids' teachers loved to leave the jar on their desk to snack on.
