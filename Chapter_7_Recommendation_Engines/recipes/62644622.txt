Ingredients:
1/3 cup Vegetable Oil
1 cup Turbinado Sugar or brown sugar
2 large Eggs
1/2 cup Applesauce
1 tsp. Vanillia Extract
2 cups Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour
2-1/2 tsp. Baking Powder
2 tsp. ground Cinnamon
1-1/2 tsp. Xanthan Gum
3/4 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. ground cloves
2 cups finely grated zucchini
1/2 cup chopped Pecans or Walnuts
1/4 cup dark Raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ. Grease two 8 x 4-inch nonstick pans. (For smaller loaves, use three or four 5 x 3-inch nonstick loaf pans.
In large bowl, cream oil, sugar, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla together with electric mixer until very smooth. Add flour, baking powder, cinnamon, xanthan gum, salt, and cloves. Mix thoroughly on medium speed until thoroughly combined. Quickly (but gently) stir in zucchini, nuts, and raisins. Batter will be somewhat thick. Turn batter into prepared pans.
Bake 8 x 4-inch loaves for 60-65 minutes; 5 x 3-inch pans for 45 minutes. Place foil over bread during final 20 minutes of baking to reduce over-browning. Cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack. Cool thoroughly before slicing.  Makes 12 slices.
