Ingredients:
1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch cubes. About 3 cups.
1 leek, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced
1/2 t coarse salt
enough water to cover, about 2 cups
1/3 cup milk, warmed
2 T butter

Directions:
Place everything in the Instant Pot® and put the lid on, closed vent.
Press manual and adjust the timer to 10 minutes. It will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure.
Allow the pressure to come down naturally for 10 minutes then manually release the pressure.
Drain well in a colander and return to pot.
Press the low saute button and toss the potatoes until they are completely dry and begin to sizzle, about 3 minutes.
Add the butter to the potato mixture and stir until melted.
Add the milk and stir.
Mash the potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic style or put through a ricer for a smoother mash.
Taste and adjust the salt.
Note: I don't use a traditional potato masher in my Instant Pot® as I don't want to scratch it.
This can easily be doubled, the cooking time does not change.

Description: 
A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes. The leeks add a very mild oniony flavour, enjoy!
