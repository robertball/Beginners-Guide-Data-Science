Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
28 ounces Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce
3 pounds frozen cheese ravioli, thawed
4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef with onion; drain grease.  Pour in spaghetti sauce and simmer 5 minutes.
In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread enough sauce and beef to cover bottom and put a layer of ravioli down end to end.  Spread a layer of sauce and cheese just like you would with regular lasagna.  Keep layering and finish with sauce on top.
Bake uncovered in a preheated oven for 1 hour. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
