Ingredients:
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, chopped
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
6 tablespoons butter
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. Over a double boiler, melt the semi sweet chocolate, the unsweetened chocolate, and the butter; stirring occasionally.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for 6 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the melted chocolate mixture, and mix for 1 more minute. Fold the sifted ingredients into the chocolate mixture with a rubber spatula. Cover the dough and chill for half an hour to an hour.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C ).  Grease cookie sheets.
Drop cookies by heaping tablespoons onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven.  Let cookies cool completely before removing from cookie sheets.
