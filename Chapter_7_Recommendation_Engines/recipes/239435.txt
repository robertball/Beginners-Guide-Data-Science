Description: 
This chile-rubbed pork chop video recipe is a kinder, gentler version of the 'blackened' cooking technique. We start on high heat, but cook the chops on medium, and then finish the cooking by wrapping the chops in foil. This produces a very moist chop, as the meat has time to 'rest' as it finishes cooking.
