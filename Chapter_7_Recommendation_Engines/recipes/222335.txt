Ingredients:
1 pound Italian sausage roll (such as Jimmy Dean®)
1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough (such as Pillsbury®)
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Spread pizza dough evenly onto a 9x13-inch baking sheet; sprinkle with sausage and mozzarella cheese. Roll the dough around the sausage and mozzarella, using the method similar to rolling a cinnamon roll. Crimp the roll closed; place seam side down on baking sheet. Brush the roll with olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
