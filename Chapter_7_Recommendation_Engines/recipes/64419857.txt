Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
4 cup all-purpose flour, divided
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
3 cup raisins
1 tbsp caraway seeds
2 egg, lightly beaten
1 1/4 cup buttermilk
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10 inch round cast iron skillet or a 9 inch round baking or cake pan.
In a mixing bowl, combine flour (reserve 1 tablespoon), sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, raisins, and caraway seeds. In a small bowl, blend eggs, buttermilk, and sour cream. Stir the liquid mixture into the flour mixture just until flour is moistened. Knead dough in bowl about 10 to 12 strokes. Dough will be sticky. Place the dough in the prepared skillet or pan and pat down. Cut a 4 x 3/4 inch deep slit in the top of the bread. Dust with reserved flour.
Bake in preheated oven for 65 to 75 minutes. Let cool and turn bread out onto a wire rack.
