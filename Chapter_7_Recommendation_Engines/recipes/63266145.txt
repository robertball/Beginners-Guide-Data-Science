Ingredients:
8 cups chopped Fuji apples (about 6 apples)
2 tbsp. brown sugar (not packed), divided
1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, divided
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup light vanilla soymilk
1/3 cup sugar-free pancake syrup
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tbsp. light whipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown)

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix apples with 1 tbsp. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Stir to coat apples well. Transfer to the crock pot.
In the empty bowl, combine oats, soymilk, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, syrup, and salt. (All remaining ingredients except butter.) Add 1 cup water and mix well.
Add oat mixture to the crock pot, and gently stir. Cover and cook on high for 3 hours or on low for 7 hours.
Add butter and mix well. (Do NOT forget this step. Stick a Post-it to your timer if you have to!) Serve and enjoy!
