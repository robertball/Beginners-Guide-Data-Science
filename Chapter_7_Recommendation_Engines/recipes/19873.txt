Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can pitted sour cherries
1/4 cup white sugar
1 envelope (1 tablespoon) unflavored gelatin
2 egg yolks
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon red food coloring
2 egg whites
1/4 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
1 (9 inch) graham cracker crust

Directions:
Let cherries sit in juice with 1/4 cup sugar for 2 hours. Drain cherries, reserving juice; pour juice in a small saucepan.
Soften gelatin in the cherry juice for 5 minutes. Mix in egg yolks and salt. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in almond extract, red food color, and cherries. Chill until room temperature, but not set.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Fold into cherry mixture. Fold in whipped cream until no streaks remain. Pour into graham cracker crust. Chill several hours or overnight before serving.
