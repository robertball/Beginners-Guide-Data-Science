Ingredients:
1lb. ground beef
1 small head of cabbage, quartered and sliced
1 large onion, quartered and sliced
1 large carrot, shredded
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 T. Worcestershire sauce
1 T. rice vinegar
1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes with juice
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. brown sugar
1 tsp. paprika
1/2 tsp. celery seed
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
good pinch of red pepper flakes
3/4 C. shredded Colby jack cheese

Directions:
In a large skillet, with a lid, brown the ground beef over medium high heat. Once cooked through, drain the grease and add in the chili powder, brown sugar, paprika, celery seed, salt, pepper and pepper flakes. Stir to combine, add in the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Add the sliced cabbage, onions, carrots, diced tomatoes with juice and garlic. Stir to combine, cover and reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes. Remove the lid and stir in the cheese. I served mine with buttered cornbread.
