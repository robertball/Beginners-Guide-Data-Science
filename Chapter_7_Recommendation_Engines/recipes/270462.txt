Ingredients:
Tzatziki:
1 (32 ounce) container Greek yogurt
1 large cucumber, peeled and finely chopped
1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon white sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon lemon zest
8 leaves fresh mint, finely chopped, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill
Falafel:
2 whole jalapeno peppers
1/2 bunch parsley
1 bunch green onions, root ends removed
4 cloves peeled garlic
3 (16 ounce) cans chickpeas - rinsed, drained, and dried
2 eggs
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon salt, divided
1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/2 tablespoon chile powder
1 cup chickpea flour
1/2 cup olive oil, divided

Directions:
Stir yogurt, cucumber, lemon juice, garlic powder, sugar, lemon zest, mint, and dill together in a bowl. Adjust seasonings to taste and refrigerate tzatziki until ready to serve with falafel.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine jalapeno peppers, parsley, green onions, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped and fully blended. Scrape mixture down and add chickpeas. Pulse several times until just blended and chickpeas are broken up, but texture is still rough; do not overblend. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Add eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, Greek seasoning, cumin, 1/2 tablespoon salt, paprika, pepper, and chili powder to the chickpea mixture. Stir with a spatula until fully incorporated. Add chickpea flour a few tablespoons at a time and stir; the final mixture should be wet, but not falling apart when handled. Place bowl in the freezer, uncovered, to firm up mixture, 10 to 15 minutes.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and brush with some olive oil.
Remove chickpea mixture from freezer and form into 20 to 24 small balls and place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush falafel with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with remaining salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until falafel are dry and slightly darker brown in color, about 45 minutes. Turn on the broiler and continue baking until tops are crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve with tzatziki.
