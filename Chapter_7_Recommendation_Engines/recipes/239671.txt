Description: 
This recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law; it is so good! You can add anything else you want and it only makes it better. I recommend everyone at least give it a try! You can even add some bacon pieces. Serve with fried deer meat. You can use olive oil or vegetable oil instead of the bacon grease, if desired.
