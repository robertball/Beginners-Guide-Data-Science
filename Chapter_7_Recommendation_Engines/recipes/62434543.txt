Ingredients:
1 pound refrigerated gnocchi
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
8 oz pancetta, chopped
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
4 ounces Parmesan cheese, shredded (or 1 tub)
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/4 bag salad spinach leaves
1 tbsp lemon juice

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the gnocci, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside.
Start the sauce immediately so the gnocci will be done first.
Melt the butter in a saute pan over medium heat.
Add the pancetta and saute until a bit browned.
Add the shallots, and cook for a few minutes, until tender.
Drain the fat, leaving any browned bits in the pan.
Stir in the cream and scrape up the browned bits; heat to a strong simmer.
Gradually mix in the Parmesan cheese, but don't let the sauce boil.
Stir until smooth, then remove from the heat immediately so the sauce doesn't clump.
Add the spinach and lemon juice and stir lightly until incorporated.
Place gnocci into serving dishes, and spoon the sauce over them.
