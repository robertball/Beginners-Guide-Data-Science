Ingredients:
1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine
1 liter lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage
1 orange
2 limes
1 cup fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and chopped
1 cup cherries, pitted and halved

Directions:
Slice the fruit up into bite-size pieces and place in a punch bowl. (You may want to slightly crush the citrus fruits to get a little more of the flavor into the punch.)
Pour in the bottle of red wine, and stir in carbonated soda (Pour it in slowly, and taste as you go along - you don't want to over-dilute the wine!)
