Ingredients:
2-3 crisp apples (peeled and thinly sliced)
2T butter (thinly sliced)
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped pecans
2 cups pancake mix (Great Value Complete)
1-1/2 cups water (or whatever your pancake mix suggests for 2 Cups of mix)
1 T vanilla extract
2 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Heat oven to 350. With cast iron skillet or baking dish inside to preheat.
Peel, core, and thinly slice apples.  Place in microvable bowl and heat on high for 3 to 4 minutes or until soft.
Mix separate bowl 2 cups of pancake mix, water, vanilla, and cinnamon. Whisk together.
It's important to do this next step quickly, so the pan is hot when batter is poured in.  This will help the pancake come out cleanly.  You may put pan on stove over medium heat if needed while you are putting this together.  Bring pan out of oven and melt butter.  Spread butter evenly around pan. Sprinkle evenly over the butter the brown sugar and pecans.  Then evenly place apples over the sugar/pecan mixture.  Pour pancake mixture evenly over the apples.
Place in oven and back for 35 to 45 minutes or until knife removes from center cleanly.  Let set 5 minutes.  Either serve from pan or loosen sides place plate over top of pan and turn upside down.  This usually works beautifully from cast iron skillets.  I've had success and failure in other types of cookware.  Slice like pie and serve with warm maple syrup.
