Description: 
This is my own variant of the classic Caesar salad dressing, but without using raw egg so that the dressing keeps longer and doesn't spoil so easily. It's also a bit more piquant than the classic version and uses more cheese (because more cheese is always good). To make it more decorative in the bottle, try adding large sprigs of fresh basil to the dressing after shaking it. Makes a nice gift, and fresh basil tastes better, too.
