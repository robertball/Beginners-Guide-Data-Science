Ingredients:
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 bunch green onions, chopped
8 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tahini
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Place the sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant.
In a medium bowl, mix toasted sesame seeds, green onions, garlic, tahini, soy sauce, white sugar, red wine vinegar, and pepper. Place desired meat in the mixture, cover, and marinate as long as you like, but overnight is best. Grill as desired.

Description: 
This has been the secret recipe in my family for years. All of our guests rave about it! The only downfall is that we always wind up hosting! This works great with chicken and steak. Try some of each.
