Ingredients:
6 poblano chile peppers, stems and seeds removed
3 egg whites, beaten until foamy
1 pinch salt
6 ounces semi-soft Mexican cheese such as Oaxaca*, cut into thick strips
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) jar HERDEZ® Tomatilla Verde Mexican Cooking Sauce
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high.
Place poblanos on baking sheet lined with foil. Broil each side of poblano chiles until skin is blistered and slightly black, turning to char evenly, about 3 to 5 minutes on each side.
Remove from heat and peel off skin that is easily removed, being careful not to split the flesh. Stuff chiles with cheese strips. Mix the salt into the beaten egg whites.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip stuffed chiles in egg whites, coating thoroughly, and place them in a single layer in the hot oil. Cook until browned, making sure to turn each chile at least once during the cooking process. Place cooked chiles on plate lined with paper towels.
Wipe out skillet. Arrange the chiles in one layer in the skillet and gently pour in Herdez Tomatillo Verde cooking sauce and water. Bring to a quick boil over high heat and reduce heat to low. Simmer until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
