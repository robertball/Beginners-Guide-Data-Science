Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups unsifted flour
1 cup rolled oats
1 C chopped Pecans (optional)
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda

1 tsp. cinammon
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup cultured buttermilk

Directions:
In a bowl, mix together flour, bran, chopped pecans,brown sugar, oats, salt and baking soda. Toss apples in and Make a well in the center.
Blend egg, milk and applesauce together; stir in starter. Pour this mixture all at once into the flour well. Stir just to moisten ingredients, with about 12 to 15 full circular strokes that scrape the bottom of the bowl; batter will be a little lumpy.
Grease muffin cups or use paper liners. Fill about 2/3 full. Bake at 375 degrees F for 30 to 35 minutes.
