Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash
Olive oil or Coconut oil
1 pound ground turkey
1 pound turkey sausage (hot or sweet)
1 large zucchini, chopped
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
8 ounces mushrooms, chopped
1 28 ounce can petitie diced tomatoes (and their juices)
Kosher Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3 large eggs, whisked (room temperature)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Poke about 10-12 holes in your spaghetti squash with a long metal skewer then place on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool.
In a large saut√© pan over medium heat add in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil or coconut oil.  Once hot add in ground turkey.  Take the casings off the sausage and add them into the pan.  Break apart the meat with a wooden spoon and cook until the sausage is no longer pink.  This will take about 7-10 minutes.  Remove meat from pan and into a bowl and wipe down the pan with a paper towel.
In the same pan add in another tablespoon of oil over medium heat.  Add in the zucchini and cook for about 2 minutes.  Add in the onion, garlic and mushrooms and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes.  Season with 1 teaspoon of sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground pepper.
Take the cooled ground turkey and sausage and place on a working board and cut up to very small pieces.  Add to the pan with the vegetables along with the diced tomatoes, basil, oregano, parsley and time.  Let cook for 2 minutes then taste for any additional salt or pepper.  Set aside.
Take a 9x10 baking dish and brush with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil or coconut oil.  Slice the cooled spaghetti squash in half the long way and take out the seeds with a spoon.  Using a fork remove the threads and add them into the prepared baking dish.
Pour the meat sauce mixture over the spaghetti squash and use a fork to combine together.  Pour whisked eggs over the top and twirl around to create an even layer over the entire pan.  Bake for 45 minutes, cool, slice and enjoy!

I love my one pot meals especially when they are Paleo Italian dishes!  I am bringing in 2015 with my new Paleo Italian recipes and I hope you love them.  Thank you to Shop Rite in E. Hartford/Manchester, CT for the ingredients to make this delicious recipe.

I created this one because I love comfort Italian food and this has all of my favorite ingredients in one pie. I made this dish in a spring form pan which was great for entertaining - Made it a gourmet dish!  I also use my 9x10 baking dish.
