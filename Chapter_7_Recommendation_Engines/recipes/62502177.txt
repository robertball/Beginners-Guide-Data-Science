Ingredients:
4 large red or russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
1/2 medium red onion, diced into very small pieces
1/3 cup extra light olive oil
1 and 1/2 TBSP white vinegar
1 TBSP white sugar
Salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Put potatoes in saucepan; fill with water until potatoes are covered. Sprinkle a teaspoon of salt into pot and cover pot with lid. When water boils, remove lid and let potatoes simmer until soft.
For dressing:  In meantime, mix oil, onions, vinegar, sugar, and salt and pepper in small bowl. Onions should become  pink in color. Let marinate for at least 15-20 minutes, mixing occasionally.
When potatoes are soft, drain and mash while hot. Immediately add dressing and mix. Add extra sugar or vinegar as needed for your own personal taste.
