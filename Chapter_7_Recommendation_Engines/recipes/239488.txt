Ingredients:
2 pounds beef stew meat, trimmed and cut into 1-inch cubes
1 cube beef bouillon
1 1/3 cups hot chicken broth
2 large onions, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon Greek seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 (8 ounce) package shredded cabbage
5 stalks celery, sliced
1 (8 ounce) can whole plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
salt to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir beef in a large saucepan or Dutch oven until browned, about 5 minutes; drain excess grease.
Stir beef bouillon into chicken broth in a bowl until dissolved; add to beef.
Mix onions, Greek seasoning, black pepper, and bay leaves into broth-beef mixture; cover saucepan and simmer until beef is tender, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Add cabbage and celery to broth-beef mixture; cover saucepan and simmer until celery is tender, about 30 minutes more.
Stir plum tomatoes, tomato sauce, and salt into broth-beef mixture and simmer, uncovered, until stew is slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves before serving.
