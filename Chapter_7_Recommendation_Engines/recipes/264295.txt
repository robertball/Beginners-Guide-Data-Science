Ingredients:
4 (8 ounce) center-cut pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
For the Sauce:
2 tablespoons butter
2 cups thinly sliced onion
1 (8 ounce) package thinly sliced baby bella mushrooms
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 cup bourbon
1 1/2 cups beef broth
1/2 cup heavy cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Season pork chops with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add pork chops; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place browned chops in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Wipe out any residual oil from the pan.
Melt butter in the same pan over medium heat. Add onion, mushrooms, and sugar. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Cover pan and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Uncover pan and stir the mixture, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Continue cooking onions for about 3 minutes more.
Pour bourbon into the onion mixture; cook until mostly evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broth and cream; bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes; pour over the browned chops in the baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the pork reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a updated version of my mom's pork chops with cream of mushroom soup. I don't care for the canned soup due to the high sodium. I use cream, mushrooms, onions and bourbon along with beef stock to make a sauce that is out of this world. I like to serve this with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.
