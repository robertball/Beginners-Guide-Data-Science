Ingredients:
Meatballs:
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 pinches ground cinnamon
2 pinches ground nutmeg
2 pinches dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Gravy:
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1/4 cup sour cream
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained

Directions:
Mix ground beef, ground pork, onion, bread crumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, cinnamon, nutmeg, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until evenly mixed; shape into twelve 2-inch balls.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs in hot oil until browned on all sides and somewhat firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove browned meatballs with a slotted spoon to a slow cooker.
Stir cornstarch into drippings remaining in the skillet; add beef broth. Bring the broth mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir sour cream into the broth mixture until smooth. Add mushrooms and stir. Season the sauce with salt and pepper; pour over meatballs in the slow cooker.
Cook in slow cooker on High for 4 hours.
