Lean and Green Smoky Stuffed Peppers Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 large green or red bell peppers, split in half lengthwise and cleaned of seeds and membranes 2 teaspoons olive oil
14 oz 98 % lean ground chicken or turkey breast
1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped
1 Tbs shallots, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 cup tomato, chopped
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp Italian seasoning
2 ounces low fat smoked cheddar or gouda cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F.
Steam your pepper halves in a steamer for 3-5 minutes (or immerse them in boiling water for the same period of time, former being preferred because they tend to preserve more nutritional content that way). Once done, set aside and let cool.
In a pan heat the olive oil and brown shallots and garlic; add the mushrooms, then add the ground meat. Add your seasonings and continue cooking, stirring the meat, until cooked through. Add the diced tomato to the mix and stir those in, cooking for just a minute longer, until the tomatoes just start to cook. Take off the heat and drain off any liquid.
Line a baking sheet with foil, spray with cooking spray, and put the pepper halves on it. Fill each half with equal amounts of cooked chicken mixture. Sprinkle with cheddar cheese, and spray with cooking spray over the top (to aid in low fat cheese melting).
Bake for 25-30 minutes. Makes 2 servings.
