3 cloves garlic, crushed

Grill the eggplant over an open gas flame or under a broiler.

Once cooked, cool and peel of skin.
Place eggplant pulp in a collander and allow to drain off excess liquid.
Place eggplant pulp in a food processor and process until smooth.
Add all other ingredients and process until blended.
