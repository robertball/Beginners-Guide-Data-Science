https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1/3 C  Straight KY Sour Mash Bourbon (Evan Williams, Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Heaven Hill, etc)
1/3 C  frozen Pineapple Juice Concentrate (undiluted)
1/3 C  Soy Sauce
1/3 C  Apple Cider Vinegar
1/3 C  Water
Crushed Garlic Cloves to taste (1-2 tsp)
Grated Ginger to taste (1-2 tsp) (optional)
2-3 Dashes of Hot Sauce (optional)

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a bowl.
Stir to blend.
Marinate meat in a glass (non-reactive) baking dish.
Cover with plastic wrap & Refrigerate.
Marinating Time:
Beef: 8+ Hrs
Chicken: 24+ Hrs
Pork: 12+ Hrs
Turn meat as needed to insure even marinating.
Meat will take on a "caramel blush".
Discard Used Marinade.
Grill/BBQ as desired.
Great for Boneless Chicken Breasts; Steaks; Chops; Slow Cooked/Smoked Ribs, Brisket, Pork Roast.
Grilling with Hickory, Mesquite, or Apple wood compliments the flavor.
The amount of garlic, pepper sauce, and ginger you use will "punch-up" the flavors.
Using Pineapple Juice Concentrate allows you to control the over-all pineapple juice strength and sweetness.
If you use canned juice, you loose all control.
I like a stronger pineapple juice flavor.
