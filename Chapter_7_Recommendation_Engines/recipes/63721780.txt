Ingredients:
1/2 cup light margarine, melted
1 cup heavy cream
3 cups skim milk
1 (1 pound) loaf stale 100% whole wheat bread, torn into small pieces
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cup Splenda Measure
3/4 cup Splenda Brown Sugar Blend
Pinch of salt
2 Tablespoons vanilla extract
1 cup toasted pecans
1/2 pound unsalted butter
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Mix heavy cream, milk, sugars, eggs, salt, vanilla in bowl mixing well with a wire whip.  Pour mixture over bread in a large mixing bowl; let soak for 10 minutes before gently stirring.
Bake in preheated oven in a water bath until bread mixture is firm and pudding-like, about 50 minutes or until center reaches 200 degrees.
Stir 1/2 pound unsalted butter, heavy cream, and brown sugar together in a heavy saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low,  and simmer until the sugar is dissolved and the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes; pour over bread pudding to serve.
Alternatively  for individual servings you can mix 1/2 Tablespoon of Splenda brown sugar blend, 1 Tablespoon of Heavy Cream and 2 teaspoons light butter and microwave approximately 45 seconds until bubbling and thickened.
