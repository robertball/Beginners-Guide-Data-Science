Ingredients:
⅔ cup peeled, cubed pumpkin
⅔ cup orange juice
1 ½ tablespoons butter
1  onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
1  Thai or Serrano chile, chopped
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground coriander seed
1 ½ cups cooked, diced ham
⅔ cup crunchy peanut butter

Directions:
Place the cubed pumpkin and orange juice in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-low heat. Simmer the pumpkin for 10 to 15 minutes, until it is soft. Carefully transfer to a blender, in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, garlic, chile, turmeric, cumin, nutmeg, and coriander for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the ham, and cook and stir for about 5 minutes, until the ham has started to brown.
Pour the pureed pumpkin mixture into the spicy ham mixture, and stir the peanut butter into the sauce. Mix well to combine, and bring back to a simmer. Serve hot.
