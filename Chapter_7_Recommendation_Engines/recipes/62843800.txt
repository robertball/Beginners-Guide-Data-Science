Growing up, my favorite snack in the world were those delicious Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pies. As an adult, I've avoided buying them, because I know I can easily eat the whole box in no time. Then one day I saw on a blog a picture of these delicious lil homemade cookies, and knew I had to try it. So close to the real thing!
