Description: 
About 3 weeks ago our oven went out.  With a family of 6 I needed to think of a way to cook our meats.  Crockpots were not really an option because they cook all day.  I wanted something to cook in a quick way.  My Husband bought me a rice cooker a couple of years ago and I had already tried grits in it and it worked.  I just figured I would try it with some pork steaks that I had.  This is one of the best recipes I have ever made and it is quick and easy.
