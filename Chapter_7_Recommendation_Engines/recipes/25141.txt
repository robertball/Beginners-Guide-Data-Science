Description: 
Pinto beans slow cooked in beef bouillon, topped with ground beef and Mexican-style cheeses create the centerpiece for these layered corn tortilla treats. Very high in protein and fiber. I prepare the beans before I leave for work, so they will be tender by dinner time. Pick your favorite garnishes and toppings, like salsa, tomatoes and sour cream.
