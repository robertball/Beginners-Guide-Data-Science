Ingredients:
Cake:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons red food coloring
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar
Frosting:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour two 9x2-inch cake pans.
Sift flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
Whisk eggs in a large mixing bowl until yolks are broken. Add oil, buttermilk, sour cream, red food coloring, vanilla extract, and vinegar; mix to combine. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing by hand as little as possible so as not to overbeat. If mixing with an electric mixer, add flour mixture and mix until just incorporated. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before removing cakes from pans to cool completely on a wire rack, 20 to 30 minutes more.
Meanwhile, whip cream cheese in a bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a different bowl.
Sift sugar, flour, and salt together in a medium saucepan. Turn heat to medium-high and whisk in milk and vanilla extract slowly until there are no lumps. Cook until it starts to bubble and becomes thick and pudding-like, 7 to 8 minutes. Pour into a mixing bowl and refrigerate for 10 minutes.
Whisk chilled mixture using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment for 5 minutes. Add whipped cream cheese slowly, whisking until you have a smooth frosting, about 5 minutes more. Use to frost cooled cake.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe after going through tons of recipes and reviews. I like nice solid cakes, and this one is a little on the dense side but it's moist and has good amounts of chocolate and vanilla so that you can taste them but they're not overpowering. It is to-die-for good with frosting that is not too sweet or heavy.
