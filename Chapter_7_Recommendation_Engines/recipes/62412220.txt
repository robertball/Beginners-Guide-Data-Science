Ingredients:
3 Italian sub loafs
3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
salt and pepper to taste
3 teaspoons dried basil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons butter
1/8 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups iceberg lettuce
1 tomato
1 1/2 cups mushrooms
6 slices pepper jack cheese
6 tablespoons spicy ranch dressing

Directions:
Lightly flour both sides of all 3 chicken breasts. Add salt and pepper to taste and a little more than 1/2 a teaspoon of dried basil to the top of each chicken breast. Take one tablespoon of butter and cut it into thirds. Place one tab of butter on top of each chicken breast. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes or until done.
While your chicken breasts are baking, saut√© the mushrooms and garlic over medium heat in 1 tablespoon of butter for about 10 minutes.
Spread approximately 2 tablespoons of spicy ranch dressing inside each sub loaf.
Remove chicken breasts from the oven and cut into strips. Do not turn off your oven. Place chicken breast strips inside sub loafs and top each sandwich with sauteed mushrooms. If you prefer a lot of sauce, you may want to add some more spicy ranch on top of the mushrooms. Add sliced tomatoes and lettuce to each sub. Top each sandwich with 2 slices of pepper jack cheese. Place sandwiches on a cookie sheet and bake them for about 5 minutes until they are warm and the cheese is melted.
Serve warm and enjoy!

This is an absolutely delicious oven-baked sandwich! My favorite restaurant offers a similar item on their menu which became my inspiration for this recipe. Be sure to serve it hot!
