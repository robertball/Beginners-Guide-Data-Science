Description: 
This is the SAUCE for Chinese restaurant style sesame chicken and broccoli. This sauce can be poured over fried chicken, or used as a dipping sauce for fried chicken. I emphasize not using too much vinegar because it turns into a sweet-n-sour type sauce. But you do need a 'touch' of vinegar.
