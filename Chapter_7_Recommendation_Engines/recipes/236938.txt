Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil for brushing, or as needed
2 eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 teaspoon dried basil
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Brush about 2 tablespoons olive oil onto eggplant slices; arrange in a single layer in a shallow baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove eggplant from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, basil, and oregano; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
Arrange about 1/2 the eggplant slices in a 2-quart casserole dish; top with 1/2 the sauce, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 the Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
