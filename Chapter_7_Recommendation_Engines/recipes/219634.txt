Ingredients:
1  russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
salt to taste

Directions:




Submitter: 
Chef John
Description: 
I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be twice fried. The first frying in done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.
