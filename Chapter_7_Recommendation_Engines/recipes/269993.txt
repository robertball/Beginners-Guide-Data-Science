Ingredients:
3/4 cup organic rolled oats
1/2 apple, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 tablespoons plain whole-milk organic yogurt
1 scoop vanilla-flavored plant-based protein powder (such as OrgainÂ®)
1 tablespoon organic chia seeds
1/2 tablespoon organic peanut butter, or more to taste
water
1 tablespoon fresh blueberries

Directions:
Toss oats in a glass lunch container. Add apple, yogurt, protein powder, chia seeds, and peanut butter. Add enough water to make a watery pudding; the chia seeds will soak up any extra liquid over time. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Garnish with blueberries before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of overnight oats packed with some protein without any added sugars or sweeteners. I usually have mine at lunch. It saves me a lot of meal prep time and it is healthy and filling! Sometimes when I have time I slice up some strawberries and garnish or toss in blueberries.
