Ingredients:
2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 32 squares)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the crumbs, chocolate chips and pecans. Stir in milk until blended (batter will be stiff). Spread into a greased 8-in. square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Cut into bars.

With six kids to keep an eye on, my mother relied on quick-and-easy recipes like this. Now my own family, who doesn't usually care for nuts, can't resist these chewy brownies.
