Ingredients:
For Bites:
3/4 cup Ghirardelli Premium Baking Coca, unsweetened
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
3/4 cup warm water
3/4 cup buttermilk
3 tablespoons sunflower oil
1 teaspoon pure peppermint extract
Peppermint candies coarsely chopped, for garnish
For Frosting:
3 sticks unsalted butter, softened
1 pound confectioners' sugar, sifted
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
For Bites: Line mini-muffin tins with mini-paper liners. Mix all ingredients (except crushed peppermint candies) to create a chocolate batter.  Divide batter among muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into centers comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Let cool in tins on wire racks.
For Frosting: Beat butter with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and creamy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. Add sugar,  cup at a time, beating after each addition, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla, and beat until buttercream is smooth.
Frost each mini bite with buttercream frosting and garnish with peppermint candy.
