3 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 tablespoons yellow curry powder

Heat the olive oil and cayenne pepper in a large pot over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender. Season with curry powder. Pour in the broth, and mix in the potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until potatoes are very tender.
Mix the squash and cauliflower into the pot, and continue cooking 30 minutes.
