Description: 
I have been serving this recipe to my extended family every Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter for over 20 years. It is always a big hit but I have never told the children that there are lima beans in it! This is especially good with a baked ham or spareribs, and is easily doubled. Enjoy!
