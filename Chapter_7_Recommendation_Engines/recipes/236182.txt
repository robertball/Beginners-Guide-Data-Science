Description: 
I had this recipe for baked oatmeal while in the Dominican Republic on a mission trip. Everyone loved it and asked for it often. With less sugar it is a healthy breakfast. You can add raisins, cranberries, nuts, cinnamon, chopped apples, flaxseed, wheat germ, etc. You can't mess up this recipe. Kids love it with the cup of sugar, but by adding less sugar and other ingredients you can make it healthy and also delicious by serving it with blueberries, strawberries, or peaches.
