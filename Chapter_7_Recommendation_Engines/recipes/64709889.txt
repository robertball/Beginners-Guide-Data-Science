Ingredients:
Crepes:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil
Other ingredients:
1 lb precooked ham
1 medium yellow squash
1 orange pepper
1 lb of cherry tomatoes
1 lb of zucchini
1 20 oz can of sliced pineapples
1 16 oz Italian Dressing

Directions:
1. Cut peppers, squash, zucchini into bite size pieces, place them in a large resealable bag.  Add enough Italian salad dressing to coat the contents.  Remove as much air out of the bag as possible.  Seal the bag and place it in a refrigerator for more than one hour.
2. In a blender combine eggs, milk, flour, salt and oil. Process until smooth. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour.
3. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and brush with oil. Pour 1/4 cup of crepe batter into pan, tilting to completely coat the surface of the pan. Cook 2 to 5 minutes, turning once, until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
4. Place the cooked crepes on a clean surface to cool to the touch.
5.  Cut the crepes in stripes about 1 - 2 inches wide.
6.  Cook the zucchini, squash, and peppers on a grill or in a skillet until soft, but firm.  The ham should be cooked to at least 160 degrees.  Cut the ham into bite size pieces.
7.  Place crepes, ham, zucchini, squash, peppers, tomatoes, pineapples and crepes on skewers in any particular fashion that you prefer.  Be creative.  I've added some pictures to give you some ideas.
