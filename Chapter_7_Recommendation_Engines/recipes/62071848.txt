Ingredients:
4 Medium Avocados
1/4 C Black Olives
1/2 C Bay Shrimp
1/2 C Frozen petite Peas (thawed)
1/4 C Diced Sweet Onion
1/4 C Diced Celery
Dash Garlic powder
Dash Onion Powder
Salt & Pepper to taste
Lemon Juice
Mayo
Lemon Wedge on the side

Directions:
With a sharp knive cut both Avocado's in half. Remove the pit. Now take a butter knife and carefully cut the inside lengthwise about 4 times (don't cut through the skin) then about 5 times the opposite way. You are making cubes. Carefully insert your butter knife between the skin and the meat and scoop it out into a bowl. Sprinkle lemon juice over the Avocado in the bowl and over the inside of the shell.
In the bowl with your avocado add the remaining ingredients. Add just enough Mayo that it is not to dry but not too mushy. Toss with a spoon carefully. Replace the avocado mixture into the shells and serve within about 1 hour so the avocados don't turn brown.
Add in options: Drained chopped Waterchestnuts, Peppers (spicey), flavored mayo, or any other veggie that will complement it.
