Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups water
1 cup apple cider
1 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1 1/4 cups jasmine rice
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored, and diced
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground cinnamon
1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds

Directions:
Combine water, apple cider, and golden raisins in a pot. Bring to a boil; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until most of the water is absorbed, about 17 minutes. Mix in white sugar, brown sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon; continue cooking until rice is tender, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir apple, onion, and celery in the hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with white pepper, salt, and a dash of cinnamon. Stir in almonds; cook until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Fold apple and almond mixture into rice. Let stand until flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
