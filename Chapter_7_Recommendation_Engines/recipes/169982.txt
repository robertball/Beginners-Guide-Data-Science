Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds boneless venison round steak
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (15.25 ounce) can Mexicorn, drained
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
8 (12 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Place the venison steaks into the bottom of a slow cooker; cover with the salsa. Discard half of the liquid from the black beans, then pour the beans into the slow cooker along with the Mexicorn.
Set the slow cooker on LOW, and cook 6 to 8 hours until the venison pulls apart easily with a fork.
Break up the meat into bite sized pieces, then stir in the cream cheese cubes until melted. Place a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon some of the filling halfway between the bottom edge and the center of the tortilla. Flatten the filling into rectangle shape with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle some of the Mexican cheese blend over the filling. Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then fold in the left and right edges.  Roll the burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.

Description: 
My family are big-time hunters. I am always looking for tasty, healthy ways to prepare the game in my freezer. This is one of my favorite options for using up the sometimes tough round steaks - and it couldn't be more simple! It is also great with elk and beef.
