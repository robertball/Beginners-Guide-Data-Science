Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. American cheese
1 can condensed tomato soup, undiluted.
2 TBS canola oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 can olives, sliced thin
1 bunch green onions, sliced very thin, including green tops
Optional additions;
Small chop pimento, to taste
Small chop peppers, such as jalapeno, for heat, to taste

Directions:
Pour undiluted condensed tomato soup into heavy sauce pan.
Add oil and blend well.
Cut cheese into small pieces and add to soup.
Heat, watching closely and stirring quite often to prevent the cheese from burning.
When the cheese is 3/4 melted, add remaining ingredinets and any additional optional ingredients.
Stirring constantly, continue cooking on a low setting for about 5 minutes.
Pour finished cheese spread into sterilized jars. Keep refrigerated.
Be sure and taste finished product. It is easy to taste flat and may need more salt.
You can use from 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of cheese. The amount of cheese you use will determine the thickness consistancy of the finished product.
Please do not try to double the recipe. If you want more than one recipe makes, just make more batches.
