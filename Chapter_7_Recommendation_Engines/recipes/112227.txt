Ingredients:
2 pounds turkey tenderloins, cut into 1/2 inch slices
1 (1 ounce) package Southwest marinade seasoning
1 pound strawberries, diced
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon sea salt
fresh ground pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 (10 inch) jalapeno and cheese flavored tortillas
2 cups fresh baby spinach
1 cup crumbled blue cheese

Directions:
In a medium bowl, toss the turkey with the Southwest marinade seasoning to coat, and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare a strawberry salsa by stirring together the diced strawberries, red onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, and lime juice in a bowl.  Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add turkey, and cook until firm and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.  Once done, microwave the tortillas for 30 seconds.
To assemble, evenly divide the cooked turkey onto each tortilla. Top with spinach, blue cheese and strawberry salsa, and roll into a wrap.

Description: 
This is a recipe I concocted when I feel like something different.  I find that every bite is an explosion of flavor. This recipe can easily adapted to different tastes by simply changing out the type of meat, greens or cheeses.
