Ingredients:
1 cup of shredded crab meat
3 tbsp. butter or margarine
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 tbsp. minced onion
3 tbsp. finely chopped celery
1/4 tsp. mustard
1 large egg
1/8 tsp. paprika
1 tsp. lemon juice
salt and pepper to taste
dash of Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
In a saute pan, melt butter, add onion and simmer for about 3 minutes. Add bread crumbs and stir over heat a few more minutes. Add all other ingredients and mix. (sometimes it works better if this is refrigerated at this point for a few hours.) Form into balls 3/4 inch to 1 inch. (dust your hands with flour.) They may be frozen at this stage. When ready to use, place thawed balls on broiler pan and broil 5 to 6 inches from heat, until heated through serve hot.
