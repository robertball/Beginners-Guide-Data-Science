Ingredients:
•1/3 cup white or rice vinegar (Note: rice vinegar gives better results)
•4 tablespoons brown sugar
•1 tablespoon ketchup
•1 teaspoon soy sauce
•2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 4 teaspoons water

Directions:
Mix the vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce together and bring to a boil in a small pot. Mix together the cornstarch and water, add to the other ingredients and stir to thicken.
(If desired, you can add 1 green pepper, cut into chunks, and pineapple chunks as desired after adding the cornstarch. For a thicker sauce, increase the cornstarch to 4 teaspoons while keeping the water constant.)
