Ingredients:
4 (4 ounce) fillets barramundi (Asian sea bass)
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
Crumb Topping:
1 cup dried bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 pinch dried thyme
Lemon-Butter-Basil Sauce:
1 cup melted butter
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Brush fish with olive oil.
Mix bread crumbs, seafood seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon zest, and thyme together in a bowl. Press fish in bread crumb mixture to coat all sides. Arrange coated fish on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip fish and continue baking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes more.
Stir butter, lemon juice, white wine, and basil together in a bowl; drizzle over cooked fish.

Description: 
Barramundi has been available quite often in my local supermarket. This recipe would also be good with tilapia. The butter-lemon-basil sauce is also good over brown rice.
