Ingredients:
4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons butter
5 carrots, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground beef
1 package of brown gravy
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
1 can of beef broth
1 cup of frozen peas
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
Salt & pepper

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Mix in butter and 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add carrots and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C.)
Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add ground beef and cook until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then stir in gravy and cook 1 minute. Add ketchup, beef broth, peas and mashed carrots. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish.  Top with the mashed potato mixture and sprinkle with remaining shredded cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
