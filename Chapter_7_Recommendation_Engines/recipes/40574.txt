Ingredients:
1 (6 ounce) can pineapple juice
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the pineapple juice, vegetable oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper. Place chicken in the bowl, and coat with the mixture. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours.
Preheat the oven broiler.
Place chicken on a baking sheet. Broil 5 minutes on each side in the preheated oven, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Discard remaining marinade.

Description: 
I searched for a long time to find a teriyaki marinade with a flavor as good as what you find in some restaurants, with the right amount of sweet and salty. Finally I made up my own recipe where the flavor increases the longer you marinate. Also works well with pork chops or beef steaks.
