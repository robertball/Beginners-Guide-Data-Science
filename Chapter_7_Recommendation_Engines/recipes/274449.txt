Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups ziti pasta
3 cups ground beef
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced onion
1 cup chopped red bell peppers
1 small stalk celery, chopped
4 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 1/2 Thai chiles, chopped
1 cup marinara sauce
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
1 tablespoon sour cream
1/2 tablespoon tomato paste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender and still firm to the bite, 6 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a 10-inch Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef to a large baking dish; drain and discard grease. Drain pasta and mix in with the beef.
Melt butter in the same pan. Add onion, bell peppers, celery, garlic, and Thai chiles. Cook and stir until onions turn translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
Transfer vegetable mixture to a blender. Pour in marinara sauce, milk, cream cheese, Sriracha sauce, sour cream, and tomato paste. Blend until combined but still chunky. Taste and season with salt and pepper as desired. Pour sauce over the beef and pasta in the baking dish.
Beat eggs together in the blender. Pour into the baking dish and mix well. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Pat mixture down and top with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, 20 to 30 minutes.
