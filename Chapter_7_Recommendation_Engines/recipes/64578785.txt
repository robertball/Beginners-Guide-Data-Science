Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, softened
4 slices Texas toast bread or any thicker cut bread
4 slices American cheese, thinly cut
4 slices Swiss cheese, thinly cut
4 slices crisp cooked bacon
1 medium tomato, sliced thinly
pickled red onion

Directions:
Preheat skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of each slice of bread. Place sliced bread, butter side up, on a plate.  Place a second slice butter side bread butter side down on top of the first, so that both buttered sides are together.  On top of the unbuttered side, add 2 slices of American & 2 slices of Swiss cheese, along with 2 slices of the cooked bacon.  Place one buttered side of sandwich in skillet. Place the other slice of bread over the top. Repeat with second sandwich. Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese is melted.  When sandwich is desired darkness, return to the plate. Lift the top piece of bread & add tomatoes & some of the pickled onion.

Description: 
A flavorful, grown-up version of everyone's favorite classic. I make a simple red onion pickle by slicing the onion & covering with a mixture of rice wine vinegar, sugar, a little salt & pepper. They can marinate overnight or longer as desired.  It gives a completely different taste to the sandwich.  I came up with this idea after ordering something similar on-line from Panera bread.
