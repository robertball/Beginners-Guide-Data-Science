Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
1/3 cup Gevalia® Cold Brew Concentrate - Caramel
3 ice cubes
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon whipped cream, or to taste
2 teaspoons chocolate syrup, or to taste
2 teaspoons caramel ice cream topping, or to taste

Directions:
Stir coconut milk until it is uniformly smooth. Pour 1/2 cup portions into paper cups or a muffin tin. Freeze until solid, about 4 hours or overnight.
Place a single 1/2 cup portion of frozen coconut milk in the container of a blender. Add cold brew concentrate, ice cubes, sugar, and salt. (Keep the remaining portions of coconut milk in the freezer for other frappes.)
Blend until smooth and creamy.
Pour into a glass, top with whipped cream. Drizzle chocolate and caramel ice cream toppings over the whipped cream.

Description: 
This icy coffee-based drink draws its inspiration from a famous cookie. It combines caramel-flavored Gevalia® Kaffe Cold Brew Iced Coffee Concentrate, coconut milk, and a touch of chocolate-caramel, too, if you dare!
