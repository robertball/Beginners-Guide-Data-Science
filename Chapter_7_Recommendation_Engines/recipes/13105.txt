Ingredients:
1 tablespoon margarine
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle light beer
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 cups half-and-half
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Melt the butter or margarine in a 4 1/2 quart soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and Worcestershire sauce and stir well. Add the beer and raise the heat to high and boil for 3 minutes to evaporate the alcohol. Add the chicken broth and bring the soup back to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer.
Combine the cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water and stir until smooth. Set aside.
Add the half-and-half and shredded cheese to the soup. Stir constantly until the cheese melts. Then stir in the cornstarch mixture. Stir constantly until the soup is thick, about 2 minutes. Serve garnished with bacon bits.
