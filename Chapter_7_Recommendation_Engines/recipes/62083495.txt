Ingredients:
1 large salmon filet
2 cans of diced tomatoes
6 ounces of evaporated milk
1 teaspoon of minced garlic
1/4 cup grated pecorino romano cheese
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 of a small onion
pepper to taste
basil to taste
oregano to taste
12 ounces of pasta (rotini works great)

Directions:
Saute onion and garlic in butter.  Add seasonings to taste.  Once onion is soft, let sit while you pan fry the salmon on both sides until cooked 85%.  Then flake salmon with a fork and continue to cook through on low heat.  While salmon is cooking, add tomatoes, milk and cheese to onions and garlic.  Bring to a boil, then turn back heat to low and let simmer for about 20 minutes.  Add salmon to sauce and sit covered on warm stove while you cook pasta.  Once pasta is done, combine all ingredients and serve. Enjoy!
