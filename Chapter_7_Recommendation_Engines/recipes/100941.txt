Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 3/4 pounds (1-inch thick) beef top sirloin steak, cut into 4 pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup beef broth
1/2 cup dry red wine

Directions:
Mix butter with garlic and garlic powder, and set aside. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat steaks with oil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Add steaks to pan and cook until well-browned on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare to medium or to desired doneness. Transfer each steak to a dinner plate.
While steaks rest, add broth and wine to the hot skillet; simmer  until reduced by half. Pour sauce over each steak, and smear a little butter over each steak before serving.
