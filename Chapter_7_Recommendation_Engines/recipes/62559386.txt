Ingredients:
1 tsp canola oil
1 medium onion, chopped
Coarse sea salt or kosher salt--to taste
1 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
1 large or 2 small garlic cloves, chopped
1 Tbsp curry powder
1 bay leaf
1 ½ cups red lentils

Directions:
In a saucepan or kettle, bring 3 ½ cups of water to a boil.
In a large saucepan over high heat, warm the oil. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and sauté, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens, and 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the sweet potato, ginger, garlic, curry powder and bay leaf and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in the boiling water and stir in the lentils. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the lentils break down and the sweet potatoes are tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Season with salt.
