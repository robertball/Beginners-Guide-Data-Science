Description: 
Kimchi, a popular Korean dish, is best described as a spicy, slightly sweet, pickled or fermented cabbage.  I spent a year in South Korea and fell in LOVE with Kimchi! My friend Myong was kind enough to share her recipe and technique with me.  Some ingredients may not be readily available in your local supermarket.  Look for Kimchi (Fish) Sauce and Korean chili powder in Asian markets or online. Use kimchi in stir fries or your favorite Korean dishes.
