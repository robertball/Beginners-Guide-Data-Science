2 egg whites, room temp
1 tsp vanilla
3/4 c chopped candied fruit, nuts, dried fruit or chocolate shavings

Cook, without stirring, to 260 degrees or hard ball stage (a few drops of syrup, dropped into cold water, form a hard ball when removed from the water). Remove from heat. Immediatley, in large bowlbeat egg whites at high speed till stiff peaks form (tips stand straight up).
Remove the thermometer and gradually pour hot syrup in a this stream over egg whites, beating at hight speed. Add syrup slowly to ensure proper blending.
Add vanilla and a few drops food coloring, if desired; beat at high speed for 4-5 mins untill candy holds its shape when beater are removed (mixture falls in a ribbon, but mounds on itself).
If candy is beaten enough, mixture will stay mounded in a soft shape when a spponful is dropped onto waxed paper. If mixture flattens out, beat 1/2 to 1 min more. The mixture is over beaten if it is stiff to spoon and surface is rough. If mixture is too stiff, beat in hot water, a few drops at a time, until the candy is softer consistancy.
When the candy holds its shape, stir in fruits and nuts, if desired; quickly drop candy by tsp onto wax paper. Cool; store tightly covered.
