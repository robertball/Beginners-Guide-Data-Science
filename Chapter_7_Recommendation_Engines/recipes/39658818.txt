Ingredients:
1 pound small bay scallops
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
4-5  diced tomatoes
1  red onion
1 serrano chili, roasted and finely diced
1 pobalno chili, roasted, peeled, seeded and diced
1/2 bunch chopped cilantro
salt and pepper

Directions:
Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Add the scallops and boil for 1 minute.  Drain and put in a non-reactive bowl.  Pour lime juice over the scallops and add remaining ingredients.  Stir, cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.  The action of the acid in teh lime juice "cooks"  the scallops, firming the flesh and turning it opaque.  Spoon equal amonts into 6 martini or margarita glasses and serve immediately.  Can also be served with tortilla chips as a dip.
