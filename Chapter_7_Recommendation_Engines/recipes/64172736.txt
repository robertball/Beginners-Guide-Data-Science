Ingredients:
1-1/2 cups black beans
1 Tbsp. flax meal or chia meal mixed with 3 Tbsp. hot water
1 zucchini
1 carrot
2 cloves garlic
1/2 onion
1 Tbsp. olive oil
2 Tbsp. tomato paste mixed with 2 Tbsp. water
1/4 cup barbecue sauce
1 cup gluten-free lentil chips, crushed
¼ cup minced cilantro
1 avocado, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
In food processor, chop zucchini, carrot garlic and onion.
Add olive oil to medium sauté pan and heat. Add chopped vegetables and sauté 5 to 6 minutes or until veggies are softened. Remove from heat and set aside.
In food processor, add black beans and pulse until roughly chopped; place half in a medium-sized bowl (leave remaining half in food processor).
Combine flax/water mixture, barbecue sauce and tomato paste/water mixture with beans in food processor. Puree until smooth.
Pour black bean puree into bowl with remaining half of chopped beans. Stir in sautéed vegetables, ½ cup crushed lentil chips and minced cilantro. (Note: Mixture should feel like wet sand. Add more crushed lentil chips or barbecue sauce as needed to achieve this texture.)
Divide burger mixture into four portions. Shape each portion into 2”-thick patty, then press each side into remaining crushed lentil chips to form a crust.
In same pan used to sauté vegetables, add a small amount of olive oil and cook burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each side until lightly browned.
Arrange burgers on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
Top burgers with avocado slices.
