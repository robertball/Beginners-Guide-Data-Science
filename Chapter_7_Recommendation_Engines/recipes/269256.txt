Ingredients:
6 medium green bell peppers - tops, seeds, and membranes removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 large onion, sliced
6 sandwich steaks, sliced into strips
salt and ground black pepper to taste
garlic powder
12 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stand peppers up in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until just soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook and stir until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add steak strips and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste. Cook until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes more.
Remove peppers from the oven, leaving oven on. Drain any liquid that may have accumulated in the bottoms. Fill each pepper with steak mixture and top with a slice of provolone cheese.
Return peppers to the hot oven and bake until provolone cheese is brown and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes more.
