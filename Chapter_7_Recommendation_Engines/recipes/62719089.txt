Ingredients:
1 head	garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
(1) 3-oz pkg cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon cream or milk
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 small shallot, minced fine
1 pat butter
1 pinch salt, or to taste
6 drops Tabasco Sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
18 pretzel sticks

Directions:
Remove papery skin from garlic head and slice about 1/4" off the top.
Place garlic head on tinfoil and drizzle with olive oil; seal tightly and place on a cookie sheet.
Bake garlic for 1 hour or until the cloves are soft and fragrant.
Meanwhile, sauté shallots in butter just until edges start to brown; stir in salt and Tabasco Sauce and let cool.
Beat cream cheese and cream in a medium bowl on medium speed, scraping bowl often, until smooth.
Stir in Cheddar and cooled shallots and continue beating until well mixed; refrigerate until garlic is done and cooled.
When garlic is cool enough to handle, carefully squeeze out the cloves.
Cut larger cloves in halves or thirds.
Shape cheese mixture into 1” balls around the smaller garlic cloves and pieces; save any remaining cloves for another use.
Refrigerate for several hours or overnight.
When ready to serve, roll balls in parsley and poke a pretzel stick in each one at a 45º angle.
