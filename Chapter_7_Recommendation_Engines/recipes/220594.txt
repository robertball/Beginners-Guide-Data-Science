Ingredients:
oil for frying
2 cups bitter ale (such as Goose Island Honkers AleÂ®)
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sesame seeds
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon baking powder
3 large portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1/2-inch slices

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk ale, flour, sesame seeds, cornstarch, and baking powder in a large bowl. The batter will be thick and slightly lumpy.
Dip 7 to 8 strips of mushroom at a time into the batter, shaking off excess.
Fry mushrooms in batches in the preheated oil until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
