Ingredients:
1/3 cup basmati rice
1 small zucchini, cubed
1/2 onion, cubed
4 1/2 ounces seitan beef, sliced
1 teaspoon pure coconut oil
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 pinch garlic powder
2/3 cup water

Directions:
Soak basmati rice in 1/2 cup cold water for 30 minutes. Drain.
Combine zucchini and onion in a pot of water, bring to a boil, and boil for about 20 minutes. Drain. Place in a blender; blend until smooth.
Pour pureed zucchini mixture into a pot over medium heat. Add seitan, coconut oil, cumin, coriander, curry powder, salt, turmeric, pepper, and garlic powder. Simmer until sauce is thick, adding a tablespoon of water from time to time to prevent burning, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine 2/3 cup water and soaked rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Serve seitan with hot rice.

A lovely vegan curry with seitan. The longer the seitan cooks, the more flavorful it gets.
