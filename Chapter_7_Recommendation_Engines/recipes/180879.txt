Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) package dried udon noodles
½ cup chicken broth
1 ½ tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons peanut butter
1 ½ tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons chili oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 whole rotisserie chicken, skinned and boned, meat pulled into large chunks
1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
¼ cup green onions, chopped
¼ cup chopped peanuts
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the udon in a few noodles at a time and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain; return to the pot.
While the udon noodles are cooking, whisk the chicken broth, ginger, soy sauce, peanut butter, honey, chile oil, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, whisking until the peanut butter has melted. Pour the sauce over the noodles. Add the chicken and red bell pepper; toss until the noodles are evenly coated in the sauce. Sprinkle with green onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro to serve.
