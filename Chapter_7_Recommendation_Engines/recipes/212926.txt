Ingredients:
4 ears fresh corn, shucked and desilked
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced

1 bunch fresh spinach, washed and dried

Directions:
Slice the kernels from the cob and scrape off the remaining bits and juice into a bowl. Set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the pork and cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes; add the prawns and cook until bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes more. Stir the corn into the pot; season with salt and pepper. Pour the chicken broth over the mixture; bring to a simmer and cook another 10 minutes. Add the spinach to the soup and cook until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
This soup is great to make especially when corn is fresh and at its peak. Prepare a big batch and freeze for when you're too busy to cook during the week. Double the recipe if desired to save for later.
