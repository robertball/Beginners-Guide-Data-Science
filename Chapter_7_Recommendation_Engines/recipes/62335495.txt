Ingredients:
2 (85 g) packages of Jello jelly powder, any flavour
2 cups water
1 (370 ml) can evaporated milk, refrigerated overnight

Directions:
Boil water. Place Jello jelly powder in a large bowl. Add boiling water to jelly powder and stir to dissolve. Leave jelly alone for about 30-45 minutes to cool but not set.
In another large bowl, beat cold evaporated milk for about 3 minutes with an electric mixer (5 minutes or longer if whisking by hand) until thick and very frothy.
Add cooled jelly to milk and whisk together. Pour into individual serving dishes and refrigerate at least one hour.
