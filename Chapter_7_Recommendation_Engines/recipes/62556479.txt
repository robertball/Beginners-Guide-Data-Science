https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
7 oz. Fluff (marshmallow creme)
2/3 C evaporated milk
1 1/4 C white sugar
2 tbsp butter
1/4 tsp salt
2 C butterscotch morsels
1 C white chocolate chips
1 tsp vanilla

Directions:
Combine Fluff, evaporated milk, sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil mixture 5 minutes, still stirring constantly, or until it reaches 235 degrees Fahrenheit, or passes the soft ball* test. Candy will have turned a more golden/tanned shade.
Remove from heat and add butterscotch morsels, chocolate chips and vanilla, being careful not to let the chocolate chips hit the bottom of the pan and burn.
Pour into greased 8x8 tin. Set in the refrigerator for 2 hours or until firm. Slice into 48 1-oz. squares.
