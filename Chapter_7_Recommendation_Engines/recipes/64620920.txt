Ingredients:
1 acorn squash
3 Macintosh apples
1 teaspoon cinnamon
apple juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Peel and dice apples. Cut acorn squash in half and scoop out seeds. Place acorn halves face up in pan.
Add an inch of water to the bottom of the pan and place diced apples in the squash "holes" where the seeds were and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Pour water over the apples so that there is water in the squash holes and cover the pan with tinfoil.
Bake for 40 minutes or until the acorn shell puckers and apple halves are soft. Cool slightly then scoop squash "meat" and apples out of the shell.
Puree in a food processor or blender, adding apple juice or water to achieve desired consistency.
