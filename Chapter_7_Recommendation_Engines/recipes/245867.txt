Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup vanilla whey protein powder
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup milk
1 cup peanut butter
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup plain yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease mini muffin cups.
Combine whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, chocolate chips, protein powder, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking soda in a large bowl.
Whisk milk, peanut butter, eggs, oil, and yogurt in another bowl until smooth. Pour over flour mixture and stir until batter is just blended. Fill muffin cups 3/4 of the way full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 10 minutes. Cool in the muffin pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack until completely cooled, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a favorite among my teenage athletes for a before-practice snack. I fill baggies with these and throw them in the freezer. The kids grab a baggie on the way to school and the mini muffins are thawed out and ready to eat before the end of the day.
