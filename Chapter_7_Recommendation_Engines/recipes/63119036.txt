Ingredients:
24 Hard Boiled Eggs
6 Different colors of gel paste food coloring (Use between 1/4 teaspoon and 1/2 teaspoon each)
6 cups white vinegar
6 plastic disposable 12 oz.cups

Directions:
Cover working area with newspaper or plastic.
Fill each plastic cup with 1 cup of vinegar.
Mix in gel paste food color at a time in each cup until desired color is achieved (anywhere between 1/4 teaspoon and 1/2 teaspoon, depending on how dark you want the dye bath).
Dip eggs in dye for a short time using a spoon, or let them "sit" in the dye bath for a longer period of time for a deeper color.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour so the colors can set.

Description: 
Lovely and vibrant, these Easter eggs get their beautiful, deep, colored shells by dyeing the eggs using professional bakers' gel food coloring. The violets, yellows, baby blues, oranges and pinks make beautiful Easter eggs - far better than the traditional box decorating kits!
