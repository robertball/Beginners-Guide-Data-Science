Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix
1 can (15-oz can) pumpkin
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice
1 jar (about 12 oz) hot fudge topping
1 container  vanilla  frosting
2/3 cup (from a 12 oz jar) caramel topping

Heat oven to 350°F (325°F for dark or nonstick pan). Grease or spray bottom only of 13x9-inch pan.
In large bowl, beat cake mix, pumpkin, water, oil, eggs and pumpkin pie spice with electric mixer on low speed until moistened, then on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour into pan. Bake 26 to 33 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.
Immediately poke cake every inch with handle of wooden spoon halfway into cake; cool 5 minutes. Place hot fudge topping in quart-size resealable bag. Cut tiny corner from bag; squeeze hot fudge into holes in cake. Repeat as necessary to use all topping.
Run knife around sides of pan to loosen cake. Cover and refrigerate about 2 hours or until chilled.
Drop frosting by spoonfuls onto cake; spread evenly.
Just before serving, heat caramel sauce as directed on jar; drizzle a heaping teaspoon over each serving of cake. Sprinkle with pecans. Store cake loosely covered in refrigerator.
