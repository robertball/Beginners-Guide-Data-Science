Ingredients:
1 21 oz. box frozen beef sandwich steaks
1 large onion, diced
8 oz. sliced mushrooms
salt and pepper, to taste
1 13.8 oz. tube refrigerated pizza crust
4 oz. sour cream
4 oz cream cheese, softened
1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning
8 slices American cheese

Directions:
Break up the steaks into a large skillet.  Brown the steaks with the onion and mushrooms, stirring frequently, until meat is cooked.  Drain fat and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.
Meanwhile, grease a 9x13 pan.  Unroll the pizza crust into the pan and bake according to package directions.  Let cool slightly.
Beat together the sour cream, cream cheese and Italian seasoning.  Spread this mixture evenly over the baked pizza crust, then top with the steak mixture.  Lay out the cheese slices so that they cover the steak mixture.
Bake at 400 for 5-10 minutes, until the cheese has melted.

Description: 
Rich weekend taste in a weeknight portion size - no need to call out for delivery!  Although authentic Philly steaks use Cheez Whiz, we prefer American cheese.  Add peppers, garlic or sauce if that's how you prefer your cheese steaks.
