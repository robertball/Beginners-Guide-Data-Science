Ingredients:
1 package of frozen puff pastry
8 oz fresh salmon, or 3 cans
Â½ cup chopped mushrooms
2 tbsp	chopped shallots
1 cup of converted rice cooked according to package directions but cook in chicken broth instead of water
1 tsp dill (fresh is best)
1/3 cup butter
1 hard boiled egg
Dash of lemon juice

Directions:
1. If you're using fresh salmon, cook, cool, and then remove bones and skin.  If you're using canned salmon, take out the bones and skin.
2. Saute the shallots and mushrooms in small amount of butter/margarine.  Mix the fish, shallots mushrooms, egg, cooked rice and dill.  Season to taste with salt and pepper & lemon juice.
3. Roll out puff pastry into two equal sized rectangles, about 10" X 15".  Put salmon mix in the middle of one rectangle..  Pour the melted 1/3 cup of butter onto the fish.  Top with the second layer of puff pastry.  Make sure you put a couple of slits for venting the steam.  If you want to be really fancy, you can cut the pastry into the shape of a fish.  Seal the edges of the pastry together with an egg wash (1 egg & a bit of milk mixed) and then wash the top of the pastry before putting it into the oven.
4. Bake at 350 till brown (30 to 40 minutes)
Serve with your favourite cheddar cheese sauce.

An elegant & delicious way to prepare salmon, this can be made ahead of time.  You can use either fresh salmon or you can cheat and use canned.  It tastes wonderful either way.  Originally a Russian dish, its worth trying.  Serve it with a salad and you're in for a treat.
