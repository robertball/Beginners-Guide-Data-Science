Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
2 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups white chocolate chips (11 oz)
1 1/2 cups Macadamia nuts, coarsly chopped (optional)
3/4 cup finely chopped coconut (super fine)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ. Cream together butter and sugars until combined well (scrape down the sides). add vanilla extract and the eggs, one at a time. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, and baking soda. Slowly (add about a cup at a time) the dry ingredients to the mixer and mix well.
Lastly, once batter is completely combined, fold in the white chocolate chips, coconut and the macadamia nuts. Scoop out onto heaping 1-2 tablespoon scoops (depending on the size you want - just pick a size and make them all the same) onto a baking sheet. I used a large cookie dough scoop to help keep the sizes uniform.
Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until just beginning to brown.
I like to pull my cookies out a little early so the finish cooking outside of the oven (keeping them nice and soft in the middle)!
