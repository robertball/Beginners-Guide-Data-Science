Ingredients:
Salmon:
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped shallot
2 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
3 (6 ounce) fillets salmon
Lemon-Pepper Sauce:
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon lemon zest
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
Salad:
1 1/2 cups watercress, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Whisk honey, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, shallot, 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest together in a shallow baking dish. Add salmon fillets and turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate until flavors combine, 15 minutes to 1 hour.
Whisk creme fraiche, 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl to make lemon-pepper sauce.
Toss watercress, dill, and tarragon with 2 teaspoons lemon juice and 2 teaspoons olive oil in a bowl to make salad. Season with salt and pepper.
Set an oven rack in the top part of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; brush with remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil.
Transfer salmon fillets, with marinade, to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until salmon is just opaque in the center, about 15 minutes.
Serve salmon with some salad and sauce on top. Serve remaining sauce on the side. Garnish with lemon wedges.

Description: 
This dish is fairly easy to make, yet it is elegant, tasty, and very nutritious! You may want more or less salad with it. It may be served with quinoa as a side for some more flavor and extra health benefits. Great for pesco-vegetarians!
