Ingredients:
Soup Stock:
6 cups chicken broth
1 cup water
1 1/4 pounds chicken tenders
3 extra large chicken bouillon cubes (such as KnorrÂ®)
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons granulated garlic
2 teaspoons ground cumin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 large white onion, chopped, or to taste
Rice:
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup white rice
1 teaspoon chili powder
Garnish:
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Combine 6 cups chicken broth, water, chicken tenders, chicken bouillon cubes, olive oil, granulated garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover pot, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Gently shred chicken using 2 forks. Add onion to broth and simmer for about 5 more minutes.
Bring 2 cups chicken broth, rice, and chili powder to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 25 minutes.
Spoon rice into each serving bowl and pour soup over rice. Garnish with avocado slices and cilantro.

Description: 
I recently came back from Del Mar, CA, and a few of the Mexican restaurants served Sonoran-style Caldo De Pollo. I attempted to mimic this recipe as closely as I could to match the delicious soup I ate there. I'm open to suggestions to make this recipe better as this is my first time attempting it.
