Ingredients:
6  eggs, lightly beaten
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
6 tablespoons butter
1 pound mushrooms, sliced
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs
Vegetable oil
6 fluid ounces dry white wine
Â½ pound sliced Muenster cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Lightly beat eggs in a small bowl.  Soak the chicken pieces in the egg for at least 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet and add the mushrooms.   Cook and stir the sliced mushrooms until softened.
Remove the chicken from the egg mixture.  Roll the chicken pieces in bread crumbs and set aside.  Heat a small amount of oil in a large skillet over medium-high.  Place the chicken pieces in the pan and brown on all sides.  Brown the pieces in batches if necessary.
Place the browned chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch glass baking dish.  Cover the chicken with the sauteed mushrooms.  Pour the wine into the baking dish, then cover the mixture with the sliced cheese.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
