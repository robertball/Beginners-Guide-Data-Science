Ingredients:
2 cups hot water
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
4 cups water, divided
5 sprigs flat-leaf parsley
1/4 white onion
2 cloves garlic
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules

Directions:
Combine hot water and rice in a bowl and soak for 15 minutes. Rinse until water runs clear and drain very well.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Combine 1 cup water, parsley, onion, and garlic in a blender. Process until smooth. Pour through a strainer into the saucepan with the rice and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms and jalapeno peppers. Boil until slightly tender, about 2 minutes more.
Stir remaining 3 cups water and chicken bouillon into in the saucepan with the rice. Bring back to a boil, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer until rice is soft, about 15 minutes.
