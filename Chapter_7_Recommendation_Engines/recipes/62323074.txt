Description: 
Using the Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajita idea, I used fajita seasoning and lemon juice (instead of water). To go from quick & easy to warp speed & basic , used pre-cooked thawed shrimp. Served over rice because it was too beautiful to wrap up in a tortilla!Modified from: Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas
