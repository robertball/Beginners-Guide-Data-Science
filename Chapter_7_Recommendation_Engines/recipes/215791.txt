1 avocado, peeled and chopped, or more to taste

Description: 
A zesty, cold shrimp dish that is perfect for brunch, appetizer or meal!  One bite will transport you to that island getaway and you'll be looking for a cool beverage to sip alongside. Great the next day or two if any is left over! If serving as appetizer, gently ladle into decorative glasses with a fork and add marinated green beans or celery sticks like a Bloody Mary cocktail; for a meal, serve in bowl with garlic bread and salad.  Also fun is to add a shot of vodka to the glass and drink the liquid when the shrimp and vegetables have been eaten!
