Ingredients:
1 stick butter or marg.
1 c. sugar
3/4 c. milk
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp. baking powder
1 c. flour
1 large can peaches (No. 2 size)

Directions:
Melt stick of butter in round 3 quart casserole or 13 X 9 baking dish.
Mix sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Add milk and stir. Pour over butter. Then pour the can of peaches over batter and bake at 350 for 45 minutes to 1 hr. ( I also sprinkle a cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top ) Because it's been asked several times, I donot drain the peaches. I like the extra peachy-ness. But it's also pretty goo-ey. The recipe is not compromised if you DO drain the peaches. I've made this recipe for many years. I've added all kinds of fruit to it, that little dab of leftover fruit from another application, crushed pineapple, oops, that one apple that's getting ready to be thrown out. It's very versatile and fun to experiment with.
