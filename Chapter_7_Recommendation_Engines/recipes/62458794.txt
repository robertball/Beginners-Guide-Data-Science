Description: 
I have created this low fat muffin recipe that is guaranteed to be the star on your plate. Each muffin is only 117 calories and taste like it is filled with butter and cream! These taste great warm out of the oven with low fat vanilla ice cream. They almost remind me of a molten lava cake but without the runny center!
