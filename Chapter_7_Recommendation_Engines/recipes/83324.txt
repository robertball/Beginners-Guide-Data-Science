Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 cup all-purpose flour
6 cups chicken broth
2/3 cup diced cooked ham
1 cup finely shredded carrots
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons pepper
1 1/3 cups uncooked wild rice
2 cups half-and-half cream
1/4 cup sherry
2 tablespoons fresh parsley
2 tablespoons fresh chives

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot, and saute the onion and garlic. Gradually blend in the flour. Cook and stir until onion is tender and flour is golden brown. Whisk in broth, bring to a boil, and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in ham, carrots, and almonds. Season with salt and pepper, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Mix rice, half-and-half, and sherry into the soup, and continue cooking 30 minutes. Stir in parsley and chives, and cook another 30 minutes, until rice is tender.

Description: 
My husband LOVES this soup! I used to make only 6 servings, but now I always make 12 and it still usually only lasts an extra day! Take some time with this recipe -- it's worth it! I serve this hearty soup in bread bowls with a salad on the side.
