Ingredients:
1/2 pound butter
1 3/4 cups white sugar
2 eggs
15 ounces ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
5 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup colored candy sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, cream together butter, sugar, eggs, ricotta cheese, and vanilla extract. Combine the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; blend into the creamed mixture, mixing in additional flour as necessary to form a workable dough. Roll dough into teaspoon-sized balls, and arrange on an ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
In a medium bowl, beat milk, confectioners' sugar, and almond extract until smooth. Spoon over warm cookies, and sprinkle with colored candy sprinkles.
