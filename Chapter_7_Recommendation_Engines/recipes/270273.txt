Honey-Mustard Pork Chops with Apples and Onions Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
4 (4 ounce) boneless pork chops
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 small sweet apples, sliced
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken stock
1/2 cup honey mustard (such as HeinzÂ®)
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

Directions:
Combine olive oil and butter in a pan large and deep enough to hold all 4 pork chops plus a few inches of cooking liquid, like a frying pan or roasting dish. Heat over medium-high heat.
Season pork chops with salt, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl and lightly dredge pork chops in the flour, shaking off excess.
Place coated pork chops in the hot pan without crowding; work in batches if necessary. Cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and add apples, onion, and garlic. Cook until onions start to become opaque, about 5 minutes more. Add chicken stock, honey, and thyme. Cover pan and allow to braise until chops are no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes more.

Description: 
In an experiment to test my ability to cook without using a recipe, I whipped this up for my family. It may not be the most creative recipe, but my husband stood at the oven spooning the sauce into his mouth after we finished eating - so I'm going to say this worked out well!
