Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup canned pumpkin
2 tablespoons buttermilk (or milk or water, optional)
1 egg white, beaten (optional)

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flours, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice; mix well.  Using pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture is crumbly.  Stir in raisins; set aside.
In a small bowl, combine egg, pumpkin and buttermilk.  Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients; mix well.
On lightly floured surface, pat dough into circle 3/4" thick.  Using a 2" round cutter, cut into 14 scones.  Place scones on ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush tops with egg white mixture, if desired.
Bake in preheated 400F. oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean.  Remove from cookie sheet; cool on wire rack.
