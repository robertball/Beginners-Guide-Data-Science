Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
2 cups gf flour (I use Carol Fenster's Sorghum recipe)
1 tsp. Xanthan Gum
1 teaspoon gf vanilla extract
1 egg (seperated)
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 x 12 inch rectangular baking pan.
Cream together the brown sugar and the butter or margarine. Add the vanilla.
Sift and add gf flour and xanthan gum to the creamed sugar mixture. Mix well.
Add the egg yolk to the dough. Mix again.
Press into the greased pan, and glaze with the lightly-beaten egg white. Sprinkle with pecans.
Bake about 20 minutes. When cool, cut into bars. Enjoy!
