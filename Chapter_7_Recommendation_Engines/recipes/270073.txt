Ingredients:
3 medium Chinese eggplants, cut into 1/2-inch rounds
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms
1 yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons dried basil
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 bunch kale, chopped
2 (14.5 ounce) cans no-salt-added crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons tahini
salt and pepper to taste
1 (12 ounce) box no-boil lasagna noodles
1 (8 ounce) container smoked tofu, diced
3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Place eggplant slices evenly on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion and cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, basil, and cayenne pepper. Add kale and cook until wilted, about 5 minutes more. Add tomatoes and tahini and simmer for 5 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper.
Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Follow by alternating layers of lasagna noodles, baked eggplant, tofu, and mozzarella cheese. Continue with remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of noodles topped by sauce and covered in mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake 10 minutes more. Allow to cool 10 minutes before serving.
