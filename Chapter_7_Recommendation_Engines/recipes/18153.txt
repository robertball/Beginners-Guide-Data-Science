Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons butter
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, stir together the cornstarch and white sugar. Add the butter and cream well. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Combine the flour and baking powder; stir into the sugar mixture until a dough forms. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto an unprepared cookie sheet.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are golden brown at the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
