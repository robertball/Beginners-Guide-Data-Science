Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons Grapeseed Or Peanut Oil
2  Large Parsnips
2 pinches Sea Salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet. You can use any kind of oil, but I’ve found grapeseed and peanut can withstand higher temperatures without burning.
While the oil is heating, thinly slice the parsnips. As the slices get larger, you can cut them in halves or fourths to keep them around the same size.
The oil will be ready when it thins out and moves around in the pan. The parsnips should sizzle in the oil. If the oil starts to sputter and spit, turn the heat down. You want to let them sizzle about 5 minutes on each side. Sprinkle each side with sea salt as it’s cooking.
Place in a dish lined with cloth or paper towels to absorb some of the extra oil. Try to wait until they cool off before devouring.
