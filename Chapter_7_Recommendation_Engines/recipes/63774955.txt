Ingredients:
1 1/2 pints blueberries (frozen or fresh)
1 cup sugar
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 cup water
2 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (14 oz) can condensed sweetened milk
2 teaspoons vanilla, divided
Prepared pie shell

Directions:
Blueberry Syrup - In a saucepan combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 cup of water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to thicken; about 25 minutes. Strain the mixture through a sieve so that the syrup is smooth.  Set the strained blueberries aside, to be used for later. Cool the syrup to room temperature and then transfer to the refrigerator in an air tight container to continue to cool.
Cheesecake:
While the syrup cooks, mix the cream cheese with a mixer until creamy. With the mixer still on, slowly add the condensed milk and teaspoon of vanilla until combined. Turn off the mixer and add to the cheesecake half or more of the strained blueberries. Gently stir to incorporate. Poor into a prepared pie shell and cook at 300Â° for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand at room temperature. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill.
Once the cheesecake and sauce have cooled, cut the cheesecake into slices. Stir the syrup thoroughly and then pour desired amount of blueberry syrup over each slice.
