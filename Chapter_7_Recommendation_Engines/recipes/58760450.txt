Description: 
MY HUSBAND likes stuffed peppers, but my old recipe made too much. I devised this recipe to accommodate just the two of us. It helps to use a small-size casserole so the peppers won't tip over while baking.    For color, I serve steamed carrots with the peppers, rounding out the meal perfectly.                                               --Elaine Carpenter                                                            Horseshoe Bay, TexasModified from: Stuffed Peppers for Two
