Ingredients:
4 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons chicken broth
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sambal oelek chili paste
2 teaspoons dry sherry
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 cups cauliflower florets
1/4 cup unsalted roasted peanuts
1 clove garlic, minced
2 green onion tops, chopped

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, chicken broth, vinegar, chili paste, sherry, and cornstarch in a large bowl. Mix until cornstarch is dissolved. Set sauce aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook cauliflower until golden brown and charred in places, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the sauce and cook until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add peanuts and garlic and cook for 2 minutes more.
Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with green onion tops.
