Ingredients:
4 cups Chicken Broth
5 Slices Bacon
12oz Mushrooms (I used a variety pack), diced
2 TBL Unsalted Butter
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
1 Medium Onion, diced finely
1/2 Cup White Wine
1 1/3 Cups Arborio Rice
Finishing:
1/2 Cup Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1-3 TBL Unsalted Butter
1/4 Cup Heavy Cream (or Whole Milk or Broth)

Directions:
1.  In large skillet on high heat, cook bacon until golden.  Remove
2.  Leave 2 TBL bacon grease in skillet and add mushrooms and cook until golden.  Remove
3.  Turn heat down to medium and add butter and melt.  Add onion and garlic and saut√© for 3 minutes.
4.  Turn heat to high and add rice and stir until grains become partially translucent (no longer than one minute)
5.  Add wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell evaporates, approx. 2 minutes
6.  Turn head down to medium low and add 3 cups of stock.  Leave it uncovered, stirring just once or twice, until most of the liquid has been absorbed.
7.  Check firmness of rice and add 1/2 cup of stock at a time, stirring in between until absorbed, until the rice is cooked to you taste.
8.  Add mushrooms back into the risotto, just to heat through.
9.  Right at the end when the risotto is ready, add heavy cream to make the risotto slightly soup and then take it off the stove.
10.  Add butter and parmesan, then stir vigorously (activates the starch and makes it super creamy).
11. Serve immediately.   Garnish with bacon and extra parm, if desired.
