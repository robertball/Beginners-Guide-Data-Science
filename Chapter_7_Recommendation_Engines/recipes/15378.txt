Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
12 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 (20 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
18 (6 inch) corn tortillas
1 (2 ounce) can chopped black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, combine the sour cream and 3/4 of the cheese.
Into a 9x13 inch pan, pour a small amount of enchilada sauce to coat bottom of pan.  Layer 6 tortillas on bottom of pan. Layer half of the cheese-sour cream mixture and 1/3 of the olives over the tortillas. Repeat this layer once more.  Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the final layer of tortillas.
Bake for 20 minutes. Cut into squares and serve.

Description: 
Five ingredients, ten minutes prep time and twenty minutes to cook - now that's what I call cheating, since it tastes good and takes little time to make these enchiladas.
