Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
6 (3 ounce) fillets mahi mahi fillets
1/3 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 dash cayenne pepper
1 large mango - peeled, seeded and diced
1 cup diced fresh pineapple
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1 jalapeno pepper, minced
6 (6 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the mahi-mahi with salt and pepper. Cook the fillets in the hot oil until the fish is golden brown on each side, and no longer translucent in the center, about 3 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, whisk together the sour cream, lime juice, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Gently combine the mango, pineapple, avocado, and jalapeno in a bowl.
To assemble, place a cooked mahi-mahi fillet into the center of a warmed tortilla. Place a scoop of the mango salsa onto the fish, then drizzle with the sour cream sauce, and finish with a generous pinch of chopped cilantro.

Description: 
A warm, flavorful dish filled with mahi-mahi, fresh fruit and an exotic ginger-lime dressing. Unique, yet tasteful, this recipe is inspired by the fresh seafood recipes in Mexico and Central America. I serve chips and salsa on the side.
