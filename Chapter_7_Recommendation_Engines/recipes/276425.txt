Ingredients:
4 links garlic-flavored chicken sausage
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 celery ribs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 onion, diced
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
7 eggs, beaten, or to taste
1 cup chopped spinach
1/2 bunch chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons garlic salt seasoning
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper (optional)
2 teaspoons all-purpose seasoning or seasoning of your choice
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place sausage links in a skillet and cover with cold water. Cook over medium-high heat just until water reaches a gentle simmer, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove sausages to a plate, drain the skillet, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Heat oil over medium-high heat. Add sausages and cook until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove sausages, allow to cool, and slice into 1/2-inch slices. Transfer to a large bowl.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add celery and onion and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the sausage. Add diced tomatoes, eggs, spinach, parsley, bouillon, garlic salt seasoning, black pepper, crushed pepper, and all-purpose seasoning. Mix until combined and transfer to a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese generously over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Broil casserole for an additional 5 minutes until cheese is crispy.
