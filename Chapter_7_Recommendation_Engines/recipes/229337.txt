Ingredients:
30 graham crackers, crushed
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
3 eggs
1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup chopped dates

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.
Mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter in a bowl; press into the bottom of the prepared pan to make a pie crust.
Beat sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Fold walnuts and dates into the milk mixture with a spatula; pour into prepared pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes; cut into bars while still warm. Place each square on a cupcake liner to serve.

Description: 
This was the recipe for date pie that my great grandmother from Syria used to make. I call them 'Date Brownies' because I cut them in squares. I'm never going to understand how such an easy recipe is according to everyone I know 'my specialty.'
