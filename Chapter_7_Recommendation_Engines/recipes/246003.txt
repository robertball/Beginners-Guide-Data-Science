Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 white onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup almond flour
1 large egg
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 sprigs fresh basil, chopped
1 pinch garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®), or to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix ground turkey, onion, almond flour, egg, garlic, basil, seasoning blend, and black pepper together thoroughly in a bowl. Form 5 burger patties using about 1/3 cup of the turkey mixture for each.
Cook turkey burgers on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
The great thing about homemade burgers is that they can easily be modified accordingly, and these turkey burgers are great for those who are gluten-intolerant, follow a gluten-free diet, or simply wish to avoid bread crumbs in their mixture without sacrificing taste or texture (like me).
