Ingredients:
Berries:
4 cups blueberries
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 lemon, juiced
water, to cover
1 teaspoon cornstarch, or more as needed
1/4 cup cold water
Batter:
1 cup milk
1 cup self-rising flour
1 cup white sugar
1 egg (optional)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste
1/4 cup melted butter, or to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 teaspoon coarse sugar, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine blueberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan with enough water to just cover; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until the berries pop and the sugar is dissolved completely, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir cornstarch into 1/4 cup cold water; stir into blueberry mixture. Continue cooking blueberries until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes more. (Mixture will thicken as it cools.)
Whisk milk, flour, 1 cup sugar, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.
Swirl melted butter in the bottom of an 8-inch square deep baking dish to coat. Pour batter over the butter. Sprinkle cinnamon over the batter; top with the berries mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until the batter is no longer wet, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle coarse sugar over the cobbler. Cool 15 minutes before serving.
