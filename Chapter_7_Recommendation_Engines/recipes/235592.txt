Ingredients:
12 jumbo-size (3 1/2-inch) foil baking cups

1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, undrained
1 (1 ounce) envelope taco seasoning mix
1 (8.5 ounce) package corn muffin mix
1 egg
1/3 cup milk
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 12 (2 1/2-inch) muffin-pan cups with the baking cups.
Cook the beef in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the soup, corn, chiles and taco seasoning.
Mix the corn muffin mix, egg and milk according to the package directions.
Spoon about 1/4 cup beef mixture into each baking cup. Spread about 1 tablespoon corn muffin batter on each.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the corn muffin topping is golden brown. Top each with 1 tablespoon cheese.
Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
