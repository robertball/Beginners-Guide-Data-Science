Ingredients:
1 ½ cups butter
1 ½ cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 ½ teaspoons vanilla
1 Tablespoon almond extract
½ cup sour cream or plain yogurt
½ cup cream cheese
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
4 ½ cups flour

Directions:
Cream butter and sugars, cream cheese and sour cream; then add eggs, vanilla, and almond extract.
Combine well.
Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl, then mix with wet ingredients until combined.
You may chill dough or drop by teaspoons onto a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 8-12 minutes depending on your oven.  Remove when cookies lose their shine but before they brown.  Moist, almost undercooked is preferable to dry and overcooked.
Let cool.
Serve plain, or melt dark chocolate and dip each cookie halfway in and let cool on wax paper.
