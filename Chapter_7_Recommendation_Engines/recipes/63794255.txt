Ingredients:
Graham cracker crust:
1 cup ground graham crackers
5 T melted butter
3 T white sugar
Mix well and spread into 9" springform pan that has been spread with melted butter.
Filling:
24 oz. room temperature cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
3 eggs, room temperature
1 cup caramel apple pie filling, finely chopped
1 tsp. cinnamon
1/8 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg
Topping:
Caramel sauce of your choice. I prefer homemade.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350*.
Press crust into buttered spring form pan, set aside.
Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla well & until creamy & smooth. Add eggs, one at a time until well incorporated. Mix in caramel apple pie filling, cinnamon & nutmeg into batter until well mixed.
Spoon batter into crust. Place springform pan on cookie sheet. Add a small metal container filled with water next to cheesecake.
Place in preheated oven and bake 45 minutes or until center is almost set. Cool 5 minutes, run knife around sides to minimize cracking. Continue to cool completely. Refrigerate to chill. Serve with caramel sauce drizzled over the top.
