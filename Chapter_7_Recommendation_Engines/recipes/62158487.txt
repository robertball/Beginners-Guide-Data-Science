Ingredients:
2 C. flour
2 Tbl. granulate sugar
2 Tbl. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 C. butter
1 egg
1/2 C. milk
2 Tbl. softened butter
3 Tbl. finely chopped pecans
3 Tbl. packed brown sugar
1 C. powdered sugar
1-2 Tbl. milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450.
Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in 1/2 C. butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Or for speed and ease, put all dry ingredients in a food processor.
Combine beaten egg and milk, and add to dry mixture until dough clings together.  Knead gently on lightly floured surface.  Roll to a 14 x 8 rectangle.
Spread with the softened butter.  Sprinkle with the brown sugar and pecans. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and cut into 1" strips.  Hold each strip at both ends and twist in opposite directions twice, forming a spiral.  Please spirals on a lightly greased baking sheet, pressing ends down to keep the spirals from unrolling.
Bake at 450 for 10 minutes.
Combine powdered sugar and milk until drizzling consistency.  Drizzle on spirals.
