Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups butter (3 sticks), softened at room temperature
1 cup canola oil
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
In a lidded, plastic storage container stir butter until it has a smooth, frosting-like consistency.
Mix the oils in a clear measuring pitcher. Slowly, add one tablespoon or so at a time to the softened butter for the first half of a cup of oil; mix well after each addition until smooth.  Stir in the remaining oil a little more quickly, mixing well.
Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until set.
Store in refrigerator.  If the 'butter' melts after being left out, refrigerate to restore solidified quality.
