Ingredients:
Zucchini -- 1 large.
3 tablespoon butter
1 clove minced garlic
1/2 cup Parmesan shredded

Directions:
Make a foil pan approximately 9x12.; spray non stick oil on foil; melt butter in small container and add minced garlic.   Thinly slice the zucchini and lay it out in rows.  I used a mandolin.  Slices can overlap.  Brush butter on each slice and then sprinkle with the Parmesan.  Grilled at about 350 for 12-15 minutes.
