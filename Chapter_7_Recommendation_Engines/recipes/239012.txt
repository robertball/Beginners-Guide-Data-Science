Ingredients:
cooking spray
2/3 cup warm water
1/4 cup instant coffee granules
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup oil
4 eggs
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 24 muffin cups with cooking spray or line with paper liners.
Combine warm water and coffee granules together in a cup until coffee is dissolved; pour into a large bowl. Mix flour, sugar, pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, eggs, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and baking powder into coffee until batter is thoroughly mixed; fold in chocolate chips. Fill muffin cups with batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
