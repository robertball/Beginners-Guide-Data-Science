Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package square wonton wrappers
1 pound sage-flavored bulk sausage
2 cups shredded Colby cheese
1 bunch green onions, chopped fine
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped fine
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped fine
1/2 cup ranch salad dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Line each cup a mini-muffin pan with a wonton wrapper, carefully pressing each into the shape of a cup. Take care to not tear the wrapper as they will tear easily.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer 'cups' to a baking sheet; repeat until remaining wontons are all baked.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Set sausage aside to cool.
Stir cooled sausage, Colby cheese, green onions, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and ranch salad dressing together in a bowl; spoon into the wonton cups.
Bake in oven until cheese has melted and is beginning to bubble, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a fabulous appetizer; it does take a little time to prepare, but the taste is well worth it. If you want to freeze them for later use, they turn out just as good; just pop them in the freezer after filling the cups and then bake a bit longer then in the original recipe.
