1/4 cup chilled butter
1/4 cup shortening
4 tablespoons ice water, or more as needed

Wrap dough in plastic wrap; let rest in a refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before using.

Description: 
Many British recipes call for shortcrust pastry. This makes a great alternative to pre-made crusts. Because it is so easy to make in batches, I make extra to freeze for later use. This pastry dough can also be kept in the fridge for 2 to 3 days.
