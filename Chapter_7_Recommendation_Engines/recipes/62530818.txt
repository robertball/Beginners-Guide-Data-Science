Description: 
I made these for our Church Thanksgiving Dinner so I could make them when I had time.  I needed to make 10 lbs. of mashed potatoes and I didn't want to do it at the last minute so I tried this recipe.  It fits perfectly in my crockpot.
*** They must have been acceptable because they were all eaten! :)Modified from: 10 lbs.Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes
