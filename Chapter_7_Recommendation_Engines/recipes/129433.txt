Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless venison roast
1 liter ginger ale
1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 (15 ounce) can pork and beans
1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15.5 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14 ounce) can baked beans
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 large green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion, coarsely chopped
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup molasses
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 tablespoons chili powder
Hot pepper sauce, to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
5 bacon slices

Directions:
Place venison roast, ginger ale, chicken broth, 1 teaspoon cumin, pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes into a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low until the venison is tender enough to be pulled apart with a fork, about 10 hours. Drain meat, and shred.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place shredded pork into a large mixing bowl and mix with pork and beans, black beans, kidney beans, baked beans, tomatoes, green pepper, and onion. Pour in barbeque sauce, brown sugar, and molasses. Season with 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, chili powder, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper. Mix until well combined, then pour into a deep 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Place bacon strips in a single layer over top.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes until bacon has cooked and begins to crisp.
