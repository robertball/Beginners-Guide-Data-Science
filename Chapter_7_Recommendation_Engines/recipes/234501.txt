Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
1 pound Italian sausage, casings removed
1 (10 ounce) package portobello mushrooms, sliced
3/4 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste, divided
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
1 (10 ounce) package frozen peas, partially thawed
1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat; cook and stir sausage in the hot oil, breaking up any large chunks, until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Transfer cooked sausage to a plate.
Heat 2 more tablespoons olive oil in the same large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in the hot oil until mushrooms are tender and all the liquid has evaporated, about 8 minutes.
Stir peas into mushroom mixture and cook until peas are warmed, about 2 minutes. Return sausage to mushroom mixture; cook and stir until flavors have blended and sausage is heated, about 3 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain pasta, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Return pasta to pot and stir in sausage-mushroom mixture; cook and stir, adding reserved pasta water as needed, until mixture is evenly mixed, about 5 minutes.
Drizzle remaining 1/4 cup olive oil over pasta mixture and season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Add Parmesan cheese; toss to combine.
