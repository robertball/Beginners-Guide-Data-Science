Ingredients:
2 lbs. thick-cut bacon
2 tablespoons olive oil
1-2 pounds ground buffalo
3 tablespoons vinegar
3 medium onions, finely sliced
2 20-oz. cans diced tomatoes with green chilis
2 28-oz. cans crushed tomatoes
3-6 cloves of garlic
2 40-oz. cans pinto beans, drained & rinsed
1 tablespoon ground sage
1-1/2 teaspoons fennel
1 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Chop bacon into bite-size pieces. In a large skillet, fry over medium-high high heat until crispy.
While the bacon is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add ground buffalo and vinegar. Stir until browned.
Once the bacon is done, add it to the pot with the ground buffalo, retaining the grease in the skillet. Add the onions to the bacon grease in the skillet and let cook over medium-low heat until caramelized. Be patient, as this can take 20 to 30 minutes depending on the water and sugar content of your onions.
While the onions are going, add the diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, and garlic cloves to your big pot with the meats. Stir regularly!
Once the onions are done, add them to the pot. Add all remaining ingredients and cook over low heat about an hour.
Serve with Greek yogurt on top or over a baked potato.

Description: 
My dad and I developed this recipe together one afternoon when we realized we weren't thrilled with any of the chili recipes we had tried before. This is a sweet and sour recipe with a mild finish, so it's tasty for kids as well as adults.
