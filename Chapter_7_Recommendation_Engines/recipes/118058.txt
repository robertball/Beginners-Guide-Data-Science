Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup fat-free milk
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine, melted
1 cup tart apples - peeled, cored and chopped
TOPPING:
1/4 cup reduced-fat granola cereal
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons fat free milk

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flours, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. In another bowl, beat egg, milk and butter. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in apples. Coat jumbo muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill half full.
For topping, combine the cereal, walnuts, brown sugar, cinnamon and milk. Sprinkle over muffins. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
