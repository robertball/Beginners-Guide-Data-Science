Easy Homemade Bread by Ansally Recipe

Ingredients:
1 1/2 Tablespoons yeast
2 cups water (lukewarm)
2/3 cups sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup canola (or vegetable) oil
5-6 cups flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix yeast, water, and sugar.  Let it sit until very foamy and bubbly (about 10 minutes)
While yeast mixture is sitting, grease 2 average sized bread pans; be sure to grease well.
Mix into the yeast mixture salt, oil and flour (one cup at a time). Continue adding flour until the dough is slightly sticky.
Knead dough (8 minutes if kneading by hand, 4 minutes if kneading with a dough hook in a mixer). If kneading by hand, be sure to knead on a lightly floured surface.
Separate dough in half. Make each half into an oblong roll (the size of the bread pan) and place into the bread pans.
Cover and let rise in the pan for 30 minutes, until doubled in size.
Place in preheated oven and cook until top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
Remove from oven; remove the bread from the pan and set on a cooling rack to cool. (if you don't do this, the bread will "sweat" inside the pan and get mushy.)
ENJOY!
