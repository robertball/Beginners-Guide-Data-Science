Ingredients:
1 3.9 oz box of instant pudding (recommend: vanilla or white chocolate)
1 1/2 cups milk
1 8 oz package of cream cheese- room temperature
1 15 oz can of mandarin oranges- drained
1/2 quart of strawberries- hulled and quartered
1 15 oz can of pineapple bits- drained
1 8 oz tub of whipped topping
OPTIONAL: 1/2-1 cup pecans, walnuts or almonds
OPTIONAL: 1/2 cup of flaked coconut

Directions:
Place room temperature cream cheese in a large mixing bowl.
Add the instant pudding packet and the 1 1/2 cups of milk.
Beat the ingredients together until blended.  DO NOT OVER BLEND.  The mix will be "chunky" with small pieces of cream cheese.  It will be also be a little thicker than regular instant pudding made according to the directions.
Place in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes until set.
Drain the oranges and pineapple.  Set aside on a papertowel to continue draining.
Hull and quarter the strawberries.
Remove the pudding mix from the refrigerator.
Add the fruits and stir gently. If using the optional nuts and/or coconut, add at this time also.
Add the entire tub of whipped topping and gently fold into the pudding & fruit mixture.
Return to the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.
Serve cold.

Description: 
My mom makes a cook-top version of this recipe.  It's TOO HOT in Texas most of the time to stand over a stove and stir a custard, so I came up with this cooler and easier way of making her favorite Creamy Fruit Salad. Change up the fruits and pudding flavor as you want!  You can also make this low fat or fat free with the same tasty results.
