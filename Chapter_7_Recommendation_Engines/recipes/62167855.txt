Ingredients:
4-1/2 cups white vinegar
3-1/2 cups water
2-1/2 tbsps. dry crushed red pepper
1-1/2 tbsps. minced garlic
3 lbs. smoked kielbasa or smoked sausage cut into even links
6 bay leaves

Directions:
Mix the brine by combining the first four ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Place sausage and bay leaves into gallon sized and sterilized glass jug.
Pour brine over sausage and seal with jar lid.
Sausage will be ready in two days, but it gets better the longer it sits.  Should be kept refrigerated,and shaking every day or two keeps the brine mixed.
Note: Depending on what sausage you use (IE: casing vs. skinless, it might not all fit in the jar.
