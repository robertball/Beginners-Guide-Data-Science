Add the flour and whisk until incorporated.
Add the chicken broth, half and half, salt, roasted garlic, pepper and parmesan cheese -- each one at a time building a layered flavor.  Whisk after each addition.  Allow the mixture to thicken for a minute and then toss with the cooked linguine noodles.
Place the pieces chicken between a piece of plastic wrap and pound the chicken out flat with a rolling pin.
Prepare three pie plates for the chicken
One with flour, salt, pepper, garlic, and onion mixture.
The second with eggs
The third with panko bread crumbs, minced garlic, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning
Coat the pieces of chicken in flour, then egg, then the bread crumb mixture, set aside.
In a nonstick skillet melt a bit of butter and olive oil.  Cook the chicken on each side on medium for 3 to 4 minutes until it is brown and crispy.
