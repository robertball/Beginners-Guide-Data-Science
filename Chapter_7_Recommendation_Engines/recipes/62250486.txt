Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbs. olive oil
1 can fire-roasted tomatoes
1 package creamed spinach
6 oz. linguine
salt and pepper to taste
OPTIONAL: add chicken breast or shrimp

Directions:
Bring water for linguine to a boil and cook until 'al dente' (about 10-12 minutes). While linguine is cooking, saute garlic in olive oil for about one minute and defrost creamed spinach according to package directions. Add fire-roasted tomatoes and bring to a simmer for about one minute.  Add creamed spinach to the tomatoes and garlic. Once linguine is done, stir into the sauce until well-coated. For a heartier meal, add some cooked chicken breast or shrimp
