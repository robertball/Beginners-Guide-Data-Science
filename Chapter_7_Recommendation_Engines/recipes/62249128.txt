Ingredients:
Blame The Dog Casserole
Serves 6-8 but can be doubled. Great as a side dish with burgers, etc.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One 28-ounce can baked beans
0ne 16 to 20 ounce can drained, dark red kidney beans
1/2 cup chopped onions ( I use the frozen kind)
1/4 cup chopped celery
One pound polish kielbasa, sliced 1/4 inch thick
0ne pound smoked sausage, also sliced
1/2 cup catsup
8-ounce can tomato sauce
1 tsp. garlic (or to taste)
dash of Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp. mustard (dry)
1/2 cup red wine (use apple juice if you want)

Directions:
Combine in 3-quart baking dish and bake at 350 for about an hour. Spoon off any excess liquid but save it in case the casserole gets too thick.  Or toss in some more wine!
You can also cook it in a slow cooker, but will need to drain off more of the liquid from time to time. Takes about 4 hours on high.( I prefer to bake it, and sometimes lay slices of bacon on top.)
Serve this alone as a main dish with coleslaw and crusty rolls, or as a side dish.
