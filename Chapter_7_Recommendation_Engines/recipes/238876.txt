Ingredients:
1 small spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
Sauce:
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce
1 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons cold water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Vegetables:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package broccoli coleslaw mix
1 zucchini, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 cup sliced green onions
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 cubed cooked chicken breasts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash, cut-side up, on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Shred squash meat using a fork and discard the peel.
Combine chicken broth, peanut butter, chile-garlic sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, oyster sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and black pepper together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; add to broth mixture and continue boiling until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute broccoli slaw, zucchini, red bell pepper, green onion, cilantro, and shredded spaghetti squash until tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken and sauce to squash mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
