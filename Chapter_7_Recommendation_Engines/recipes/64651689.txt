Ingredients:
2 sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Clean and wipe potatoes.  At this point you can cut the potatoes with the skin on but I had already peeled them before I decided to make chips.  (I liked cutting them pretty thin).  A sharp chefs knife will work fine as well.
Place potatoes in a bowl then drizzle melted coconut and season with salt and pepper.  Use your hands to coat the sliced potatoes evenly.
Take a large baking sheet and line with parchment paper.  Lay each potato in a single layer on the baking sheet.
Bake for 20-25 minutes; flipping once during baking.  Enjoy alone or with my Sriracha Dipping Sauce!
Enjoy

Description: 
Hubby and I love sweet potato fries with our burgers!  However tonight as was I holding 2 thin sweet potatoes I quickly decided to change it up a little.  I took out my mandoline to make chips!  As a little surprise I even made a Paleo sriracha dipping sauce!
