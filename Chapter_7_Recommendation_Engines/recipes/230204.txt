Ingredients:
3 bananas, mashed
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
3 tablespoons buttermilk
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease 14 muffin cups.
Lightly beat bananas and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth; add eggs, one at a time, until incorporated. Beat in vegetable oil until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in flour, baking soda, and buttermilk; mix well. Fold in pecans. Pour batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle cupcakes with confectioners' sugar.
