Ingredients:
24 chicken wings
1 cup barbecue sauce
1 cup honey
1/2 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
Onion Powder
Garlic Powder
Pepper

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tip section.
Mix onion and garlic powders and pepper.
Place in plastic bag.  Add wings to coat.
Place on a foil lined rimmed cookie sheet that has been sprayed with Pam Olive Oil spray.  (May opt to place a rack on the cookie sheet and the wings on the rack so the fat can drip away. Be sure to line the pan with foil though for easy clean up).
Bake at 400 for 30-45 min, turn and bake for an additional 30-45 min.
While the wings are baking, combine barbeque sauce, honey and soy sauce in a bowl and set aside.
Remove wings from oven.
Using a spoon dip each wing in the sauce to coat well and return it to the pan.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F until crispy/chewy, approx. 20 min.
