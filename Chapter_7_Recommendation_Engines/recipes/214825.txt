Ingredients:
2 slices whole grain bread
2 teaspoons butter
2 slices Swiss cheese
2 thin slices deli ham
1 teaspoon mayonnaise
1 teaspoon whole grain mustard

Directions:
Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat.
Spread one side of each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon butter. Place one slice, butter-side down in the hot skillet. Top with Swiss cheese and ham. Spread the unbuttered side of the second slice of bread with mayonnaise and mustard; place it, butter-side up on top of the sandwich. Cook until the sandwich is golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side.
