Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat
½ cup Italian-style salad dressing
1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
1 ½ teaspoons honey

Directions:
Slice chicken into thin strips. In a small bowl mix together the dressing, lime juice and honey. Place chicken strips in a 9x13 inch baking dish and pour mixture over chicken, covering all. Cover dish and refrigerate to marinate for 1 hour.
Remove chicken from marinade, discarding any remaining marinade. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute chicken strips until lightly browned and cooked through (juices run clear), 12 to 15 minutes.

I used to love the chicken tenderloins at a well-known restaurant chain. With this recipe, I can make them at home and they are just as good!!
