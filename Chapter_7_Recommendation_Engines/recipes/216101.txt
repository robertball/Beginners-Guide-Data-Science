Ingredients:
3 smoked turkey legs, cut into 1-inch thick pieces
4 chicken bouillon cubes
4 red bell peppers - cored, seeded, and cut into chunks
6 tomatoes, cut into chunks
1 onion, cut into chunks
4 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped (wear gloves)
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup vegetable oil
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the turkey legs into a large saucepan, pour in enough water to barely cover, and add the bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook until the water has nearly evaporated, about 30 minutes. Place the red bell peppers, tomatoes, onion, habanero peppers, garlic, and tomato paste into a blender, and blend until the vegetables are pureed. Be careful because the habanero peppers are very hot -- don't touch your eyes after handling peppers.
Heat the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat, and pour the blended mixture into the oil. Reduce heat and simmer until the oil separates and the sauce begins to fry, about 30 minutes; stir the turkey into the sauce, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes to blend the flavors. Season to taste with salt.
