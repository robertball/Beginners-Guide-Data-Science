Ingredients:
1 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 sprig fresh rosemary, bruised
6 lamb chops
2 eggs
1 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Mix together Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic and rosemary in a non-reactive bowl. Place the lamb chops in the marinade and turn. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 1/2 to 3 hours, turning once or twice.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.
Remove lamb chops from marinade and set them aside. Discard the rosemary sprig. Whisk eggs into the leftover marinade. Spread breadcrumbs on a large plate.
Dip lamb chops into the egg/marinade mixture, then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Place the breaded chops into the prepared baking dish. Discard marinade/egg mixture.
Bake for 20 minutes and turn chops over. Bake for 15 more minutes or to desired doneness.

Description: 
I found a lot of great recipes out there for grilled lamb chops but only one for breaded, and it didn't have a lot of flavor.  So I came up with this easy recipe myself a few years ago.  It's bursting with flavor and has become a comfort food staple in our home.  Use plain or Italian bread crumbs. We like it with a Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes.
