Ingredients:
Olive oil for greasing pan
1 pound lean ground beef
1/3 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 egg
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (24 ounce) jar Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional Pasta Sauce
12 ounces spaghetti, cooked and drained
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.
Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, mozzarella cheese, and garlic in a medium bowl. Use a 1/4 cup measure or ice cream scoop to portion into 12 to 13 meatballs. Place on prepared baking sheet.
Baked until browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Bring the Ragu(R) Sauce to a simmer in a 12-inch skillet. Gently place the cooked meatballs into the sauce. Simmer 10 minutes.
Ladle some of the sauce over hot pasta and toss to coat. Serve with more sauce and the meatballs with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.
