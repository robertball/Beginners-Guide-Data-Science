1 cup of Raisins
1/2 cup crumbled bacon
1 1/2 cups of Broccoli
1 cup cashews
1 red onion
Mayonnaise
Red wine vinegar

Directions:
Separate broccoli heads from the stalk. Cook bacon (let cool) then place bacon in a large freezer bag, zip shut and crumble bacon. Dice onion.
Mix Broccoli, bacon, red onion, cashews and raisins in a large bowl, set aside.
In a separate bowl combine approximately 1 cup of mayonnaise and 1/4 cup of Red wine vinegar, stir. You will need to adjust the combination of these two ingredients to your taste. You want to make sure that it isn't too vinegary or tastes too much like mayonnaise.
pour sauce in with the rest of the ingredients and mix well then serve.
