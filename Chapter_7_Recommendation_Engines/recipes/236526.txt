2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar

Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks in a bowl. Mash yolks with a fork until smooth; stir in mayonnaise,  green onions, rice wine vinegar, and wasabi paste. Season with salt.
Arrange egg white halves cut-side-up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into whites; garnish each egg half with pickled ginger and pea shoots.
