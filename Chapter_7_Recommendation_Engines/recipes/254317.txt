Ingredients:
1 cup buttermilk
2 ripe bananas, mashed
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
1 (18 ounce) package brownie mix
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin tin with liners.
Whisk buttermilk, bananas, and eggs together in a bowl; gradually stir in coconut oil.
Combine brownie mix, oats, all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in buttermilk mixture. Stir together until batter is just moistened.
Divide batter among muffin liners, filling each 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in the pan, 10 to 15 minutes. Move to a rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
After a boxed brownie mix languished in my cupboard for some time, I decided to turn it into something I knew my tennis-playing son would eat. This recipe arose from comparing a brownie recipe with a muffin recipe, and adding the differences to the mix. To finish, I simply sprinkled powdered sugar over the tops, but I'm sure other toppings would be great as well.
