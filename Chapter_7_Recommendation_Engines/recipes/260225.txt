Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 pounds ground round beef
1 pound ground turkey breast
3/4 cup unseasoned dry bread crumbs
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3 eggs, slightly beaten
1/4 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3 tablespoons ketchup, or to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar

Directions:
Grease a slow cooker with cooking spray.
Combine ground round and turkey in a bowl; mix until fully combined. Stir in bread crumbs, soup mix, parsley flakes, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add eggs, 1/4 cup ketchup, and mustard; mix well. Form meat mixture into a loaf. Place in the slow cooker. Cook on High until no longer pink in the center, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Mix 3 tablespoons ketchup and brown sugar together in a small bowl to make the glaze. Spread over the meatloaf; continue cooking until glaze is set, about 1 hour more.
