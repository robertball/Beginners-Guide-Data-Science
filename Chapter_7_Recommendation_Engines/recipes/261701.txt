Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 pounds tomatoes, diced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
20 fresh mint leaves, chopped
1 teaspoon ground paprika
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon harissa
1 pinch saffron threads
4 cups water, or more to taste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, chickpeas, cilantro, parsley, mint, paprika, turmeric, ginger, harissa, and saffron. Add water and cook over medium heat until flavors have combined, about 30 minutes.
Mix a few tablespoons of soup liquid with flour and cornstarch in a small bowl and return to the soup, stirring in well. Add cherry tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer over low heat until soup thickens, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Harira is a famous Moroccan soup, and here's a hearty vegetarian (and vegan!) version - packed with tomatoes and chickpeas and flavored with paprika, turmeric, saffron, ginger, and harissa. The amount of water can be adjusted depending on the thickness you want. I like this soup pretty thick and nourishing, so I do not add too much water.
