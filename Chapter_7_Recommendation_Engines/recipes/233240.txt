Ingredients:
3/4 pound butter
1 large onion, minced
2 tablespoons poppy seeds, or to taste
1 (1 pound) loaf sourdough French bread
1 pound white American cheese, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion in the melted butter until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir poppy seeds into onion mixture.
Cut bread into slices, leaving them still attached on the bottom of the loaf. Put an American cheese slice into each slit; spoon poppy seed mixture into each slit. Wrap loaf with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
