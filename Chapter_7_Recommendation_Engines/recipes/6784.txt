Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
6 cups bread flour

Directions:
Mix yeast, warm water, and white sugar together in a large bowl.  Set aside for five minutes, or until mixture becomes foamy.
Stir olive oil, salt, herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, cheese, and 3 cups flour into the yeast mixture.  Gradually mix in the next three cups of flour.  Dough will be stiff.
Knead dough for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it is smooth and rubbery.  Place in an oiled bowl, and turn to cover the surface of the dough with oil.  Cover with a damp linen dish towel.  Allow to rise for one hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.
Punch dough down to release all the air.  Shape into two loaves.  Place loaves on a greased cookie sheet, or into two greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Allow to rise until doubled in size, about a 30 minutes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes.  Remove loaves from pan(s), and let cool on wire racks for at least 15 minutes before slicing.
