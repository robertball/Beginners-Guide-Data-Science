Ingredients:
24 - Raw Jumbo Shrimp (or more if you LOVE shrimp)
12 - Fresh Chiles Gueritos (Yellow Jalapeno Peppers, or you can use the regular jalapenos if you enjoy spicy foods)
12 - Slices of bacon (or double if you REALLY love bacon)
12 - Corn Tortillas
Sauce:
1/2C - Soy Sauce
1/4C - Water
1 - Bunch green onions (chopped with stalks)
Juice of 5 Limes
Pepper - To Taste

Directions:
Seed Peppers - (slice a "T" on your pepper) On the stem side of the pepper, cut width wise halfway down the pepper,  you do not want to cut the stem off, this will help your shrimp stay in the pepper, it will also allow you to turn the peppers easily while frying them.  Now make a slit along the length of the pepper.   Remove seeds and veins.
Stuff each pepper with two (or more) shrimp.
Wrap 1 strip (or two) of bacon around pepper and tuck ends underneath.
Put wrapped peppers in HOT pan and fry,  turn peppers until bacon is nice and crisp toss in sauce.  If you put the pepper with the ends tucked under you should not need toothpicks to hold the bacon in place but you can use toothpicks if needed.
Sauce:
In a bowl combine all ingredients
Warm up corn tortillas
Wrap a pepper in a tortilla, spoon some fo the sauce over it and enjoy!!
