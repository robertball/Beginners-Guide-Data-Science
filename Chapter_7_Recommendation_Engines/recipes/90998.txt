Ingredients:
4 cups whole milk
1/2 cup fine semolina
1 cup sugar
2/3 cup unsalted butter
4 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough, thawed
2/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
3 cups water
2 cups sugar
1/2 large lemon

Directions:
In a 4 to 6 quart heavy pot, bring the milk to a boil, and reduce heat to low.  Sprinkle in the semolina, whisking constantly.  Add the sugar, and simmer for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from the heat, whisk in 2/3 cup of the butter, and add eggs one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Blend in the vanilla.  The mixture will be thick but pourable, like a soft polenta.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan.  Line bottom with 8 sheets of phyllo, layering them one at a time, and brushing each sheet with butter.  The sheets will be larger than the baking pan.  Be certain that the bottom is covered by pressing the dough into the corners, and allow the excess to run up the sides of the pan.  Phyllo sheets not in use should always be covered with a damp towel.
Pour the milk filling over the sheets.  Cover with remaining 12 sheets of phyllo, repeating the layering process, and brushing each sheet with butter.
With a very sharp knife, trim the dough around the edges of the pan, and score the top diagonally in two directions to make diamond-shaped slits on the surface.  Sprinkle the top with a little water, and bake 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Check after 45 minutes, pie is done when top is light brown and the filling is set.
As soon as the pie is in the oven, begin to make the syrup. Combine water and sugar in a 4 quart sauce pan.  Squeeze the halved lemon in the sugared water, and drop the juiced half in the liquid.  Simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes.  Discard the lemon.  Very carefully, because syrup can boil vigorously, pour the hot syrup over the pie as soon as it is removed from the oven.
Let the pie cool completely and then serve by cutting along the diagonal scores made prior to baking.
