Ingredients:
3/4 c butter, melted (I put it in an oven-safe bowl and let it melt while the oven is preheating to 375 degrees)
1 c white sugar
1 egg
1/4 c molasses
2 c. all-purpose flour
2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/3 c. white sugar (to roll dough in)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a medium bowl, mix together the melted butter, sugar, and egg until smooth.  Stir in the molasses.  Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg; blend into the molasses mixture.  Cover and chill dough for one hour.
Roll dough into walnut-sized balls and roll them in the 1/3 c. sugar.  Place balls 2-inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until tops are cracked.  Cool on wire racks.

Description: 
I love the taste of ginger snaps, but don't really like hard cookies.  This recipe has the ginger taste I love and the texture is perfect-o!
