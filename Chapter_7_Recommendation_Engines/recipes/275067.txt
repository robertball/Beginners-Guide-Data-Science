Description: 
Similar to scalloped potatoes, but...well, different. I searched your site and didn't find anything with my ingredients, although there were slow cooker dishes with potatoes in it. Hope you like it. I got this recipe from an elderly neighbor when my husband and I lived in Baltimore, MD. It's entirely her creation. I've taken this dish to family affairs, church potlucks, and picnics. I always have an empty Crock PotÂ® to bring home.
