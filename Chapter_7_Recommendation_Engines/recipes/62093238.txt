Creamy Coffee Granita Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups strongly brewed coffee
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup half & half

Directions:
Add sugar to brewed coffee, stir until sugar is dissolved.
Allow to cool to room temperature.
Once cooled stir in half & half.
Pour mixture into 8 or 9 inch square pan.
Freeze until firm, stirring every 30 minutes, for about 4 to 5 hours.
Before serving scrape surface of granita with fork.
Texture should resemble chipped ice.
Scoop spoonfuls into chilled glasses and serve with a spoon.
Can be kept covered, frozen for up to 3 days.
You can adjust the sugar to suit your taste.
I recommend using half & half instead of milk for an added creaminess, but in the interest of cutting down on fat and a few calories you can definitely use fat-free half & half.
Another tasty idea is to use a flavored coffee creamer in place of part or all of the half & half.
