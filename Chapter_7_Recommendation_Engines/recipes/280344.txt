Description: 
Bechamel is such a wonderful ingredient for so many dishes. With tuna casserole, bechamel eliminates the need for a canned cream soup... its thick, creamy texture clings to the pasta and adds tremendous flavor overall. The amount used in this recipe keeps the entire casserole light but still filling.
