Ingredients:
500 g flour
20 g fresh yeast
2 Tsp. salt
40 g margarine
300 mL milk
4 Tbl. baking soda
coarse salt

Directions:
Mix flour and salt.
Make a well in the middle of the flour, and add the yeast to the well.
Melt the margarine.
Pour the liquid margarine over the yeast and mix.
Knead the dough through.
Immediately form the pretzels by rolling the dough into a long snake with a thicker middle and thinner ends and folding into a pretzel shape.
Boil 1 liter water and add the baking soda.
Add each pretzel with a slotted spoon to the boiling water for 30 seconds, holding lightly under the surface of the water.
Transfer the pretzel to baking pan or paper.
Cut a slit in the "stomach" of the pretzel: the thicker middle/bottom part.
Sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake at 200ÂºC until brown.
Immediately after baking spray them with water so that they become shiny.

Description: 
In German, these are called Brezels. I learned this recipe from Frau Kraut, a real German housewife. The baking soda bath gives German brezels their striking deep brown color.
