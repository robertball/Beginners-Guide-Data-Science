Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1 cup sour cream
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups blueberries, rinsed, drained, and floured
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped nuts
1/2 tsp cinnamon
confectioners sugar for topping

Directions:
Cream butter until light and fluffy
Beat in sugar, then eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth
Stir in sour cream.
Add vanilla.
Add flour, baking soda, salt – mixed together.
Beat until smooth and well blended.
Fold in blueberries.
Spread half of the batter into a greased 9x12x2 inch baking pan.  (I like to use a tube pan – greased and floured.)
In another bowl, mix brown sugar, nuts, and cinnamon.
Sprinkle mixture evenly over top of batter in pan.
Spread remaining batter over top.  ( The batter will stick to the cinnamon mixture.  Pour carefully and spread with a knife as you pour.)
Bake in 350 degree oven for 40-45 min.
Before serving dust with confectioners sugar.
