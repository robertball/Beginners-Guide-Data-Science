Remove kale leaves from stems; finely chop leaves and massage with oil in a large bowl until dark green and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cherry tomatoes and sprinkle with kosher salt. Add feta cheese, cranberries, couscous, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds.

Description: 
This kale salad with cranberries is called circus salad in our house because it is so colorful and fun! This is a super wholesome salad with all-natural ingredients and no added oils or sugar. Try using quinoa instead of couscous, add warm asparagus on top, or stir in roasted, diced sweet potatoes and onions for even more color and nutrients. This keeps well for days - I usually make a big batch and have it for lunch through the week.
