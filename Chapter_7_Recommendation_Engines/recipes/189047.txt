Ingredients:
1/2 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, minced
1 celery stalk, minced
1 small carrot, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, minced
1/4 scotch bonnet chile pepper, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 cup water
2 potatoes, cubed
2 cups hot water
1 cup frozen French cut green beans, thawed
1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Toss the shrimp, white wine vinegar, seafood seasoning, and cumin together in a bowl.
Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat; cook the onions in the oil until they begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the celery, carrot, red bell pepper, and scotch bonnet pepper; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 3 minutes. Whisk the curry powder into 1/2 cup of water in a small bowl; pour into the pot while also adding the potatoes; mix to coat and allow to cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in 2 cups hot water and bring mixture to a boil. Gently lie the green beans into the pot. Allow the mixture to simmer until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook another 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro leaves over the mixture and season with salt and pepper just before serving.

Description: 
This is my version of curried potatoes, green beans, and shrimp. It's yummy! This recipe is versatile in that if you want to make it vegetarian just leave out the shrimp! Use a Trinidadian brand of curry powder if available. Serve this over steamed basmati rice or with naan.
