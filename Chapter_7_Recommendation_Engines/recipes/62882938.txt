Ingredients:
5 pounds "party wings"
Vegetable or peanut oil for deep frying
1 cup of your favorite sauce (hot wing sauce, BBQ sauce, etc.)
1 pound carrot sticks or baby carrots
6 celery ribs, cut into sticks
2 cups bleu cheese or Ranch dressing

Directions:
Heat oil in your deep fryer or in a large heavy pot to 375 degrees F.
Rinse "party wings" in a colander, then pat dry with paper towels.  Deep fry wings in batches until almost done, approximately 8-10 minutes per batch.  Drain on paper towels and let cool slightly.
Fry wings a second time, again in batches, until golden brown, approximately 6-8 minutes per batch.  Drain on paper towels again.
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.
While the wings are still hot, put them in a large mixing bowl and pour the sauce over them, tossing to coat.  Using tongs, remove wings from the bowl and place in a single layer on a baking sheet that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.  Baste with any sauce remaining in the mixing bowl, then bake at 375 degrees F until the surface of the wings is almost dry, about 15 minutes.
Serve with carrot sticks or baby carrots, celery sticks, and bleu cheese or Ranch dressing.
