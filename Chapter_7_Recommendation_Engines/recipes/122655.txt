Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2/3 cup honey
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup chopped walnuts, toasted
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, combine milk, honey and butter.  Heat just until the butter is melted.  Cool for 10 minutes.  In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; stir in milk mixture just until combined.  Pour into a greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pan.  Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 hour or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean.  Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.  Serve warm.

Description: 
'When you cut into this wholesome-tasting bread, you can hardly believe it's not a yeast bread,' assures Wendy Skipper of Cornelius, Oregon. 'It's best warm from the oven...however, leftovers are also great toasted the next day.'
