Description: 
Super cheesy and super gooey!  A smooth creamy blend of Swiss and Sharp Cheddar with the sweetness of lobster.  I buy my lobster frozen in a 12 oz package that is mostly claws but already shelled and ready to go.  Side dish for many, or a many course for probably 10 give or take. A great guilty pleasure!
