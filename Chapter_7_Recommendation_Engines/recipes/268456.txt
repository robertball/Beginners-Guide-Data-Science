Ingredients:
6 cups water, or as needed
2 medium red potatoes, thickly sliced
2 large carrots, thickly sliced
4 teaspoons clam base
3 sprigs fresh dill
3 tablespoons butter
2 medium shallots, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno, thinly sliced
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup white wine
1 (14 ounce) can light coconut milk
1 pound cooked crabmeat
1 stalk lemongrass, cut into 4 pieces
2 lemons, juiced
1 tablespoon grated ginger root
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine water, potatoes, carrots, clam base, and dill in a large soup pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
Meanwhile, heat butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add shallots, jalapeno pepper, and garlic. Cook until shallots are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add wine and transfer mixture to the soup pot.
Add coconut milk, crabmeat, lemongrass, lemon juice, and ginger to the soup pot. Add water to desired consistency. Simmer soup about 20 minutes more and season with black pepper.

Description: 
This Thai-inspired crab chowder has some zippy ingredients, balanced to frame the crab without overpowering it. Shelling fresh crab is the most time-intensive and tedious part of the preparation. Taste as you cook; you don't want the ingredients to overpower the delicate taste of the crab.
