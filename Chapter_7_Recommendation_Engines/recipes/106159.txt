Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
2 serrano peppers, minced, or to taste
3/4 teaspoon red chile powder
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
3/4 teaspoon garam masala
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 (14.25 ounce) can tomato puree
1 tablespoon ketchup
8 ounces paneer, cubed
1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas, thawed
whipping cream or half-and-half to taste
chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender and dark brown, about 20 minutes more. Stir in garlic and ginger, and continue cooking for 1 minute.
Reduce heat to low, stir in chopped serrano chiles, and cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle in the red chile powder, cumin, coriander, garam masala, and turmeric; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Pour in tomato puree and ketchup; thin with water to desired consistency. Stir in the paneer and peas; cook to soften peas, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in cream, and increase heat to medium-high. Allow the curry to come to a rolling boil, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
