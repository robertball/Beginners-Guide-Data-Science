Ingredients:
1/2-1 pint container of fresh strawberries
1 tsp honey

Directions:
Wash and hull the strawberries.  Place into a food processor and pulse until strawberries are in a small dice (or chop by hand).
In a medium bowl mix together the softened cream cheese and the honey.  Stir together well.  Fold in the chopped strawberries.
Spread mixture 1/4" thick onto the tortillas and roll up. Place into the refrigerator to chill for at least one to two hours or until ready to serve.
