2. Pound the cutlets, dip in flour seasoned with salt and pepper, set aside on plate
3. Saute cutlets in oil until golden brown and transfer to a clean plate while you saute the remaining cutlets.
4. Pour off fat from pan and away from heat, deglaze the pan with vodka and reduce until the vodka is almost gone.
5. Add the broth and lemon juice. Place in oven-proof pan and continue to bake for 15-20 minutes.
