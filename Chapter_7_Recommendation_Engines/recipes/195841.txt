Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/4 pounds ground turkey
1 cup finely chopped white onion
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard, divided
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup water
1/4 cup finely chopped jalapeno
5 hamburger buns

Directions:
Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat; cook and stir the ground turkey, using the back of a wooden spoon to work the meat into small crumbles as it cooks. When the meat is about half browned, stir in the onion, garlic, and black pepper; cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink.
Stir in 1 tablespoon of the prepared mustard, the cayenne pepper, chili powder, and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring, until the water has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Stir in the remaining mustard and the chopped jalapeno, and cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes. Spoon the mixture onto the hamburger buns.

Description: 
This is a southern tavern with just a bit of a mild kick. You can add more heat by doubling the chili powder and cayenne pepper and adding a few of the seeds from the jalapeno. You can use beef, too! You can serve these on burger buns, in tortillas or in pitas garnished with with some shredded cheddar, pickled jalapeno slices and chipotle mayo. (If you have a more classic taste, American cheese, pickles and ketchup still tastes good as well!)
