Description: 
This is the best Vanilla Ice Cream you'll ever eat.  The pudding makes it so much creamier than plain vanilla ice cream. If you want to add fruit, put the sugar in the chopped fresh fruit ahead of time to sweeten it, and then add to the mixture! Please note: this recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs. Important: be sure to use only fresh eggs for this recipe.
