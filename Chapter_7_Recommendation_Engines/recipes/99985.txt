Ingredients:
1 cup cottage cheese
2 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons semolina flour
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
1/3 cup canola oil for frying

Directions:
Mix together the cottage cheese, eggs, and sugar. Stir in semolina and all-purpose flour, and work into a soft dough. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll into a 1-inch thick log. Slice the log into 8 pieces, then pat each piece in additional flour to form a patty.
Heat the oil over medium heat until hot. Fry the syrniki in hot oil until golden brown on each side, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
