Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound sausage
26 oz. spaghetti sauce
16 oz. cottage cheese
1 pint ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
8 oz. mozarella cheese
2 eggs
16 oz. lasagna noodles
1/4 cup milk
15 oz. tomatoe sauce
2 tbsp. brown sugar
2 tbsp. parsley
1 tsp. oregano
1 tsp. basil
1 tsp. garlic powder
1/4 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Brown the ground beef and sausage in a skillet & drain.
Add spaghetti & tomatoe sauce back to skillet with meat.
Add parsley, oregano, brown sugar, basil, garlic powder, & pepper.
Simmer for 15 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, combine the cottage, ricotta, & parmesan cheese.
Add the milk and eggs to this mixture and blend.
Spread a thin layer of the sauce mixture to a 11 3/4 X 9 1/4 foil pan.
Place three uncooked noodles on top.
Follow this by a thin layer of the cheese mixture and then by the mozarella.
Keep 1/2 cup of mozarella reserved for later.
Repeat these layers three times.
Cover with foil and bake in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.
After time has lapsed, cover with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozarella.
Return to the oven til cheese is melted.
Usually it takes about 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let it set for around 10 minutes before you serve.
SLOW COOKER METHOD:
Assemble as above, then cover and cook for 6 hours.
Add the reserved cheese, recover and cook til it is melted. It has to set for the same amount of time before you can serve, also.
FREEZE FOR PRE-MADE MEAL:
Thaw in refrigerator overnight or eight hours. Then cook as above.

Description: 
This lasagna recipe has taken me a little over three years to perfect. Two cooking methods are provided. I tend to use the slow cooker version on the weekends.
