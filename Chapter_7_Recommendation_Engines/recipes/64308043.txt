Ingredients:
2 cups shredded cheese
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste
2 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced
5 plum tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/4 cup butter
1 chopped onion
3/4 cup fine bread crumbs

Directions:
Slice tomatoes & lay out on several layers of paper towels on a cookie sheet to drain.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x9-inch pan.
In a large bowl, combine Cheddar, Parmesan, oregano, basil, and garlic.
Arrange half of the zucchini slices in the pan. Spread 1/2 the onion on top. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1/4 of the cheese and herb mixture on top. Arrange half of the tomatoes, season with salt and pepper then top with another 1/4 of the cheese mixture. Repeat layers.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions, and cook until soft and translucent. Stir in breadcrumbs; cook until they have absorbed the butter. Sprinkle on top of casserole.
Cover loosely with foil, and bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake until the top is crusty and the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
