Ingredients:
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 ½ cups milk
¾ cup unsalted butter
1 ½ cups granulated sugar
Pinch of Salt
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (or extract/flavoring of choice)

Directions:
Cook the flour and milk together in a sauce pot over medium high heat, stirring constantly. You are making a roux, which is similar in consistency to a pudding. Once the mixture starts to boil, pour it into a heat safe container, and lay a piece of parchment directly on top so the roux doesn’t form a skin. Place in the refrigerator overnight.
In a stand mixer or a bowl with a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until you can no longer see sugar granules. With a spatula, mix your roux, ensuring that it is smooth and that it won’t be lumpy when adding it to the butter. Then, slowly, with your mixer on low, add the roux to the butter. It will take a few minutes for you to add it all, which is good; you need to be patient! Once all the roux has been added and mixed in, stop the mixer, scrape down the bowl, and then turn the speed up to medium high for 5-10 minutes, until frosting is light and fluffy.

Description: 
Originally known as Ermine Icing or Butter Roux Icing, you can change up the flavor with any extract you want to try. For the holidays, I love adding peppermint extract for a pop of seasonal flavor.  -Blackberry Farm
