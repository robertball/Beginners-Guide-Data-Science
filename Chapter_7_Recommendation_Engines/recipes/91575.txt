Ingredients:
1 medium Golden Delicious apple
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons golden raisins
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 cup apple cider
8 slices white or whole wheat bread

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Peel and core apple and cut into small dice; you should have about 1 cup.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until they are almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the cider, sugar, raisins, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon; simmer until all of the cider has evaporated.
Trim the crusts off the bread so that the bread is an exact square. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the bread with a rolling pin until it is flattened to about 1/16-inch thick. Divide apple mixture to the left of center on the bread slices; moisten the edge of each bread slice. Fold the larger side of the bread slice over the apple mixture to form a triangle and press the sides together firmly. Brush the outside of each turnover with some of the remaining butter.
Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon over tarts.

Description: 
Golden Delicious apples mingle with plump golden raisins, cinnamon, sugar, and apple cider. You'll love the great time-saving technique, too! Just roll out crustless slices of bread until thin, and then fill them up with the apple mixture. Brushed with butter, then baked, they come out golden and delicious!
