Ingredients:
1/2 cup apricot jam
1/4 cup soy sauce
4 tsp. rice vinegar
2 tsp. sesame oil
1 (5 lb.) bag frozen chicken wings or drumettes thawed

Directions:
In a small bowl, whisk together the apricot jam, soy sauce, rice vinegar and sesame oil. Put the chicken pieces in a shallow pan and pour the marinade on top. Turn to coat. The chicken should be just coated, not swimming in marinade. Cover the chicken with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.
Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Using heavy-duty aluminum foil, line two 9 by 13-inch baking dishes. Divide the chicken between the dishes in a single layer.
Bake until the wings begin to crisp, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. These are best served shortly after baking.
