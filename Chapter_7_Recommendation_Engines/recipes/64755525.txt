Ingredients:
1 c. butter
1 c. sugar
1 c. brown sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp. vanilla
2 c. flour
2 1/2 c. blended oatmeal (measure oatmeal then blend to fine powder)
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. baking soda
12 oz chocolate chips
4 oz Hershey bar, grated (optional)
1 1/2 c. chopped nuts (optional)

Directions:
Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla.
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Mix into sugar mixture.
Add chocolate chips, Hershey bar, & nuts (we rarely have Hershey bar on hand and don't like nuts in cookies so usually omit those 2 ingredients).
Roll into balls & place 2" apart on ungreased cookie sheet.
Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
