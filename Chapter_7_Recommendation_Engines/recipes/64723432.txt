2- 16oz. pks. diced ham

Directions:
Fill two sauce pans of water adding a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Add in macaroni in one and eggs in the other.
As macaroni and eggs boil, cut up all other ingredients (do not use food processor) for it won't taste the same.
After macaroni is finished drain while running cool water until macaroni is cold, poor into large mixing bowl and add all cut up ingredients  (saving cheese until last). After eggs finish boiling, run through cool water, peel, and diced up and add to bowl. Mix all ingredients together macaroni,pickles, olives,ham,onion,eggs,miracle whip, and sugar.
