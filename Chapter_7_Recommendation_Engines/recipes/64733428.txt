Ingredients:
1 quart apple cider
1 whole lemon
3 tablespoons honey
2 cinnamon sticks
6 cloves
6 allspice berries

Directions:
Pour the cider into a large saucepan over medium heat.
Using a vegetable peeler, peel off the lemon zest in several long strips, avoiding the white pith beneath.
Put the zest in the cider and squeeze in the lemon juice.
Stir in the honey, cinnamon sticks, cloves and allspice.
Bring the cider just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, partially cover, and let it heat gently for at least 20 minutes.
To serve, use a ladle to dip up cupfuls, letting the whole spices stay in the bottom of the pan.
