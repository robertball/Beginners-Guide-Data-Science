Ingredients:
8 slices provolone cheese
4 ciabatta rolls, split
12 slices pancetta
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1 large tomato, sliced
2 roasted red bell peppers, sliced
1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat panini press and lightly oil the grates.
Place a slice of provolone cheese on both top and bottom pieces of ciabatta bread. Layer 3 slices pancetta and 1/4 cup spinach over the 4 bottom slices of bread. Divide tomato, bell peppers, and onion equally among the sandwiches. Drizzle each sandwich with about 1 teaspoon each olive oil and vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Replace tops of ciabatta rolls and brush with the remaining olive oil.
Place sandwiches on the panini grill; close the press tightly on top. Cook until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
