Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds of fresh sweet potato
3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg
salt to taste
1/2 cup of water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Peel sweet potatoe(s) and cut into 1" or so cubes.
Place cubed sweet potatoes in a mixing bowl and sprinkle with the cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of salt.
Gently mix until they are coated. Place in an 8" pie dish or my favourite, a 9X4 glass baking dish.
Pour water into baking dish and cover tightly with tinfoil. Let bake for 25 minutes. If you like the tops to be a bit browned, remove the tinfoil 5 minutes prior to removing from oven. I like this dish because it leaves plenty of room in the oven for other items. Trust me, you will not need the sugar!
