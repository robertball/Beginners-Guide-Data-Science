Description: 
An easy and delicious weekday meal; just throw the ingredients in your slow cooker in the morning and come home to a hot and ready meal. I find it difficult to keep my roommate from sneaking scoops before dinner! If you are watching your sodium intake, use reduced or no-sodium broth and you are set! Recipe serves 6 as a reasonable size main dish, just add buns or biscuits to make it a full meal.
