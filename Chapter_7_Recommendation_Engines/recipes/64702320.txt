Description: 
This is the recipe for the creamy garlic salad dressing from Alexander's Steak House, an iconic southside Chicago restaurant circa 1930-1978 on 79th & South Shore Drive. The Alexander brothersâ€™ swanky meat palace was such a star magnet that Nicky Hilton flew buckets of their salad dressing to the Anaheim Hilton when he married Liz Taylor.
