Ingredients:
1 cup chestnuts
3/4 cup butter
1 cup diced celery
1 cup diced onion
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 cups slightly dry bread cubes
2 eggs
3 tablespoons milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Cut an "X" into the bottom of each chestnut using a sharp knife, trying not to pierce through the skin. Arrange chestnuts on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until toasted, about 15 minutes. Cool chestnuts until easily handled. Shell and peel chestnuts and break into small pieces. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir celery and onion until onion is soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add chestnuts, salt, poultry seasoning, and black pepper; stir until evenly mixed.
Put bread cubes in a large bowl. Mix chestnut mixture into bread cubes. Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; drizzle over bread cube mixture and toss to coat. Transfer mixture to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 30 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a family favorite. My Nana Bebe made it and now all of the girls in my family do too. The chestnuts give a slightly sweet, piquant flavor to a traditional stuffing. Yum!
