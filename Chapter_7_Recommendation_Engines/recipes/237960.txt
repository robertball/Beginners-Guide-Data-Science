2 (29 ounce) cans mixed vegetables (with potatoes)

2 large cooked chicken breasts, cut into cubes
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
Stir vegetables, chicken soup, mushroom soup, and chicken cubes together in a Dutch oven with a flat lid.
Cook over campfire coals until warmed through but not boiling, about 15 minutes.
Arrange biscuit dough segments in a layer atop the vegetable mixture. Put lid on the Dutch oven and carefully arrange some hot coals atop the lid.
Heat until the biscuits are cooked through, 15 to 30 minutes.
