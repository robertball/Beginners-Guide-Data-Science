Ingredients:
3  cups thinly sliced zucchini
4  eggs, slightly beaten
2  tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4  teaspoon salt
1/4  teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2  teaspoons snipped fresh oregano
2  teaspoons snipped fresh thyme
2  teaspoons snipped fresh marjoram
2  teaspoons snipped fresh basil
2  tablespoons olive oil
6  1/4-inch-thick tomato slices
6  1/8-inch-thick pepperoni slices
4  ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Cook zucchini, covered, in a small amount of boiling water for 3 minutes; drain.
Combine eggs, flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Stir in oregano, thyme, marjoram, basil, and zucchini; set aside.
Heat olive oil in an 8-inch broilerproof skillet over medium heat. Carefully transfer zucchini mixture to hot skillet. Cook over medium heat about 15 minutes or until egg mixture is mostly set (surface will be moist). Do not stir.
Layer on tomato, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese. Place skillet under the broiler 4 to 5 inches from the heat. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes or until top is set, cheese has melted, and pepperoni is sizzling. Cut into eight wedges. Makes 4 servings.
