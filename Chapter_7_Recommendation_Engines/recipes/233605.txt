Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds ground beef
1 yellow onion, chopped, divided
1 habanero pepper, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained (optional)
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®), drained
2 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle amber beer
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)
1 sleeve crackers (optional)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, half the onion, habanero pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Transfer beef mixture to a large pot and add tomato sauce, kidney beans, diced tomatoes with green chiles, 2 tablespoons chili powder, 1 tablespoon cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, white pepper, and black pepper.
Bring beef mixture to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in beer, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Continue to simmer chili until flavors blend, about 2 hours.
Spoon chili into bowls and top with Cheddar cheese, crackers, and remaining half onion.

Description: 
Being in Texas, chili is a staple on the few cold days we have each year. This is something I've come up with after years of trying to perfect an easy-to-make and delicious chili. This is a very spicy chili and the perfect meal for a chilly day. The beans are optional here as they traditionally aren't found in Texas chili.
