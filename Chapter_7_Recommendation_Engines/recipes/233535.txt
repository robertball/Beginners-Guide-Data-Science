Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 sweet red peppers, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
4 cloves cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press
5 links precooked chicken and apple sausage, sliced into 1/4-thick rounds
3 (16 ounce) packages penne pasta
garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. DashÂ®) to taste
sea salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir peppers until slightly tender, about 7 minutes. Stir in onions and cook until onions soften and turn golden, 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir sausage slices into onions and peppers, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
Stir drained penne into sausage and onions and reduce heat to low. Season with garlic and herb seasoning, sea salt, and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This recipe originated with my son, who makes it with very spicy chicken sausages. I loved it so much that I adapted it to suit our taste. Because my husband prefers less spicy food, I use milder chicken-apple sausage. This is one of our favorite dinners.
