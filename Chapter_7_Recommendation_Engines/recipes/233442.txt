Ingredients:
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
3 pounds ground venison
1 pound ground pork
1/2 pound venison liver, finely ground (optional)
1/2 pound venison heart (optional)
2 large onions, finely chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup ground dried sage
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Stir together venison, pork, liver, heart, onions, garlic, and sage in a large bowl. Stir in potatoes; season with salt and pepper. Place mixture into a large oven-proof Dutch oven with a lid.
Bake in the preheated oven until meat is fully cooked and flavors have blended, about 2 hours. Mix thoroughly with a fork, replace lid, and allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving.
