Ingredients:
10 ounces angel hair pasta
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 zucchini, diced
1 pound button mushrooms, quartered
1/4 cup red wine
1 (16 ounce) jar pasta sauce
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
While pasta is cooking, in large skillet over medium heat, saute onion in butter 2 minutes.  Stir in garlic and zucchini and cook 3 minutes more.  Add mushrooms and cook 5 minutes more, until mushrooms are soft.  Pour in red wine and pasta sauce, reduce heat to low and simmer.  Add corn and bring back to a simmer again to heat through.
Serve sauce over pasta with a dab of butter, or toss together.

Description: 
Family favorite for years, great way to get veggies into kids, and no separate side dishes. Top with fresh chopped parsley and/or parmesan if desired.  This stuff reheats great and I have used ground beef in it before, just brown it with the onions, drain then continue recipe.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as we have.
