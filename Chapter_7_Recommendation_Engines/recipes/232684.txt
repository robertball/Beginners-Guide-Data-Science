Image:
NA
Ingredients:
2 (14 ounce) packages extra firm tofu, drained and cubed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
¾ cup maple syrup
¼ cup coconut oil
¼ cup cold butter, cut into cubes
¼ cup crystallized sugar cane juice (such as Sucanat(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1  egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch spring-form pan.
Blend tofu, cream cheese, maple syrup, coconut oil, cold butter, sucanat, cocoa powder, egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender or food processor until smooth; pour into prepared spring-form pan.
Cover the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil and place it into a pan at least 1 inch larger than the spring-form pan. Pour about 1/2 inch water into the larger pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until mostly set, about 1 hour and 20 minutes; cool at room temperature until just warm before chilling completely in refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.

Description: 
Not quite vegan, but tofu does make up the bulk of the creaminess in this lower-fat, higher-protein crustless version of chocolate cheesecake. Be sure to refrigerate the cake overnight for best outcome. You may want to make a cookie-crust with crushed Oreo(<sup>&reg;</sup>) cookies and butter. Using a high-quality cocoa powder will greatly improve your results.
