Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 1/4 cups cold beef stock
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons cooking sherry

Directions:
Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons flour with salt and pepper in a bowl. Dredge beef strips in the mixture.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the dredged beef strips; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms, onion, and garlic; cook until onion is barely tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the beef and mushroom mixture to a plate.
Melt remaining butter in the same skillet; reduce heat to low. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour and tomato paste; cook until slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium. Add beef stock slowly, stirring constantly, until gravy is thickened and no lumps remain, 5 to 10 minutes.
Return the beef and mushroom mixture to the skillet with the gravy. Stir in sour cream and sherry; heat until bubbling, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Being of Norwegian descent, I really don't know how this Russian beef stroganoff came into the family. My grandma has made this recipe for 50 years that I know of and it is truly my favorite. Serve over noodles. For a wintertime comfort food this is the best. I actually like it so much that my wife and I will have this for dinner and the next morning we will eat the leftovers with a couple of eggs on the side for brunch. You can't beat it!
