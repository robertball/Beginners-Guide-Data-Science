Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground turkey breast
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 onion, minced
1 zucchini, chopped
1 yellow squash, chopped
1 pinch kosher salt
1/3 cup water
1/2 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1/2 (15 ounce) can fat-free refried beans
1/2 (15.5 ounce) jar queso dip
1 (14.5 ounce) package baked tortilla chips
1 tomato, chopped

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground turkey in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain and discard grease.
Heat olive oil in a second skillet over medium heat. Add onion to the hot pan; cook and stir until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add zucchini, yellow squash, and salt. Cook until soft, 3 to 5 minutes more. Add cooked turkey, water, and taco seasoning. Cook until some of the water has evaporated, 1 to 3 minutes.
Place refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl and warm in the microwave, 1 to 3 minutes. Place queso dip in a microwave-safe bowl and warm in the microwave, 1 to 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, arrange tortilla chips on a serving plate. Spread warm refried beans and queso dip on top of the chips. Add turkey-vegetable mixture. Top with chopped tomato.
