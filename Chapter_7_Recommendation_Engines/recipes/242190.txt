Ingredients:
2 pounds carrots, sliced
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook carrots in boiling water until soft but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain. Transfer carrots to a container with a lid; add onion and bell pepper.
Stir tomato soup, sugar, vinegar, oil, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour soup mixture over vegetables.
Cover the container and refrigerate vegetables, 8 hours to overnight.
