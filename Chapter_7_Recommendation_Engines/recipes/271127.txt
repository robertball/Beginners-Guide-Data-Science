Ingredients:
½ cup olive oil, divided
1 pound ripe tomatoes, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2  2-inch thick chicken breasts
1 pinch garlic salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 cups Shiraz red wine
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup fresh baby spinach

Directions:
Divide oil between a medium and large skillet. Heat both over medium heat.
Add tomatoes and garlic to the large skillet and toss to coat.
Increase heat under the medium skillet to medium-high. Season chicken with black pepper and garlic salt and place into the the hot oil. Cook until browned on each side, about 7 minutes per side.
Add red wine to the skillet with the tomato mixture and increase heat to high. Use a spoon to crush any tomatoes that have not reduced on their own. Bring mixture to a rolling simmer and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add brown sugar and butter and mix well. Reduce heat to low and cover.
Transfer browned chicken to the tomato sauce and simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside, turning once, about 15 minutes.
Spread spinach over a serving platter. Place chicken on top of spinach and spoon sauce over the chicken.
