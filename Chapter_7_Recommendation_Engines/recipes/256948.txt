Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed
1 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup grape jelly
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Dust a flat work surface with flour; roll bread dough into an oval shape that is 1/4-inch thick.
Spoon peanut butter into a microwave-safe bowl; melt in the microwave at 50% power for 45 seconds. Spread evenly over dough with a spatula.
Pour grape jelly into a microwave-safe bowl; melt in the microwave at 50% power for 20 seconds. Spread over peanut butter with the spatula.
Roll dough lengthwise toward you and shape into a 'U'; transfer to a nonstick baking sheet. Brush egg over dough; sprinkle sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
