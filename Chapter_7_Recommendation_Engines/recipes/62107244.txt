Ingredients:
1 16 ounce loaf French or sour dough bread, halved horizontally
1 1/2 sticks butter, softened
4 Tablespoons Kraft grated American cheese
4 Tablespoons freshly grated parmesean cheese
4 to 6 cloves garlic, minced or run through a garlic press

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Mash butter, cheeses and garlic together in a small bowl. Spread this mixture over cut sides of bread, using it all.  Place loaf halves, cut side up on a baking sheet. Bake in the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, keeping a close watch, until cheese and butter bubbles and browns slightly.
Remove from oven and cut into inch-wide slices.  Serve hot.

I had been trying for years to duplicate garlic bread that I used to get in a restaurant in my home town of Burbank, CA.  This is the closest I have come.
