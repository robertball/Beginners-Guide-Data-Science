Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup shredded coconut
1/2 cup crushed pecans
1/2 cup Spanish Marcona almonds
1 1/2 tablespoons flaky sea salt (such as MaldonÂ®)
1 tablespoon flax seeds
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup coconut oil
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon molasses
1 teaspoon Mexican vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Combine oats, coconut, pecans, almonds, sea salt, flax seeds, cinnamon, nutmeg, paprika, and ginger in a large bowl. Spread evenly on the lined baked sheet.
Stir 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown sugar, honey, molasses, and vanilla extract together in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. Pour over oat mixture and mix with a spoon until evenly coated.
Bake in the preheated oven, stirring halfway through, until granola is evenly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool completely before storing.

Description: 
I was looking for an affordable way to make delicious, healthy granola. I like the complex flavors, including the mix of molasses and Mexican vanilla. It goes great with milk, yogurt, as an ice cream topping, or just by itself! Enjoy!
