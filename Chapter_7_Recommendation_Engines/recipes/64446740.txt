2 tablespoons oil
1 cup corn starch
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
Â½ teaspoon pepper
sauce
4 tablespoons hoisin sauce (can be found in the Asian section at most markets)
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon minced garlic (or garlic powder)
2 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
steamed or fried rice for serving

Directions:
1. Preheat oil in a nonstick pan or skillet over medium heat. Whisk together corn starch, salt, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and pepper.
2. Add corn starch mixture and chicken pieces to a large zip lock bag. Seal and shake to coat chicken.
3. Add coated chicken pieces to pan. Saute 1-2 minutes until browned. (It chicken will still be raw in the middle at this point, that's okay)
4. In a bowl combine all sauce ingredients and whisk to combine. Add half to the crockpot along with chicken pieces. Cook on low for 4 hours.
Immediately before serving, Add remaining sauce to the crockpot and stir gently. 5. Serve with rice.
