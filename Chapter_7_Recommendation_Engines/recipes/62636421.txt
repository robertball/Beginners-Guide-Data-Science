Ingredients:
1 package dry onion soup mix
6 cloves garlic  4 minced, 2 slivered
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons maple syrup
½ tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
½ tablespoon bacon grease (vegetable oil can be substituted)
1 tablespoon mustard powder
¼ teaspoon hot sauce
1 cup amber/dark beer
1 5-6lbs Prime Rib Roast (2-3 bone)
¼ cup olive oil
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix onion soup mix, 4 minced cloves of garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, bacon grease, mustard powder & hot sauce.  Stir in beer
Cut slits into roast (all over) and insert slivers of garlic into slits.  Push until garlic is no longer visible
Place roast in a sealable container, and pour marinade over roast.  Let roast sit in fridge for 1 hour.  Remove from fridge and let sit at room temperature for an additional hour.
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)
Remove roast from sealable container, place on rack in a roasting pan.  Pour marinade over roast in pan.  Pour olive oil over roast and rub oil into roast then sprinkle with salt & pepper (to taste)
** Optional step – insert a roasting thermometer into middle of roast, making sure it doesn’t touch any bone.
Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil and seal edges tightly around pan
Cook roast for 1 hour in preheated oven.  After 1st hour, remove foil, baste roast with pan juices and lower temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue roasting for one more hour.  This should have the roast cooked to a medium rare temperature (140 – 145 degrees F)
Use thermometer to ensure desired doneness.
Remove roast from oven, cover with aluminum foil and let stand for 20—30 minutes before carving.
Skim fat off pan juices and use for a jus, or gravy depending on personal preference

Description: 
After getting tired with our standard prime rib recipe (my mom's old fav) I decided to start experimenting with different tactics to cook a roast.  This is what I ended up with... the pan juices alone are worth giving it a try!!  ...and the roast isn't too shabby either!
