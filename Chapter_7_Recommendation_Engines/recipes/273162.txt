Description: 
This is a low sodium, low acid, IC friendly chicken salad recipe that tastes great and is made in an Instant Pot®. I created this recipe for my husband who has a number of dietary restrictions and it turned out so well I thought I'd share. You can optionally add the dried cherries, cranberries or chopped green grapes mentioned in the last step. If you have IC, you should skip this step or make sure you are using something that works with your condition. In my opinion green grapes taste the best, but they might not work if you suffer from IC. Serve cold between slices of potato bread, perhaps with some green leaf lettuce and fresh sliced tomato.
