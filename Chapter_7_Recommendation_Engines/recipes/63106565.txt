Ingredients:
2 cups prepared spinach dip
1 13 oz. can chicken breast
1 10 oz. can refrigerated pizza crust
1/3 cup chopped green onions
1 cup fresh broccoli, 1/4" dice
1 tomato, seeded and chopped
1 4 oz. can black olive slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400.
Lightly grease a pizza pan. Unroll dough and press into the prepared pizza pan.
Bake crust for 7 minutes or until it begins to turn golden brown. Remove from oven. Let crust cool for 5 minutes.
Spread 1 cup of the spinach dip evenly over the crust to within half an inch of the edge. Top with broccoli, olives, chicken, green onions, and tomato, saving a few olives, green onions, and tomatoes to garnish the top.
Cover with the other cup of spinach dip. Garnish with desired toppings.
Cook for another 7 minutes.
