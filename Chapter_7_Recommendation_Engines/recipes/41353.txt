Ingredients:
1 bone-in turkey breast (8-1/2 pounds)
3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
2 tablespoons olive or canola oil, divided
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage

Directions:
Loosen skin from turkey with fingers, leaving skin attached along bottom edges. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil, garlic and seasonings. Spread under turkey skin. Combine remaining lemon juice and oil; set aside. Place turkey on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 2-1/2 to 3 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 170 degrees, basting every 15-20 minutes with lemon mixture. Let stand for 10 minutes. Discard skin before carving.

Description: 
Herbs tucked under the skin give the turkey a wonderful aroma as it's roasting, and the lemon juice adds a subtle hint of citrus.
