1 cup coarsely chopped celery
1/2 cup coarsely chopped green peppers
1/2 cup coarsely chopped onions

1 small package of Muellers small seashell pasta cooked al dente

2 tbsp. horseradish
2 tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar
2 tbsp. worchestershire sauce
1 tsp. old bay seasoning
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp.  black pepper
Combine all these ingredients and mix thoroughly.  The dressing
can be made in advance and kept refrigerated until needed.

Directions:
Add chilled dressing to chopped ingredients gradually.   Add only
enough dressing to hold dry ingredients together.  Depending on
the seafood you used not all the dressing will be used.  Crabmeat
is very moist and will not require as much dressing.  Mix thoroughly
and chill before using.
