Description: 
A classic meatloaf recipe calling for a winning combination of three delicious meats.  Moist, tender, and just a little sweet, this flavorful meatloaf is a family tradition.  This recipe is quickly thrown together like all good meatloafs.  If you prefer, substitute veal for another quarter lb each of beef and pork; to spice it up a little, substitute catsup for chili sauce.
