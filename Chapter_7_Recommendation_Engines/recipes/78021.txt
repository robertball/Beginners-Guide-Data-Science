Ingredients:
Salad:
2 ounces pine nuts
5 cups mixed greens
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup scallions, sliced
1 large orange, cut in 1-inch chunks
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1 cup cilantro, chopped
Dressing:
2 tablespoons orange juice concentrate
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1/4 teaspoon salt
Cumin-Crusted Salmon:
1 1/2 tablespoons cumin
2 teaspoons paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pound salmon fillet, skin removed

Directions:
Heat a non-stick skillet, add pine nuts and stir until toasty, about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, place all salad ingredients (reserve half of the cilantro and half of the pine nuts for garnish).
In a separate bowl, stir dressing ingredients together.
In a bowl, combine cumin, paprika, salt and pepper. Cut salmon in 8 strips and coat with spices. Grill (or sear in a non-stick skillet brushed with canola oil) until crusty.
Toss salad and dressing; divide on plates. Top with salmon and reserved cilantro and pine nuts.

Description: 
For the greatest omega-3 benefit buy the fattiest fish. Try mackerel, anchovies, herring, sardines, salmon, tuna and turbot. Frozen and canned are OK, the USDA says.
