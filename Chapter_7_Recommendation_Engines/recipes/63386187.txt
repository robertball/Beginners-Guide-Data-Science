Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
Pate Brisee (Pie Dough)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark-brown sugar
1/4 cup currants
1/4 cup golden raisins
1/4 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup citron
1/4 cup candied orange peel, chopped into 1/4-inch pieces
1 cup finely chopped blanched almonds (4 ounces), toasted
Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons brandy
1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
2 large eggs

Directions:
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out 3/4 of pate brisee to fit a rectangular 13-by-4-inch tart pan to thickness of 1/8 inch. Place pastry in pan; gently press down with your fingers into edges and along rim. Trim pastry along edge of pan. Cover with plastic; refrigerate, along with remaining dough, while making filling.
2. Sift flour, salt, and spices into bowl. Add sugar, dried fruit, citron, orange peel, almonds, zest, and juice. Stir in brandy, molasses, and 1 beaten egg. Pack into pastry-lined tin.
3. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out remaining dough to 1/8 inch thick. Moisten edges of pastry in tart tin with water; place rolled dough over filling. Seal well, and trim excess dough. Chill tart for 1 hour.
4. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Make three slits with a knife for air vents. Whisk remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water in small bowl. Brush tart with egg wash, place tart in oven, and bake until pastry is golden brown and flaky, about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Let cool on wire rack to room temperature. Using a serrated knife, slice into 3/4-inch-thick slices.
