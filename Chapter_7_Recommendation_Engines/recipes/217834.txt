Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillet, skin removed
salt to taste
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the salmon fillet on a rimmed baking sheet, and season with salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Whisk in the flour, cooking for 1 minute, then stir in the wine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low. Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chives and season with salt and pepper. Break the salmon into large chunks, and serve topped with the sauce.
