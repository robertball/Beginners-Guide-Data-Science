Ingredients:
2 lbs of fresh kielbasa, sliced into large pieces (approx. 2")
2 - 16 oz bags of sauerkraut, rinsed and drained.
1 med sweet onion, diced.
1 apple, peeled & diced.
2 slices of bacon (can substitute 3 drops of liquid smoke).
If using liquid smoke - 3 Tbsp. butter.
3 or 4 large yellow or russet potatoes, cut into pieces
1-1/2 cups of chicken broth.
1/2 cup of beer.
1/2 tsp sea salt.
1/4 cup of dark brown sugar.

Directions:
Set Instant Pot to Saute.  Once hot, add bacon and cook until crispy, pull out with tongs and set aside.  If using liquid smoke instead of bacon, then add butter and melt before adding Kielbasa.
Add Kielbasa and brown a bit on all sides, you may not get it all in at one time, pull out with tongs and set aside.
Add onions and saute 2 to 3 minutes until soft.  While that is cooking crumble and add bacon if using.   Add brown sugar, stir.  If adding liquid smoke, suggest adding the drops to a teaspoon, then stirring into broth to avoid accidental over use of smoke.   Add the rest of ingredients and use tongs and mix gently.
Set Instant Pot to manual on high for 12 minutes.  Let release naturally for 10 min., then quick release.
