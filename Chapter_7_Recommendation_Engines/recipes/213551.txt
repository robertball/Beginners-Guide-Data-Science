Ingredients:
1 pound lean pork butt, cut into pieces
1 onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place the pork, onion, cinnamon, and clove into a saucepan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour in water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the water has nearly evaporated, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally to ensure the pork cooks evenly.
Use a potato masher or wire whisk to break the pork into thin strands. Pour off any remaining liquid, then spoon the gorton into a serving bowl. Refrigerate until cold before serving.
