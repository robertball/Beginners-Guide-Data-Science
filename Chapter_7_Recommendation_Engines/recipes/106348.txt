Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seed
2 medium onions, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper to taste
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 clove garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
5  peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in cumin seed and cook until they start to pop, 20 to 45 seconds.  Stir in onion, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Season with turmeric, cayenne, garam masala, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.
Puree the mixture with the tomatoes in a blender until smooth.  Return the puree to the saucepan, and add the chicken.  Simmer gently until the chicken has cooked, about 20 minutes; add water as needed while cooking to maintain desired consistency.

Description: 
This is a really nice Indian recipe, taught to me by an elderly Indian lady, who used to cook for all her family. It is a simple recipe and tastes lovely served with rice.  You can also use mutton instead of chicken.
