Directions
•	Tie cinnamon sticks, cloves, and allspice in cheesecloth and add to vinegar. Cover the pot and simmer the mixture for about 5 minutes.
•	Add blueberries and cook them over medium heat until heated. Gently shake the pot. Do not stir to avoid breaking the berries. Remove pot from heat (covered) and let it stand at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.
•	Pour berries and liquid into a colander set over a bowl. Remove the spices. Carefully transfer berries to canning jars, reserving the liquid.
•	Return liquid to pot and add the sugar. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Boil until thickened, about 4 minutes.
•	Cover berries with hot syrup, leave ½ inch headspace. Close the jars and process in a boiling-water bath for 15 minutes.
