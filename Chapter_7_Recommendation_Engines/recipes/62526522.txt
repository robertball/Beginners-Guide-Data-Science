Ingredients:
Crust
2 cups flour
1 cup cold shortning
1/2 cup water
pinch of salt
Filling:
6-8 apples peeled and sliced thin (Best to use half sweet apples and half tart like Granny Smith)
1/2-3/4 cup sugar
1 tsp Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Nutmeg
4-5 "shakes" of Clove
3 "shakes" of All Spice
1/4 tsp Ginger

Directions:
For the pie crust fold all the dry ingedients in with the shortning and water. Then divide into two even parts as you will need a top and bottom crust.
Roll out onto floured surface and be sure to make it bigger then your pie dish.It should be about 1/8" thick. To move your crust to your pie dish roll it up onto your rolling pin. After you have your apple filling in you will roll the top and the bottom crusts together and pinch the edges together. Don't forget to poke holes in the top!
For the Filling
In a medium saucepan heat apples and spices on low heat for about 10 minuets or untill mixture becomes fragrant. Using a sifter sprinkle a light coating of flour over your apples once you put them into your pie crust.
Bake @ 400 degrees.
If the edges start to brown too quickly cover them with foil. Or you could bake at 350 degrees but it takes a little longer! Remove from oven when the pie is Golden Brown! Enjoy!
