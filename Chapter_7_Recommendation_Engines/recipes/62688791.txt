1/4 cup uncooked barley
1 carrots, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
3 oz mixed vegetables

Pour the vegetable broth into a large pot. Add the barley, carrots, celery, tomatoes, zucchini, garbanzo beans, onion, and bay leaves. Season with garlic powder, sugar, salt, pepper, parsley, curry powder, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 90 minutes. The soup will be very thick. You may adjust by adding more broth or less barley if desired. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Description: 
Easy to make and delicious. Vegetable broth, barley, and lots of veggies make this soup hearty and filling. I use and recommend organic products. Please add a review if you make it. Enjoy! Adjust seasonings depending on the quality of your broth.  Change up veggies as desired = have added beef bits, cabbage, lima beans, potatoes, corn, etc.  Lovely!Modified from: Beaker's Vegetable Barley Soup
