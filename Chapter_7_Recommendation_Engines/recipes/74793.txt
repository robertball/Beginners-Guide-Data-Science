Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked spaghetti
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the garlic 1 minute, until tender. Mix in the clams and juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup.
In a large bowl, toss the spaghetti with the sauteed clams, chopped parsley, and Parmesan cheese. Garnish with parsley sprigs to serve.

Description: 
A very quick and easy crowd pleaser! Spaghetti tossed with clams, garlic, parsley, and Parmesan. The kids will love it, adults too! I like to serve with a crisp white wine, a tossed green salad, and garlic bread.
