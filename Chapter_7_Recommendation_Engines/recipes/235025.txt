Ingredients:
1  green bell pepper, chopped
1  onion, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
½ cup prepared hummus
½  lemon, juiced
1 teaspoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Stir green bell pepper and onion together in the bottom of a 9-inch casserole dish. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables; stir to coat.
Coat chicken breasts completely with a thin layer of hummus and place atop the vegetables. Drizzle lemon juice over the chicken and dust with paprika.
Cook chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a fast, delicious weeknight dinner. Use any flavor of hummus that you prefer, but spicy works well for me. Serve with a side of rice.
