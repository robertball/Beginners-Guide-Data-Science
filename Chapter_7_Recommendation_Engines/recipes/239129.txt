Ingredients:
1 teaspoon shortening, or as needed
3 cups baking mix (such as Bob's Red MillÂ® Biscuit and Baking Mix)
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 tablespoon salt
2 cups rice milk
5 eggs
1 cup date sugar
2 cups raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously grease a jelly roll pan or rimmed baking sheet with shortening.
Mix baking mix, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add rice milk, eggs, and date sugar and mix until dough is thoroughly mixed. Fold raisins into batter; spread evenly into the prepared baking sheet.
Baking in the preheated oven until bread easily bounces back when touched, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Invented for my daughter to take to a tea party, this is only ho-hum straight out of the oven . . . but the next day?  Wonderfully moist and sweet. These are absolutely yummy with coconut butter on top (instead of dairy butter).
