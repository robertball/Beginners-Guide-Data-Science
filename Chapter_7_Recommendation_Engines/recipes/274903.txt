Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
Frosting:
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter
1 1/4 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine white sugar, pumpkin, butter, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl.
Combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Add to pumpkin mixture until a soft dough forms.
Drop dough by heaping teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes.
Heat brown sugar and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Spread frosting over cooled cookies.
