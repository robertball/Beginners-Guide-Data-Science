Ingredients:
1 lb asparagus, rinsed and chopped
8 oz. spaghetti noodles (1/2 package)
4 oz. cream cheese
4 T butter
3/4 cup milk, warmed
1 tsp garlic
1 T lemon juice
pinch of salt and pepper

Directions:
Boil pasta according to package directions.
Add cream cheese to a saucepan over low heat. When it begins to melt, add butter. Melt over low heat and whisk to combine. It will not combine until completely melted, you may need to use a spatula to help incorporate it.
Add the warmed milk slowly and then the remaining ingredients. Whisk to combine. Cook over medium low heat for about 7 minutes. It should be slightly thinner than you want it because it will thicken upon cooling.
Meanwhile, add asparagus and a small amount of water to a large frying pan and cook over medium low heat until tender. Drain the water from the pan.
Add sauce and pasta to pan and toss to coat. Sprinkle with dried thyme, if desired. Serve warm.
