Description: 
I've been mixing tuna with my cottage cheese at lunch for years and I've also enjoyed pairing fresh basil with pineapple. One day, I put it all together and came up with this recipe. Sometimes, I eat it in a bowl, sometimes with crackers, or bread, but anyway it's eaten, it hits all the high notes and is wonderfully satisfying.
