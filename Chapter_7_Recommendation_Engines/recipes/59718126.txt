Ingredients:
1 box ready made pie crust
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, toss together the sliced apples, white sugar, and brown sugar.  In a small bowl mix together the flour and softened butter to make a paste.
Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with the top crust.
Place the bottom crust in the pie plate.  Fill halfway with apples, take half the butter and flour mixture and dot all over the apples.  Top with the remaining apples, mounding slightly.  Dot the remaining butter and flour mixture over apples and top with crust.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.

Description: 
This recipe calls for Granny Smith apples but feel free to experiment with other hard fleshed apples.  My favorite, when in season, is the Honey Crisp, it's a perfect balance of sweet and tart.  I cut back on the sugar in the original recipe as well as the butter, making this pie perfectly sweet and buttery.Modified from: Apple Pie by Grandma Ople
