Ingredients:
2 quarts fresh strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup shortening
2 1/2 cups self-rising flour*
1 egg
1 cup buttermilk
Whipped cream

Directions:
Combine the strawberries and sugar; set aside. In a large bowl, cut shortening into flour until crumbly. In a small bowl, beat egg; add buttermilk. Stir into flour mixture just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead three to four times. Roll out to 1/2-in. thickness; cut with a 3-in. round biscuit cutter. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned; cool slightly.
Split biscuits lengthwise; place the bottom halves on serving plates. Top with about 1/3 cup strawberries and whipped cream. Replace biscuit tops; spoon about 1/3 cup strawberries and more whipped cream on top. Serve immediately.
