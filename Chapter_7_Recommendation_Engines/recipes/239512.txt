Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
2  boneless chicken breasts, diced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce
1 (8 ounce) package oven-ready lasagna noodles
1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, or as needed
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil, oregano, and basil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute chicken in hot oil until cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Mix tomatoes and Alfredo sauce together in a bowl.
Spread 1/3 of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; add 1/3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese over noodles and top with 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese. Repeat 1 more layer of 1/3 of the sauce mixture, 1/3 of the noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese, 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese. Spread chicken mixture over cheese layer and top with remaining 1/3 of the sauce mixture, 1/3 of the noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese, 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove foil and sprinkle remaining 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese. Continue baking until cheeses are melted and lightly browned, about 15 minutes more.
