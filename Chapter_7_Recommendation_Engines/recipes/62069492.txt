Ingredients:
1 can of tomato soup
3 sticks of crabmeat (or artificial) they come in the freezer section in sticks probably equivalent to a little over a cup if you had the flaked only
1 (tuna can sized) can of shrimp
1 cup of mixed vegtables preferable the brocoli/cauliflower mix
1/4 cup of black olives
1 t dried garlic
1 t oregano
1 t basil
(if adventurous - curry) 1 t
(if you'd like it really creamy) you favorite cheese 4-5 slices

Directions:
Take all the ingredients and put them in to a food processor and combine until they're well chopped or very starting to get creamy (puree). (minus the cheese) - when it's all mixed, add 2 cans of water to the mixture while emptying everything into a pot on a stove medium heat. As the mixture starts to come to a boil, add your cheese and it will make your soup really creamy. Let it melt well and serve with parsley sprinkles on top.
