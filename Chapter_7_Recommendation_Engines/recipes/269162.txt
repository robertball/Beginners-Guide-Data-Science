Ingredients:
1 fennel bulb, cut into 1/2-inch slices, fronds reserved
1 small onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 turkey Italian sausages, casings removed
1 pound prepared pizza dough, or as needed
1/2 cup pizza sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
Toss fennel and onion slices with olive oil; spread out on the baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Roll out pizza dough on a lightly floured surface. Transfer to a pizza pan or clean baking sheet. Spread sauce on top and cover with mozzarella cheese. Top with fennel, onion, sausage, and garlic slices.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes. Garnish with chopped fennel fronds.

Description: 
I made this fennel and sausage pizza one night and it was the best pizza we have had in a long time. You can adjust the amount of toppings and sauce and cheese to your preference. For the dough, I like Jay's Signature Crust from this site.
