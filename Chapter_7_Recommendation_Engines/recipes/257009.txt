Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 pounds ground beef
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
3 eggs
1 large white onion, chopped
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
2 tablespoons seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®)
2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 hot banana peppers, diced
2 teaspoons pink salt
2 teaspoons onion salt
2 teaspoons garlic salt
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
Sauce:
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup tomato-based chile sauce (such as Heinz®)
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray.
Combine ground beef, diced tomatoes, eggs, onion, panko bread crumbs, seasoned salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, hot banana peppers, pink salt, onion salt, garlic salt, paprika, and liquid smoke flavoring in a large bowl. Mix well with your hands. Pack it into the prepared loaf pan, doming the top.
Smoke meatloaf for 2 hours, adding wood chips to the drip tray according to manufacturer's instructions.
Whisk ketchup, chile sauce, sugar, 1 tablespoon pepper, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, red chile pepper, and red pepper flakes together to make sauce.
Drain excess grease from meatloaf; spread sauce on top. Return to smoker for 30 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

This is like a little taste of pure masterfulness. I am a fanatic of meatloaf and wandered around aimlessly for 20-odd years looking for an answer... This is it!
