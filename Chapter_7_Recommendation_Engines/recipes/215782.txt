Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more if needed
1 sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 1/4 cups vegetable broth
1 small zucchini, chopped
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup baby spinach leaves
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir the onion until translucent, about 5 minutes, then stir in garlic and quinoa. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook and stir the mixture until the quinoa becomes light brown in color and has a toasted fragrance, 5 to 7 minutes. Slowly pour in the stock, stirring constantly. Bring the mixture back to a boil over medium heat, and stir in the zucchini, mushrooms, and celery; season to taste with salt and black pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low, and allow the mixture to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Stir in the baby spinach and garbanzo beans, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 10 to 15 more minutes.
