Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds bacon, cut into 1" pieces
2 medium yellow onions, finely diced
3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
3/4 cup strongly brewed coffee
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup maple syrup

Directions:
1.  In large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until the fat is rendered  and the bacon is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towel-lined plate to drain.
2.  Pour off all but 1 TBL drippings from the skillet and reserve for another use.  Add the onions and garlic to the skillet and cook until the onions are translucent, about 6 minutes.  Add the coffee, vinegar, brown sugar, and maple syrup and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits from the skillet, for 2 minutes.   Add the bacon and stir to combine.
3.  Reduce the heat to a bar simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the liquid almost completely evaporates and turns syrupy, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
4.  Let the bacon concoction cool slightly before transferring into a food processor and pulsing until coarsely chopped.  Store until ready for use.  Gently rewarm.
