Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (1.27 ounce) packet dry fajita seasoning, divided
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn
1/2 cup salsa
1 (10 ounce) package mixed salad greens
1 onion, chopped
1 tomato, cut into wedges

Directions:
Rub chicken evenly with 1/2 the fajita seasoning. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken 8 minutes on each side, or until juices run clear; set aside.
In a large saucepan, mix beans, corn, salsa and other 1/2 of fajita seasoning. Heat over medium heat until warm.
Prepare the salad by tossing the greens, onion and tomato. Top salad with chicken and dress with the bean and corn mixture.
