21/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, beaten
2 cup all-purpose flour
2cup whole wheat
1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar
2 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon salt
1 can full berry cranberry sauce
1/2 cup pecans, chopped ( optional )

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a muffin pan, or use paper liners.
In a small bowl, mix together applesauce, oil and egg. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in egg mixture. Stir until just moistened. Fold in cranberries and pecans. Spoon into muffin cups, 2/3 full.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in pan for 2 minutes before removing.
