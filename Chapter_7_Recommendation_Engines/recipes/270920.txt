Ingredients:
5  poblano peppers
2 cups chicken bone broth
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded
½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
½ cup salsa verde
2 tablespoons butter
¼ cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pound boiled boneless, skinless chicken breast, shredded
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Roast poblano peppers over open flame on a gas stove or grill until all sides are charred, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.
Combine chicken broth, cream cheese, Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses, and salsa verde in a blender. Blend until smooth.
Peel the cooled poblano peppers and remove seeds. Finely chop peppers in a food processor.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and cumin. Cook and stir until slightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add poblanos and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken and saute for 2 minutes more.
Pour cheese mixture into a stockpot over low heat. Add the chicken mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook until heated through, at least 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
