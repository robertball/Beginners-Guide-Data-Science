Description: 
Moist tender trout is draped in a creamy Parmesan cheese coating that makes this dish elegant enough to serve company. 'I picked up this recipe at the campground where we were staying,' says Mary Zimmerman of Spring Lake, Michigan. 'I also use the delicious sour cream mixture on salmon.'
