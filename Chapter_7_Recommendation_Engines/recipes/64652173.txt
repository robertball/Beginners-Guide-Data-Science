Ingredients:
1 pound Italian Sausages (hot Or Sweet, In Casings)
1 pound Penne Pasta
3 Tablespoons Etxra Virgin Olive Oil
1 26 oz. jar Spaghetti Sauce (use your favorite or homemade)
1 16 oz. bag Frozen Peppers And Onions (I Use Birds Eye And It's A Mix Of Green, Red And Yellow Peppers And Onions)

Directions:
Boil sausages in water until cooked through, approximately 25-30 minutes. Drain and cool slightly until easy to handle.
Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet with deep sides, heat olive oil.
Cut sausages into about 1/2 inch rings and place in skillet to lightly brown.
When the sausages are browned to your liking, add in the bag of frozen peppers and onions (no need to thaw ahead). Cook and stir until peppers are thawed and heated through (there will be liquid, this is ok).
Add in the spaghetti sauce and cook until heated through and peppers and onions are tender.
Add pasta and toss to coat.
Serve with grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!

I came up with this recipe after my husband's favorite dish at a local Italian restaurant was no longer on the menu. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
