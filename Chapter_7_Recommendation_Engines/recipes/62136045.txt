Ingredients:
1 medium-large eggplant, peeled and sliced lengthwise into 1/4" slices
1 log fresh goat's cheese (4-6 oz)
2 whole roasted red peppers (from jar packed in water) jar, diced
olive oil
Italian seasoning

Directions:
After peeling and slicing the eggplant, lightly salt both sides of the slices and refridgerate for at least 30 minutes (longer is fine, too.)
Rinse slices in cool water and pat dry with paper towel.
Spray or lightly brush both sides with olive oil and sprinkle to taste with Italian seasoning (or dry basil/oregano).
Place on medium-heat, closed grill for 3 minutes each side. Do not turn until 3 minutes is up.
While grilling, soften unwrapped cheese in microwave for 20-30 seconds until soft/spreadable.
Remove eggplant from grill, spread with softened goat's cheese, and sprinkle with diced red peppers.
Can serve flat and open-faced or roll-up. To re-warm, place for 2 minutes on low-heat grill.
