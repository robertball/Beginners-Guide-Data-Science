brush grill pan with olive oil
Arrange coated tomato halves cut side down on grill pan
Grill on low heat for about 10-15min

Tomatoes should be soft, but not falling apart
Remove from heat, and let cool.
In a blender or food processor, finely chop the shallots.
Add vinegar and brown sugar, and process until smooth.
Slowly add oil, processing frequently, so as to thicken the mixture.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Brush romaine hearts with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.
Place romaine hearts on the preheated grill.
Cook 5 to 10 minutes, turning frequently, until slightly charred but not heated all the way through. Serve warm on salad plates surrounded by tomato pieces and drizzled with the shallot dressing.
