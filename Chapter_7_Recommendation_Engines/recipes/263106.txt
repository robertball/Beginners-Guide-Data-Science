Ingredients:
1 onion, cut into thin slices
2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
4 limes, divided
water to cover
3/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 quart canola oil for frying
18 corn tortillas
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark beer
1 1/4 pounds whitefish, cut into 3x1-inch strips
1 egg
1/3 head cabbage, thinly sliced
1 cup pico de gallo salsa
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place onion in resealable plastic bag with 1 teaspoon salt, basil, and oregano. Squeeze in juice from 1 1/2 limes. Add enough water to help spread marinade all over the onion slices. Seal and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, and the juice of 1 lime in a bowl. Mix, adding more lime juice as needed, until the white sauce is runny. Cut the remaining limes into wedges.
Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep pot over medium heat.
Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place tortillas in oven to keep warm.
Whisk flour, beer, and egg together in a medium bowl until texture resembles pancake batter. Dip 3 to 4 pieces of fish into the mixture and fry in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining fish.
Place fried fish over warmed tortillas, topped with the marinated onions, white sauce, lime wedges, cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro.

I went to Baja California to visit parents and tried to copy the taste of what we had at a few taco stands there, and this fried fish taco is closest we could come up with.
