Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 pound ground beef
1 1/2 teaspoons dried minced onion
1 garlic clove, pressed
2 (10.75 ounce) cans tomato soup
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 pinch Italian seasoning, or to taste
1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste
3 slices fat-free American cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and minced onion in the hot skillet until almost browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic to ground beef mixture and cook until beef is browned, 2 to 3 more minutes; drain and discard excess grease.
Stir macaroni, tomato soup, corn, Italian seasoning, and seasoned salt into ground beef mixture; top with American cheese slices. Cover skillet until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes; stir well.

Description: 
Hot dish or goulash, call it what you want. I grew up on this quick and easy meal. I have tweaked the ingredients a bit, but the results are just as good. Serve with a side salad for a great weekday dinner. Enjoy.
