Ingredients:
3 1/4 cup flour
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400ยบ F.
In a small bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt.  Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Beat for 2 minutes.  Add flour mixture, and stir until well mixed.
Refrigerate for 20 minutes.
Split dough in half and roll out each half between 2 sheets of plastic wrap until 1/4 inch thick. Place the wrapped dough on a flat surface put in freezer for 20 minutes.
Cut into desired shapes. Using a spatula, transfer the cookies to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake for 7-8 minutes. The cookies may appear as if not done, but they are.
Allow to cool, then frost with buttercream frosting. I like to bake one day, then frost the next.

Description: 
My best friend's mom passed this recipe down to her and she passed it along to me.  I love this recipe because the cookies hold their shape and retain a crisp cut-line, rather than puffing out.
