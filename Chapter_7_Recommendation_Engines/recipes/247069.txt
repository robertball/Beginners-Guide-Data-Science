Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons crushed dried rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and spray them with cooking spray.
Drop tablespoonfuls of Parmesan cheese 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten them out to the size of a potato chip. Sprinkle rosemary and garlic salt on top.
Bake in the preheated oven just until edges start to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes; lift off with a spatula and transfer to a wire rack to cool until firm, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Perfect with a Caesar salad, these tasty treats are super easy to make and absolutely addictive! I love them with crushed rosemary and a dash of garlic salt but they are good on their own or with your favorite savory seasoning. Serve immediately for best results or store in an airtight container between waxed paper.
