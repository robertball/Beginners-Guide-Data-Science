Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds beef chuck short ribs
2 whole shallots, minced
3 stalks celery, diced
3 cups dry red wine
1 cup beef broth
2 Tbs tomato paste
2 Tbs flour
2 bay leaves
salt
fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Pat short ribs dry with a paper towel. Season each piece of meat with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. When hot, add the ribs and brown, cooking about 3-4 minutes per side. Don't overcrowd the pan, work in batches if necessary.
After the ribs have browned, remove from pan and place in the bottom of the slow cooker.
Take the pan off the heat briefly to cook down, then return to medium heat and add the shallots and celery. Saute for about five minutes or until tender then add the tomato paste onto the veggies. Using a rubber spatula continue to saute on medium heat for another four minutes.
Pour the wine and the beef broth into the skillet and stir. Whisk in the flour, making sure to break up any clumps. Add bay leaves, thyme and season with salt and pepper.
Bring sauce to a boil, then to a simmer. Pour sauce right over the ribs in the slow cooker. Place lid on slow cooker and cook on high for seven to eight hours or on low for 11-12 hours. When done, the meat should literally be falling off the bone. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.
