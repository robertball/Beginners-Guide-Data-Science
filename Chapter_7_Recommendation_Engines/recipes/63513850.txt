Ingredients:
Cake:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup ground almonds
1 ½ tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
3 large eggs
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 tsp orange zest
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup sliced almonds, toasted and cooled
Glaze:
1-1/2 cup confectioner’s sugar
3 tbsp milk, soy milk, or water
1/4 tsp fresh lemon juice
1/4 tsp almond liquor

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour the pan and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them slightly to break up the yolks. Add the sugar and whisk it in very thoroughly. Add the olive oil and whisk until the mixture is lighter in color and has thickened slightly, about one minute. Whisk in the extract and zest, and the orange juice.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and whisk until they are thoroughly combined and you are left with a smooth batter.
5. Fold in the cooled toasted almonds.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes.
7. The cake is done when it springs back slightly when touched and a cake tester comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely before glazing.
8. To make the glaze, pour the confectioners sugar into a owl and whisk slightly to break up any clumps. Add the milk, liquor, and lemon and whisk until completely smooth. Taste the glaze—if it’s too sweet, add a few more drops of lemon juice. Pour the glaze onto he top of the cake and allow it to drip down the sides. Let it set for a couple of minutes, and enjoy.

Description: 
Though every year I plan on staying away from these oily fried foods, I can’t seem to do itI have too much holiday spirit to renounce the tradition all together (especialy if they’re Indian-spiced)! Instead, I decided to come up with another option for those more health-conscious and more averse to oil stains: Olive Oil Cake.
