Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup canola oil
3/4 cup unsweetened soy milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Stir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine the oil and soy milk in a measuring cup. Pour into the dry ingredients all at once, and stir just until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.
Bake for 8 to10 minutes in the preheated oven, until the biscuits are browned on the top and bottom.
