Make the Filling
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
With a mixer, beat together until light and fluffy the cream cheese, cocoa, sugar and vanilla. Add the 2 eggs and beat until smooth.  Stir in the chocolate chips.  Pour into crust and bake 20 minutes or until only the center jiggles a bit.
Remove from oven and let cool 15 minutes.  Raise oven temperature to 425.
Add the topping and bake
Spread on the sour cream topping and return to oven and bake 10 minutes.  Let cool slowly.  Decorate the top as you wish.
