Ingredients:
3 avocados
1/2 a white onion, diced
1/2 a red or orange pepper, diced
4 green onions
1 tbsp lime juice (or the juice of one lime)
1/2 jar of hot peppers*
3-4 cloves of crushed garlic
pinch of cayenne pepper
fresh ground pepper to taste
cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Mash the avocados to as smooth a paste as you like.  A couple lumps are okay, in fact I often mash two into a smooth paste and keep one a little chunkier.
Diced all onions and peppers and mix into avocado mixture. Add crushed garlic, pepper, lime juice, cayenne pepper and cilantro and lots of love!
Refrigerate until ready to use.  Keep cellophane touching the surface of the gaucamole to prevent browning. Just as good the next night!
Garnish with colourful pepper pieces, cilantro and green onion.

Description: 
The recipe was inspired by my hairdresser and friend Crystal who used to put out a great Guac recipe when I'd get my hair done.  I've figured out the portions for hers and tweaked it a bit.  

I half the recipe for yummy California Burgers with my boyfriend and we have enough left over the next night for taco chips or nachos! Enjoy. :)
