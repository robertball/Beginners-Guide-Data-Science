Ingredients:
1 large head garlic, or to taste
3 slices bread, or more as needed
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 on-the-vine tomato, sliced
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Wrap garlic in aluminum foil.
Bake garlic in the preheated oven until dark brown and softened, about 30 minutes. Remove garlic from the foil and let cool, about 7 minutes.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet.
Peel garlic into a bowl; mash with butter to form a chunky paste. Mix in mayonnaise. Spread garlic butter over the bread slices; top with tomato and Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bread has absorbed the garlic butter, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
First, don't let the times scare you away, you'll see it's not so hard. This is a recipe that I adapted from other garlic bread recipes; I wanted to try making my own garlic bread after realizing how bad the store-bought versions were.
