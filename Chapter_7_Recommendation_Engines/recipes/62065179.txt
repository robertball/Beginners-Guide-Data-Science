Ingredients:
½ cup canola oil
1 large onion finely chopped
1 tbsp. minced ginger
½ tsp. salt
3 tsp. coriander (fresh or dry)
2 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. chili powder
1 tsp. turmeric
1 tsp. dry mustard powder
6 whole cloves
5 whole cardamoms
½ cinnamon stick
½ cup water
1 can coconut milk
2 peeled and chopped tomatoes
1 lb. peeled & divined shrimp

Directions:
Heat oil over medium/high heat and fry the onion until golden. This should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the ginger and spices and fry. Once the spices start to stick to the bottom of the pan add the water and cook until aromatic. This should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes and your home should smell like an Indian restaurant at this point.
Add the tomatoes to the masala and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the shrimp to the masala and stir until coated completely and turns pink slightly. This should take another 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk and simmer for 15 minutes.
Shrimp curry is best served with Basmati rice.
