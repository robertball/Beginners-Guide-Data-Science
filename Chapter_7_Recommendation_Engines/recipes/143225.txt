Ingredients:
8 pounds untrimmed beef brisket
1 cup strong black coffee
1 (14 ounce) bottle ketchup
1 (12 fluid ounce) can cola carbonated beverage
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed

Directions:
Place the beef brisket in a large slow cooker with the fat side up. Pour the coffee over the meat. Cook the brisket on LOW for 24 hours.
Meanwhile, stir together the ketchup, cola beverage, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, liquid smoke, and brown sugar in a bowl until well blended. Refrigerate until needed.
After 24 hours, remove and discard any fat from the brisket. Use a fork to pull apart and shred the meat. Pour the sauce over the meat, stirring to coat evenly, and cook 1 hour longer.

Description: 
This slow-cooker recipe comes directly from the heart of a wonderful Texas cook who makes the best brisket in the world! Yay, Papa Louis! He shared it with me years ago, via my sister (his daughter-in-law). I change it from time to time by adding ingredients to make it more Mexican (serve it with tortillas), or leave it as is and serve it with fresh rolls.
