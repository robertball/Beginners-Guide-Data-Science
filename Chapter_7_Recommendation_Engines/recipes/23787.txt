Description: 
I run a day care and was looking for a good snack too feed the kids with little sugar but still big on taste. I came up with these. I have made a batch of these for the last three days now and can't keep them around. Even the parents have been asking for the recipe. Frost with the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting recipe.
