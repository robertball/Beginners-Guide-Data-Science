Ingredients:
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth
1 tsp. of minced garlic
1/2 tsp. of rosemary
sliced onion
1 pound thinly sliced deli roast beef
8 slices provolone cheese
4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Open the hoagie rolls and lay out on a baking sheet.
Saute onions in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat until browned.  Add beef broth, garlic, and rosemary  to make a rich beef broth. Place the roast beef in the broth and warm for 3 minutes. Arrange the meat and onions on the hoagie rolls and top each roll with 2 slices of provolone.
Bake the sandwiches in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese just begins to melt. Serve the sandwiches with small bowls of the warm broth for dipping.
