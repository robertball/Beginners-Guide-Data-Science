Ingredients:
1 cup panko breadcrumbs (sub for 1 cup ground oatmeal for gluten free)
1/2 cup whole milk (I usually use half and half)
2 lb ground chicken
1 small onion shredded
1/4 cup roughly chopped parsley
1 tsp dried oregano
10 oz frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry
3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 large eggs (beaten)
1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 cup honey mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
In a large bowl, mix together breadcrumbs and milk. Let stand until breadcrumbs have absorbed milk and are soft. Add remaining ingredients and combine.
Form mixture into the shape of a football and place on a rimmed baking heet lined with parchment paper.
Bake about 25 minutes, then brush top with 1/4 honey mustard. Continue baking until internal temp reaches 160, about 15 minutes more.
Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
