Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable stock
1 head cauliflower, roughly chopped
2 medium Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and chopped
2 carrots, roughly chopped
1/2 red onion, roughly chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Combine vegetable stock, cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, onion, salt, and pepper in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Close and lock the lid. Select Soup/Broth setting according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Use an immersion blender to carefully puree soup until smooth. Drizzle olive oil once soup is smooth with the blender running.
Taste soup and season with more salt and pepper, if needed.

Description: 
A luxurious vegan cauliflower soup that requires hardly any prep time and is ready in a flash. I find the secret to making a satisfying pureed vegetable soup that's vegan is to drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while blending. It lends richness to the soup, not to mention the olive oil helps your body absorb all of the nutrients!
