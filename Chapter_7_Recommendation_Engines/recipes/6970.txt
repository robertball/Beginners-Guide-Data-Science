Ingredients:
1 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon hot water
1/4 cup margarine
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup margarine
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cherry jam

Directions:
Preheat oven 350 F (175 degrees C).  Line a 12-cup-muffin-pan with paper baking cups.
Cream 1/4 cup butter or margarine and white sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy.  Gradually add small amounts of beaten egg, beating continuously.  In a small bowl, combine cocoa powder and hot water. Stir cocoa mixture into batter. Fold in flour using figure eight movement.  If the mixture is too stiff, batter should slowly drop off spoon when lifted from bowl, add a small amount of water.  Divide mixture into 12 muffin cups.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until well risen and firm to touch.   Allow to cool.
Cream 1/4 cup butter or margarine until soft.  Gradually add sifted confectioners sugar and vanilla extract.  Mix cream filling until smooth.
Cut circles from tops of muffins, and halve these to resemble butterfly wings.  Put a small amount of cherry jam in the cut out hole, and cover with a teaspoon of cream filling.  Place the wing shapes into the cream filling curved side down.
