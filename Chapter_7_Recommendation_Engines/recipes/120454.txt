2 (3 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped green chiles

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese. Add the cheddar cheese, chilies, olives, onion and hot pepper sauce. Separate each tube of crescent dough into four rectangles; press perforations to seal.
Spread cheese mixture over dough. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side. Cut each roll into 10 slices; place on greased baking sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
