Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (15.25 ounce) can white corn kernels, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 1/2 cups cooked long-grain white rice
1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
3/4 cup chopped lettuce
1/3 (8 ounce) jar salsa
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Season chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.
Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and cooked through, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips or bite-sized pieces.
Warm corn and black beans in separate saucepans over medium-low heat, covered, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
Layer cooked rice, corn, black beans, and chicken on 2 serving plates. Top with Monterey Jack cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream.

Description: 
I love to eat at places like Qdoba® and Chipotle®, so I created my own chicken burrito at home, minus the tortilla! This is very easy for a weeknight meal and is very filling and healthy; the recipe can easily be increased for more people.
