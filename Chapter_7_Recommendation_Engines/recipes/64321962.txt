Ingredients:
1 spray(s) cooking spray to coat pan
1/2 pounds fish, salmon fillet, (about 1" thick), skin removed
salt to lightly salt water
4 ounce(s) pasta, whole-wheat, shells or twists
1/2 cup(s) peas, baby, fresh or frozen
1 ounce(s) cheese, feta, reduced-fat, crumbled (1/3 cup)
1/8 cup(s) mint, fresh chopped, plus mint leaves for garnish
1 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh

Directions:
Heat the broiler. Cover a broiler pan with foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. Place salmon on the broiler pan and broil until fish is opaque and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove salmon from the broiler and transfer to a large bowl.
When cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size pieces. While salmon is cooking, bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.
Cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, adding peas during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain pasta and peas and transfer to the bowl with salmon.
In a medium bowl, whisk together feta, mint, lemon juice, salt, and reserved 1/4 cup pasta cooking water to make a sauce. Pour sauce over pasta and salmon and toss gently to coat. Serve warm.
Each serving is a generous 1 1/2 cups.
