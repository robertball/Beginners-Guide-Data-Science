Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef or turkey
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 cup shredded Cheddar or Colbyjack cheese
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons steak sauce
For sauce:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir the ground meat, bread crumbs, cheese, onion soup, eggs, 1/4 cup ketchup, and steak sauce in a large bowl until well combined.  Whisk the brown sugar and 1/2 cup ketchup until smooth.  Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.  Spread half of the brown sugar-ketchup mixture in the bottom of the pan.  Add the meatloaf mixture, then spread the remaining brown sugar-ketchup sauce on top.
Bake in preheated oven until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, 45 to 60 minutes.
