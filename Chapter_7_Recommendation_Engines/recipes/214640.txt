Ingredients:
2 cups chopped onions
1 cup strong black coffee
1 cup ketchup
1 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup hot chili peppers, minced
3 tablespoons chili powder
6 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Mix together the onions, coffee, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, cider vinegar, hot chilies, chili powder, garlic, and salt in a saucepan until the brown sugar has dissolved. Place over medium heat, bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Pour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth. Store in glass container in refrigerator.

Description: 
Yes, this barbecue sauce actually calls for coffee. The coffee helps to give the sauce a unique flavor which works particularly well on beef, but you just might find yourself putting this sauce on most anything.
