Ingredients:
1 cup plain yogurt
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
3 slices whole wheat bread
3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups dried bread crumbs
1 cup French-fried onions
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon coarsely crushed coriander seed
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 pounds ground beef
3 cups vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, mix together yogurt, salt, small jalapeno pepper, and  3 tablespoons chopped parsley. Set dipping sauce aside.
Soak bread slices in water for 3 minutes.  Remove from water, and squeeze out excess moisture.  Crumble into a large bowl. Mix in eggs and Worcestershire sauce. Mix in dried bread crumbs, fried onions, garlic, ginger, ground cumin, crushed coriander seed, 4 tablespoons parsley, and large jalapeno pepper.  Add ground beef, and work in with your hands until well mixed.
Roll mixture into balls the size of walnuts.
Heat 3 cups of oil in a large, deep, heavy bottomed frying pan until piping hot, about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  Cook meatballs a few at a time in hot oil until brown and crispy, about 3 to 4 minutes.  To check for doneness, cut one in half to see if cooked through; it should be cooked in the center.  Remove from oil using a slotted spoon, and place on a plate lined with paper towels to drain.  Insert a toothpick into each meatball for serving and dipping.  Serve hot or cold with dipping sauce.

This recipe is not difficult to make, even though it has quite a number of ingredients.  It's a great party appetizer. This recipe can be found in my cookbook From Uncle Bill's Kitchen.
