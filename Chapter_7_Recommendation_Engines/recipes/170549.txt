Description: 
This is a fresh alternative to the tired tuna salad. A unique, yet pleasant mixture of flavors. Also, you can adjust ingredient amounts for a personalized taste. I like it sweet with a bite. You can also use 1 slice of jack or favorite kind of white cheese to melt on top. Use for a sandwich, with wheat or grain crackers for a snack or a twist for hors d'oeuvres at your cocktail party.
