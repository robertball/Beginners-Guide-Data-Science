Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1/4 cup Earth Balance Margarine
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups cooked navy beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 cups soy milk
1 cup asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
salt and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, about 11 minutes. Drain well.
Meanwhile, melt the &#34;butter&#34; in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2/3 cup of the beans and 1/2 cup of soy milk; mash with the back of a spoon or a potato masher to create a thick paste. Stir in the remaining soy milk to create a thick sauce. Mix in the remaining beans and asparagus; simmer until asparagus is tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Toss pasta with the sauce, and serve.
