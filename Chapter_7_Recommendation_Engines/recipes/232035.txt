Ingredients:
10 roma tomatoes
1 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons garlic salt
1 tablespoon white vinegar

Directions:
Place tomatoes, water, and olive oil in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer tomato mixture to a large pot.
Stir sugar, garlic salt, and vinegar into tomato mixture and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Pour tomato sauce into a clean blender or food processor no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until tomato sauce is very smooth.

Description: 
I noticed that most (all?) the pizza sauce recipes call for either tomato paste or tomato sauce or both. I wanted to do it from scratch! So I experimented until I got it right. This is much better than the store-bought sauce with none of those nasty preservatives.
