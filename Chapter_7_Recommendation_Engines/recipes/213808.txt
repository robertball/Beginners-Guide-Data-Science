Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened coconut cream
1 tablespoon cornstarch
4 1/2 cups grated, peeled yucca root (tapioca root)
1 cup water
2 cups flaked coconut, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Mix the sugar, coconut cream, and cornstarch together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves completely. Add the grated cassava, water, and about 1/3 of the grated coconut; mix well.
Toss the remaining coconut with the salt in a separate bowl; set aside.
Bring a couple inches of water to boil in a wok or large pot. Arrange 8 1-cup ramekins into a large steamer insert and place over the boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove the insert and spoon the cassava mixture into the heated ramekins to fill. Sprinkle a portion of the coconut over the top of each cake.
Steam the cakes over the boiling water until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Depending on the size of your steamer, you may need to do this in multiple batches. Make sure you have enough water to continually boil, if this is the case.
