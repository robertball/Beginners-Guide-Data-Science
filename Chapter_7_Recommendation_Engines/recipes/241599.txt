Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup uncooked whole grain quinoa, well rinsed
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 cup granulated sugar
3 eggs
1/4 cup lime juice
2 teaspoons finely grated lime zest
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Gay Lea Real Coconut Whipped Cream
Chopped fresh mango
Toasted coconut

Directions:
Bring water and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan with a tight fitting lid set over medium heat. Add quinoa; cover and cook over low heat for 15 minutes or until fluid is absorbed.
Meanwhile, whisk coconut milk with sugar, eggs, and lime juice. Stir into quinoa. Return pan to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly for 5 to 7 minutes or until thickened. Remove from heat; stir in lime zest and vanilla.
Cool to room temperature; transfer to the refrigerator and chill completely. (Pudding can be reserved in a covered container for up to 3 days.)
Spoon into bowls and garnish with a generous amount of coconut whipped cream, mango, and toasted coconut.
