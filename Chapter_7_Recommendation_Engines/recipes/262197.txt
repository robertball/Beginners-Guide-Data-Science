Ingredients:
3 cups water
2 red onions, thinly sliced into half-moons
3/4 cup white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
5 black peppercorns

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan.
Stuff onion slices into a pint-size Mason jar. Pour some of the boiling water over the onions. Let rest for 10 seconds. Pour out water through a mesh strainer, keeping onions in the jar. Repeat twice more to cook onions slightly.
Measure vinegar into a bowl. Stir in salt and sugar until dissolved. Add peppercorns. Pour vinegar solution over onions. Seal and shake well.
Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving so that the flavor develops.
