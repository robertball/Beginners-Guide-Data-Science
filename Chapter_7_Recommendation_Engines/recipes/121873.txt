Ingredients:
2 (18.25 ounce) packages devil's food cake mix
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the cake mixes, oil and eggs; mix well. Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Do not flatten. Bake at 350 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until set. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks (cookies will flatten as the cool).
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and butter. Add sugar and vanilla; beat until smooth. Spread on the bottom of half of the cookies; top with remaining cookies. Store in the refrigerator.

Description: 
These cookies freeze well, so it's easy to keep some on hand for last-minute munching. In summer, I often make them larger to use for ice cream sandwiches.
