Ingredients:
8 fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and sliced into thin wedges
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
1/4 cup boiling water
MIX TOGETHER:
3 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine peaches, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and cornstarch.
Toss to coat evenly, and pour into a 2 quart baking dish. Bake at 425° for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Blend in butter with your fingertips, or a pastry blender, until mixture resembles coarse meal.
Stir in water until just combined.
Remove peaches from oven, and drop spoonfuls of topping over them.
Sprinkle entire cobbler with the sugar and cinnamon mixture.
Bake at 425° until topping is golden, about 30 minutes.
