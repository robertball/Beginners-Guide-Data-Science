Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
10 ounces salmon, cut into thin strips
1 leek, sliced
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, crushed
3/4 cup light cream
3/4 cup sour cream
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
8 ounces dry fettuccine noodles
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the salmon, leek, onion, and garlic, and fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix together the cream, sour cream, and cornstarch; stir into the skillet. Stir in the lemon zest, pepper, and paprika. Cook, stirring constantly, for 10 minutes, until sauce is thickened and salmon flakes easily with a fork.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and toss with the salmon sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.

This is the ultimate pasta dish - no matter if it's a casual weekday supper or fancy dinner party you're preparing it for, it is always delicious. The only way a fish-hating friend of mine craves to have salmon, too!
