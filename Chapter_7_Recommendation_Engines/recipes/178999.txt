Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cheddar Cheese Soup
1/2 cup Pace® Thick & Chunky Salsa
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
5 cups tortilla chips
1 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Stir the soup and salsa in a 2-quart saucepan.
Cook the beef and onion in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is well browned, stirring often to separate meat. Pour off any fat. Stir 1/2 cup soup mixture into the skillet.  Cook until the beef mixture is hot and bubbling.
Heat the remaining soup mixture over medium heat until it's hot and bubbling.
Place the chips onto a serving platter and top with the beef mixture. Spoon the soup mixture over the beef mixture. Top with the tomato and jalapeno pepper, if desired.
