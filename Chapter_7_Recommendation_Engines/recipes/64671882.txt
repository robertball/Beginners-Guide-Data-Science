Ingredients:
50 g brie cheese
sprinkle of paprika

Directions:
Cut the rind off the brie cheese and cut into cubes, about ½ inch (1×1 cm).
Line a plate with baking paper.
Place a few pieces of the brie cheese on the paper at a time, making sure there is 3-5 cm between pieces.
Bake in the microwave oven for 1–2 minutes.
Do not stop the cooking until they puff. Brie will at first melt, then puff up.
Watch so as not to let them burn.  Once puffed, they are finished.
Sprinkle paprika over puffs and let cool.
