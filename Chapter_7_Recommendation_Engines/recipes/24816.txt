Ingredients:
1/4 head savoy cabbage, thinly sliced
4 apples, cored and diced with peel
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts
6 stalks celery, diced
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Use a chef's knife to slice cabbage into thin pieces 1 to 2 inches long.  Do not use the large ribs of the cabbage, as they are too strongly flavored.
In a large bowl, toss together the cabbage, apples, walnuts, celery, mayonnaise, sugar and salt until evenly coated.  Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to one day.

Description: 
My dad always made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  He called it Waldorf Salad, but it is really a cabbage salad 'Waldorf style'.
