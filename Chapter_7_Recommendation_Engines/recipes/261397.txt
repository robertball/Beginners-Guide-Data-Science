Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 small beets, peeled and chopped
3 small white potatoes, scrubbed and cubed
2 turnips, peeled and cubed
2 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 sweet potato, peeled and cubed
2 red potatoes, scrubbed and cubed
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1/2 lemon
2 tablespoons dried rosemary
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 pinch ground coriander
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch kale, stemmed and chopped
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Spread beets, white potatoes, turnips, carrots, sweet potato, and red potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil on top. Squeeze lemon juice over vegetables and season with rosemary, thyme, coriander, cayenne, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until root vegetables are just tender, about 45 minutes.
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet when root vegetables are nearly done. Cook and stir garlic over medium heat until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add kale; cook and stir until bright green, about 5 minutes. Season with sea salt and mix into the root vegetables.
