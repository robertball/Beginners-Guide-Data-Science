Ingredients:
1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 ounces crumbled blue cheese
2/3 cup barbecue sauce
4 onion rolls or hamburger buns

Directions:
In a skillet, saute mushrooms in butter for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Set aside and keep warm.
In a bowl, combine the beef and seasonings just until mixed. Shape into eight thin patties. Sprinkle half of the patties with blue cheese; tip with remaining patties and press edges firmly to seal.
Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 3 minutes on each side. Brush with some of the barbecue sauce. Grill 10-12 minutes longer or until juices run clear, basting and turning occasionally. Drain the mushrooms. Serve burgers on rolls topped with mushrooms.
