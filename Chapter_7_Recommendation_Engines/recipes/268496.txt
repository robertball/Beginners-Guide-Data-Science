Ingredients:
2 jumbo hot dogs
1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix
2 hot dog buns
1/3 cup guacamole
4 tablespoons salsa
6 pickled jalapeno slices

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Make sure the air fryer is at temperature for at least 4 minutes.
Cut 5 slits into each hot dog. Evenly rub 1/2 teaspoon taco seasoning over each hot dog.
Cook hot dogs in the air fryer basket for 5 minutes. Place hot dogs in buns and return to the basket. Cook until buns are toasted and hot dogs are crisp, about 4 minutes more.
Top hot dogs with equal amounts of guacamole, salsa, and jalapenos.

Description: 
Hot dogs cooked in an air fryer inside their buns, then topped with taco fixings, will redefine Taco Tuesday. The air fryer renders the hot dogs crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
