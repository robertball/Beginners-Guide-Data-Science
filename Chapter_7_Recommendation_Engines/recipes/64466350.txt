Ingredients:
1 small onion- chopped
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbsp. salted butter
6 ounce fresh baby spinach
2 cups packed fresh kale, rinsed
1 large scallion
1 egg
2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs, plus extra for coating
1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
salt and pepper to taste
dash of cayenne pepper
olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a frying pan, heat and melt butter with olive oil.  Add onion and saut√© until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add spinach and kale and cook until they wilt, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Place cooked contents into a food processor along with one chopped scallion and pulse for several seconds. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.
Add one egg, 2/3 cup of panko breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese.  Mix with a spoon until well combined.  Add salt and black pepper to taste and a dash of cayenne pepper.
In a small bowl or dish, pour some panko breadcrumbs. Take a teaspoon full the spinach and kale mixture into your hand.  Make a small ball with your hands (larger than a quarter, smaller than a golf ball).
Gently roll ball into panko breadcrumbs to coat evenly.
Lightly spray baking sheet with cooking spray.  Place the spinach and kale bites onto baking sheet.

Description: 
Although the original recipe came from the Edmontosaurus, it's my understanding that Dinomite added the kale to the dish.
