Ingredients:
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon ground ancho chile pepper
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
2 (1 1/4 pound) boneless pork tenderloins
kosher salt
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/3 cup cherry preserves
1/3 cup white vinegar (use less/balsamic?)
1 pinch dried oregano
Sage

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk cocoa powder, ancho chile powder, cumin, black pepper, and chipotle pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
Generously season tenderloins with salt, then coat in the cocoa powder mixture. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place tenderloins in the skillet and reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned on each side, about 4 minutes.
Transfer tenderloins to a baking dish; cook in the preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Whisk cherry preserves, vinegar, and oregano in a small saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil and cook 30 seconds. Remove from heat; season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon sauce over pork tenderloin and serve.
