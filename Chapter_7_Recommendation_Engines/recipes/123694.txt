Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
CARAMEL FILLING:
1 cup chopped pecans
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
FROSTING:
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 teaspoons water
1/4 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add milk, eggs, sugar, butter, salt and 2 cups four; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft but sticky dough. Do not knead. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Beat 25 strokes with a spoon; turn onto a well-floured surface. Roll into a 16-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Combine filling ingredients with a fork; spread evenly over the dough. Cut dough lengthwise into three strips. Roll up jelly-roll style, beginning at a long end; pinch edges and ends to seal. Place three rolls diagonally, seam side down, on a foil-lined 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Braid ropes together gently (do not stretch); seal ends. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and cool slightly on wire rack. For frosting, heat butter in a saucepan over low heat until golden brown; cool slightly. Stir in sugar and vanilla. Stir in enough water to make a spreadable consistency. Frost top of braid; immediately sprinkle with pecans.

Description: 
It's become a Christmas-morning tradition for my husband, me and our two young children to much on this scrumptious bread with its nutty filling while opening gifts. Since I make it ahead, I can also relax and enjoy the festivities.
