Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon butter
½ medium onion, sliced or diced
8 ounces sliced mushrooms

Description: 
This is a fairly lean version of beef stroganoff, as most recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to coat the meat and noodles.
