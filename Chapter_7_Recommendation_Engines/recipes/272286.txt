1/2 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese
2 teaspoons white sugar
4 drops vanilla extract
3 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
10 strawberries, thinly sliced, or more to taste
3 kiwis, thinly sliced
2 bananas, thinly sliced

Directions:
Mash cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla together with fork until smooth.
Top each tortilla with 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture, spreading it into a square all the way to the edges. Arrange strawberries and kiwis in a single layer inside each square. Top with banana slices. Fold up tortillas, pushing in any filling that slides out. Set wraps seam sides down on a plate and press to seal.
Freeze for 10 minutes to set. Cut wraps in half on the bias.
