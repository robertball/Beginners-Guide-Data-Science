Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1/4 tsp each)
1 can (5.5 oz) tomato paste
1 can (10 oz) tomato soup
2 cups water
1/2 cup uncooked white rice
4 cups shredded cabbage
Sour cream

Directions:
Brown the beef with the onions. Add garlic, salt, pepper, tomato paste, tomato soup, and water. Bring to boil and stir in rice. Simmer for 20 minutes.
Place half the cabbage in a greased casserole dish; cover with half the beef mixture. Repeat layers.
Cover and bake in 350 oven for one hour. Serve with sour cream.
(May be made ahead and refrigerated before baking. Just let sit at room temp while preheating oven.)
