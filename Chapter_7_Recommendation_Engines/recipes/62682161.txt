Ingredients:
2 tsp flour
4 medium sized potatoes cubed
1 bunch bulb onions sliced
6 carrots cubed
4 pieces of chicken, rinsed
1 large 20 oz pineapple slices can

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use one large browning bag. Place the 2 tsp of flour in the bag and shake it around to coat the bag. Cut up the potatoes, onions, and carrots. Place them in the bag. Then rinse the chicken and place it in the bag. Top the chicken/vegetables with the pineapple slices. Shake the bag with the chicken/vegetables so that the flour coats them. Tie the bag and place on a baking sheet in the oven for 50 minutes. Check for the chicken to be done/baking time may have to be adjusted according to your oven.
