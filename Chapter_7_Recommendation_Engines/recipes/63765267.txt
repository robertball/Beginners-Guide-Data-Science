Ingredients:
Brownies:
1.5 cups black beans
0.25 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
0.25 cup chocolate whey protein powder
0.75 cup egg substitute
2 T. Walden Farms zero calorie chocolate dip
2 T. nonfat plain Greek yogurt
1 T. tub margarine, melted
8 T. Stevia in the Raw (all natural zero calorie sweetener)
1 t. vanilla extract
Frosting:
-12 T. peanut flour + 12 T. water to reconstitute
(or 6 T. all natural peanut butter)
-All natural zero calorie sweetener to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray an 8 X 8-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Combine the beans, cocoa powder, protein powder, and egg substitiute in the bowl of a food processor. Process until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes.
Add the chocolate dip, Greek yogurt, butter, Stevia, and vanilla. Process until all the ingredients are combined, about 1 minute.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish, and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 28 to 30 minutes, turning the dish halfway through the baking time. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out with soft batter clinging to it.
Let the brownies cool completely in the baking dish on a wire rack. Cut into 12 squares and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers.
