Ingredients:
2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/2 cup good red wine
1/4 cup EVOO
2 TBSP crushed or minced garlic
1 TBSP dried basil
1/2 tbsp dried oregano
1/2 tbsp dried minced onion
1 tbsp dried parsley
1/2 tbsp ground black pepper
pinch or two dried thyme
pinch or two dried sage
pinch or two dried marjoram
pinch of paprika

Directions:
Whisk wine, garlic, oil, onions, and all spices briskly in a small bowl.  Set aside.
Pre-heat oven for 375.
In a skillet over med-high heat, briefly brown chicken in a little butter or oil, but do not cook through.
Pierce browned chicken with fork.
Pour mixture into an 8x8 casserole dish.
Add chicken, flip to coat, cover with foil and place in center of oven.
Flip chicken once or twice while cooking.
30 minutes into cooking, uncover chicken and continue cooking until cooked through.
Remove from oven, let cool a little, and serve topped with the remaining juices.
Marinating chicken in the wine mixture for a couple of hours enhances the complex flavors of this dish.

Description: 
Purple chicken.  What more can you say?  I mean, its purple!  Good red wine is essential (for taste and color).  So is a good extra virgin olive oil.  Serve with simple sides like stuffing or rice and fresh steamed veggies.
