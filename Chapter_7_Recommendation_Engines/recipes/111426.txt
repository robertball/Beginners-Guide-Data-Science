Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 cloves garlic, sliced
2 (1 pound) grouse, cut into quarters and patted dry
1/4 cup dry sherry or white wine
1/4 cup chicken stock
2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon
1/4 cup peach or apricot jam
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Melt the butter with the garlic in a large skillet over low heat.  Allow to bubble slowly for about 10 minutes to infuse the garlic into the butter, then remove garlic and reserve.
Increase the heat to medium-high.  When hot, brown the grouse until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side; then set aside.
Pour the sherry into the skillet and allow to simmer for 20 seconds.  Stir in the chicken stock, tarragon, and peach jam; bring back to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the balsamic vinegar, and cook, covered for 2 minutes.  Return the grouse to the pan, and simmer until fully cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
I first tasted this in a restaurant owned by a friend who specializes in game bird dishes and loved it.  He graciously gave me this simple but elegant recipe that I've been making for 10 years.  This sauce has a mild sweet taste, a beautiful color and tastes delicious with delicate game meats such as grouse, pheasant or quail.  Serve with wild rice pilaf and it's perfect for company.
