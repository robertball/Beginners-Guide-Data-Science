Ingredients:
1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
8 slices bacon, diced
1 large tomato, diced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 large egg yolks
3 sprigs fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place squash, cut side up, on a baking sheet.
Bake squash in the preheated oven until tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Scoop out flesh and shred squash into strands using a fork.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir bacon in the hot oil until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add shredded squash; cook and stir until squash is softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir tomato, salt, and pepper into squash mixture; remove skillet from heat.
Stir egg yolks into squash mixture, without letting the egg yolks touch the skillet, until mixture is creamy. Transfer squash carbonara to a serving bowl; garnish with basil sprigs.
