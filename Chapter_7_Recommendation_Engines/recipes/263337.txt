Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon garam masala
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Drain and rinse chickpeas under cold running water. Place in a bowl, cover with cold water, and stir in baking soda. Soak for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Heat oil in a pot and cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic-ginger paste, cayenne, salt, turmeric, and garam masala. Cook and stir until spices are well absorbed by the onion, about 2 minutes.
Add tomatoes and frozen spinach; stir to combine. Add chickpeas and stir gently. Simmer until flavors are well combined, about 20 minutes. Add a little water if sauce is too thick.

This recipe was given to me by my boss, who is Asian. It has been passed through generations of her family so as you can imagine it is the real deal. Very healthy and super tasty. You can serve it as a side or main. Serve with either rice, bread, bhaji, or samosas.
