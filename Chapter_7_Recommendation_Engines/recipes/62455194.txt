Ingredients:
1 lb. ground beef
1/3 panko bread crumbs
1 egg, lightly beaten
1T Worcestershire
2 cloves garlic
Evenly sprinkle with salt, pepper, onion powder, and granulated garlic.
1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed French onion soup
1 (10.5 ounce) can beef consomme
corn starch

Directions:
In large bowl, combine ground beef with all of the ingredients except soups and cornstarch.  Mix together. Make patties (I made 4 then cut in half prior to putting back into the soup mixture).
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add patties to skillet and cook for 7 minutes per side or until browned. Remove patties from pan; set aside. Drain if necessary.
Add onion soup to pan. Bring to boil and thicken with cornstarch/water mixture.  Then stir in consumme, bring to boil.  Return patties (I halved) to skillet; bring to boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes or until patties are cooked through and sauce is thickened.
