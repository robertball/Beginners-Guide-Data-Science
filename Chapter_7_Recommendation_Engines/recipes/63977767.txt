Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable or olive oil (I use a 50/50 mix)
4 cloves of garlic, peeled and halved
1 jalapeño or Serrano pepper, quartered (seeds & all)
3/4 cup cilantro (nice big handful) roughly chopped
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper

Directions:
Gently warm oil in small pan.
Add quartered garlic pieces & pepper.
Cook over med/low heat 2 to 3 minutes or until garlic is softened and oil is fragrant.
Let cool to room temperature.
To make dressing, combine lime juice, oil (with garlic and pepper), cilantro, salt and pepper in blender or food processor and purée.

#1) Use as a marinade for chicken breasts (Mexican Chicken Salad - marinade for up to 1 hour); #2) Add 2 to 4 tablespoons to mashed avocado for guacamole (depending on how loose you like it - this was SO good!); #3) Use as a salad dressing - the freshness of the lime is wonderful
