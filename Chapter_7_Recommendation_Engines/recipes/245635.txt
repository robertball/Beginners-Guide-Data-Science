Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes
5 pitted Kalamata olives, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1 tablespoon capers
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place tilapia fillets on a baking sheet and brush with olive oil.
Bake tilapia in the preheated oven until opaque and easily flaked with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine chopped tomatoes, olives, onion, and capers in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes begin to break down and tapenade flavors are combined, 5 to 10 minutes. Spoon tapenade over baked fillets.
