Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
3/4 cup butter, softened
1 large egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/4 cups pumpkin spice baking morsels (such as Nestle® Toll House®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl until creamy, using a rubber spatula. Add egg and stir until well blended.
Combine flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda in another bowl. Add to the sugar mixture a little bit at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts until well combined.
Fold pumpkin chips into the dough. Line up teaspoon-sized scoops of dough on an ungreased cookie sheet. If desired, press in a few more pumpkin chips so they're more visible after baking.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft and chewy with golden edges, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack.
