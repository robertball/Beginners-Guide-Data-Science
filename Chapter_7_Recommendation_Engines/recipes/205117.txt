Ingredients:
18 whole graham crackers, crumbled into small pieces
2 cups crispy rice cereal
1 cup Karo® Light Corn Syrup
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter OR margarine
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon Spice Islands® Pure Vanilla Extract
6 (1.55 ounce) bars milk chocolate candy
1 (10 ounce) package mini marshmallows
1/3 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Combine crackers with cereal in a large mixing bowl; set aside.
Cook corn syrup and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a boil just around edges.  Remove from heat; stir in butter, baking soda and vanilla. (OR in a 1-quart microwave-safe bowl, microwave on HIGH (100%) for about 2 minutes or until syrup boils.)
Pour syrup over cereal mixture and stir to coat completely.  Transfer to a greased 13 x 9-inch pan; press firmly to level.  Place chocolate bars in a single layer over cereal mixture; sprinkle with marshmallows.
Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 5 to 8 minutes, or until marshmallows are puffed and lightly browned.  Remove from oven and top with mini chocolate chips.
Refrigerate for 1 hour until firm; cut into squares.  Store in tightly closed container for up to 2 days.
