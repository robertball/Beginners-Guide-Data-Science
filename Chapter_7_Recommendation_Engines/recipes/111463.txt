Ingredients:
Steak Marinade:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup olive oil
4 1/2 tablespoons honey
6 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
2 pounds flank steak
Chipotle Mayo:
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, olive oil, honey, garlic, rosemary, pepper, and salt in a  resealable plastic bag. Add the steak, and turn to coat with the marinade; press out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or overnight for better flavor.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.  Discard marinade.
Lightly oil the grate. Grill the flank steak for 7 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing very thinly against the grain.
Drain the chipotle peppers reserving 1 teaspoon of the adobo sauce. Finely chop the chipotle peppers. Stir together the mayonnaise, chipotle peppers, and reserved adobo sauce in a medium bowl. Serve the sauce with the steak.
