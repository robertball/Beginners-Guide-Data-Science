Ingredients:
Filling:
1/2 (15 ounce) can seasoned black beans - rinsed, drained, and mashed
1/2 cup finely chopped cooked chicken
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/4 cup salsa
1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
1 dash hot pepper sauce
Pastry Crust:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
3/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten, divided
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 3 or 4 baking sheets.
Combine black beans, chicken, Mexican cheese, salsa, cumin, and hot sauce together in the bowl of a food processor; process until combined.
Stir flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in pepper Jack cheese and shortening until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add milk and 1 beaten egg; stir until well mixed.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently, 10 to 15 strokes. Divide dough in half; keep remaining half wrapped in plastic wrap until you are ready for it.
Roll 1/2 of the pastry dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut using a 3-inch round cutter. Re-roll scraps and repeat until dough is used up. Repeat with remaining dough.
Place 1 rounded teaspoon of filling in the center of each dough circle. Moisten edges with some water and fold in half. Seal edges with a fork. Prick the top of each empanada several times. Place onto the prepared baking sheets.
Stir remaining egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl. Brush over each empanada.
Bake in the preheated oven until brown, 15 to 18 minutes.

Description: 
These chicken and black bean empanadas make a great little baked appetizer to dip. A great way to used up leftover chicken or turkey, and they freeze well either before or after baking! Serve with salsa, sour cream, and/or guacamole, if desired.
