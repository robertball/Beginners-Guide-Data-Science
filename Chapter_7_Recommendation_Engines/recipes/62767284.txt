Alaska Sour Dough Starter Recipe

Ingredients:
1       pack           Yeast
1       tablespoon     Vinegar
2 1/4 cups             Warm water
1       teaspoon       Salt
2       tablespoons    Sugar
2       cups           Bread flour

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water. Add sugar vinegar, salt, and flour. Add remaining water until a creamy batter is formed. Place in a glass bowl, cover and let sit until it starts to ferment--about 3 days. It will take on a powerful boozy smell.
Stir again until creamy and measure out what is called for in the recipe.  Replenish starter with equal amounts of flour and water.
Store in the fridge and bring to room temp before using. Allow to ferment for one week between uses. Let it sit out overnight after feeding. This starter takes about 1 1/2 months to become really sour.

I like this recipe because of the sour flavor made prominent by using vinegar.
