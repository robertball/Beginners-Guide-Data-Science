Ingredients:
1 banana, sliced
1 tablespoon unsweetened almond butter, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons chia seeds
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 teaspoon pure maple syrup
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place 3 to 4 slices of banana in the bottom of a jar. Layer 1 1/2 teaspoon of almond butter, 1/2 teaspoon chia seeds, and 1/2 cup oats on top. Repeat layering remaining almond butter, chia seeds, and oats, leaving a 1-inch gap at the top.
Mix almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a bowl. Pour over oats, leaving a 1/2-inch gap at the top to allow oats to expands as they soak. Push a knife or fork vertically through the jar to make sure milk mixture soaks all the way through.
Cover jar tightly and refrigerate until oats are moist, 4 hours to overnight.

Description: 
A little sweetness is all you need and vanilla extract makes it taste gourmet. You can get creative with this recipe and use berries instead of bananas, flax seeds instead of chia, or any unsweetened nut milk or nut butter that you fancy.
