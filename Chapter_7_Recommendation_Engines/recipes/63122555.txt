Ingredients:
Â½ cup uncooked brown quinoa
1 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
1 small red onion, chopped
1 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup frozen corn
1 Teaspoon salt
1/2 Tsp black pepper
1/8 Tsp cumin powder
Cayenne pepper ( to taste, optional)
1/3 Teaspoon chili powder
2 eggs
1/3 cup breadcrumbs

Directions:
In a pot, combine quinoa & 1 cup water; bring to a boil, and then simmer until liquid evaporates
In a saucepan, heat a little oil over medium heat and saute the onion and garlic about 5 minutes, until the onion is translucent and soft.  Add corn and spices cooking until corn defrosts.
In a medium bowl, mash the drained beans with a fork, add quinoa, corn, and onion mixture, mashing it with your fork. Taste and adjust spices if desired before adding eggs
Add the egg and mix in well, add bread crumbs and mix.
Form into patties by patting the desired amount of mixture into a flat round.
Cook about 4 minutes on each side (if you can't flip the patty without breaking it, it's probably not finished cooking).
