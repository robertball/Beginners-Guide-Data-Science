Ingredients:
8 potatoes, sliced
1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend (such as Club House No Salt Added Vegetable SeasoningÂ®), or to taste
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
3 cups beef gravy

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 16x16-inch baking dish.
Spread 1/3 of sliced potatoes in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle potatoes with 1/3 of seasoning mix; top with 1/3 the mozzarella cheese. Continue layering with remaining potatoes, seasoning, and cheese.
Pour gravy evenly over potato mixture to cover.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly and potatoes are tender, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
A new spin on the old classic scalloped potatoes. I use this dish as a side dish with burgers. Try it with bread crumbs on top, too. It's really good.
