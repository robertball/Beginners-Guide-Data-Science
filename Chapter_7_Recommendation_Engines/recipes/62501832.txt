Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
-1 cup pumpkin seeds
-1 scant teaspoon Cajun seasoning, or to taste
paprika, for more color, if desired
-a little salt, depending on saltiness of the seasoning
-2 dashes Worcestershire sauce
-1 tablespoon melted butter or vegetable oil

Directions:
-Rinse seeds well and get as much of the pumpkin pulp off of them as possible. Some of the small pieces are going to adhere, but they won't hurt the seeds at all, and might even add a little more flavor. Pat dry with paper towels. Don't let them dry completely on the paper towels, because they might stick!
Toss pumpkin seeds with seasonings. Combine butter and Worcestershire sauce; stir into seeds until well blended and coated.
-Heat oven to 300Â°. Roast, turning from time to time, for about 45 to 60 minutes, or until nicely browned and crunchy.

Description: 
Double or triple this roasted pumpkin seed recipe, depending on how many cups of seeds you have. One large pumpkin will generally yield 1 cup or pumpkin seeds, and smaller pie pumpkins will yield about the same amount. Toss a salad with these seeds, sprinkle over a chicken dish, or serve as a snack.
