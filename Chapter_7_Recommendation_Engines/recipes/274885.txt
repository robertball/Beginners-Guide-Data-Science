Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 cup olive oil, divided, or more as needed
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs, divided, or more as needed
1/4 cup chopped white onion
1 egg
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place garbanzo beans, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs, onion, egg, parsley, curry powder, garlic powder, lemon juice, and pepper into a food processor or blender. Puree until coarse, adding bread crumbs if needed as you don't want mixture too moist.
Take 1 tablespoon of mixture, roll into a ball, and coat with panko bread crumbs. Place on a plate. Repeat with remaining mixture.
Heat remaining olive oil (about 1 inch) in a deep skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry bites until crispy golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side, working in batches if necessary. Remove and drain on paper towels.

Description: 
Easy and super quick pan-fried falafel recipe. I had everything in my pantry already. I love this as a snack with a tzatziki cucumber sauce, or try with a spicy sriracha sauce.
