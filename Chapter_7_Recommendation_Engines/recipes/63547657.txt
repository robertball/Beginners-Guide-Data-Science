2 1/2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper (omit)
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the paprika, garlic powder, salt, onion powder, thyme, cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper. Use all of this seasoning mixture for the chicken.
Preheat oven and cast iron grill to 450-degrees. Put spices into a plastic bag, coat chicken breasts (or strips) in the spices.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on the grill, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes on each side, until juices run clear.

Description: 
This is a terrific rub for chicken. It adds amazing flavors, seals in juices, and gives the finished chicken a lot of color.

This blend of spices reminds me of the Jamaican / African spice blend known as Piri Piri.Modified from: Spicy Chicken Breasts
