Ingredients:
3 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
bamboo skewers and wooden toothpicks, soaked in water
3 tablespoons prepared chili without beans, divided
3 tablespoons shredded pepperjack cheese, divided
Â½ pound applewood smoked bacon
1 cup sweet barbecue sauce (such as Sticky Fingers(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Carolina Sweet), divided

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Lay a chicken breast onto a work surface and place the palm of your hand down on the meat. With a sharp knife, carefully slice the chicken breast half horizontally, without cutting all the way through, and open up the sliced chicken breast like a book. Repeat with the other two chicken breasts.
Place each sliced, opened out chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound the chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.
To stuff the chicken breasts, lay out a flattened breast and place a skewer on the meat, in the center. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of chili over the skewer and top the chili with about a teaspoon of pepperjack cheese. Roll the chicken breast around the skewer and secure with toothpicks. Wrap each chicken roll with 2 slices of bacon and secure with toothpicks. Pour about 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce into a bowl, and brush each roll with sauce. Discard any leftover sauce.
Cook on the preheated grill, turning often and spraying the grill with water occasionally to prevent flare-ups, until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, the juices run clear, and the bacon is browned, about 15 minutes.
Pour more barbecue sauce into a clean bowl and brush the rolls again before removing from the grill. Let rest about 5 minutes before pulling out the toothpicks and skewers for serving.

Description: 
This is a grilled chicken recipe inspired by a dish found in Del Rio, TX. Truly a man's meal, and not for the faint of arteries, this dish combines three of men's favorite things: Grilling, Bacon, and Chili. Don't love it till you try it! Goes well with a light beer and mashed potatoes.
