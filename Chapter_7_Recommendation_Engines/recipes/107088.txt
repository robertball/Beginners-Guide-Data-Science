Ingredients:
1/2 cup kosher salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 quart water
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
1/2 cup orange juice concentrate, thawed
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning

Directions:
Dissolve salt and sugar in 1 quart of water in a bowl. Add meat and let stand 45 minutes. Rinse, then pat dry.
Meanwhile, in a small pan, reduce orange concentrate by half over low heat. Stir in garlic and Italian seasoning. Brush pork with glaze and set aside.
Either build a charcoal fire in half the grill or turn gas grill burners on high for 10 minutes. Lubricate hot grill rack with an oil-soaked rag using tongs.
Place tenderloins on hot grill rack and close lid; grill until well-seared, about 7 minutes. Turn meat and close lid; grill until well-seared on second side, about 6 minutes longer. Turn off gas grill (or move meat to the charcoal grill's cooler side) and let tenderloins sit in covered until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees (63 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, about 5 minutes longer.
