Crazy Veggie Burgers Recipe

Ingredients:
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
1/3 cup finely diced mushrooms
1 1/2 clove fresh garlic
1/3 cup cooked chickpeas (I used canned.)
1/3 cup finely diced green beans (I used the frozen kind, thawed.)
1/2 cup quick oats
1/4 cup diced black olives
2 tablespoons Panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon cornstarch (I use organic/non-GMO.)
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1/4 teaspoon ground sage
1 teaspoon nutritional yeast flakes
1 pinch salt (or to taste)
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper (optional)
2 tablespoons gluten flour (a.k.a. vital wheat gluten)
3 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce or Bragg's liquid aminos

Directions:
In a medium skillet, saute your onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic just until your mushrooms have cooked down, and your onions are soft.
Meanwhile, mash your garbanzo beans. I have done this with my hands in a bowl and with a small food processor. Either method works just fine and doesn't take long at all.
In a medium mixing bowl, combine mashed chickpeas with sauteed onion, garlic, mushrooms, and bell pepper.
Add remaining ingredients (except water and soy sauce) to your mixing bowl. Make sure all of your dry seasonings are well incorporated with gluten flour and other ingredients before adding your water and soy sauce. (Feel free to use your hands.) This will ensure that all of your seasonings are distributing evenly throughout the patties before the water activates your gluten flour and makes mixing more difficult.
Add water and soy sauce to your mixing bowl and use your hands to form either 4 large patties, or 8 smaller slider patties.
In a clean skillet, heat to medium to medium-high heat for about 30 seconds. Fry your patties for about 1 minute on each side, or until golden brown.
Serve immediately on your favorite burger buns with all the trimmings.
