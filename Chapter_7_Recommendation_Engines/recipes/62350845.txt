Description: 
The southern region of Oaxaca Mexico is known as the land of siete moles or  seven moles. I developed this chicken dish using the herbs and tomatillos needing to be used up. This is also known as a verde mole. It's an interesting taste difference using the mole both cooked and in the raw form in this dish.
