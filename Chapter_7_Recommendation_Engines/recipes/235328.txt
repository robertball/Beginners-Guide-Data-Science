Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 teaspoon butter
1 small onion, minced
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon diced chile pepper
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, garlic, and chile pepper in hot butter until fragrant and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir cooked rice, egg, soy sauce, and sesame oil into onion mixture. Cook and stir until egg is cooked through and rice is coated and heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
