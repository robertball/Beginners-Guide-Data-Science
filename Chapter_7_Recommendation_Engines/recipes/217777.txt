Image:

Ingredients:
5 cups matzo farfel
5 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup kosher margarine, melted
2 large apples - peeled, cored and shredded
2 very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup ground walnuts, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9x13 baking dish.
Moisten the matzo farfel by placing in a large bowl, stirring in enough cold water to cover, and rinsing immediately in a colander set in the sink. Mix in beaten eggs, sugar, salt, and margarine until thoroughly combined, and lightly mix in the apples, bananas, and 1/4 cup of ground walnuts. Spoon the kugel into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of ground walnuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until the kugel is browned and set in the center, about 1 hour. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.

Description: 
I usually don't like Passover kugels and my family only likes sweet kugels...this one fit the bill! If you don't have farfel, it's really just tidbit-size pieces of matzah. I leave out the nuts, but every Passover recipe seems to have them, it's your choice!
