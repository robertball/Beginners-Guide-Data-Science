Ingredients:
Meatballs:
2 lbs ground sirloin
1 lb ground pork
5 to 6 large cloves of garlic, minced
3/4 to 1 cup sweet onion, minced
1 tsp seasoned salt (Lawry's)
1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
1 tbsp Italian seasoning blend
3/4 to 1 cup plain bread crumbs
1/4 cup fresh grated Parmesano Reggiano
3/4 cup Original Prego sauce
2 large eggs
1/4 to 1/2 cup water
Sauce:
1 large jar Prego Original Sauce
1 tbsp sugar
Either 2 tbsp fresh chopped basil, if in season, or
1 tbsp dried basil
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Mix all meatball ingredients together thoroughly in a large bowl.  Form into 2 inch diameter meatballs, makes approx. 16 to 20.  In a large Dutch oven, combine all sauce ingredients.  Submerge raw meatballs into sauce.  Bring heat up to allow meatballs to simmer on low, covered, for approx. 30 minutes.  Then uncover and stir gently. Using a splatter screen, simmer on low for another 2 to 3 hours, stiring gently ocassionally.  Do not allow meatballs to stick to bottom of pan.  Can add more Prego if sauce cooks down too much.  Serve over favorite pasta.

Description: 
This is how my mother taught me to make Italian meatballs.  I loved walking in from school and smelling them cooking.  Starting the meatballs raw and simmering them in the sauce slow for a long time allows the flavors to soak into the meatballs, and they turn out so tender!
