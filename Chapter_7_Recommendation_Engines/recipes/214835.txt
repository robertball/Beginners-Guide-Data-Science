Description: 
This is so simple, yet delicious. I do not typically like ketchup, but my whole family loves this dip! Dip it with plain chips, or we use the kettle cooked crunchy ones. Just a nice dip to share at a picnic or outing, or to just have around the house. Not at all bad on a burger either!
