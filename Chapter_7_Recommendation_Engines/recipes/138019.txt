Ingredients:
ice cubes
1/2 fluid ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/2 fluid ounce Cointreau or triple sec
1 fluid ounce brandy
1 lemon wedge

Directions:
Fill a cocktail shaker 3/4 full with ice cubes. Pour in lemon juice, Cointreau, and brandy. Cover and shake vigorously for about 30 seconds until the outside of the shaker becomes cold and frosty. Strain into a martini glass and garnish with a wedge of lemon.

Description: 
I always think of the sidecar as a brandy margarita, except that it is made with fresh lemon juice.
