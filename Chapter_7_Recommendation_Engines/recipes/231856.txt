Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
cooking spray
4 1/2 cups whole kernel corn
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) container chive and onion cream cheese

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble when cool enough to handle.
Coat the inside of a 4-quart slow cooker with cooking spray.
Combine corn, red bell pepper, half-and-half, butter, sugar, salt, black pepper, and half the crumbled bacon in the slow cooker; stir well.
Cook on High for 2 to 2 1/2 hours.
Stir cream cheese into corn mixture; cook until cheese melts, about 10 more minutes. Stir well and top with remaining bacon before serving.
