Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust
1 tablespoon butter
2/3 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest
2 egg yolks
1 cup milk
2 egg whites
1 3/4 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, cream butter.  Mix in sugar, flour, lemon juice and lemon zest. Beat in egg yolks, then milk.
In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into the lemon mixture. Pour filling into pie crust. Scatter blueberries evenly over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 50 minutes, or until filling is set. Cover the pie with foil after about 30 minutes to avoid browning. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

Description: 
Tart and refreshing with a smooth, creamy, meringue-like consistency. Blueberries can be omitted if necessary, but it won't be nearly as good!
