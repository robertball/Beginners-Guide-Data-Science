Ingredients:
2 potatoes
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 whole cloves
2 small dried chile peppers (optional)
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 bay leaves
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, grated
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon water
1 tomato, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
1 tablespoon cilantro leaves

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and peel.
Place cooked potatoes into a bowl and add cornstarch, ginger, cumin, cayenne, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mash together with a fork. Oil your hands with a little vegetable oil and divide the potato mixture into 4 equal portions. Pat each portion into a potato patty about 1/3-inch thick.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry potato cakes until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from heat and keep warm.
Grind peppercorns and cloves with a mortar and pestle.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in red chile peppers, cumin, bay leaves. Add onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is golden, about 5 minutes. Add pepper-clove mixture, curry powder, and turmeric.
Mix tomato paste with water. Stir diluted tomato paste and tomato into the skillet. Cook over medium heat until the tomato has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.
Spoon chickpea sauce over the potato cakes and sprinkle with cilantro leaves.
