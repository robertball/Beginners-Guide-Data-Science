Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
2 inch piece fresh ginger root, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 whole star anise pods
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into bite-size pieces
20 new potatoes
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
1/4 cup minced fresh Thai basil leaves

Directions:
Stir the onion, ginger, garlic, star anise, white wine, salt, pepper, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, rice vinegar, and chicken together in a mixing bowl. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 6 hours. Meanwhile, place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool before cutting in half.
Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, and squeeze the excess marinade from the chicken; reserve the marinade. Cook and stir the chicken in the hot oil until browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard the star anise from the marinade, and stir the marinade into the chicken. Bring to a boil, then add the cherry tomatoes and halved potatoes. Cook until the potatoes are hot and the cherry tomatoes begin to burst, about 3 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the water, and stir into the chicken mixture along with Thai basil. Cook and stir until thick, about 1 minute more.

Description: 
A delicious Chinese-style stir fry.  Normally, I would use Chinese cooking wine, but I was out of it.  The white wine adds a wonderful sweetness that pairs nicely with the star anise. Serve with steamed rice, white or brown.
