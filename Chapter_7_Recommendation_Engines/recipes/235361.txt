Description: 
Southern pulled pork BBQ that is so easy to make! I have shared this BBQ with family, friends, and co-workers, and they have told me that this is amongst the best BBQ they have ever eaten. I use a North Carolina style vinegar-based sauce when I make this, but this is the fun part of this recipe, because you can use any sauce you like and it turns out good. Your pulled pork makes good BBQ plates, or it is good on sandwiches also.
