Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon lime juice
3 tablespoons spiced rum
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
20 jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
4 (10 inch) skewers

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Mix together the honey, lime juice, spiced rum, orange zest, orange juice, ginger, cilantro, salt, black pepper, and cornstarch in a large bowl until the glaze is smooth and the cornstarch is thoroughly blended with the rest of the ingredients. Pour half the glaze into a smaller bowl for basting. Rinse and pat the shrimp dry, and gently stir into the large bowl to thoroughly coat the shrimp with the glaze.
Remove from the glaze, and discard the used glaze. Thread 5 shrimp onto each skewer, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
Grill the shrimp until bright pink and opaque and the glaze has cooked onto the shrimp, about 4 minutes per side. Baste with additional unused glaze before turning the shrimp over.
