Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 1/2 cups shredded smoked Gouda cheese
2 cups buttermilk
3 eggs, separated
2/3 cup light sour cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, garlic salt, parsley, rosemary and tarragon. Stir in the shredded Gouda. Set aside.
In another bowl, mix together the egg yolks, buttermilk, sour cream and vegetable oil until well blended. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture, and stir until just blended. In a separate clean bowl, whip the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold into the waffle batter.
Heat the waffle iron, and grease with vegetable oil spray. Use the recommended amount of batter for each waffle according to your iron. Close the lid, and cook until golden brown. Waffles can be held in a warm oven while the others are cooking. Serve with creamed beef or chicken.

Description: 
These are not a sweet waffle!  I use them to serve creamed beef or chicken for a quick, easy supper.  They are very light, very tasty, and they smell heavenly.
