Ingredients:
3 pounds salmon fillet, skin removed
1 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
12 dashes hot sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or more to taste

Directions:
Slice salmon fillets into 4 equal sections, width-wise. Rotate each section 90 degrees and slice lengthwise, about 1/4-inch thick. Remove pin bones with needle-nose pliers. Don't slice bony sections near the center of the fillet.
Stir soy sauce, molasses, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, black pepper, liquid smoke, and hot sauce together in a glass or plastic bowl until marinade is well-mixed. Place salmon in the marinade, ensuring every strip is covered. Cover bowl and refrigerate for 4 hours.
Remove salmon from bowl and drain liquid using a colander. Pat the salmon dry using paper towels.
Place each salmon strip in a dehydrator and run the dehydrator according to manufacturer's instructions until desired doneness is reached, about 6 hours. Check every few hours for doneness.

Description: 
Each year we collect a bountiful harvest of red salmon during the summer. A portion of this yield usually goes to making salmon jerky. This delectable marinade makes the salmon jerky to die for, and I have yet to taste a better recipe!
