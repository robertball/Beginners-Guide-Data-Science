Ingredients:
1/4 cup bourbon whiskey
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup ketchup
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot Â®)
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Stir the bourbon, brown sugar, ketchup, white vinegar, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, honey, and butter together in a saucepan over medium heat; cook, whisking occasionally, until the mixture begins to bubble. Reduce heat to low and cook at a gentle simmer, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens nearly to the consistency of maple syrup or molasses, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Description: 
Tired of the same old red pepper and butter 'hot sauce' on your wings? Try this on your next batch for a change of pace. We're crispy wing lovers, so we always make them fried. It might work for baked wings as well, but that hasn't been tested...yet. Make your fried wings according to your favorite recipe, coat the wings in this sauce, and sprinkle with sesame seeds just prior to serving. You should be able to coat about a dozen wing pieces with the recipe. Your wings are going to be sticky but the wing lovers I hang with claim they're well worth the mess.
