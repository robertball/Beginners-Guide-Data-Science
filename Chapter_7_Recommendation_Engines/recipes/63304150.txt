Ingredients:
1 cup whole pecans (optional)
1 tsp. vinegar
3 egg whites
1/8 tsp. salt
1 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F.  (This is very important!) If you are using pecans, put them in a large baggie and crush with a wooden spoon, mallet, etc.
In a large mixing bowl, mix egg whites, vinegar, sugar, and salt on HIGH for 15 minutes.
If you are using pecans, fold them in now.
Drop by teaspoon-fulls or other desired size (note: puffs do not expand) onto a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper.
Put the cookie sheets in the oven and TURN THE OVEN OFF!
Keep the cookies in the oven overnight and ENJOY!
