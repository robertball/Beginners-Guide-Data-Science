Ingredients:
2 large portobello mushroom caps
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pinch dried parsley, or to taste
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
4 ounces shredded pepperjack cheese
4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
2 tablespoons sliced black olives, or to taste (optional)
1 tablespoon Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place mushrooms in a baking dish.
Cook and stir tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, basil, garlic, parsley, and red pepper flakes in a large skillet over medium heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Top each mushroom with 1/2 of the tomato mixture. Sprinkle pepperjack cheese and mozzarella cheese on top of tomato mixture; top with black olives and bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crispy, about 25 minutes.
