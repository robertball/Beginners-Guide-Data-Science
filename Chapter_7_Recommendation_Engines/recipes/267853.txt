Hungarian Fruit Squares  Recipe

Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup apricot preserves
3/4 cup raspberry preserves
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Use a pastry blender or fork to cut in butter until pea-sized crumbs form. Add eggs and vanilla extract and mix dough well.
Separate out 1/4 of the dough and chill in the refrigerator. Press remaining dough into the bottom and sides of an ungreased 15 1/2x10 1/2-inch jelly roll pan. Spread apricot preserves on 1/2 the mixture and raspberry preserves on the remaining 1/2.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Remove chilled dough from the refrigerator and roll out onto a lightly floured board. Cut into 1/2-inch strips and place diagonally across the preserves to form a lattice; press around edges to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
Allow to cool and cut into squares. Dust the top with confectioners' sugar; this keeps cookies from sticking and looks nice, too.

This is my Hungarian great-great-grandmother's recipe. It is a family favorite every year. Once you make it one time, you will continue to make it every year.
