Ingredients:
8 pounds standing rib roast top fat trimmed
2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
3 ¼  3½ Morton Ice Cream/Rock Salt (or brand of choice)
3 ¼ - 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1  1 ½ teaspoons crushed dried rosemary
¾ - 1 cup water
1  6.5 ounce jar prepared horseradish
2  -1 ounce packages McCormick Au Jus Gravy Mix (or your brand choice)
2 8 ounce packages fresh mushrooms or 1 large package
½ cup dry red wine
6 pieces bacon - can be optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Rinse the roast and pat dry with paper towels.
Sprinkle the black pepper and rosemary on top and sides of roast.
In a large bowl add rock salt and flour.
Slowly pour in cold water and mix to where you get a type of sticky paste. Use your judgment if too runny add more flour.  Goal is to have a sticky paste.
In your baking dish, layer the rock-flour mixture to ~ ½ inch thick.
Bone side down, place the roast on top of the rock-flour layer.
If using bacon, place the bacon on top of the roast.
Cover the roast with the remaining rock-flour mixture.  Literally coating all sides top and bottom.
Be sure to place a meat thermometer into the roast where you can see it.
Place the roast on a baking sheet due to greese from the bacon.
You want to sear it quickly, so make sure oven is at 450 degrees F before you put in and cook for a good 20-30 minutes.
After that time, remove the roast to check for any visible holes.  If so, cover with remaining mixture.
Placing roast back in oven, lower oven temperature to 325 degrees F and cook to a minimum internal temperature of 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).  Or continue to cook to desired doneness.
Once you remove the roast, let rest for ~ 30 minutes.
Place chopped mushrooms in a saucepan and sauté.
Mix the Au Jus according to package instructions and add to mushroom mixture.
Add ½ cup red wine.
Gently break off crust and discard.
Slice and serve with horseradish and au jus mushroom.
