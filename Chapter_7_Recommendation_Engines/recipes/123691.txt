Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup cold butter or margarine
6 tablespoons cold water
FILLING:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup half-and-half cream
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken
2 cups fresh or frozen peas
2 medium potatoes, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
3 medium carrots, thinly sliced
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 teaspoon milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring with a fork until a ball forms. Divide pastry into thirds. On a floured surface, roll two-thirds of the pastry to fit an ungreased 2-qt. baking dish; line dish with pastry.
For filling, melt butter in a large saucepan; stir in flour until smooth. Add cream, broth, salt, thyme and pepper. Bring to a boil; boil for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in chicken, peas, potatoes, carrots and onion. Pour into prepared dish. Roll out remaining pastry to fit top of dish. Place over filling; seal edges. Cut slits in top; brush with milk. Bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour or until vegetables are tender.

Description: 
I remember Sunday dinners at my grandma's farm. Chicken potpie was probably second in popularity only to chicken and dumplings. I like to collect heritage recipes from my area and hope to compile them someday into a cookbook.
