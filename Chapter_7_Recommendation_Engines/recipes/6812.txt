1/2 cup dry potato flakes

Divide dough into 12 pieces.  Roll each into a 10 inch rope; coil rope and tuck in the end so that it comes up through the middle.  Place 2 inches apart on a baking sheet dusted with cornmeal. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes.
Brush tops with egg glaze or melted butter, and lightly sprinkle with kosher salt.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes.
