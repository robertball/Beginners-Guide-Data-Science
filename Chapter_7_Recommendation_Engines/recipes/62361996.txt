Ingredients:
1 1/2 Cups butter or margarine
2 Cups sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla extract
2 tsp. almond extract
2 Cups Flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1 box fudge Chocolate instant pudding mix
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 Cup Nestle's chocolate chunks
1 Cup dark chocolate chips
1 1/2 Cups dried cherries

Directions:
Cream butter, sugar until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time. Stir in extracts. Mix dry ingredients together. Add to cream mixture a 1/3 at a time, mixing after each addition. Fold in chocolate chips and dried cherries. Drop with small ice cream scoop on an ungreased cookie sheet. (I use parchment paper. It makes cleanup much easier.) Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 min.
