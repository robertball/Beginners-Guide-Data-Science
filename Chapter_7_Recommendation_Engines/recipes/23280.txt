Ingredients:
1 cup LAND O LAKESÂ® Butter, softened*
1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Combine butter, brown sugar and vanilla in large bowl.  Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until creamy. Add flour; reduce speed to low.  Beat, scraping bowl often, until mixture leaves side of bowl and forms a smooth, soft dough.
Divide dough in half.  Shape each half into 6x2-inch round log.  If desired, shape logs into squares or triangles. Wrap each log in plastic food wrap; refrigerate at least 2 hours.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cut logs into 1/4-inch slices with sharp knife.  Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until lightly browned on edges.  Let stand 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheets.
Stir together sugar and cinnamon in small bowl.  Roll warm cookies in cinnamon-sugar mixture.
