Ingredients:
12 eggs
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup vegetable oil
6 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper
3 tablespoons baking powder

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to boil over medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a large bowl, beat eggs. Stir in melted butter and oil. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, pepper and baking powder.
Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the egg mixture. Mix until dough pulls together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into an 8 inch long cylinder. Bend each cylinder into a ring shape and pinch ends together. With a sharp knife, score each ring around its outside edge.
Drop rings two at a time into boiling water and boil for 1 minute. Remove rings from water and place on lightly greased cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, until golden brown.

Description: 
For Italian families, pepper rings are a type of biscuit eaten in place of bread. In our family, they are traditionally served at Easter, but are delicious any time of year. They taste extra special if heated before serving. Try them with black coffee or espresso.
