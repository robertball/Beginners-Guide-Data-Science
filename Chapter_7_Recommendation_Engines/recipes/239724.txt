Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
3 eggs
2 cups grated zucchini
1/2 cup grated carrots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix flour, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl. Beat sugar, applesauce, and eggs together in a separate bowl; mix into the flour mixture until batter is just combined. Fold zucchini and carrots into batter. Divide batter between the prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
A delicious light version of a classic quick bread. It is so moist and rich you would never guess it didn't have all the oil of the original version.
