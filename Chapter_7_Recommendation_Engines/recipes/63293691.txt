Ingredients:
3 eggs, lightly beaten
1 cup vegetable oil
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup light brown sugar
3 cups shredded zucchini
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 pint fresh blueberries
Streusel:
2/3 cup flour
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 stick softened butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 standard-sized loaf pans.
In a large bowl, beat together the eggs, oil, vanilla, and sugar. Fold in the zucchini. Beat in the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon. Gently fold in the blueberries. Transfer to the prepared loaf pans.
Prepare the streusel topping.  Mix together streusel ingredients. Sprinkle over loaves before baking.
Bake 70 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of a loaf comes out clean. Cool 20 minutes in pans, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.
