Ingredients:
1 cup mashed ripe bananas
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons skim milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon molasses
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 cups white whole wheat flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup frozen blueberries
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the bottom of 12 muffin cups or use paper liners.
Beat bananas, honey, applesauce, brown sugar, yogurt, milk, oil, molasses, and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Gently stir whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt into the batter.
Roll blueberries and 2 teaspoons flour together in a bowl. Fold floured blueberries into the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin until safe to handle, about 10 minutes. Quickly remove muffins from tin to prevent sticking; let cool.

Description: 
With blueberries in season, what better way to prepare them than to combine with a banana muffin base? The use of whole wheat flour and replacing much of the sugar in a traditional banana muffin recipe with natural sources like honey, Greek yogurt, and applesauce results in a moist, dense texture. These banana-blueberry muffins make a light, satisfying breakfast or dessert.
