Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 3/4 cups animal cracker crumbs (subbed for graham cracker crumbs)
1/4 cup pretzels, crushed into smaller bits
1 cup butter or margarine, melted
2 cups powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar)
1 cup peanut butter
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
4 tablespoons peanut butter

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the butter or margarine, animal cracker crumbs, pretzel bits/crumbs, confectioners' sugar, and 1 cup peanut butter until well blended. Press evenly into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.  Put the pan in the freezer for about 10 minutes while you prepare the chocolate layer.
In a metal bowl over simmering water, or in the microwave, melt the chocolate chips with the peanut butter, stirring occasionally until smooth. Spread over the prepared crust. Refrigerate for at least one hour.  Before cutting into squares, let sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes.  Use a metal serving spatula to cut each piece.  *see tips below

Description: 
These bars are for those who prefer a little texture in the peanut butter layer.  Animal crackers don't turn as creamy as graham crackers, and pretzel crumbs give even more crunch.Modified from: Peanut Butter Bars I
