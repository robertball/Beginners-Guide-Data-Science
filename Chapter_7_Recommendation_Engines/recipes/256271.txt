Ingredients:
9 cups cold water
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup uncooked rice, rinsed in cold water
1 1/2 teaspoons very thinly sliced ginger root (optional)
2 preserved thousand-year eggs, cut into small pieces
1 (4 ounce) cod fillet, cut into thin slices
1 tablespoon rice wine
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 dash ground white pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 tablespoon diced green onion (optional)

Directions:
Combine water, chicken broth, and rice in a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until rice is fluffy, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir in preserved eggs.
Combine cod slices, rice wine, sesame oil, soy sauce, and white pepper in a bowl. Add to the pot; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir salt in gently.
Ladle congee into serving bowls; garnish with green onion.
