Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1 cup (1-inch) sliced green onions
1/4 cup light soy sauce, divided
1 lemon, juiced, divided
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cube beef bouillon (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, halved
1 cup 1-inch cut green beans
1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 hot red chile pepper (donne'sali), chopped (optional)

Directions:
Place beef in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until browned, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess grease.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, tomatoes, green onions, 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 1/2 the lemon juice, garlic, beef bouillon, and black pepper. Cook and stir until flavors combine, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in water chestnuts and green beans; cook and stir until tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir drained ground beef, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and lemon juice into the skillet. Pour in coconut milk slowly; add chile pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer until coconut milk is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.

Description: 
Tinaktak (pronounced tee-nack-tack) may have originated from the sound of chopping meat: tak! tak! tak!  It is one of Guam's favorite comfort foods and definitely a favorite of mine since it is so simple to make yet yields a tasty dish! Serve over hot steamed rice (white or brown).
