2 medium sized apples, sliced
2 cups buttermilk baking mix

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Melt butter in the 9 inch pan over the stovetop. Remove from heat. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the melted butter. Arrange the apple slices over the brown sugar.
In a medium bowl, stir together the baking mix, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the egg and milk, beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Spoon batter over the apples.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Invert cake onto a serving plate while still hot. Serve with ice cream or whipped topping.
