Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
1/2 cup beer with lime flavor
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Brown the turkey meat, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks, then stir in onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the turkey is no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle on 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper; stir to combine, and continue cooking until the meat is browned, about 5 more minutes. Pour in the beer, and cook until the beer is reduced by about half.
Pour the diced tomatoes with chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, kidney beans, 1 more tablespoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, and cumin into a slow cooker. Stir in the turkey mixture and chicken broth. Set the cooker to High, and cook for 2 hours.
