Ingredients:
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup shortening
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat brown sugar, white sugar, margarine, shortening, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; beat into sugar mixture until you have a dough. Stir chocolate chips and walnuts into dough. Drop rounded teaspoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool briefly on the baking sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
