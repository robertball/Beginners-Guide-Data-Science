Ingredients:
1 (2 1/2 pound) spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 ½ pounds sliced fresh mushrooms
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
½  zucchini, halved and sliced
½  yellow squash, halved and sliced
½ cup chopped onion
1 clove garlic, minced
½ teaspoon cornstarch
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
⅔ cup tomato juice
2 teaspoons chili powder
½ teaspoon crushed oregano
½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place spaghetti squash cut-side down on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine mushrooms, chicken breasts, zucchini, yellow squash, onion, and garlic in a large skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until chicken is no longer pink and onion is tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in cornstarch.
Pour tomato sauce and tomato juice into the skillet. Season with chili powder and oregano. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Cover to keep warm.
Use a fork to shred and separate squash flesh into strands. Spoon chicken mixture over the spaghetti squash and top with Monterey Jack cheese.
