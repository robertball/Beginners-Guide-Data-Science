Ingredients:
6 cups apples your choice - I had Gala on hand
¼ cup sugar  if you are using Granny Smith apples use ½ cup sugar.
½ cup apple sauce - I had sweet applesauce on hand.
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon lemon juice or juice of 1 lemon
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ cup blueberries  I had frozen on hand
2 Pet Ritz Deep Dish pie crust

Directions:
Pre-heat over to 400º F.
Peel and slice apples and place into one of the Deep Dish Pie Crust.
Add blueberries on top.
In a mixing bowl, combine and mix sugar, apple sauce, vanilla, lemon juice, ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg.
Distribute sugar mixture blend evenly over apples and blueberries.
Place 2nd pie shell on top of apples. With the back of a small fork, pinch the edges of the 2nd pie crust to meet the first one. Pinch all the way around the crust.
Cut several 1 inch slits in the top of 2nd pie shell once in place.  If you have an extra pie shell, you can cut out designs and place on top of the pie. I used a small glass to make circles then pinched the edges with the back of a fork - little medallions.
Place pie in oven and bake at 400º for ~ 10 minutes. Beginning of a nice crust.
Bake an additional 35-50 minutes (depends on your oven). You can tell when it is done as the pie will be hot and bubbly and the crust a nice golden brown.
Cool on wire rack.
