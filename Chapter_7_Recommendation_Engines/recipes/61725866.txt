1/2 cup chopped onion

1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup low-fat mayonnaise

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and discard yolks. Chop whites.
In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, egg whites, celery, onion, relish, garlic, celery seed, mustard, pepper and mayonnaise. Mix together well and refrigerate until chilled.
