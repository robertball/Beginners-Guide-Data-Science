Ingredients:
1 egg white
1 tablespoon Chinese rice vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced
8 cups water
1 tablespoon peanut oil

Directions:
Whisk egg white, vinegar, cornstarch, and salt together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Add chicken; cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, about 30 minutes.
Bring water and oil to a boil in a pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium.
Pour excess marinade off the chicken. Add chicken to the pot; boil until white on the outside but still raw in the middle, about 1 minute. Strain off excess liquid.
Store in the refrigerator in a sealed container until ready to use, up to a few hours. Heat until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.

Description: 
Chicken as moist and tender as the best Chinese restaurant. Not my technique--got online--why limit it to Chinese? Chicken can be stored for a few hours before adding to vegetables and sauce when food is just about done.
