Description: 
This is a recipe I experimented with to try to get a good amount of vitamins, calcium, protein and fiber in my diet. The great part of this is that I don't get bored with it (even though I drink it every day) because I can change the type of fruit I use whenever I want.Modified from: All-Around Good Smoothie
