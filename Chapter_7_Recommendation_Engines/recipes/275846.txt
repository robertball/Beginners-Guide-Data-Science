Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic, or more to taste
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 pound chicken tenders, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup diced onion
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
salt to taste
1 1/2 cups Chardonnay wine
1/2 cup marinara sauce
1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
1 pound frozen gnocchi
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and saute until garlic starts to turn golden brown, about 1 minute. Add chicken, onion, bell pepper, and salt. Saute until chicken is no longer pink inside and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. Add wine and marinara sauce; let simmer until liquid is reduced, about 10 minutes more.
Add gnocchi to boiling water.
Stir spinach into the chicken mixture and cover the skillet.
While the chicken mixture simmers, cook gnocchi until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer gnocchi to the chicken mixture; stir and let simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
