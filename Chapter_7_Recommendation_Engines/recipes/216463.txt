Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano
Â½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 teaspoons rubbed sage
2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon celery seed
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (4 pound) whole chicken
6 cloves garlic, crushed
2  onions, quartered

Directions:
Combine the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley, oregano, cayenne pepper, sage, thyme, coriander, celery seed, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Rub the chicken inside and out with the spice blend. Stuff the cavity of the chicken with the crushed garlic and onion. Place into a 9x13-inch baking dish and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 hours.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.
