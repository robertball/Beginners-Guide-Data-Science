Ingredients:
1/4 cup paprika
2 tablespoons hot chili powder
1 cup fresh lemon juice
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 bone-in chicken breast halves

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the paprika, chili powder, lemon juice, garlic, ginger and salt. Rub chicken with the mixture, place in a dish, and marinate for 3 hours.
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
Place chicken onto the grill and discard the marinade. Cook for about 30 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is slightly charred and juices run clear.

Description: 
This is a great spicy marinade recipe, a traditional African dish, great for BBQ. Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date though, gives you wicked garlic breath!
