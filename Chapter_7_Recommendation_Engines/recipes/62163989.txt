Ingredients:
1 8 oz. pkg. Somen noodles (Lomein or Chinese noodles may be substituted)
1 Head Lettuce, tore into bite size pieces
2 Beaten Eggs (optional)
2 Green Onions (optional)
1 12 oz. Pkg Imitation Crab Flakes (Diced cooked chicken or turkey may be substitued)
6 Tbsp. Toasted Sesame Seeds
6 Tbsp. Sugar
3/4 Cup Salad Oil
2 Oz. Soy Sauce
3 Oz. Rice Vinegar

Directions:
Prepare noodles as directed, drain and rinse in cold water.
(Optional). Pour eggs into large greased frying pan so the eggs create a thin layer over the whole pan and fry until done, do not break egg up in pan.  Remove and slice egg "pancake" into thin, 1 inch pieces.
Prepare dressing.  Grind sesame seeds in food processor or pestle until about half are ground and combine sesame seeds with sugar, salad oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar in bowl.  Mix well as the dressing does separate when standing.
Spread noodles evenly on large serving tray with sides or a 9x13 pan.  Place lettuce on top of noodles and crab on top of lettuce.  Garnish with egg pieces and chopped green onion.  Drizzle with salad dressing.
Serve with remaining dressing on the side so individuals can flavor to taste.
