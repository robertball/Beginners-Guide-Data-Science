Ingredients:
1 teaspoon lemon juice, or as needed
1 cup water, or as desired
1 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, and sliced, or more to taste
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10 inch) graham cracker crust
1/3 cup quick-cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Stir lemon juice and water together in a bowl; add apples to stop browning process. Whisk 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon together in a separate bowl.
Beat cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add egg and vanilla extract and mix until evenly combined.
Drain apples and transfer to the graham cracker crust. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture and oats over apples. Pour cream cheese mixture over apple mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is just beginning to brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, 1 to 2 hours. Refrigerate until completely set, 3 to 4 hours.
