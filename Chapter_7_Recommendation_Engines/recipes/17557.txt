Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 clove garlic, minced
6 pork chops
1 pinch kosher salt

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the lemon juice and the garlic and heat until garlic is tender. Remove from heat.
Arrange the chops on a plate and coat top side of each chop with the butter mixture. Place chops on the grill butter side down.
Sear over high heat for 1 minute, coating the top side of the chops with the butter mixture while the other side is grilling. Flip the chops and sear the other side for 1 minute.
Turn the meat, cover the grill and cook 3 to 5 more minutes per side, brushing occasionally with the remaining butter mixture. Pork chops are done when internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
