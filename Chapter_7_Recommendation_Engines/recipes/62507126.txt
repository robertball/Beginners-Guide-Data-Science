Ingredients:
1 tbsp olive oil
2 large onions, diced
2 celery stalks, with leaves, diced
1 large carrot, diced
4 garlic cloves, diced
1 can diced tomatoes
5 cups VGo (which is like V8 but much better)
1-2 cups water
1/2 head of cabbage, shredded
2 tbsp oregano
2 tsp basil
1 tsp each garlic and onion powder
1 bay leaf
salt and pepper
(optional: beans, peas, asparagus tips, etc.)

Directions:
In a large microwave-safe bowl, cook the shredded cabbage with an inch or two of water, covered, for 8-10 minutes, set aside.
In a large stock-pot, saute the onions, celery and carrots in the olive oil for 6-8 minutes over medium-low heat.  Add the garlic and saute a further minute.
Pour in the VGo, add the cabbage, the can of tomatoes, and all of the seasonings.  Simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.
Remove bay leaf and check seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed.  Enjoy!
