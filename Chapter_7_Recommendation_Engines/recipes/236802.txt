Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups water, divided
2 cups uncooked couscous
1/2 cup raisins
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 cups fresh asparagus tips and pieces
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
1/3 cup shredded carrots
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 ounces crumbled blue cheese
1/4 cup sunflower kernels

Directions:
Bring 1 3/4 cups water to a boil in a saucepan. Slowly pour couscous and raisins into the boiling water while stirring. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the couscous absorbs most of the water, 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat and set aside until couscous absorbs remaining water, about 5 minutes more. Fluff couscous with a fork.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute asparagus, green onions, and carrots in hot oil until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
Mix vinegar, sugar, curry powder, ginger, and salt together in a large bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved into the vinegar; add the couscous mixture, asparagus mixture, blue cheese, and sunflower kernels. Gently fold the mixture until the kernels are evenly distributed through the mixture.
