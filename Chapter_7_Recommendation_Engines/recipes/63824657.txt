Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Using a wooden spoon as a cradle, place each potato in the spoon and make several parallel slits into each potato top making sure not to slice completely through. Place 3 garlic slices between slits at the crown of each potato. Toss in a medium bowl with butter and olive oil. Place on a baking sheet lined with tin foil and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. When the potatoes begin to “fan out” it’s time to make the magic happen.Carefully slip a hunk of bacon into each slit of the potato like so and continue to cook Once the potatoes and bacon are fully cooked (use a knife poke test), coat the potatoes with heaping helping of shredded cheese. . Bake until tops are crispy and potatoes are cooked through, about 1 hour. Transfer to a platter and top with Herbed Sour Cream and chives. Herbed Sour Cream: 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Combine ingredients in a small bowl. Season, to taste, and refrigerate until use. Original Source: Easy Recipes, Healthy Eating Ideas
