Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet
4 cups water to cover
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans amber ale
1 large onion, quartered
4 red chiles
3 cloves garlic
3 cinnamon sticks
12 peppercorns
4 bay leaves
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon caraway seeds

Directions:
Place corned beef brisket and spice packet in a large Dutch oven with water to cover. Add ale, onion, chiles, garlic, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 4 to 5 hours.
Combine brown sugar, cloves, ginger, mustard, celery salt, and caraway seeds in a small bowl. Remove corned beef from the cooking liquid and discard aromatics. Rub brown sugar mixture onto the cooked corned beef while still hot.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place the coated corned beef on the hot grill and cook until the coating is crunchy, 5 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
I found this recipe attached to a 6-pack of beer on St. Patrick's Day in 1995. 

I've been serving it as a holiday tradition since. Even self-proclaimed corned beef haters love this corned beef. A typical comment is, could be the best corned beef I've ever eaten.
