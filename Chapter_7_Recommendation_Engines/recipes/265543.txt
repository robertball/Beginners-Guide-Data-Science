Ingredients:
4 potatoes, peeled and cut into eighths
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 cucumber, thinly sliced
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1 carrot, thinly sliced into rounds
1 tablespoon apple juice
1/3 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
5 tablespoons mayonnaise

Directions:
Soak potatoes in a bowl of water to draw out the bitterness.
Rub salt over cucumber and onion slices; squeeze out excess moisture and pat dry. Set aside.
Drain potatoes and place in a pot with carrot. Add enough water to cover. Season with salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes can be easily pierced with a bamboo skewer, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove carrot from the pot when tender.
Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Add apple juice and vinegar; mash potatoes with a wooden spatula or fork for about 2 minutes.
Transfer potatoes to a bowl. Add cooked carrot, cucumber, onion, and eggs. Mix in mayonnaise. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until cool, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Serve in individual bowls.
