Ingredients:
2 medium potatoes
50 g (1 3/4 oz) Unsalted Butter, diced
Salt and Freshly Milled Black Pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 180°C (355°F).
Peel and finely slice the potatoes (a mandolin makes this so easy) to around 3 mm (maybe 1/8 inch). Place the slices in a mixing bowl.
In a small pan, over gentle heat, melt the butter. Pour the melted butter over the potatoes and season with salt and pepper.
Mix well, trying to ensure that each slice is coated.
In a baking tray, on a sheet of baking paper, arrange the slices so that they overlap each other and form circles of around 13cm (5 inches) diameter.
Place another piece of baking paper over the top and then press down with a second baking tray on top of it all. This prevents the potatoes from curling up.
Bake until golden and cooked through, around 20 or 30 minutes.
