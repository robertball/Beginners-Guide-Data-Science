Ingredients:
6 large baking potatoes
1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese
¾ cup butter
salt and pepper to taste
3 slices American cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake potatoes for 1 hour or until soft.
Cut enough of the skin off the top of each potato to be able to scoop the potato out of the skin and into a mixing bowl.
Add butter, sour cream, grated cheese and mix together well.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
Fill the skins with the mix and top with 1/2 slice American cheese.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes just until heated through.
