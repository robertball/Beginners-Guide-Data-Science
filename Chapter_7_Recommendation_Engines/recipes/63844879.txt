Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups uncooked white rice
2 2/3 cups water
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
2 cups Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups mild salsa

Directions:
Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place chicken breast halves into a large saucepan, and fill the pan with water.
Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 minutes, or until done.
Remove chicken from water.
When cool enough to handle, cut meat into bite-size pieces.
In a medium bowl, combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses.
In a separate bowl, mix together cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, onion, and salsa.
Layer 1/2 of the rice, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in prepared dish.
Repeat layers, ending with cheese.
Bake at 350Â° for about 40 minutes, or until bubbly.
