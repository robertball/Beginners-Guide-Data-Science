Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni
6 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/2 cups panko bread crumbs
6 cups chopped kimchi, squeezed dry
5 1/2 cubes whole milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 pound grated Cheddar cheese
1/2 pound shredded Monterey Jack cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse macaroni with cold water and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease one 4-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in microwave and mix with bread crumbs.
Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until warmed through.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large, high-sided pan over medium heat. Add flour once bubbling; whisk for 1 minute. Slowly pour in the warm milk. Whisk until sauce thickens slightly.
Remove sauce from heat and stir in Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Add the macaroni; stir to coat. Mix in the drained kimchi. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle the buttered bread crumbs on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top, about 20 minutes.
