Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise
5 ears fresh corn
2 tablespoons heavy cream
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons Southwestern ancho chile seasoning (such as Penzeys Arizona Dreaming)
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1/3 cup crumbled Cotija cheese

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill corn, turning occasionally, until kernels are slightly charred, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool until safe to handle, at least 15 minutes. Remove kernels from the cobs to get about 2 cups of corn.
Mix cream, butter, lime juice, ancho chile seasoning, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Fold in cotija cheese. Drizzle mixture over the corn kernels. Serve hot or cold.
