Ingredients:
1 pound peeled and deveined jumbo shrimp, thawed if frozen
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 eggs
2 tablespoons water
2/3 cup finely chopped macadamia nuts
2/3 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
2 tablespoons ghee, or more to taste

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sprinkle shrimp with salt and pepper.
Stir together coconut flour, garlic powder, and onion powder in a shallow dish. Thoroughly whisk eggs and water in a second shallow dish. Mix together macadamia nuts and coconut in a third shallow dish.
Dip each shrimp in coconut flour mixture, lightly coating all sides. Dip in egg mixture, then dip in macadamia-coconut mixture. Arrange coated shrimp on the prepared baking sheet.
Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a large skillet over medium heat until melted; add 1/2 of the shrimp. Cook, turning often, until shrimp are golden brown and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes total.
Transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining shrimp, adding additional ghee as needed.
