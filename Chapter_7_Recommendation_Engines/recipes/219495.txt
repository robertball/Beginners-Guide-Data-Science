Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 tablespoons dry mustard powder
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 (5 pound) prime rib roast
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 onions, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
4 cloves garlic, peeled
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 cup red wine
1/2 cup beef broth

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix the flour, dry mustard, thyme, sea salt, chili powder, black pepper, granulated garlic, and onion powder in a bowl; rub the mixture over the prime rib roast evenly. Place the seasoned roast in a roasting pan; drizzle the Worcestershire sauce over the roast.
Scatter the chopped onions, chopped carrots, chopped celery, garlic cloves, and bay leaves around the roast. Stream the soy sauce, red wine, and beef broth evenly over the vegetable mixture.
Roast in the preheated oven to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
