Title:
Danish Chicken Liver Pate Recipe
Image:
NA
Ingredients:
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon water, or as needed
1 pound chicken livers, trimmed
1 ¼ cups heavy whipping cream
1  onion, quartered
2  eggs
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix flour and water together in a bowl until a thin paste forms, adding more water as needed.
Combine flour mixture, chicken livers, cream, onion, eggs, butter, salt, nutmeg, and black pepper in a food processor; process until blended and smooth, 30 to 45 seconds.
Transfer liver mixture to three 7x4-inch disposable pans. Cover pans with aluminum foil and place in a baking pan. Pour enough water into the baking pan to come up halfway up the sides.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cooked through, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool to room temperature. Cover with lids and refrigerate.
