Ingredients:
4 skinless chicken breast halves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
29 ounces diced tomatoes
1 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or more for extra heat
1/4 cup Parmesan or pecorino cheese (divided)

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken on both sides and set aside on a platter. Cover with foil.
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and red pepper, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables just begin to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to brown. Add the garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds. Add wine and cook until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes and juice, oregano, red pepper flakes and salt (I used about 1/4 teaspoon) and simmer covered for 10 minutes.
Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer, covered, until the chicken is just done.
Serve topped with cheese

Description: 
This version and uses thinly sliced red peppers along with, onions, mushrooms, and red wine. It created a delicious sweet and earthy flavor, with just a touch of heat from the garlic and red pepper flakes. What I love is that you get all those flavors and a filling dish for only 271calories with 6 grams of fat, 34grams of protein, 16 grams of carbohydrate and 4 grams of fiber. This is absolutely a dish you can eat without guilt.
