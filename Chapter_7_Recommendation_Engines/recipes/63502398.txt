Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
4 chicken breasts flatten slightly
cajun seasoning to taste
6 slices prosciutto (thin sliced)
2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3/4 cup dry white wine (optional)
1 cup sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Drizzle butter into a casserole dish. Season chicken with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon garlic. Wrap chicken thighs in prosciutto, and place in casserole dish. Sprinkle mushrooms and remaining garlic on top of chicken.
Bake in a preheated oven until juices run clear, about 30 hour. Remove chicken to a platter, and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Pour drippings from casserole and wine into a skillet set over medium-low  heat. Reduce by half then whisk in sour cream, and cook until warmed through, about 5 to 7 minutes. Pour over chicken, and serve.
