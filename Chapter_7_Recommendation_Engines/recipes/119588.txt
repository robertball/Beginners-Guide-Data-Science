Description: 
'This recipe comes from an old Yorkshire cookbook I picked up in England, where leeks are very popular. The curry powder lends jut the right amount of zip,' writes Valerie Engel of San Jose, California. 'I like to serve the soup with French bread, followed by scones with lemon curd for dessert.
