Ingredients:
1 large sweet potato
4 slices bacon
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 small onion, chopped
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon mild curry powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups with butter. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place sweet potato and bacon on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes; flip sweet potato and bacon. Bake until sweet potato is tender and bacon is crisp, about 20 more minutes. Let bacon cool on paper towels.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, curry powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Stir in Cheddar cheese until coated.
Peel sweet potato and transfer to a bowl; roughly mash. Measure out 1 cup of mashed sweet potato. Chop bacon and stir into onion.
Whisk eggs vigorously in a separate bowl. Add milk, sour cream, and butter; whisk until smooth. Fold in 1 cup sweet potato, bacon, and onions. Gently stir the sweet potato mixture into the flour mixture, using a rubber spatula, until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared muffin tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 18 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
When I lived in New Zealand, there was an abundance of kumara (their version of our sweet potato) and it was used in everything from curries to muffins. I came up with this recipe to fuse those two ideas, but mainly to appeal to my then 2-year-old, a picky eater who loved finger foods. I serve it with fruit for a complete meal.
