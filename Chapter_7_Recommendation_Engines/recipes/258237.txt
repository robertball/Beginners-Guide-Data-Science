Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) store-bought pie crust, unbaked
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, slightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (6 ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup broken pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Press crust into a 9-inch pie plate to form a shell.
Mix sugar, butter, flour, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until well blended. Fold in chocolate chips and pecans. Pour into the pie shell.
Bake pie in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool until center is firm before slicing, about 30 minutes.
