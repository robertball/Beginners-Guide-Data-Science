Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package frozen waffle fries
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 cup diced tomatoes
1/2 cup sliced black olives
1/2 cup sliced jalapeno peppers
3 leaves romaine lettuce, chopped
3 tablespoons sour cream, or to taste
3 tablespoons guacamole, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Arrange waffle fries in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light golden in color, 12 to 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir in taco seasoning and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.
Transfer baked fries to a 9x13-inch baking pan. Spread ground beef evenly over fries. Cover beef with cheese.
Return to the oven until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.
Remove from the oven and garnish with tomatoes, olives, jalapenos, and lettuce. Dollop sour cream and guacamole on top.
