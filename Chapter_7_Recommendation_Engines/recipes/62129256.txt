Ingredients:
2 slices of whole grain or whole wheat bread (e.g. Ezekial 4:9 sprouted whole grain)

1 tablespoon of honey

Directions:
1. Place 2 skices of bread in a toaster and toast lightly. On one slice smear a tablespoon or 2 amount of peanut butter. Squirt about 1 tablespoon of honey on the same slice. You may also do this to the other slice, if desired. Squish the two pieces of bread together.

Description: 
A different approach to the classic peanut butter sandwich. A good friend of mine got me hooked! I prefer Ezekial 4:9 bread...it's the best!
