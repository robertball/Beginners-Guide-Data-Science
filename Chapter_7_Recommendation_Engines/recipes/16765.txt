Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
8 ounces mushrooms
1 clove garlic, minced
2 large carrots, diced
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery, sliced 1/4 inch wide
2 cups cauliflower florets
1 cup fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped into 1/2 inch pieces
3 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 recipe pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Heat oil in a large skillet or saucepan.  Cook onions, mushrooms, and garlic in oil for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in carrots, potatoes, and celery.   Stir in  cauliflower, green beans, and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then turn heat down to a simmer.  Cook until vegetables are barely tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch, soy sauce, and 1/4 cup water until cornstarch is completely dissolved.  Stir into vegetables, and cook until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes.
Roll out 1/2 of the dough to line an 11x7 inch baking dish. Pour the filling into the pastry lined dish. Roll out remaining dough, arrange over the filling, and seal and flute the edges.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the crust is brown.
