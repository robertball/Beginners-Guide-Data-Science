Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 garlic cloves, minced
freshly ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1-1/2 inch pieces
2 red bell peppers, cut in 1-inch pieces
1 large onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
skewers

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together oil, honey, soy sauce, garlic and pepper. Add chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover bowl and marinate chicken, refrigerated, for 1 hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
Thread chicken, peppers and onions on skewers, alternating chicken with every 2 pieces of vegetable.  Discard any remaining marinade.
Place kabobs on hot grill; cover and cook, turning once, until grill marks form on both sides and chicken is cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serve.
