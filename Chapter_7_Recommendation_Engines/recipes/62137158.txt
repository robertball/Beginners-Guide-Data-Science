Ingredients:
5 tomatoes, diced
1 red pepper, chopped
1/2 cup red onion, chopped
1/3 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 tbsp. canned green chiles
2 cloves garlic
1 tbsp. white vinegar
1 tbsp. lime juice
2 tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt

Directions:
Puree the tomatoes in a food processor, then pour into a large mixing bowl.
Mix the garlic, red pepper, onion, cilantro, and green chiles in a food processor, then add to the tomatoes.
Add vinegar, lime juice, sugar, and salt to the rest of the ingredients and stir.
It is ready to eat now, but will taste even better the next day when it is cool and the flavors have had a chance to blend overnight in the refrigerator.

Description: 
I love the salsa at Mexican restaurants but have been unable to find the exact recipe.  This combination of ingredients is the closest I've gotten to the real thing.
