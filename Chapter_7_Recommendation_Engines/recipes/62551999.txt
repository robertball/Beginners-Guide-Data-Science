Ingredients:
4 6oz fillets of sable fish (skin-on)
1/3 cup roasted sesame seeds
1 tsp miso paste
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp sake
1/4 tsp sriracha hot sauce or crushed chilis
1/4 cup water
1 large bunch spinach
4 large shitake mushrooms
1 tbsp cooking oil
1/2 tsp soy sauce

Directions:
Pre-heat the oven to 400 F.
Grind the sesame seeds in a spice grinder or food processor until they make a very thick paste. Add the miso paste, sugar, sake, hot sauce, and combine well. If the mixture looks very dry, add water as necessary. The resulting texture should resemble Adam's Peanut Butter.
Sear the fish skin-side down for about 6 minutes on medium heat in a large oven-proof skillet. Remove skillet from the heat, heap the sesame mixture on the top of each piece of fish, and finish in the pre-heated oven for an additional 6-10 minutes.
Heat the cooking oil in a pan over high heat. Add sliced mushrooms and sautee until golden, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and toss in the spinach. The residual warmth will wilt the leaves. Season lightly with soy sauce.
Pile 1/4 of the spinach and mushrooms in the centre of a plate and place one piece of sablefish on top. Repeat until all is used.
