2/3 cup vegetable stock
2 cloves garlic
1 cup packed fresh basil leaves
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons pine nuts
12 ounces penne pasta
2 large tomatoes, seeded and chopped

In a small saucepan, combine stock and garlic cloves.  Simmer for about 5 minutes, or until garlic is soft.  Alternatively, microwave on High for 5 minutes in a microwave safe bowl.
Add basil to the bowl of a food processor; chop fine.  Blend in stock mixture.  Add Parmesan cheese and pine nuts; chop fine.  Pesto can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 24 hours.
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until al dente.  Drain well, and return to pot.  Stir in pesto to coat pasta.  Toss with tomatoes.
