Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen puff pastry shells
1 (16 ounce) package fresh baby carrots, cut in half
1 1/4 cups water, divided
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1 (8 ounce) package sliced baby portobello mushrooms
2 tablespoons chopped shallots
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Bake pastry shells according to package directions. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the carrots and 1 cup of water. Cover and microwave on high for 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the beef, mushrooms and shallots over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Combine the flour and broth until smooth. Add the broth mixture, tomato paste, wine, tarragon, salt, pepper and remaining water to beef mixture; stir to combine.
Drain carrots; add to skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove top of pastry shells; fill with beef mixture.
