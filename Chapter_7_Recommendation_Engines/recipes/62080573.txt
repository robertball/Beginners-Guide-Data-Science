Ingredients:
Juice of 1 medium-sized lemon, divided
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, divided
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup sour cream
1/3 cup milk
1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
1-1/4 cups frozen blueberries (do not thaw)
Topping:
1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
1 Tbsp. icing sugar

Directions:
In custard cup, blend topping ingredients; set aside.
In large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, butter, eggs, sour cream and remaining lemon juice. Blend thoroughly, then stir in milk. In separate bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and salt.  Remove 2 Tbsp. flour mixture and place in smaller bowl.
Stir the flour mixture into the liquid ingredients with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, blending just to combine. Stir frozen blueberries with remaining flour mixture till berries are coated. Fold berries into batter, stirring only till evenly mixed. Put batter into prepared (with Pam) 9"x5" loaf pan. Bake in preheated 350 oven for 60 minutes. Remove from oven and immediately poke holes all over top of loaf with toothpick. Pour topping all over. Let loaf cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove to wire rack to cool completely. Like most sweet loaves, this one tastes best when wrapped tightly and allowed to sit for a day to let the flavors meld.
