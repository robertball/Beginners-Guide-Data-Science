Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup frozen sweet corn kernels
1 cup fresh blueberries
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
2 large eggs

Directions:
Pour vegetable oil into a 9-inch cast iron skillet and place skillet in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
While the oven is preheating, place corn in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover and microwave on high for 2 1/2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Place corn in a colander to drain any excess liquid, then transfer to a medium bowl. Add blueberries and 2 tablespoons flour and toss to combine; set aside.
Combine cornmeal, 1 cup flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
Whisk buttermilk, melted butter, and eggs together in a small bowl. Pour into the cornmeal-flour mixture and mix to combine. Gently fold in the reserved blueberry-corn mixture.
Remove skillet from the oven and brush the oil onto the bottom and sides until coated. Pour batter into the hot skillet and level the top with a spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm.
