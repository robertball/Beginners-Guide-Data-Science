Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon onion powder
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup chicken broth
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, or as desired
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
¼ cup heavy whipping cream
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon hot sauce
½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. Toss in chicken, onion powder, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Whisk chicken broth and flour together in a bowl until well blended. Pour over the chicken in the skillet. Add half the Cheddar cheese, diced tomatoes, cream, butter, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce; stir to combine. Continue stirring over medium heat until sauce starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Stir cooked pasta into skillet.
Pour chicken-pasta mixture into a glass baking dish. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and melted, about 15 minutes.
