Ingredients:
1 lb polenta log
1 T all-purpose flour
2 t cayenne powder
pinch salt
pinch black pepper
peanut oil for frying

Directions:
*Cut off both rounded ends of the polenta log to form a cylinder and reserve ends.  Cut polenta cylinder in half, perpendicular to its length.  Cut each half into 1/2" slices.  Then cut slices into 1/2" thick strips.
*Place strips between several sheets of paper towel and thoroughly remove any excess liquid.
*In a flat bowl, mix flour, cayenne, salt and pepper.
*Completely coat polenta strips in flour mixture.
*Heat 1/2" oil in frying pan.  Test temperature by dropping a small amount of reserved polenta and ensuring that it sizzles immediately.  Fry half of the strips for about 10 minutes, until golden.  Drain on paper towels and repeat with the second batch.
