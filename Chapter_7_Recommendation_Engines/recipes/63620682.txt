1 cup white vinegar
1 cup water
8 oz IPA of your choice (IPA is BEER!)

2 tsp dill weed
4 cloves garlic
1 tbs pickling spice

Cut the ends off the cucumbers (helps them stay crisp) and then half or quarter them, set aside

Canning:
Boil 2 mason jars to sterilize. Use tongs and pull them out of the water. Place sliced cucumbers into the jars. Pour equal amounts of the dry spice in each jar. Place equal amounts of the garlic in the jar. Pour the liquid brine into each jar, leaving about 1/4 inch of head space. Dip the lids of the canning jars in the hot water to soften seal. Place on jar. Place sealing ring on jar finger tight. Place in dark cool place overnight. Check the next day to make sure they sealed. If not sealed, place in fridge and eat within a few weeks. If sealed, keep as long as you wish!
