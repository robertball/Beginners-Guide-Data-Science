2 tablespoons vegetable oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup lemon juice

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Coat asparagus with vegetable and arrange on a baking sheet. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
Roast in preheated oven until lightly browned at the tips, about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine lemon juice, butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in on high in microwave until butter is completely melted, about 1 minute; stir to combine. Pour butter mixture over roasted asparagus and toss to coat.
