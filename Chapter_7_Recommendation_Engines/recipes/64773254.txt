Ingredients:
1 lb powdered sugar, sift for best results
2 -3 Tbsp CK Meringue powder use more for thicker icing
Juice of 1/2 of a lemon
Dash of vanilla extract
Water mixed with other liquid make 3 1/2 oz

Directions:
Mix water and lemon juice  in bowl and dissolve the meringue powder until smooth. Then add sugar and beat with electric mixer until smooth. for a standard glaze, don’t beat the icing too much. If you beat more or add more meringue powder it will be fluffier maybe good for gingerbread house “glue”. Adjust more water or sugar to desired consistency.
Divide out into bowls and color for decorating. Let cookies cool all the way before applying icing. Have fun!
