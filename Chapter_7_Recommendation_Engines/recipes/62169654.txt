Step 4: Dilute the leftover sugar in the espresso coffee.Dip 24 cookies in the coffee mixture, taking care not to over soak them. Then fill the bottom of a pyrex lasagna pan by placing them side by side.
Step 5: Spread half of the creme mixture over the cookies.Then dip the other 24 cookies in the coffee mixture and place them on top of the creme. Then spread the leftover creme mixture over the cookies.
Step 6: Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours for best flavour. Sift the cocoa powder over the cake when it is time to serve for best appearance ,but it can be added on the same day the cake is made.
