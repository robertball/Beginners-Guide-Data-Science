Description: 
The Instant Pot® creates a wonderfully soft and tender flan that is creamier than a regular custard flan. You'll recognize the French influence in this Vietnamese version of the creme caramel, and will also taste the Vietnamese take on the dessert as it's steamed in the Instant Pot®. The delicate texture and vanilla flavor make the dish entirely delicious!
