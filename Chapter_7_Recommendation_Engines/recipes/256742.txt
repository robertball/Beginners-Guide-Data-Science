Ingredients:
Dry Rub:
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
Bowl Ingredients:
1/2 pound flank steak
1 cup cooked white rice
1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
1 cup chopped romaine lettuce
1 cup tortilla chips
1/2 cup canned black beans
1 jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced
1 lime, cut into wedges
1/4 cup crumbled cotija cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
Avocado Cilantro Dressing:
2 avocados, peeled and pitted
1 cup water
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons sour cream
1 lime, juiced
1 clove garlic
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat until just barely smoking.
Combine garlic powder, chili powder, kosher salt, paprika, and cumin in a bowl; rub over all sides of flank steak.
Grill flank steak in the preheated grill pan, flipping halfway through, until browned and cooked to desired doneness, about 8 minutes. Let steak rest on a work surface for 10 minutes. Thinly slice steak against the grain.
Divide rice, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, tortilla chips, black beans, jalapeno peppers, and lime wedges between 2 serving bowls; top with steak, cotija cheese, and 1 tablespoon cilantro.
Combine avocados, water, 1/2 cup cilantro, sour cream, lime juice, garlic, and salt in a blender; blend until dressing is smooth. Pour dressing over each bowl.
