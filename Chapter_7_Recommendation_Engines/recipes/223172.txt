Ingredients:
8 dried pasilla chiles, seeded and torn to pieces
8 dried guajillo chiles, seeded and torn to pieces
8 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon achiote powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
5 whole cloves
1 cup white vinegar
salt to taste
2 pounds pork tenderloin, thinly sliced
1/2 cup chopped pineapple
32 (5 inch) corn tortillas
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
4 limes, cut in wedges

Directions:
Soak pasilla chiles and guajillo chiles in a bowl with hot water until chiles are softened, about 10 minutes; drain. Mash chiles, garlic, achiote powder, cumin, and cloves in a saucepan with a fork.
Pour vinegar into sauce pan and bring to a boil; cook and stir until mixture becomes a thick paste. Season with salt. Rub chile paste over sliced pork, stacking meat on a plate. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir marinated pork and pineapple until pork is browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Divide pork over stacks of two corn tortillas and serve with onion, cilantro, and lime wedges.
