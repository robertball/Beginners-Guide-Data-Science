Ingredients:
6 tea bags
2 quarts boiling water
1 1/2 teaspoons loosely packed saffron threads
1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar
2/3 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon rum flavored extract
2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
2 1/2 teaspoons ground dried ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves
2 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 tablespoons salt
1 bunch fresh tarragon, chopped

Directions:
Steep the tea in the hot water for 5 minutes. Remove and discard the tea bags, then whisk in the saffron, sugar, lemon juice, rum extract, cayenne pepper, ginger, clove, coriander, salt, and tarragon until the sugar has dissolved. Cool to room temperature before using. Refrigerate any marinade that will not be used immediately.
To use, marinate meats such as chicken or pork in the refrigerator overnight.

Description: 
When you smell this marinade you'll want to drink it! It's great with chicken and pork, and could also be thickened and used as a sauce if you reduce the salt a little.  I marinated three pans of chicken legs with this recipe, and while covering with plastic wrap, two of then gave me a strong static shock....maybe just a coincidence, but nothing else has ever zapped while working in a kitchen.
