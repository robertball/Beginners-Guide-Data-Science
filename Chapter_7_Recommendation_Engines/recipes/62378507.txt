Ingredients:
4 tsp good white wine vinegar
1 cup of water

Directions:
Mix ingredients in a bowl and use to deglaze a hot pan.  The acidity will dissipate and work precisely like wine.  You will know this is working, in the beginning, because you will smell vinegar.  Cook for about five minutes, or until you can no longer smell the acridness of the vinegar smell.

Submitter: 
Toasted Garlic
Description: 
If you do not have wine, and you need it as a part of a deglazing process, this is a cheap and effective way to work.
