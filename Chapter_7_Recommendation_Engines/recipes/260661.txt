Ingredients:
1 (27 ounce) can sauerkraut with juice
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
4 pork chops

Directions:
Mix sauerkraut and juice, ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce together in a slow cooker to form a sauce. Add pork chops; stir to cover chops with the sauerkraut sauce.
Cook on Low until pork is no longer pink in the center, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
Taking a standard pork chop and sauerkraut recipe, I wing it a little by raiding the pantry and adding some on-hand ingredients, which yields a yummy pork chop dinner with a little extra kick.
