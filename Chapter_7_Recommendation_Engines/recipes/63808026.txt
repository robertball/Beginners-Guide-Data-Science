Ingredients:
4 cups bananas, sliced and frozen (about 6-8 ripe bananas)
1 cup pineapple chunks, frozen
1 (14 oz.) can of coconut milk
Juice of one lime
pinch of kosher salt

Directions:
Peel and slice bananas into about 1/2" disks and place on a plastic wrapped baking sheet. Drain 1 can of pineapple chunks or use fresh pineapple and place them on the lined baking sheet as well. Put baking sheet in freezer until fruit is frozen solid.
Remove baking sheet from freezer and let set at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Put frozen bananas and pineapple and coconut milk into a food processor fitted with a blade. Process for about a minute or until smooth. Depending on the size of your processor, you may want to put the fruit in one cup at a time. Add fresh lime juice and pinch of salt.  Process again to mix.
Pour mixture into a plastic wrapped 8 x 11 baking pan and place back into the freezer for 30-45 minutes.
*Top with toasted un-sweetened coconut shreds. (*Optional)
