In a large pot add vinegar its best to use heavy stainless steal for this type of stuff . Add celery seed and mustard seed then add sugar .Bring to a boil and stir til sugar dissolves . When vinegar / sugar mixture boils, add the drained chopped veggies. Stir and return to a boil. This will take about 10 minutes to boil and you don't need to constantly stir . When veggie mixture begins to boil, turn off heat and ladle chopped veggies into hot jars with the funnel. Fill almost all the way to the top, wipe rim of jar clean, then top with hot lid, then tighten band over to seal.
