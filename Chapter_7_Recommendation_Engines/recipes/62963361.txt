Ingredients:
1 (3-pound) chuck roast, cut into 1-inch pieces or stew beef
Kosher salt
Black pepper
Garlic powder
Cooking spray
1/3 cup all-purpose flour, plus 1/4 cup
8 tablespoons cooking oil
1 large bell pepper, chopped
2 medium onions, chopped
1 cup diced celery
3 large cloves garlic, minced
4 cups beef broth
3 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 tablespoons hot sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 (10-ounce) cans tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel)
1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley leaves

Directions:
Season beef with kosher salt, black pepper and garlic powder. Dust beef with 1/3 cup flour and toss lightly. Heat 8 tablespoons cooking oil. Brown meat in hot oil and remove to a large bowl. Leaving oil in Dutch oven, saute bell pepper, onions, celery, and garlic. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Brown vegetables and remove to bowl with beef.
You will need 3 tablespoons of oil to make your roux. To make roux, add approximately 1/4 cup of flour, stirring constantly and slowly until flour is dark golden brown, be careful not to burn the flour. Slowly add 4 cups of beef broth or water and stir. Bring to a simmer and add back beef and vegetables. Add bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, dried basil, and 2 cans tomatoes with green chiles, stir. Simmer for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove bay leaves and stir in 1/2 cup chopped parsley. Enjoy!
