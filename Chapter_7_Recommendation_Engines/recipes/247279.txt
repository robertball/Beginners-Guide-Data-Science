Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) jar chunky salsa
4 eggs
1 onion, chopped
1/4 cup barbeque sauce
1/4 cup mustard
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons sriracha sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons malt vinegar
1 (1.25 ounce) packet meatloaf seasoning mix
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
5 pounds ground beef, broken into small chunks
2 pounds sausage, broken into small chunks
1 cup bread crumbs, or more as needed
Topping:
2 tablespoons barbeque glaze (such as Jack Daniel'sÂ®)
2 tablespoons barbeque sauce
2 tablespoons mustard
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Mix salsa, eggs, onion, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, 1/4 cup mustard, 1/4 cup ketchup, Parmesan cheese, sriracha sauce, soy sauce, malt vinegar, meatloaf seasoning mix, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir beef and sausage into salsa mixture until thoroughly mixed. Add enough bread crumbs to bring meatloaf mixture together.
Line a container with plastic wrap. Pack meatloaf mixture into the container. Chill until set, 3 to 4 hours.
Preheat smoker to 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.
Line a wire rack with aluminum foil. Position in a cake pan lined with aluminum foil. Use plastic wrap to lift meatloaf onto the prepared wire rack.
Smoke meatloaf until no longer pink in the center, about 3 hours.
Combine barbeque glaze, 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce, 2 tablespoons mustard, 2 tablespoons ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Baste meatloaf with topping.
Continue smoking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 185 degrees F (85 degrees C), 1 to 2 hours more.
