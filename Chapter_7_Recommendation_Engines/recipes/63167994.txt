Ingredients:
4 matzo sheets
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil/ or 1/4 cup applesauce
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
2 apples - peeled, cored and cubed
3/4 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. Break the matzo sheets into pieces, and soak in a bowl of water until soft. Drain in a colander, mashing to squeeze the water out.
In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, salt, sugar, oil & cinnamon. Add the soaked matzo & mix well. Fold in the apples & raisins. Spoon into the prepared baking dish, and spread evenly. Dust top with cinnamon.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until nicely browned & apples are tender.
