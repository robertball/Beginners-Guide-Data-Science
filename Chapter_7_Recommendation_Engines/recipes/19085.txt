Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 3/4 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup hot water
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk and hot water, mixing just until incorporated. Stir in the raisins.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
