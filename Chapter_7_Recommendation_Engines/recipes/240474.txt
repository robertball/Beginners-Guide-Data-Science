Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups cornmeal
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir milk and cornmeal together so the cornmeal is completely wet; let soak for 5 minutes.
Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl with a whisk; add cornmeal mixture, eggs, and coconut oil and stir until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
This cornbread is made with coconut oil because it is healthier than vegetable oil and is said to help raise your good cholesterol. It does not change the taste of the cornbread.
