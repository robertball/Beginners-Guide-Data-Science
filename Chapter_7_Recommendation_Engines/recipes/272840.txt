German-Style Baked Pork Chops with Mustard Cream Sauce Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 cup apple juice
1/4 cup spicy brown mustard
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
3 (3 ounce) lean boneless pork chops
2 tablespoons fat-free sour cream
1 teaspoon prepared horseradish
2 cups sauerkraut, drained

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly spray a baking pan.
Whisk apple juice and brown mustard together in a bowl. Spread out panko on a shallow plate.
Dip each pork chop in the mustard mixture to cover completely, then roll in panko. Place in the baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork chops are no longer pink in the center and bread crumbs are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Meanwhile, pour remaining mustard mixture into a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until bubbling and simmer until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and horseradish. Remove pork chops from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Heat sauerkraut in a separate pan until hot. Place about 1/3 of the sauerkraut on each plate. Top with 1 pork chop and drizzle with mustard cream sauce.
