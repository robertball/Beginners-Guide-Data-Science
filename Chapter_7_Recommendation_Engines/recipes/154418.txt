Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy. Mix in the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves until the sugar dissolves.  Beat in the vanilla ice cream, lemon juice, and orange juice on low speed. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Just before serving, stir in the ginger ale.

Description: 
This punch is a Christmas tradition at our home, and a wonderful alternative to traditional eggnog. It is not too heavy and the addition of ginger ale gives it a kick! You can make it several days in advance and wait until the last minute to add ginger ale. I also freeze a ginger ale ice ring and add it to the punch bowl to help keep the punch cold. Add cinnamon swizzle sticks to your glasses for pretty presentation.
