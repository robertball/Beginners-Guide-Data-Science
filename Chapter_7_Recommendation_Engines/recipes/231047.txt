Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter at room temperature
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon orange zest (optional)
1 teaspoon orange extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (6 ounce) package sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®), or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl until mixture is creamy. Beat in eggs, orange zest, orange extract, and almond extract.
Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; mix dry ingredients into moist ingredients to make a stiff dough. Mix sweetened cranberries into dough. Form dough into a ball, cut into halves, and shape each half into a log. Place logs onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Let logs cool completely on wire racks.
Cut logs into slices on a slight diagonal and lay the slices on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake biscotti until crisp and lightly golden brown, about 7 minutes.

Description: 
I received this recipe from a friend, and it's great! I use the convection bake setting on my oven, so it's usually 50 degrees hotter than normal ovens. you may want to add 50 degrees depending on your oven.
