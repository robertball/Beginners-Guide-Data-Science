Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sliced blanched almonds
1/2 cup chopped red candied cherries
2 ounces white chocolate (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line bottom and sides of an 11x7-inch glass baking pan with parchment paper; leave paper hanging over pan edges so that cookies can be lifted out after baking.
Beat butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stir flour into butter mixture until crumbly; stir in almonds and cherries. Press mixture evenly into the bottom of prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at edges, about 20 minutes. Score with a sharp knife into bars while in the pan and still warm; allow cookies to cool about 30 minutes. Lift cookies from pan and slice to separate along scored marks.
Melt white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Drizzle melted white chocolate over cookies or dip half of each cookie into melted white chocolate.

Description: 
This is my Grandmother's recipe, at least 50 years old, a classic cherry almond icebox cookie that I turned into a bar cookie. I also dip or drizzle white chocolate on the cooled cookies to make them a little more fancy for Christmas cookie exchanges. But it's delicious either way!
