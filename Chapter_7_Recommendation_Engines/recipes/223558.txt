Ingredients:
1 Spanish onion, finely chopped
1 (16 ounce) package bella mushrooms, sliced into thirds
1 orange bell pepper, diced
1 (16 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
2 tablespoons Hungarian hot paprika
1 tablespoon dried oregano
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until just slightly tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Discard any excess water from vegetables. Transfer vegetables to a 2-quart casserole dish. Add garbanzo beans, paprika, oregano, and salt; stir to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great side dish, full of flavor and super easy to make. My favorite pairing of this dish is with a simple white fish such as tilapia. This recipe is gluten and dairy-free.
