Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
2 cloves garlic, minced and divided
4 portobello mushroom caps
1/2 cup goat cheese
4 sandwich buns, split and toasted
1 1/2 cups baby spinach leaves
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 limes, juiced

Directions:
Preheat toaster oven broiler.
Whisk the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, rosemary, and 2 cloves minced garlic together in a bowl. Spread about half of this mixture over the ribbed side of the portobello mushroom caps; arrange the mushrooms on a baking sheet with the ribbed sides facing upwards.
Broil the mushrooms until tender, making sure to not burn the garlic, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip the mushrooms and brush the remaining olive oil mixture over the tops of the caps. Return to the oven and broil until tender, about 6 minutes more.
Spread equal amounts of the goat cheese on one half of each of the sandwich rolls. Top each with a portion of the spinach. Whisk the mayonnaise, garlic, and lime juice together in a bowl; spread evenly over the remaining sandwich roll halves and top with one mushroom cap each. Bring the two halves together to form the sandwiches to serve.
