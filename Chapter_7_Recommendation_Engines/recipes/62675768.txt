Ingredients:
Wisk together in a large bowl:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
Combine in another bowl:
1/3 cup nonfat or low-fat yogurt
1/3 cup orange juice
3 tablespoons walnut oil (or vegetable oil)
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
1 teaspoon vanilla
Streusel topping
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon walnut oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350. Grease and 8X2 inch round pan. Prepare and set aside the streusel topping.
Whisk together thoroughly the dry ingredients. Combine the wet ingredients in another bowl.
Pour wet mixture over the dry mixture and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Do not overmix; the batter will not be smooth. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread evenly. Sprinkle with the streusel. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes before unmolding to cool completely on the rack.
