Ingredients:
4 eggs, beaten
2/3 cup wheat berries
1/2 cup almond milk
1/3 cup oats
3 tablespoons coconut oil, softened
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
1 pinch salt
1 cup cottage cheese

Directions:
Blend eggs, wheat berries, almond milk, oats, coconut oil, and vanilla extract together in a blender until smooth, 45 to 50 seconds. Add sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves, mace, and salt; pulse blender until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the batter.
Pour batter into a large bowl and fold cottage cheese into the mixture.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and coat with cooking spray. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side, about 2 minutes more.

Description: 
A delicious and healthy option for busy mornings! I love the subtle gooey goodness of the cottage cheese. They are fluffy with just a touch of cinnamon-spice.
