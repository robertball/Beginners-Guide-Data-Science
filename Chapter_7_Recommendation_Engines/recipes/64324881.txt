Ingredients:
1 large bunch kale, ribs removed, chopped
1 bunch beet greens, chopped
3 cloves garlic minced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon ginger
3-4 tablespoons of Pecans (you can toast them for about 3-4 minutes to improve flavor)
Orange zest (optional)
Sea salt to taste

Directions:
Gently clean the kale and beet greens under cool running water.
Remove the stems from the beet greens and chop them into 1/4-1/2 inch pieces.
Remove the ribs from the kale and discard. Chop the kale and beet leaves into 1/2-3/4 inch strips.
Saute garlic and chopped beet stems about 5 minutes in a large skillet on medium heat until garlic and stems are softened.
Add the beet and kale greens and saute adding ginger and salt to taste. (I recommend using freshly grated ginger but powdered ginger will work, as well.) Turn the greens in the pan using a large pair of tongs. The water clinging to the washed greens is typically enough to steam them a bit but, if needed, you can add a few extra tablespoons. Saute until softâ€”about 5-7 minutes longer.
Serve sprinkled with toasted pecans. A small amount of orange zest, if you have it, provides a colorful garnish for this dish.  Serve with pasta or other starch.
