Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
3 cups all-purpose flour
Cornmeal

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the sugar, salt, garlic salt, cheese and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape each half into a 14-in. loaf. Place on a greased baking sheet that has been sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
Brush loaves with water. Make three diagonal slashes about 1/2 in. deep with a very sharp knife in each loaf.
Fill a  13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan with 1 in. of hot water and place on the bottom oven rack.  Preheat to 400 degrees F. Bake loaves for 20-25 minutes. Remove to wire racks.

Description: 
This crusty bread is as big a treat today as it was when Mom made it back when I was growing up. It goes so well with an Italian meal or alongside a big bowl of soup.                        --Cookie Curci-Wright, San Jose, California
