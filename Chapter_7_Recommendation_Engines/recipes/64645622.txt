Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 Tbsp maple syrup
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp olive oil
4 salmon fillets (4 ounces each)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
In a small saucepan, bring the orange juice, vinegar, syrup and garlic to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Transfer 2 Tbsp to a small bowl; add oil. Set remaining glaze aside.
Sprinkle salmon with salt and pepper; place skin side down on grill rack. Using long-handled tongs, moisten a paper towel with cooking oil and lightly coat the grill rack. Grill, covered, over medium heat or broil 4-6 in. from the heat for 10-12 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork, basting occasionally with maple-oil mixture. Drizzle with reserved glaze

Description: 
We eat a lot of fish, super healthy.  This is a family-favorite, heart-healthy salmon recipe. I serve it this way at least once a week and sometimes more! Sometimes I don't feel like using the grill. so I broil them for up to 20 minutes or until internal temperature is 140 degrees
