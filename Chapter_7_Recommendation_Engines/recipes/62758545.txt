Ingredients:
1 lb green beans, cut into 1/4" pieces
1 T curry powder
3 T vegetable oil
1 tsp minced garlic
2 tsp garlic paste
1/4 c water
1/2 c besan (chick-pea flour)
1/2 c water
2 hot green chilies
2 T chopped cilantro
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Measure everything out and place in small bowls so everything will be right at hand
Toss the cut beans and the curry powder together.  Set aside.
Heat oil over med-high heat.  Add the garlic and ginger and let it just begin to brown a little.  Quickly add the beans and fry for about 5 minutes, constantly stirring.
add 1/4c water, reduce heat to med, cover, and cook for about 15 mins
Whisk the remaining water together with the besan.
When the green beans are done, stir in the chilies and the coriander.
Let cook for a couple of minutes, then pour this batter into the pan with the beans.  DO NOT STIR.  Let it cook for a minute or so until it begins to thicken like a pudding.
Gently turn the mixture for about 5 minutes.  The besan mixture will break up into bits of dough (sort of like smallish dumplings)
Goes well with any of the more stew-like curries or soups.
