Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic
5 (5 ounce) fillets catfish
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 lemon, juiced
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir cilantro and garlic into the melted butter; cook about 1 minute.
Season catfish fillets with salt and black pepper; lay gently into the butter mixture. Place a cover on the skillet. Cook fillets 10 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Squeeze lemon juice and lime juice over the fillets to serve.

Description: 
I was looking for a recipe for Mexican catfish and wasn't able to find exactly what I wanted, so I made my own version. I wasn't sure what it would end up like, but it tasted great.
