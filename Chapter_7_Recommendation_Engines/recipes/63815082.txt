Ingredients:
2 1/2C vegetable broth
1 1/4C milk
1C quick-cooking polenta mix
1 1/4C shredded Mexican-style four-cheese blend (5oz)
1 4-oz can diced green chiles
1C finely chopped onion
8oz bulk pork sausage
2C sliced fresh mushrooms
nonstick cooking spray
8 eggs
black pepper  (opt)
snipped fresh cilantro (opt)
bottled hot pepper sauce (opt)

Directions:
In lg. saucepan, bring broth to boiling. Meanwhile, in sm. bowl, stir together milk and polenta. Add polenta mixture in slow, steady stream to broth, stirring constantly; reduce heat. Cook and stir until bubbly; cook and stir for 3-5 min. more until polenta thickens. Stir in cheese and chiles; set aside.
In an extra-lg. skillet, cook onion, sausage, and mushrooms over med-high heat until meat browns and onion is tender. Drain and discard liquid. Stir in polenta mixture.
Spread polenta-meat mixture in a greased 3-qt. oval or rectangular baking dish. Cover with greased or nonstick foil; chill overnight.
While oven preheats to 375, use the bottom of a 1/3-cup measuring cup coated w/cooking spray to make 8 indentations in the polenta-meat mixture. Bake, covered, for 35 min. Reduce oven temp to 325. Remove dish from oven; remove foil. Break one egg into a small, shallow bowl. Slide egg into an indentation. Repeat with remaining eggs. Return to oven.
Bake, uncovered, in 325 oven for 25 min. or until eggs are almost set. Let stand on wire rack 5-10 min. (eggs will continue to cook). If you like, sprinkle w/pepper and cilantro and serve w/hot pepper sauce.
