Ingredients:
1 lb. green beans
1 package center cut bacon, uncooked
1 cup butter

Begin by taking 3-4 green beans and rolling bacon around them.
Place them side by side on a greased cookie sheet.
Once you have rolled all of the green beans, in a small sauce pan, combine butter, brown sugar, and garlic.
Warm over medium heat, constantly stirring to avoid burning.
Once sugar has completely dissolved, pour over green bean bundles generously.
Place into preheated oven (350 degress) and cook for 45minutes to 1 hour.
