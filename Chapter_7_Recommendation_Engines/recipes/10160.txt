Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter
2/3 cup ground blanched almonds
1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Mix together shortening, butter and almonds.  Sift in flour and salt.  Add vanilla.
Chill dough until firm.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C).
Roll dough with hands into 3 inch lengths, pencil thick.  Form into crescents on ungreased baking sheet.  Bake until just slightly brown -- about 16 minutes. Cool on pan
While still slightly warm, carefully dip in a mixture of confectioner's sugar and  cinnamon.  These are extremely fragile cookies -- handle with care!
