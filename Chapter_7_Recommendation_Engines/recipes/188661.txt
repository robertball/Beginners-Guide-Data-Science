Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds andouille sausage, sliced into rounds
6 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
3 cups chicken broth
2 cups milk
1 3/4 cups heavy cream
2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 bunch fresh spinach, chopped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the butter and oil together in a large stock pot over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the butter and oil until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage slices; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Stir in the potatoes; cook and stir 15 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, and Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer and cook 10 to 12 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Mix in the spinach. Remove from heat. Top with Parmesan cheese.
