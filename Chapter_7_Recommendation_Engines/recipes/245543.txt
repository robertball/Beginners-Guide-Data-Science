Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
1 (10 ounce) bag nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as DoritosÂ®), crushed
1 (15.25 ounce) can corn kernels, drained
1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine beef and taco seasoning in a large skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Place refried beans in a small saucepan and heat over low heat, covered, until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
Spread a thin layer of salsa on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Layer half of the crushed chips, seasoned beef, beans, corn, olives, and cheese on top. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients, starting with salsa and ending with cheese.
Bake nacho lasagna in the oven until bubbly and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.
