Ingredients:
1 lb hamburger
garlic powder to taste
Prego Meat-flavored sauce
pepper to taste

Directions:
1.  Brown hamburger in a large skillet over medium high heat and drain.  Return hamburger back to skillet and lower heat to medium heat.  Add Prego sauce, garlic powder (I use about 2 tablespoons, but add as much or as little as you like), and pepper (to taste).
2.  Cook over medium heat for about 30 mins, stirring often.
3.  Pour over prepared spaghetti noodles and enjoy!

Description: 
This is a recipe for spaghetti passed down from my mother in law.  Even though I'm not a spaghetti fan, my husband and daughter ADORE it.  It makes plenty to go around.  The sauce is the key.
