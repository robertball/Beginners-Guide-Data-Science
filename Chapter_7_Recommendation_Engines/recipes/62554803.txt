Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cracked black-pepper
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 cups buttermilk
1 pound cube-steak
1/2 cup crisco or olive oil
2 cups beef broth
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup water
1 8oz package baby bella mushrooms

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Pour buttermilk into shallow bowl and set aside.
Stir flour, black pepper, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and seasoned salt together in a separate shallow bowl from the milk.  Set aside.
Cut steak into pieces that are about 2 inches wide as this helps with making the meat tender.
Each piece of steak should be coated in buttermilk and then dredged in the seasoned flour.  Save 1.5 tablespoons of the flour for later.
Heat crisco or olive oil in pan and cook steak on medium-high until brown.  (3-4 minutes on each side)
Remove steak from pan with fork and set aside.
Using a wooden spoon, scrape all that is left in the pan away from the bottom.  This is used in the gravy and adds flavor.  Whisk in beef broth, whole milk, water, and the seasoned flour you saved.
Place the steak in a pan and cover with uncooked mushrooms.
Pour broth mixture over steak and mushrooms.
Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake for 2 hours at 350 degrees or until fork-tender.

Description: 
I've made a few changes to the traditional recipe.  The mushrooms and broth give it a deeper flavor.  Serve over mashed potatoes.
