Ingredients:
1 bulb garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed
2 cups shelled edamame
1/2 cup roughly chopped cilantro
1/3 cup tahini
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim about 1/4 inch off the top of the garlic bulb, to expose the cloves; drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and wrap in aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft, about 1 hour. Let cool until easily handled, about 10 minutes.
Squeeze roasted garlic cloves into a food processor. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, edamame, cilantro, tahini, lemon juice, and salt. Process until smooth, adding more oil if needed, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with smoked paprika.
