Ingredients:
3 large eggs
1/2 cup sugar
2 Tbls. brandy
2 cups espresso or strong brewed coffee (cooled)
16 oz. mascarpone cheese
30 ladyfingers (such as Savoiardi)
3 Tbls. cocoa

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combined 3 egg yolks, sugar, 1 Tbls. espresso, and the brandy.  Beat with a mixer for 2-3 minutes until smooth.  Add mascarpone cheese and beat another 3-5 minutes until well blended.
In a smaller bowl, beat egg whites and a pinch of sugar until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold into mascarpone mixture until well blended.
Pour espresso into a flat dish.  Dip one side of ladyfingers into espresso and layer on serving platter (2 horizontal rows of 6 with 2-1/2 ladyfingers vertically on the end to form a rectangle).
Top with 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture.  Dust with half of the cocoa.  Repeat with another layer; ladyfingers, mascarpone and finish with a dusting of the remaining cocoa.
Refrigerate for 2-3 hours before serving.  This will give time for the ladyfingers to soak up the espresso and soften from the moisture in the mascarpone layer.

Description: 
On my first trip to Italy to meet my husband's family back in 1995, I didn't speak a word of Italian, but I DID learn how to make great dolci from his sister, Maria.  This was her recipe, and now when we go back they ask ME to make it!
