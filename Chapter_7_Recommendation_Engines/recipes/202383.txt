Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 (7 ounce) can minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or to taste
1 bunch green onions, minced
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
1 (15 ounce) can spaghetti sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Mix the ground beef, chipotle peppers with the adobo sauce, green onions, bread crumbs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Roll the mixture into balls the size of cherry tomatoes. Arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 30 minutes.
While the meatballs bake, bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook until tender but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
Pour the spaghetti sauce in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the cooked meatballs and stir to coat. Ladle over the drained spaghetti and top with the grated Parmesan cheese to serve.
