Description: 
I had some extra eggnog and was trying to figure out what to do with it. I decided to use it for chicken and everyone was a little skeptical, but after tasting it they all thought it was amazing. You can taste the eggnog, but it's subtle. I was cooking for some people who disliked eggnog and they still loved this recipe!
