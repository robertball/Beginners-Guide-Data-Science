Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef lean
1 lb Italian Sausage
1 c Italian bread crumbs
1 c Romano or Parmesan Cheese
1/4 c dried Italian parsley, or 1/2 c fresh
1-2 Tablespoons of garlic powder
3 eggs
salt and pepper to taste
Sauce:
2 28oz cans whole peeled Tomatoes, put through the blender
4-6 cloves of pressed garlic
1/4 c dried basil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix all and really kneed it together. Form meatballs and place in 12 cup muffin tin sprayed with oil. Put in oven and check every 1/2 hour. Turn if needed. Meanwhile saute garlic in olive oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) until golden brown. Add Tomatoes and spices. The longer you saute' this sauce the better it tastes. Put meatballs in sauce and continue cooking over low heat a half an hour. Serve with pasta of course!

My very good friend from Italy gave me this recipe. I'll never make meatballs any other way,and her sauce is the best. I love her suggestion of baking the meatballs in a 12 cup muffin tin!
