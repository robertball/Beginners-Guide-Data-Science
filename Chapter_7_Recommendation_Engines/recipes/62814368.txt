8 ounces uncooked bow tie pasta
2/3 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
3 garlic cloves, sliced
1 can (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained, divided
1/2 cup fresh cilantro

Even people who don't like beans will compliment you on this delicious salad! It's a favorite at family get-togethers and potlucks. The slimmed-down dressing gets little kick from cilantro and lime. (From Taste of Home Magazine)
