Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
2 cups crushed potato chips
lollipop sticks from a craft or party store

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Crush potato chips onto a plate. In a large bowl, whisk together egg and milk. Dip the chicken cubes into the egg mixture, then coat well with potato chips. Spread the nuggets onto the baking sheet.
Bake for 10 minutes. Turn nuggets over, and bake for 10 minutes more, until golden brown. Remove baking sheet from oven, and insert a lollipop stick into each nugget.

Description: 
This is a fun recipe for a children's party...but found adults love it even more.  Experiment with various potato chip flavors.  I happen to like barbecue chips, but my husband enjoys the sour cream and onion variety. Serve with honey mustard dressing, ranch dressing, thousand island dressing or ketchup for dipping
