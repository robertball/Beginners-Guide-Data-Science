Ingredients:
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
6 eggs, separated
6 teaspoons rum

Directions:
Melt the chocolate slowly in a double boiler over simmering water. Remove from heat and beat egg yolks into chocolate with electric mixer.
Beat in rum, orange liqueur, or vanilla extract, if desired.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites to medium-stiff peaks. Stir a large spoonful of egg whites into the chocolate mixture to loosen. Then gently fold the remaining egg whites into the chocolate. Pour into serving glasses and chill in refrigerator until set, 4 to 5 hours. Will keep up to four days in refrigerator.

Description: 
Use a chocolate with a high cocoa content for best results.  Feel free to use whisky, orange liqueur or anything you fancy, really, instead of the rum.  This recipe can be made per person, using one ounce of chocolate and one egg for each. This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.
