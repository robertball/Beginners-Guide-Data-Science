Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, chopped
24 fluid ounces chicken broth
1 pound fresh asparagus spears, trimmed and halved crosswise
1 large Idaho potato, peeled and diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/3 cup heavy cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as TabascoÂ®), or to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Cook and stir onion in butter until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour chicken broth over onions and bring to a boil.
Stir in asparagus and potato; cover and cook until asparagus spears are tender, about 8 minutes.
Mix in jalapeno pepper.
Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.
Stir in heavy cream.
Season with salt, black pepper and hot sauce.
