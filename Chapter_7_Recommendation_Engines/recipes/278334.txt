Description: 
Adapted a traditional Amish macaroni salad recipe. Made this for July 4th weekend and there was not one ounce left the first night! Celery seed really makes this! Add more mayo or a bit of sour cream if it's not wet enough to your liking or after it's set. Rinse your pasta in cold water if you don't have time to let it cool. Don't put dressing on hot noodles--it dries out! Use your favorite pasta shape but I like the large shells as the peas get trapped inside.
