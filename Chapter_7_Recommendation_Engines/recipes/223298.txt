Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 boneless quarter-loin pork chops, fat trimmed and chops cut into 1-inch cubes
1 onion, sliced
1/2 head cabbage, coarsely chopped
1 (15.5 ounce) can Great Northern beans, drained
1/2 cup ketchup, or more to taste
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or stew pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir pork cubes with onion until pork is no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Stir cabbage into pork mixture and cover the pot; cook until cabbage is wilted, about 5 minutes. Mix in beans, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, and allspice. Cover pot and simmer until pork and cabbage are tender and the soup has thickened, about 45 minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This is a quick and nutritious recipe I created, or think I did, which my companion and I enjoy. Naturally, you may adjust any ingredients as you wish. I had to approximate the ketchup as I didn't want that to overwhelm this recipe. Due to my being a Southerner, I cook corn bread with this. I prefer pure olive oil to extra-virgin as it's not as fruity. Any oil will do.
