Ingredients:
3.5 pound skinless, boneless turkey breast
•	3/4 c olive brine
•	1/2 c buttermilk
•	1 sprig fresh rosemary
•	2 sprigs fresh thyme

Directions:
1.	Whisk together the brine and buttermilk. Put the turkey breast into a glass bowl and pour the brine/buttermilk into the bag. Add the rosemary and thyme sprigs. Put the zipped bag in the refrigerator for 8 hours.
2.	Take the bag out of the fridge and allow to rest until the breast reaches room temperature.
3.	Preheat an air fryer to 180°C. Cook the breast in the air fryer for 15 minutes. Flip over the breast and cook for 5 minutes. Check the internal temperature of the turkey. If it is 75°C, it is done. Otherwise, keep cooking at 5 minute intervals until the correct temperature is reached.

Description: 
An easy recipe for a savory, juicy turkey breast. Using olive brine gives the breast flavor and also keeps it tender. I use spicy Tabasco® Olive brine for extra kick. Serve with cranberry sauce.
