Ingredients:
2 cups ripe strawberries
1 cup water
1 cup fresh mint leaves
2 (17.5 ounce) cans coconut water
water
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons agave nectar
1/3 cup chia seeds

Directions:
Blend strawberries, 1 cup water, and mint leaves in a blender until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds; strain into a 2-quart pitcher. Stir coconut water, 1 cup water, lime juice, lemon juice, and agave nectar into the strawberry mixture.
Mix chia seeds in small increments into the strawberry mixture, stirring continually to keep from clumping together. Refrigerate mixture until chia seeds fully absorb the liquid, 30 minutes to overnight.

Description: 
Refreshing, healthy, and energizing drink containing coconut water for electrolytes and mint for a cool taste. Chia seeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Inspired by Mexican Chia Fresca and my love for mojitos! The juice can be drunk without waiting the 30 minutes, but the seeds might stick to the glass more. A juicer can be used to juice the strawberries and mint. Doing so will give more mint flavor and may require using less mint to begin with.
