1/2 cup 1% milk
1/4 cup fat free chicken broth
2 tbsp reduced fat sour cream
salt and pepper to taste
For the filling:
1 lb 93% lean ground turkey
1 tsp olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 cloves garlic, diced
10 oz frozen mixed vegetables
2 tbsp flour (leave out to make gluten-free)

Directions:
Boil sweet potatoes and garlic in a pot of salted water until cooked and soft. Drain and mash with chicken broth, sour cream, salt and pepper.
Preheat oven to 400°F.
In a large saute pan brown turkey; season with salt and pepper. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, celery and sauté about 5 minutes until celery is soft.
