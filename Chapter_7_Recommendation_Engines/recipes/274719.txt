Ingredients:
1 pound ground hot Italian sausage
1 bunch scallions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 (12 ounce) bags sliced okra
2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup water, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Combine sausage, scallions, and garlic in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until sausage is browned and crumbly and garlic and scallions have browned a bit, about 10 minutes. Mix in okra, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce until well combined.
Reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Add mushrooms, salt, and pepper; simmer for another 20 to 25 minutes, adding water if mixture begins to dry out.

Description: 
A spicy take on the classic okra and tomatoes, using RO*TEL® tomatoes with green chiles and hot ground sausage. Made this for a party awhile back and it was a hit. RO*TEL® tomatoes come in varied hotness. Pick your poison.
