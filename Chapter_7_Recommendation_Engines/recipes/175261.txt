Ingredients:
2 tablespoons reduced-fat mayonnaise
1 1/2 teaspoons wasabi paste
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
4 (6 ounce) yellowfin tuna fillets
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Directions:
Mix together the mayonnaise, wasabi paste, five-spice powder, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce in a small bowl.
Lay the tuna fillets into a glass baking dish. Pour the rice vinegar and 1 tablespoon soy sauce over the tuna. Spread the mayonnaise mixture evenly over both sides of each piece of fish. Cover the dish and refrigerate 15 to 30 minutes.
Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Sprinkle the sesame seeds evenly over both sides of the fillets. Lay the tuna gently into the skillet. Grill to desired level of doneness, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare. Serve immediately.
