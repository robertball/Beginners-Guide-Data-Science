Ingredients:
4 cups sliced fresh rhubarb (about 1/2 inch thick)
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
1 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crust
1/2 cup regular rolled oats
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon butter, melted
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss the rhubarb with 1 1/2 cups of sugar and the tapioca in a large bowl. Drizzle with the melted butter and toss again to coat. Pour the rhubarb into the pie crust, and set aside.
Mix together the oats, 1/4 cup sugar, flour, softened butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl until evenly blended. Sprinkle the oat topping over the rhubarb.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue baking until rhubarb is tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 30 minutes more. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
Rhubarb is sweetened and topped with a crunchy oat topping in this delicious and easy to make pie. A dear family friend always grew rhubarb and made this pie with her bounty each year.  People are skeptical when they hear it is a rhubarb pie without strawberries but after only one taste, they understand the magic of this pie. Serve with vanilla ice cream for added sweetness!
