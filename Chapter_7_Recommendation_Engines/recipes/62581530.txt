Ingredients:
6 slices Bacon (optional)
1 lb Sausage (optional)
2 tablespoons Finely chopped onion
6 cups Cubed cooked potatoes

6 Eggs, lightly beaten
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Parboil or microwave the potatoes.
While the potatoes are cooking, in a large heavy skillet, cook the bacon pieces &/or the sausage over moderate heat until crisp or browned. Remove the bacon/sausage to drain. Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of dripping.
Heat the drippings remaining in the pan until sizzling. Add the onion and potatoes; cook, stirring gently, until the potato cubes are browned.
While the vegetables are cooking, in a separate pan scramble-prepare the eggs.
Once the potatoes are browned, cover with the bacon &/or sausage. Sprinkle on the shredded cheese and top with scrambled eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately
