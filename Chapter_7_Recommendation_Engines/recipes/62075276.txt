Ingredients:
1 trifle sponge
1/2 cup sherry
strawberry jam
1 pkt strawberry or greengage jello
100g pecans, chopped (reserve about 8 for the decoration)
500ml milk
90ml custard powder
45ml sugar
250ml cream, whipped
glace cherries

Directions:
1. Make up jello according to packet instructions. Leave to set.
2. Make custard: Mix 90ml custard powder, 45ml sugar and 50ml milk and add to 450ml milk which has been brought to the boil, stirring well. Return to low heat, stirring continuously until it thickens. Sprinkle with sugar to prevent a skin forming, cover with plastic and leave to cool.
3. Cut trifle sponge into slices, spread thickly with strawberry jam and arrange slices on the bottom and around the edges of a large glass bowl. Sprinkle with sherry to taste.
4. Chop up strawberry jelly and mix in chopped pecans. Add in a layer on top of the sponge.
5. On top of the jelly, add the custard.
6. Finish off the trifle with a layer of whipped cream. Decorate with glace cherries and the remaining pecan halves. Chill for 1-2 hours before serving.

Description: 
My grandmother, of Irish/British descent, served this pudding every Christmas, New Year and Easter - and it was always a treat. Hers was famously sherry-sodden, but the ingredients can be varied to taste. The combination of the creamy custard and sponge together with refreshing jelly, sherry and nuts has to be tried to be truly appreciated. 
Also makes a great day-after breakfast!
