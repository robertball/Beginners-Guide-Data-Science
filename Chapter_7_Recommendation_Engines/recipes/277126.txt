Ingredients:
1 pound tri-color rotini pasta
1/2 pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons dry ranch dressing mix (such as Penzeys)
1 tablespoon dry chip and dip seasoning mix (such as Penzeys)
1 teaspoon dry Italian-style salad dressing mix (such as Penzeys)
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1 small head romaine, torn into bite-size pieces
1 large cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch chunks
1 avocado, cut into bite-size pieces (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
While pasta cooks, place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender-crisp, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain pasta and asparagus and chill until ready to use, at least 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, ranch dressing mix, dip mix, and Italian dressing mix in a bowl.
Assemble chilled rotini, asparagus, ham, romaine, cucumber, and avocado in a large bowl. Top with mayonnaise dressing mixture and toss. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving.
