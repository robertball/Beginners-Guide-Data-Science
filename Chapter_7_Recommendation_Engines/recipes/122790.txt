Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 cup chopped onion
1 garlic clove, minced
2 cups unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup apple juice
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine flour, salt if desired and pepper. Cut each tenderloin into six pieces; flatten to about 1-in. thickness. Melt butter in a large skillet. Dip pork into flour mixture; add to skillet and brown on both sides. Place in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. In the same skillet, saute onion and garlic until tender. Add remaining ingredients; bring to a boil. Pour over pork. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hour, or until the juices run clear and a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
