Ingredients:

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and stir in onions, garlic, and peppercorns. Saute until onions are tender. Mix in ginger, garam masala, turmeric, paprika, red pepper flakes, and salt. Stirring constantly, cook until onions are thoroughly coated with the seasonings.

This is a great side dish to spice up your vegetables. You can even use left over vegetables of any kind! Goes great with rice. You can alter the red pepper to get the desired spice level as well. My family loves it, and yours will too!
