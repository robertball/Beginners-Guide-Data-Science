Ingredients:
1 sheet (9 oz.) frozen puff pastry (thawed)
2 tbsp honey dijon mustard
3 oz. (about 1 cup) shredded gruyere
1/4 c grated parmesean
4 oz. very thinly sliced baked ham

Directions:
Heat oven to 425. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry to a 10 x 14 in rectangle. Using the back of a spoon, spread the pastry evenly with the mustard. Sprinkle on the gruyere and parm in an even layer.
Arrange ham in a single, even layer. Lay a piece of parchment or waxed paper on top and gently roll to compress the layer.  Gently peel off paper without disturbing the ham.
Cut the rectangle in half widthwise to make two 10x7 inch bands. Gently roll 1 long edge of band into the center and then roll the opposite edge in so the two rolls meet in the middle and resemble a double scroll. Press lightly to stick two roll together. Repeat with second band.
With a very sharp knife, slice each band into about 22 pieces, just under a 1/2 inch each. Arrange the palmiers on 2 parchment lined baking sheets and bake until a deep golden brown and no longer doughy in the center (break one open to be sure). 10- 12 minutes. Be careful not to let the bottoms burn.
Let cool on rack.
