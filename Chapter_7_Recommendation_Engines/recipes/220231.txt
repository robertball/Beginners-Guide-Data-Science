Ingredients:
1 (13.25 ounce) package dried whole wheat rotini pasta
2 (5 ounce) cans skinless, boneless salmon, drained
1 cucumber, thinly sliced
2 (5.3 ounce) containers Greek yogurt
2/3 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 Roma tomatoes, thinly sliced

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until rotini has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Transfer pasta to a large bowl.
Toss salmon and cucumber in with rotini, flaking the salmon as you stir.
Combine Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, dill, and onion powder in a small bowl.
Spoon yogurt mixture over rotini and gently combine.
Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Arrange slices of Roma tomatoes on the salad before serving.

Description: 
This is a great pasta salad for spring and summer when the weather is great and you don't want to spend it in the kitchen. It's very kid friendly too.
