Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
4 egg yolks, beaten
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
1 Tbsp strongly brewed coffee
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 pint whipping cream
1 tsp vanilla
3 Tbsp powdered sugar
1 Tbsp cold water
1 tsp unflavored gelatin

Directions:
In a microwave safe bowl, cream together egg yolks and sugar. Mix in cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt. Add milk and stir gently.
Put bowl into microwave.  Microwave for 1 minute at a time.  After each minute, remove bowl and quickly whisk.  Repeat until mixture starts to thicken (about 12 minutes in my small microwave).
Mix in butter or margarine and vanilla extract. Cool slightly, then pour mixture into pastry shell.  Chill.
For whipped topping: Put 1 Tbsp cold water in small microwave safe dish.  Sprinkle gelatin over the water.  Allow to absorb (about 1 min).  Put in microwave for 30 seconds.
Pour whipping cream into bowl of electric mixer.  Beat at low speed.  Gradually make your way up to high speed.
Add vanilla, gelatin, and powdered sugar.
Continue to whip until cream holds peaks.  Don't overwhip.
Top pie with whipped cream.  Chill & serve.
