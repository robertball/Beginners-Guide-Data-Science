Ingredients:
5 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and cut into hunks
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 celery heart with leafy tops, chopped
8 slices of bacon or 1 ham steak
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups half and half or cream
1 egg
1 to 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Chop the bacon or ham steak into bite size pieces. Brown bacon in a med to large frying pan until fat is rendered and bacon is crispy. Remove the meat from the pan.
Saute onions and celery in the bacon fat until soft.
Place the potatoes, meat, onion and celery into a large stockpot with the chicken broth. Add water to bring the liquid level to 1 inch above the vegetables. Add salt and pepper to taste. Simmer until the potatoes are fork tender.
Meanwhile, lightly scramble the egg in a medium sized mixing bowl. Add flour slowly to the egg, mixing with your fingers until a dry coarse crumbly texture is achieved. This must be a very very dry consistency. The dumplings will have a chewy texture.
With the soup simmering on medium begin adding the rivels a small handful at a time. Stir them in and continue adding in small batches until they are all incorporated. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add half and half or cream to the thickened soup and warm through. You can also use whole milk if you'd like to cut the fat. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
This is a different recipe with a very unique addition. In my family they are called rivels. These dry dumplings make this soup thick, rich and really stick-to-your-ribs delicious. You can make this a vegetarian recipe by replacing the meat with butter or margarine.
