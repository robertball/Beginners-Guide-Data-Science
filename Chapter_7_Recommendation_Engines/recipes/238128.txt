Ingredients:
3 cups whole milk, or more to taste
3 cups heavy whipping cream
3 cups white sugar
4 cinnamon sticks
4 tablespoons Indian-style plain black tea
3 tablespoons garam masala (Indian spice blend)
10 black peppercorns
6 cardamom pods
2 whole star anise pods
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate (optional)

Directions:
Mix whole milk, whipping cream, sugar, cinnamon sticks, tea, garam masala, peppercorns, cardamom pods, anise pods, and nutmeg together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. Strain mixture through a colander into a large bowl. Add up to 1 cup more milk to cut spice level and sweetness to your liking.
Pour milk mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Stir chocolate into the churned milk mixture and freeze, stirring occasionally, until soft and creamy, 4 to 5 hours.

Description: 
My husband and I love chai tea and decided to try making chai tea ice cream. We used Indian black tea and masala spices, but decided to add some of our own spices to increase the intensity of the flavor.
