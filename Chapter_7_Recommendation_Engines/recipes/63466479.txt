Ingredients:
1 cucumber
3-4 radishes
pinch of sea salt
pinch of course ground black pepper
Red wine vinaigrette, or your favorite vinaigrette salad dressing

Directions:
Peel a washed cucumber leaving a thin line of dark green skin on the edges in random stripes (the random dark green is decorative). Slice the cucumber as thinly as you can without it falling apart.
Cut off the tops and bottoms of washed radishes. Slice the radishes as thinly as possible preferably using a mandolin (a slicer). With a mandolin uou can get the radishes paper thin and not only are they easier to eat that way, they will be translucent and make for an impressive looking display.
Arrange them on a plate randomly alternating the cucumber with the radishes starting with the largest pieces and finishing at the top with the smallest.
Sprinkle with the pinch of sea salt and black pepper.
Splash it with red-wine vinaigrette to taste.
