Description: 
Mom won five dollars for this recipe in 1933 which bought us groceries. Everyone who partakes asks for recipe. We learned of their keeping value only when she sent them to troops in Korea. Before that none of the cookies had lasted long enough for us to know if they kept well! Store separated by wax paper. Substitute dates for the raisins if desired.
