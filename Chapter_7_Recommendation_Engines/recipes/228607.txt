1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 yellow onions, chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons white wine, or to taste
3 small potatoes, cut into long French fry-shaped strands
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
5 sausages, sliced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken stock
1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
3/4 pound cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined

Directions:
Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions, garlic, and white wine until onions and garlic are tender and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add potatoes and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and black pepper. Cover and cook until potatoes are slightly tender, about 10 minutes.
Stir sausage into onion-potato mixture; increase heat to high. Cover and cook until sausage is about halfway cooked, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock, tomato sauce, shrimp, roma tomatoes, cucumber, green chile peppers, chili powder, parsley, bay leaf, and celery seed; bring to a boil. Cover and cook until heated through, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors have blended and sausage is fully cooked, 45 minutes.
