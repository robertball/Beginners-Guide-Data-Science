Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 bunches green onions, sliced, white parts and tops separated
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
2 tablespoons sherry
2 cups uncooked long-grain rice
salt to taste
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups chicken broth
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 cup minced cilantro
1/2 cup minced parsley

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute the white parts of the green onions with the jalapenos for 5 minutes; do not brown.
Stir in the sherry, rice, salt and pepper.  Pour in the broth and water; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Fluff with a fork and stir in cilantro, parsley and tops of green onions.  Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve immediately.

I have changed this recipe off and on during the years, but generally it has remained the same wonderful dish. Add red bell pepper for additional color if you wish!
