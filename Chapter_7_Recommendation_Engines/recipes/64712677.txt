Ingredients:
1 cup Deglet Noor dates
1 cup hot water
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 large eggs
2 tsps vanilla extract
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
1. Place dates in a small bowl with the hot water. Allow to soak for 10-15 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and line an 8x8" baking pan with parchment paper, leaving enough paper to hang over the sides of the pan.
3. Remove dates from water and place into a food processor. Pulse until dates are completely smooth, about 1-2 minutes. If date paste is too thick, add in hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until dates are completely pureed.
4. Add softened butter into the food processor, and pulse to combine, about 30 seconds. Add in eggs and vanilla extract, and process until light a fluffy, about 1 minute.
5. Add whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt to the food processor. Pulse until mixture is just combined, about 30 seconds. Gently stir in chocolate chips by hand.
6. Pour batter into prepared baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges just begin to set. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove brownies from pan by gently lifting up on the edges of the parchment paper. Allow to cool completely on a cooling rack. Cut into 16 pieces.

Description: 
Using dates in place of sugar makes for a very fudgy and chocolate-y tasting brownie. These brownies are slightly cakey; so if you prefer a denser brownie, use only 1 egg instead of 2.
