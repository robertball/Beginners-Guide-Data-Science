Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 Tbsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp dried ancho chile powder
3/4 tsp dried oregano
1/2 cup chicken stock
4 skinless chicken thighs (about 3/4 lbs)
1 1/2 cups cooked hominy (about 1 can)
1 1/2 cups salsa

Directions:
Combine first 9 ingredients (through stock) in medium crock pot (I used a 3 1/2 quart - don't use anything bigger unless you plan to double the recipe).
Lay chicken on top of this mixture, and top with hominy and salsa.
Cover and cook on low for 6-7 hours.
Use two forks to pull apart the chicken, and remove bones if you used bone-in meat.

Description: 
I can always find chicken thighs on sale (the wife love dark meat) so I am always looking for new ways to prepare meals using them.
