Ingredients:
2 lbs tilapia fillets, rinsed and patted dry
1 1/2C long grain rice, uncooked
2 1/2C water
1/4 C white wine (or water)
1 t chicken boullion granules or chicken soup base
1/2 tsp dried parsley
1/2 tsp Old Bay ™ Seasoning
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp salt
lemon pepper seasoning, to taste (optional)
3 T butter, softened

Topping
1/4 c mayonnaise
4 T butter, softened
3 tsp lemon juice
1/2 C Panko bread crumbs, divided
1/4 tsp  Old Bay ™ Seasoning
1/4 tsp dried dill weed
lemon pepper seasoning, to taste (optional)
lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425.
Spray 9x13 baking pan with cooking spray, or 2tsp.olive oil.  Mix rice, herbs and seasonings, place in pan.  Cover with water & wine, carefully, so that the rice remains in an even layer, and dot with softened butter.  Place tilapia fillets in pan. Sprinkle with additional Old Bay ™ Seasoning, if desired.
Cover tightly with foil and bake at 425 for 25 minutes or until rice is done*, and tilapia flakes easily with a fork.
Turn your oven's broiler on high.
Topping:
Mix topping ingredients (less 1/4 C of the panko breadcrumbs) and spread evenly over filets.  Sprinkle remaining panko crumbs over filets and return to oven to broil until browned, watching carefully to avoid over-browning.
Serve with lemon wedges.
