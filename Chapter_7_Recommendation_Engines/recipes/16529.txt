Ingredients:
1 cup macaroni
1 (19 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained
4 tomatoes, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
1 cup pitted black olives
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook  8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse under cold water to chill, and drain.
Meanwhile, combine the chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, garlic, feta cheese, olives, salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside to marinate while the pasta is cooking.
Mix macaroni with chickpea mixture. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to blend flavors.
