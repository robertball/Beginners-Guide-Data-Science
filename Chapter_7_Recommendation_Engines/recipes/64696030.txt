Ingredients:
1 pound pasta - I like long fusilli best
4 carrots or a bunch of baby carrots chopped
1 zucchini chopped
1 yellow squash  chopped
5 cloves of garlic - leave whole but pressed
Parmesan cheese
Extra virgin olive oil
Red pepper flakes

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Cook macaroni until al dente.
Heat olive oil,
Sauté carrots for a few minutes.
Add zucchini, squash and garlic.
Add red pepper flakes.
Sauté veggies for a few minutes then add salt & black pepper.
Cover pot with lid to let veggies soften and help give up their liquid.
Add Parmesan cheese.
Stir in cooked macaroni.
Once the cheese and the macaroni have soaked up the liquid, it’s done.
Mangia!
