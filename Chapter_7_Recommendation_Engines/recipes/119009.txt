Ingredients:
1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated crusty French loaf dough
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 pound thinly sliced deli ham
1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
On a lightly floured surface, unroll dough at seam. Pat dough into a 14-in. x 12-in. rectangle. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over dough to within 1/2 in. of edges. Top with a single layer of ham. Roll up tightly from a short side; pinch seam to seal. Place seam side down on an ungreased baking sheet. Brush top of loaf with butter; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut with a serrated knife.

Description: 
'The original recipe for this savory bread called for salami, but I use ham instead,' writes Janice Brightwell of Jeffersonville, Indiana. 'People are always amazed that it only takes about 15 minutes to assemble. I usually serve it with tomato soup.'
