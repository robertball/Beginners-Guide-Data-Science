Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup molasses
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter, molasses, cocoa, 1/3 cup sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt together in a large bowl until well blended. Beat in flour on low speed just until blended; dough will be firm.
Form into 1-inch balls; roll in 1/4 cup sugar. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffy and cracked on top, 8 to 9 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
