Ingredients:
6 ounces Hatch chile peppers, halved and seeded
3 tablespoons corn oil
1 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups beef broth
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place chile peppers cut-side down on baking sheet.
Broil in the preheated oven until skin is heavily blistered and turning black, about 4 minutes per side.
Transfer chile peppers to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 15 minutes. Peel and chop the chile peppers.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in flour until mixture thickens. Stir in chopped chile peppers, beef broth, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
