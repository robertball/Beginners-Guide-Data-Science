Ingredients:
1 picked over turkey carcass
12 cups water
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
5 carrots
1 onion, quartered
2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cube chicken bouillon or chicken broth
1 bay leaf
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk
1 small rutabaga, cubed
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds cooked turkey, cubed
1/2 cup chopped parsley
2 slices white bread, quartered
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
4 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Combine turkey carcass, water, 1 cup celery, 2 carrots, onion, 2 teaspoons salt, thyme, bouillon, and bay leaf in large 4 quart stockpot.  Bring to boiling.  Lower heat, and cover.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  Strain stock, and discard solids.  Skim off fat using ladle or fat separator.  Pick meat off bones when cooled.  Reserve meat.
Combine 6 tablespoons flour and 1/2 cup milk in a jar with a tight fitting lid.  Shake to combine.  Pour stock into pot.  Bring to simmering.  Strain flour mixture through sieve into stock, stirring.
Slice remaining 3 carrots.  Add rutabaga, ground pepper, remaining 1/2 cup celery, and sliced carrots.  Simmer 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender.
While the soup is simmering, prepare the dumplings.  Combine parsley and bread in processor; whirl until medium size crumbs.  Add 1 1/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt; process just until combined.  Add 1/2 cup milk and butter; process using on-off pulses just until blended.
Drop mounded tablespoons of dumpling mixture into simmering soup. Place cover on pot.  Cook for 12 minutes, or until dumplings are dry in center.  Add turkey meat; cook 3 minutes, or until heated through.
