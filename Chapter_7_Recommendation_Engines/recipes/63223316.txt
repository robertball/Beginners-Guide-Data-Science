Ingredients:
1 cup water
1 tablespoon of extra finely ground coffee (powder consistency)
1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom, or 1 cardamom pod
sugar (optional)

Directions:
Bring water and sugar to a boil in ibrik. If you do not have an ibrik, a small saucepan will work.
Remove from heat and add coffee and cardamom.
Return saucepan to heat and allow to come to a boil. Remove from heat when coffee foams.
Again, return to heat, allowing to foam and remove from heat.
Pour into cup, and allow to sit for a few minutes for the grounds to settle to the bottom of the cup.
Cardamom pod may be served in cup for added flavor.

Description: 
Turkish coffee is famed for the way it is made. It is prepared in an ibrik, a small coffee pot that is heated. Sugar is added during the brewing process, not after, so the need for a serving spoon is eliminated. Cream or milk is never added to Turkish coffee, and sugar is optional. It is always served in demitasse cups. 
In some regions, your fortune is told by the placement of the coffee grinds left in the cup!
