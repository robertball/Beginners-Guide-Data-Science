Ingredients:
1 sweet potato (about one pound), peeled and cut into ¼ inch dice
? cup chopped shallots
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
2 tablespoon melted butter, divided
1 tablespoon minced garlic
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup Arborio rice
½ cup white wine
3 cups vegetable stock
½ cup Parmesan cheese grated
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
In a small baking pan place diced potato, shallots, 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 tablespoon of the butter, garlic, salt and pepper. Mix around and bake for 10 minutes. Flip mixture and bake for another 10 minutes.
While potato is cooking, in a medium pot, add last tablespoon of oil and butter and heat over medium high. Add rice and cook, moving rice around for 2-3 minutes, but do not brown. Add wine and stir. Reduce heat to medium to medium low. When wine has evaporated, begin adding stock one quarter cup at a time, waiting until each addition evaporates before adding the next.
Do not let rice get completely dry before adding each quarter cup.
Once the sweet potato is cooked, add to rice (at any stage of cooking) and continue cooking rice until all of the stock is gone and rice is cooked but not mushy. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan and parsley. Cover and let sit 3-5 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and the texture is creamy. Adjust seasoning and serve.
