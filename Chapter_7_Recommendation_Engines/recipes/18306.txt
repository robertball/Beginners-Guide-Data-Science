Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
3 (15 ounce) cans whole green beans, drained
1 (16 ounce) bottle French dressing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Slice bacon in half (easiest to slice whole package at once right down the middle). Bundle 6 to 7 green beans together and wrap one slice of bacon around the middle of the bundle. Secure with a toothpick. Arrange bundles in one layer in a baking dish. Pour French dressing over all of the bundles - make sure to drizzle some on each bundle.
Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for 30 minutes or until the bacon is done.
