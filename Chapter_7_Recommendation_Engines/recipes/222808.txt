Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
2 cloves garlic, pressed
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon mild curry paste (such as Patak'sÂ®)

Directions:
Pour enough oil into a frying pan to cover the bottom 1/3-inch deep; add garlic, cumin, salt, turmeric, and black pepper. Heat oil mixture over medium heat.
Cook and stir potatoes in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until cooked through, golden brown, and crisp on the outside, 10 to 15 minutes. Add fresh cilantro and curry paste and stir to coat. Fry until cilantro is dark green and crisp, about 1 more minute. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon and transfer to serving dish.

Description: 
Tasty fried curried potato cubes make a wonderful accompaniment to many Indian curry dishes. I don't know that this recipe is authentic in any way, I came up with it making use of what I had around. It turned out great and I got sent to the kitchen to make more. Serve with tamarind chutney for dipping.
