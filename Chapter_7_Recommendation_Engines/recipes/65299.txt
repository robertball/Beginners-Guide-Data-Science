Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoons dry mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 pound halibut fillets, cubed
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 (2.8 ounce) can French-fried onions

Directions:
In a shallow dish, mix the olive oil, butter, lemon juice, dry mustard, salt, and pepper. Place the cubed halibut in the dish, and allow to marinate for 45 minutes in the refrigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer the halibut and marinade mixture to a casserole dish. Spread the sour cream over the halibut, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, and top with French fried onions.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork and marinade mixture is bubbly.

Description: 
I ate this at a party given by some friends of my uncle's. They had been to Alaska on a fishing trip and had come back with TONS of salmon and halibut. This is one of the yummiest things I have ever eaten!
