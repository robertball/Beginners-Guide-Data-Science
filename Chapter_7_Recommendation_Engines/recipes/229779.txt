Ingredients:
2 eggs, slightly beaten
2 cups white sugar
1 cup solid pack pumpkin
1/2 cup corn oil
2 tablespoons orange zest
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups cranberries, halved

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat eggs, sugar, pumpkin, corn oil, and orange zest in a small mixing bowl until smooth.
Mix flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl with a fork. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour pumpkin mixture into the well; stir until the dry mixture is just moistened into a batter. Fold cranberries into the batter.
Scoop batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
I have been making these for years. I used to make them in bread form, but having 7 children it was just easier to dole out a muffin than cut up the messy loaf. I also began giving these out as Christmas food gifts. This was requested by my 17-year-old son for our dessert we have to bring to his football banquet. My 21-year-old daughter who moved to Ogden, Utah with her husband and 2 kids wants to make these muffins for her in-laws who will be spending the Thanksgiving holidays with them.
