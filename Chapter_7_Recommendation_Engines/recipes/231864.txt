Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup rice flour
1/4 cup stevia powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt
3 ripe bananas, mashed
3/4 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
3/4 cup pine nuts (optional)
1/4 cup flax seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
Mix all-purpose flour, rice flour, stevia powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Beat bananas, almond milk, vegetable oil, and egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; fold in pine nuts and flax seeds. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour.
