Ingredients:
4 boneless pork loin chops, butterflied
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup chicken broth
3 tablespoons prepared Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium heat while preparing chops. Rub both sides of the chops with oil and season with rosemary, salt and pepper. Whisk broth, mustard, brown sugar and lemon juice in a small bowl; set aside.
A couple of minutes from cooking, increase heat under skillet to medium-high. Add chops to skillet; saute, weighting the chops with a second, smaller skillet and turning them once, until well browned on both sides and cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chops from skillet and add mustard mixture to the hot skillet; simmer until reduced to  sauce consistency, 1 to 2 minutes.
Serve chops with a spoonful of sauce.
