Description: 
I'm not going to lie, my Chocolate Chip Cookie Cupcakes are still my favorite, but these are a VERY close second AND you don't have to wait for anything to freeze so they provide almost instant gratification, which makes me happy.  Instantly. The very center of the brownie layer remains slightly gooey to give you that decadent brownie indulgence!
