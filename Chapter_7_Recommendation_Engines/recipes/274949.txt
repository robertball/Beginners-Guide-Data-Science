Ingredients:
1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup coconut water
1 teaspoon maple syrup
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 dash sesame oil
1 shallot, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Clean the shrimp by placing them in a bowl and rinsing them with water. Drain. Add salt and rub into shrimp thoroughly. Rinse well again. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Heat sugar in a heavy pot over medium-low heat and stir until melted. Once sugar begins to caramelize, pour in coconut water, using caution so it does not splatter. Pour in maple syrup. Stir until sugar syrup is well combined and smooth. Remove pot from heat and set aside.
Warm olive oil and sesame oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and cook until shallot is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add fish sauce and sugar syrup; stir for 1 to 2 minutes.
Add shrimp to the saucepan and cook, turning them in the syrup, until shrimp turn pink and are well cooked, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle chives over shrimp.
