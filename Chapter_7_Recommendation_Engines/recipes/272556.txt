Ingredients:
3 pounds lamb shanks, on the bone
1 (32 fluid ounce) container Thai culinary stock
1 (14 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
12 ounces fire-roasted tomatoes
1 tablespoon red curry powder
1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt to taste
1 head cauliflower, chopped
3 medium red potatoes, quartered
1 cup frozen peas

Directions:
Place lamb shanks, culinary stock, coconut milk, tomatoes, curry powder, red pepper, and salt together in the bottom of a slow cooker. Cook on High until lamb is tender and juices run clear when pierced with a knife, about 3 hours.
Skim the fat off of the top of the mixture. Mix in cauliflower, potatoes, and peas. Switch to Low and cook until vegetables are tender, about 3 hours more. Remove lamb meat from bones. Return meat to the slow cooker; discard bones.
