Ingredients:
2 pounds extra lean ground beef
2 onions, finely chopped
1 quart water
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons ground allspice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 bay leaves
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 ounce unsweetened baking chocolate

Directions:
Cook the beef and onion in a large skillet over medium high heat, breaking up beef into tiny pieces, just until meat is no longer pink. Drain and place in a large Dutch oven or slow cooker. Stir in the water, garlic, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, tomato sauce, and chocolate. Simmer over medium low heat for 3 to 5 hours.

Description: 
I have searched far and wide for a recipe that compares to Goldstar or Skyline chili, to no avail. Finally, I took a number of decent recipes and blended them together with the help of a former Goldstar Chili employee. It's still not the same, but it feeds my cravings. The most important things about the chili is how you prepare the beef and the cinnamon and chocolate. I recommend refrigerating the chili overnight. It always tastes better the next day.
