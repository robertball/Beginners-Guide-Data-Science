Ingredients:
1 pound of fresh strawberries
1 tablespoon white sugar
1/2 cup low fat cinnamon graham cracker crumbs
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 tablespoon brown sugar
12 ounces of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup light sour cream
2/3 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 cup fat free whipped topping
mint springs, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Slice the strawberries into a bowl and sprinkle with one tablespoon of sugar.  Toss and set aside.
Mix the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and one tablespoon of brown sugar.
Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the sour cream, powdered sugar and beat until combined.
In another bowl, whip the cream until stiff peaks form.  Fold into the cream cheese mixture.
Assemble Parfaits:
Place about a tablespoon of the graham cracker "crust" in the bottom of your glasses.  Layer some of the cheesecake filling in the glasses, then some of the strawberry topping and sprinkle some more of the graham cracker on top.  (Amounts will vary according to how many parfaits you are making, so just adjust accordingly). Repeat layers and top with mint.
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
