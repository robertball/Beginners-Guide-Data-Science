1/2 pound spaghetti or similar long noodles
Salt

2 Tbsp. olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced

1 tsp. pickled green peppercorns, minced (optional)
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
1/4 cup parsley, finely chopped

Directions:
Bring large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 Tbsp. salt and cook pasta until tender to the bite or according to the package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid and drain pasta.
Meanwhile, in a large saute pan or second pot, heat oil over medium heat. Cook the bacon or pancetta until crisp, if using. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add pepper flakes and stir to combine.
Add olives, capers, and peppercorns, if using. Stir to combine. Add cauliflower florets and the reserved pasta-cooking liquid. Cover and simmer until cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes.
