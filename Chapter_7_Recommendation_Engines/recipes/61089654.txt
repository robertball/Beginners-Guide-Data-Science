Ingredients:
9 cups water
8 cubes vegetable or chicken bouillon, crumbled
28-30 oz. potatoes, cubed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large white onion, chopped
1 bunch celery, chopped
4 cups chopped carrots
2 (15 ounce) cans whole kernel corn
2 (15 ounce) cans peas
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 cups milk
12 oz. processed cheese, cubed

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine water, bouillon, potatoes and garlic.  Bring to a boil, then stir in onion, celery and carrots.  Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in corn, peas and green beans and continue to cook on low heat.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter.  Whisk in flour all at once to form a roux and let cook 10 seconds.  Whisk in milk, a little at a time, and cook, stirring, until mixture is thick and bubbly.  Stir in cheese until melted.  Pour this mixture into the large soup pot, stir well and heat through.
