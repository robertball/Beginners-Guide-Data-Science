Description: 
I have made this for over 16+ years.  It is a way to doctor up the normal boxed cheese cake mixes.  It is very rich and I get requests for it when potlucks come around.  I Chill it over night for a good set-up.  I have made this with a variety of pie fillings Peach, Cherry, Blueberry, Apple and am currently trying to find Blackberry or Raspberry pie filling to go on top.  I have even thought about melting caramels and swirling that on top as well.  You can be creative in your toppings. It is quick and easy to make I hope you enjoy it.
