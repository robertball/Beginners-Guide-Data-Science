Ingredients:
2 cups Blue Cheese dressing
1 cup hot sauce( I like Louisiana hot sauce)
1/3 cup of Molasses or Honey
1/2 cup onions
1/2 cup green bell pepper
4 garlic gloves
1 teaspoon of mesquite flavored liquid smoke
2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons of season all(any kind will do)
30-35 wings or drummettes

Directions:
Season the chicken with cayenne pepper and season all.  Put on a baking pan at 375 degrees and let cook until crispy, turning over once.  While your chicken is baking in a medium sauce pan add hot sauce, liquid smoke and molasses.  Put on medium low heat and add the onions, bell pepper and garlic and allow to simmer until tender.  Add the blue cheese dressing and stir until well blended.  Let cook for 5 minutes.  Once chicken is done place on a plate with papertowels to soak up any grease, then return to baking pan and pour sauce evenly over the wings.  Use a spatula to turn them over and be sure to get both sides.  Put back in oven for about 20 minutes to let the sauce soak.  Once done take out, allow to briefly cool and enjoy!
