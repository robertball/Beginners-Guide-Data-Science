Ingredients:
bread:
2/3 cup water
2 cups bread flour
2 tsp parsley
3/4 tsp salt
1 T olive oil
1 tsp crushed garlic
1 1/2 tsp sugar
1 1/4 tsp bread machine yeast
(can also add oregano, italian seasonings, onion powder to taste)
filling/topping:
shredded mozzarella cheese
parmesean cheese
olive oil
garlic powder

Directions:
Place the bread ingredients in order recommended by bread machine manufacturer.
Select dough/manual cycle to knead bread.
Once bread machine is done, remove bread from the machine, using floured hands.  Cover with a towel and let sit for 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface.
Grease a large cookie sheet.  Roll or pat dough into a 15x9" rectangle:  place on cookie sheet.  Sprinkle cheeses on one half of the dough.  Fold over half of the dough and pinch to seal edges together.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for 15-20 minutes, or until almost double.
Heat oven to 375.  Mix the olive oil, garlic powder & parmesan cheese to taste, and brush over the bread.  Bake for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from cookie sheet to wire rack and cool at least 10 minutes (cheese gets hot!).  Cut into breadsticks.

I took a combination of a few breadstick recipes I had found and created my own cheesy garlic bread that my fiancee can't get enough of.  Enjoy :)
