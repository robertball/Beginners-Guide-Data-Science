Ingredients:
2 1/2 tablespoons butter (divided)
2 1/2 tablespoons plain flour
4 cups fish stock or 4 to 5 cups vegetable stock
1 medium carrot, finely chopped in strips
1 to 2 cups leeks, finely chopped in strips
1 to 2 potatoes, peeled and cut into small cubes
1(14 ounce) can chopped tomatoes (optional)
12 peeled raw shrimp (approx) or 4 jumbo cut up
12 mussels (approx) or 12 small scallops (approx) or 4 large scallops, cut in quarters
6 ounces Norwegian cat fish (wolf fish) (or white fish of your own choice--haddock or cod)
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper
2 tablespoons sour cream (optional)
2 teaspoons lumpfish caviar (optional)

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, add the flour, stir for about 2 minutes without browning the flour.
Add the fish stock at intervals, stirring all the time, let it boil gently for 5-10 minutes.
Melt the rest of the butter and sauté the carrots and leeks and potatoes, if using, for approx 10 minutes.
Add the sautéed vegetables and tomatoes (if using) to the stock and simmer for another 5 minutes, then add the seafood.
Simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the fish and shellfish are tender.
Add the cream and warm the soup without boiling.
Add the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.
Serve garnished with sour cream and lumpfish caviar,  if you wish. A good hearty bread like the bread they make in Scandinavia goes wonderfully with this hearty soup.
