Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1 onion, chopped

1/4 cup cocktail sauce

Directions:

Description: 
I made this on a whim. I just had these things on hand. This is a wonderful combination of eggs, cocktail sauce, and shrimp.  It is an interesting mixture of tastes that you wouldn't think would go together, but they do. This goes together very quickly, if you have everything ready to go. This sauce becomes sweet when you cook it. Also I made my own cocktail sauce, but you could use a pre-made sauce. You can cook the eggs in butter instead of oil if desired. Garnish with lemon and parsley.
