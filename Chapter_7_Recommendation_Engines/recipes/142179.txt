Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup uncooked quinoa
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1/2 cup broccoli florets
1/2 cup diced firm tofu
1/4 cup vegetable broth
1/4 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup chopped fresh spinach

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup vegetable stock to a boil. Stir in the quinoa and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
While quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, broccoli florets, and tofu. Stir for a minute, then cover and steam over low heat for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup vegetable broth, mushrooms, and spinach. Cover and cook over medium heat until the mushrooms are soft and spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes.
Stir the vegetable-tofu mixture into the cooked quinoa. Cover, and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I blundered into this delicious mix of ingredients while trying to use up leftover vegetables in the fridge. Even friends who 'don't like vegetarian cooking' have enjoyed it. I like the slightly bitter taste of unwashed quinoa (just check for unwanted debris before you use it), but most recipes call for rinsed quinoa.
