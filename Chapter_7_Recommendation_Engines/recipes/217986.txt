Ingredients:
3 cups canola oil for frying
2 green plantains, peeled and shredded
2 teaspoons garlic salt

Directions:
Heat canola oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Gather about 2 tablespoons of shredded plantains and shape into patties.
Fry the patties in the preheated oil until golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with garlic salt.

Description: 
Another quick and fun way of preparing green plantains, aranitas (little spiders) come out really crunchy and look so pretty on the plate. Remember to season them as soon as they come out of the oil. Traditionally served with mayo-ketchup (1:1 ratio blend of mayonnaise and ketchup with fresh pressed garlic or garlic powder to taste).
