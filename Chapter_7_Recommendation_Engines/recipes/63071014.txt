Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon orange zest
2 cups fresh blueberries
2 eggs, large
1 1/4 cups low-fat (1%) buttermilk
1/2 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon orange juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Place the rack in the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F. Line muffin tins with paper liners.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and orange zest. Add the fresh blueberries and toss gently to coat the blueberries in flour. This will help keep the blueberries suspended in the batter versus falling to the bottom.
In a medium mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then whisk in the buttermilk, brown sugar, canola oil, orange juice, and vanilla. Don’t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled or lumpy.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until most of the flour is incorporated. The mixture can be slightly lumpy; don’t over mix. Divide the batter among the 18 prepared muffin cups.
Bake 12 to 14 minutes, until the muffins are golden brown around the edges.

Description: 
If you buy a blueberry muffin at a coffee shop, you’ll likely be buying a muffin that weighs 5 ounces, contains 450 calories, and is made with refined flour and lots of added sugar. The muffins from this recipe weigh about 2 ounces, contain 130 calories, and are made with a mixture of whole wheat, white, and almond flour. (You don’t need to buy almond flour; you can make your own almond flour by grinding whole almonds in your food processor.)
