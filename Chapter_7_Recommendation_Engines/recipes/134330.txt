Ingredients:
10 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed
1/2 cup grapeseed oil or olive oil
1 1/2 pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cacho de cabra pepper, or Anaheim pepper, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
3 tablespoons pisco or brandy
salt to taste
cayenne pepper to taste
1 lime, cut into wedges, for serving

Directions:
Place the garlic cloves and grapeseed oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Let the garlic slowly turn golden brown as the oil becomes hot; continue cooking until the garlic has turned golden-brown, and the oil is quite hot.
Add the shrimp, stir to coat with oil, and cook for 15 seconds before stirring in the chile pepper. Continue to cook until shrimp is pink and firm. Pour in pisco, and cook for 30 seconds to let the alcohol evaporate. Season with salt to taste, then pour the mixture into a serving dish. Serve sprinkled with cayenne pepper, and garnished with lime wedges.
