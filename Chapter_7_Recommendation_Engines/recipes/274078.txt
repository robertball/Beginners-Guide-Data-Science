Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup butter
12 large marshmallows
3/4 cup cherry baking chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup peanut butter
2 teaspoons butter, divided
10 ounces crushed peanuts

Directions:
Bring sugar, evaporated milk, and 1/2 cup butter to a rolling boil over high heat in a pot. Remove from heat. Add marshmallows, cherry chips, and vanilla extract; stir until fully incorporated. Set aside to cool.
Melt chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave. Add peanut butter and 1 teaspoon butter; mix until smooth. Mix in crushed peanuts until fully coated.
Pour 1/2 of the chocolate mixture into a buttered 9x13-inch pan, making sure to completely cover the bottom. Pour cherry filling mixture on top of chocolate and spread to cover. Top with remaining chocolate mixture. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Cut into bars.

Description: 
This is a homemade version of the Twin BingÂ® candy bars from the 60s. They are rich and sweet and a small piece is a nice treat. These really are like candy, so cut in small pieces. A 1-inch square is sufficient! Store in a cool place in an airtight container, separating layers with waxed paper.
