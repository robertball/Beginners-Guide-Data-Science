Ingredients:
1 Large can of pie filling of your
choice
1 cup of real fruit added to pie
filling
1 Box of Jiffy yellow cake mix
1 stick of butter
1/4 cup of brown sugar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Empty a can of pie filling into a baking dish then add fresh to it.  For example peach pie filling and a couple sliced fresh peaches.
Brown sugar if you think it will go with fruit.  I would use it with peaches but not blueberries.
Place boxed cake mix on top of fruit.  Cut up the stick of butter to make little pats and place them on the top of the cobbler.
Cook in a 350 oven for 45 minutes or until brown and bubbly.
