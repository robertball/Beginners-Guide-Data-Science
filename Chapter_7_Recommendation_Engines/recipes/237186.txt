Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
2 tablespoons sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup tomato sauce
4 ciabatta rolls, split
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
8 slices hot Genoa salami
8 slices roasted ham
2 tablespoons diced red onion
2 tablespoons chopped roasted red pepper
2 tablespoons chopped black olives
4 leaves basil, chopped
4 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat; add mushrooms and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat to cool.
Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.
Spread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each ciabatta roll. Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each roll; top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms, red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and spread evenly atop the meats. Finish by topping with provolone cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.
Cook sandwiches on preheated panini press until there are dark brown grill marks on the bread, the cheese is melted, and the center is warm, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
Paninis make a boring sandwich a gourmet meal. Pizza is a classic dish and can also sometimes become routine. A grilled pizza panini is a creative way to jazz up the boring sandwich and predictable pizza. Great to heat up as leftovers also for lunch the next day!
