Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
8 slices turkey bacon
1 (8 ounce) package fat-free cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1/4 cup lowfat cottage cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add cauliflower, bring back to a boil, and cook over medium heat until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl.
Line a microwave-safe plate with paper towels; arrange turkey bacon on the paper towels. Top with more paper towels. Microwave on high until bacon is crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Cool and crumble.
Mix cauliflower with crumbled bacon, cream cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese using an electric mixer until evenly combined. Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted on top, 15 to 20 minutes.
