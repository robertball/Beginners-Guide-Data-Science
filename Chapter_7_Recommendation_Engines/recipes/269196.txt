Ingredients:
2 pounds breakfast sausage
2 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 cube beef bouillon, crushed (optional)
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups almond milk, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Break sausage apart in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce to the mix and let it heat up before adding beef bouillon and nutmeg. Stir and cook sausage until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes more.
Reduce heat to medium low and sprinkle in flour gradually. Cook, stirring constantly, until flour coats the sausage and is completely absorbed. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.
Pour in almond milk gradually, stirring constantly until gravy starts to thicken, up to 12 minutes. Add a little more almond milk if too thick. Season with salt and pepper. Continue stirring vigorously until gravy reaches desired thickness. Remove from heat and let cool. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.

Description: 
Fairly basic, large-batch sausage gravy recipe that I've developed over time. The family loves it every time, so the large batch is needed! Normally I'd use soy milk for most things, but I've found that in greater quantities it tends to froth badly. Almond milk does not have this problem though! Serve over warmed biscuits or toasted bread of your choice.
