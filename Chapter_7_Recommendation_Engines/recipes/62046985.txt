Ingredients:
2 cans (4.25 oz.) deviled ham
2 tbsp. finely chopped onion
2 tbsp. mayonnaise
4 oz. cream cheese
1/2 cup crushed pineapple, drained
8 slices white bread, crusts removed
4 slices wheat bread, crusts removed
Butter or margarine

Directions:
Flatten bread slices with rolling pin to 1/4 inch thickness.  Spread each slice with margarine or butter.  Combine ham, mayo and onion in a bowl and set aside.  Combine cream cheese and pineapple in another bowl and set that aside, as well.  Spread a thin layer of deviled ham mixture over one white bread slice and cover with a slice of wheat, buttered side down.  Spread a thin layer of cream cheese mixture over that, and cover with another slice of white bread, buttered side down (you should have a three layer sandwich).  Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate.  Repeat until you have four sandwiches.  After chilling for two hours, cut each sandwich into 4 triangles.

Description: 
These tea sandwiches are popular in England and were served to my grandfather when he lived there.  A little bit of extra work, but great to serve to guests.  You can also get creative with the fillings.  The possiblities are endless!
