Ingredients:
64oz beef bone broth or beef stock (sugar free) or beef broth (sugar free)
2lb 90/10 or 95/5 ground beef
6 Cloves of garlic, minced
1 yellow onion, chopped
6 potatoes, peeled and chopped in bite sized pieces (I used russets but this is your choice)
1 cup of carrots, peeled and chopped
1/2 a cabbage, chopped
1 cup of green beans, chopped
2 small zucchinis, chopped
1 teaspoon basil (or to taste)
1 teaspoon oregano (or to taste)
salt (to taste)
black pepper (to taste)
cooking oil of your choice (I use ghee or Epic organic pork fat)
2 tablespoons of tomato paste (optional)

Directions:
In a large stew pot, heat up 1 tsp of oil and brown your ground beef with salt and pepper (to taste)
Leave the oil in the pot and set your ground beef aside
Saute the garlic and onion in the oil until the onions start to go transparent (add more oil if needed but heat well before adding onions and garlic)
Leave the oil in the pot and set aside the onions and garlic with the ground beef
Saute your potatoes in the seasoned oil, adding salt and pepper to taste, for 3-5 minutes
Add the carrots and saute for an additional 1-2 minutes
Add the ground beef, onions and garlic back to the pot and mix it all together
Add the broth, basil and oregano (and tomato paste if you like) and bring to a boil
Add cabbage and let simmer for about 5 minutes
Check your broth and see if there is anything else you would like to add for seasoning (I like to add some smoked sea salt at this point)
Add the green beans and zucchini and let simmer an additional 3-5 minutes (or until the vegetables reach the tenderness you like)
Enjoy!
