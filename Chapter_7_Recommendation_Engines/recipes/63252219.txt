Ingredients:
2-1/2 pounds lean boneless pork, cut into 1-inch cubes (you can use pork chops with bones...just remove them.)
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 garlic clove (minced)
1 1/2 cups onion (chopped)
1 can (14 1/2 ounces) no-salt-added diced tomatoes, (with juice)
1 to 2 cans (4 ounces each) chopped green chilies
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup grated Mexican Blend cheese (Monterrey Jack and Cheddar).

Directions:
In a large DUTCH OVEN over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of oil until hot.
Dust pork pieces in flour until covered and add to Dutch oven; browning all sides well.
Add onion and garlic - saute until tender.
Stir in canned tomatoes (with juice), green chilies, and cilantro; cover and simmer for 40 minutes or until pork is tender and no longer pink.
If stew appears thin, then in a separate container, mix cornstarch and water together and slowly add to stew over medium heat until thickened.
Allow to rest for 10-15 minutes, then ladle into bowls.
Top with cheese and chopped cilantro as desired.

Description: 
Here's my version of a traditional Mexican Guisado de Puerco en Chile Verde (Green Chile and Pork stew). It is bursting with flavor, and is mildly-spicy. Serve with hot corn or flour tortillas with butter.
