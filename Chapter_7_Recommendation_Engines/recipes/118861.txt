Ingredients:
1 cup cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1 cup fat-free milk
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
3/4 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped*

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the egg, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in the spinach, cheese and jalapenos.
Coat muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray; fill two-third full with batter. Bake at 400 degrees F for 18-22 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 2 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
