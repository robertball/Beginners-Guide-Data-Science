Ingredients:
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup vinegar
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 tsp. paprika
radiatorre or rotini pasta
tomatoes, chopped
cucumbers, chopped
green onions, sliced
red or green peppers, chopped (optional)

Directions:
Heat the sugar, oil, ketchup, vinegar, salt, pepper and paprika in microwave, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved.
Cool dressing in fridge.
Cook the pasta to el dente.
Drain and rinse with cold water.
Add the veggies.
Toss with cooled dressing.
Refrigerate. It tastes even better if it has a few hours or more to marinate.

Description: 
I like to make this salad a few hours to a day early so it has a chance to marinate. Change up the pasta shapes for fun. One of my daughter's favorites :)
