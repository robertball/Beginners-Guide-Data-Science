Description: 
This is a salad my great grandma use to make and is one of my favorites to eat during the holiday season.  Most people make this creamy by melting the cream cheese or dissolving it in the juice.  We actually add small chunks of the cheese after the mix has cooled.  So you have a clear jello with little white chunks in it.  So good!
