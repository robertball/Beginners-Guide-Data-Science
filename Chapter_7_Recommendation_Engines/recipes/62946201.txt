Description: 
Salad/Tacos, Yummy! A family favorite. I made this recipe up many years ago, and didn't have much meat on hand. A couple of friends were coming and we all had small childern. This is what I came up with. Worked out great, everyone loved it.

I like to use lots of lettuce and tomatoes for more of a salad type meal. I also reserve a few chips to keep the crunch towards the end...
