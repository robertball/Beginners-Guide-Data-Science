Ingredients:
2 cups diced ham
2 cups shredded Swiss or Cheddar cheese
2/3 cup chopped green onion
2 cups diced asparagus
3 cups milk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
7 eggs, lightly whisked

Directions:
Lightly grease or spray a 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking dish. Layer ham, cheese, green onion and asparagus in dish.
Whisk milk into baking mix a little at a time so mixture doesn't get lumpy. Whisk in eggs just until blended. Pour mixture carefully over ingredients in baking dish.
Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until puffed and golden brown, and a knife inserted in centre comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
