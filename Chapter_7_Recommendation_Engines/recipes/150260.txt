Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons peanut oil
1 tablespoon chipotle chile powder
1/2 tablespoon red curry powder
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 pound lean beef sirloin tip, sliced into 1/8 inch strips
1 cup peanut satay sauce (such as A Taste of Thaiâ„¢ Peanut Satay Sauce)

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, vinegar, peanut oil, chipotle chile powder, red curry powder and sea salt. Add the meat to the mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to marinate.
Preheat your oven's broiler. Thread the meat onto skewers. Pour any leftover sauce into a small saucepan or microwave safe dish. Bring the sauce to a boil, and cook for a few minutes.
Broil the skewers, turning frequently, for about 10 minutes, or until meat reaches your desired degree of doneness. Baste frequently with the sauce. Serve with Thai peanut sauce for dipping.
