Ingredients:
1/2 (13.5 ounce) can chopped spinach
1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 Roma tomato, diced (optional)
1/2 cup water

Directions:
Puree spinach in food processor until smooth.
Whisk spinach, Alfredo sauce, artichoke hearts, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, garlic, and tomato together in a pot.
Pour water into Alfredo sauce jar and top with lid. Shake water in jar to release last remnants of Alfredo sauce, and stir into pot with Alfredo sauce mixture.
Cook Alfredo sauce mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until cheeses have melted and sauce is bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
A yummy dish I came up with over a batch of spinach artichoke dip. Serve over hot pasta immediately with French bread. If you prefer a pasta sauce that is not so chunky, process artichokes in food processor. Instead of a 1/2 cup of water use 1 cup water or add a second jar of Alfredo sauce.
