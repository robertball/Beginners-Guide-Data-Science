Ingredients:
1/2 cup of sugar (or more, this is for the caramel)
6 eggs
8 oz cream cheese (1 brick)
1 can of sweetened condensed milk
1 can of evaporated milk
1 bag of Goya frozen mango pulp, thawed
1/4 cup of sugar
1/8 tsp salt

Directions:
1. Melt the sugar and coat the bottom of the pan where the flan will be cooked. Or you can use the other method where you put sugar and water in a pan and cook it down until the water is all evaporated. IF YOU HAVE NEVER MADE FLAN AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS: Ask someone who knows to explain it to you, or look for detailed instructions on the Internet. It is a simple process but you have to know what you are doing.
2. In a blender, mix all of the other ingredients and process until velvety smooth. Pour into the mold that has already been coated with the caramel.
3. Place that mold inside a bigger mold (need at least 1 inch of difference all around) and pour water into the bigger one. This method of baking is called a 'baño de maría' or baine marie.
4. Bake at 350F for about 1 hour or so.. it is done when a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. the top will turn golden brown and puff up a bit but that will go down when it cools.
5. Let it cool completely and unmold carefully so you can catch all of the caramel juice.
