Rhubarb Custard Cake •1 2-layer yellow cake mix (and the water, oil, and eggs for the mix) •4 c chopped rhubarb •1 c sugar •1 pint whipping cream (2 cups) or use 1 cup cream and 1 cup evaporated milk -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- •Preheat oven to 350° •Grease and flour a 13x9 inch pan,I used a glass pan

Directions:
•Prepare cake mix as directed on package directions (using water,oil, and eggs); turn into prepared pan •Spread chopped rhubarb evenly over top of cake batter •Sprinkle sugar evenly over rhubarb •Pour cream (unwhipped) evenly over sugar •Bake in the preheated oven 50-60 min, or until cake tests done (springs back when lightly touched) •When baked, the cream, sugar, and rhubarb sink to the bottom, cake rises forming a custard layer under cake
