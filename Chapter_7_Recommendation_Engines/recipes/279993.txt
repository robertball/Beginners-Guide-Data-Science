Description: 
Vegetable broth made easy with the help of your multi-functional pressure cooker. No need to stand watch over a stove when you can throw it all in and go using this method. The best part is that you know exactly what went into it and also that you can use vegetables that are getting old and in need of using. This recipe is perfect for soup of for adding flavor to pasta and rice dishes. Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
