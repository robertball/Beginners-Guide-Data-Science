Tri Color Slaw Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 head green cabbage, cored
1 head red cabbage, cored
1 pound carrots, peeled and shredded
1 large bunch cilantro, leaves roughly chopped
3 limes, juiced (about 1/3 cup)
2/3 cup neutral oil, such as peanut or safflower
1 to 2 teaspoon sugar
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

Directions:
Shred the cabbage finely in using a chef's knife, a mandoline, or a food processor's shredding blad. In a very large bowl, toss together the shredded cabbage with the shredded carrots and chopped cilantro.
Whisk the lime juice and oil together in a bowl or measuring cup, and whisk in the sugar. Toss with the slaw, and season generously with salt and pepper (it may need more than you think it will at first, and this salad definitely needs its salt!).
Best served within a day or two, cold from the fridge, but you can refrigerate it for up to 3 days or until it loses its crispness.
