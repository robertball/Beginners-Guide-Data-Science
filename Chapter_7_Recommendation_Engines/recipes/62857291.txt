Ingredients:
2 large potatoes
2 large turnips
1 yellow onion
2-3 tablespoons fresh herbs
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons all purpose or white whole wheat flour
ground black pepper to taste
2 cups sunflower/safflower oil for frying
Directions

Directions:
Finely grate potatoes and turnips with onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess liquid.
Finely chop herbs and add to bowl. We use whatever is growing in the garden. Dill, Basil, Parsley work great.
Mix in egg, salt, and black pepper. Add enough flour to make mixture thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.
Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Drop two or three 1/4 cup mounds into hot oil, and flatten to make 1/2 inch thick pancakes. Fry, turning once, until golden brown. Transfer to paper towel lined plates to drain.  Repeat until entire mixture is used.
Serve immediately.
