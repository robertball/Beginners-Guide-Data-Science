Ingredients:
3-4 Tilapia Filets Depending on Size
1/4 Cup of breadcrumbs or unsalted or low sodim crushed crackers (I prefer the saltines)
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 tbs. Italian seasoning
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tbs. lemon juice
salt
pepper
garlic powder
olive oil

Directions:
Combine breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and garlic powder on a plate.
On a seperate plate, pour 1 tbs. lemon juice.
Place each filet, one at a time in the lemon juice coating both sides.
Season the filets with salt, black peper, and garlic powder.
Dredge filet in the paremesan mixture until both sides are well coated.
Place filets in a lightly oiled baking dish.
Bake at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes or until they easily flake with a fork.
Turn after 10 min. (You may want to brush each side with a little extra olive oil to make the breadcrumbs crispy)
Dress the filets with additional lemon and/or parmesan cheese as you wish.
