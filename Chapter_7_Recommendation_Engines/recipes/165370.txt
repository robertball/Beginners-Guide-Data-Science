Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) halibut, swordfish or mahi mahi fillets or steaks
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cloves minced fresh garlic
1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
Nectarine Mint Salsa:
2 fresh California nectarine, pitted and diced
3 tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper
2 tablespoons sliced green onions
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice
1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1/2 finely chopped small seeded jalapeno pepper

Directions:
Prepare grill for cooking fish over medium-high heat. Rinse fish and pat dry. Melt butter in a small saucepan. Add lemon juice, garlic, lemon pepper and salt; simmer for 1 minute over low heat and set aside. Cook fish fillets for about 5 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily with a fork, brushing liberally with butter mixture during the last few minutes of cooking. Serve with a large scoop of Nectarine Mint Salsa. To prepare salsa, stir together all ingredients and keep covered until ready to serve.
