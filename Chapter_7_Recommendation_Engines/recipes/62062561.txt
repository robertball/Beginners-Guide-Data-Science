Ingredients:
1 deep dish pie shell
6 large eggs or 2 cups egg substitute
1 package of shaved steak (don't use steak-um's, it doesn't taste the same)
1 medium onion (chopped)
1 package of your favorite shredded cheese
onion powder
garlic powder

Directions:
Brown and throroughly separate the steak meat, season it to taste with the onion and garlic powder. Drain and set aside to cool for a bit. Line the bottom of the pie shell with a layer of shredded cheese. Add some onion. Add some meat. Repeat til the pie shell is full. Beat the 6 eggs (or just measure out the egg substitute) Pour over the mound of yummies in the pie shell. Make sure everything gets wet from the egg. Press down a little with a fork so you see the egg come up a bit.
Bake in 350 oven til center is solid. (Varies from oven to oven)
