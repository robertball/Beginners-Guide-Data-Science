Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts - sliced
1 tbsp cornstarch
2 tsp soy sauce (for marinade)
3 tbsp soy sauce (for sauce)
2 tsp medium-dry sherry (for marinade)
3 tbsp medium-dry sherry (for sauce)
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp sambal oelek
2 tbsp oyster sauce
1 tsp of minced garlic
1/2 tsp of minced ginger
3 cups broccoli florets
2 green onions - sliced
1/2 cup sliced yellow or white onions
3 tbsp vegetable oil

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the sliced chicken with the garlic, ginger, cornstarch, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp medium-dry sherry, and 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Set aside.
To make the sauce, in a small bowl, combine the sambal oelek, oyster sauce, 3 tbsp medium-dry sherry, and 3 tbsp soy sauce. Set aside.
Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Once it is hot, add 1 tbsp vegetable oil (or enough to coat plus 1 extra teaspoon depending on size of the pan). Stir fry the chicken in the wok with the oil. Remove once golden and just cooked through. Cook the chicken in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan.
Add a touch more oil if needed, then add the onions and broccoli florets. Once the broccoli is partially cooked but still firm, add the sauce and toss to coat. Once the broccoli has started to soften, add the chicken and green onions. Toss until heated through and thoroughly coated with sauce. Season with salt and pepper if desired and serve immediately.
