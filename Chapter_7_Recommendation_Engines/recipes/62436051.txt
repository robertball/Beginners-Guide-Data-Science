Stir until well mixed, incorporating all the dry ingredients.  Cover the bowl with a clean towel and set aside for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the dough to rise.  Empty dough out onto a clean, floured surface.  Knead by hand 6-8 times, it may be necessary to add additional flour to the surface to keep dough from sticking.  Roll into desired shape and thickness.  Place rolled dough onto prepared pizza pan, add favorite sauce and toppings.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes, depending on crust thickness.
