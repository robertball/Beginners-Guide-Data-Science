Ingredients:
2 T brown sugar
2 T Smoked paprika
½ T kosher Salt
1 t garlic powder
½ t cayenne pepper
2-3 lbs. pork back or side ribs
1 c regular cola (NOT diet)
½ c BBQ sauce (your choice!)

Directions:
Combine the first five ingredients to make your rib rub. You could also substitute another rub if you have one that you particularly like, but this makes a nice base.
Generously rub the ribs with the rub (that’s a little bit of a tongue twister…). Let sit for 5 minutes.
Cut the ribs into 3-4 bone pieces and layer in your slow cooker. Pour the cola over the ribs, but make sure you don’t wash off all the rub. .
Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Go to work, or read a really long book.
After 6-8 hours, the ribs will be fall-off-the-bone tender. Carefully remove from the slow cooker and place them on a baking sheet. Coat with BBQ sauce and place under the broiler for 3-5 minutes, just to crisp up the outside a little. You could also toss them on the grill for a few minutes if you want to be fancy.
Put on a Rib Bib and enjoy!

Description: 
These ribs are ridiculously easy and delicious, and you can easily pop them in the slow cooker before you go to work and come home to a rib feast worthy of the Stonecutters. So while the purists will scoff at my methods, I can eat ribs four times a week without having to quit my day job- so suck on them bones!
