Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2-3 tablespoons of Chinese or Japanese green tea powder (NOT the same as instant green tea)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 pound unsalted butter
3/4 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F.  Cream butter (slightly softened, or room temp) until fluffy, about 3 mins.  Add sugar, and continue to cream until light in color (about 2 mins more).  Set aside.
Mix remaining dry ingredients: flour, green tea powder, and salt in a small bowl.
Add flour mixture gradually to creamed butter + sugar mixture.  Mix on low until dough sticks together.
Place a sheet of parchment paper or plastic wrap on a flat, clean surface and dust with flour.  Roll dough to 1/4 inch thickness.  Cut with cookie cutters into 1-1/2 to 2 inch cookies, or cut into bars.  Roll extra dough and cut again.  Chill for 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer cookies (using a spatula is helpful) to a non-stick baking sheet or a regular baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  Sprinkle with sugar (or confectioner's sugar).  Bake until firm and barely stating to golden, for 15 minutes.  Cool completely before eating.  Cookies taste better the next day.
