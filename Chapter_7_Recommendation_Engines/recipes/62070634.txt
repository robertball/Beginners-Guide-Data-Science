Ingredients:
2 cups old fashioned oatmeal
1/3 cup dried cherries or other dried fruit
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup pecans or other nuts, chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon almond flavoring
1 apple, chopped

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine old-fashioned oats, dried fruit, baking powder, cinnamon and chopped pecans.
In a large bowl, combine beaten egg, milk, melted butter, brown sugar, almond flavoring, and chopped apple.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients; stir together and pour into an 8x8 pan, pushing the oatmeal mixture to the edges & corners so the oat mixture and milk mixture are distributed evenly in the pan.   Bake 20-25 minutes at 375 degrees.
Scoop baked oatmeal out of the pan and serve warm with a few tablespoons milk or cream; or eat it plain; or cold as a snack.
