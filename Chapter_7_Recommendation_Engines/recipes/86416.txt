Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
2 eggs
3/4 cup instant oatmeal
3 tablespoons dried minced onion
3/4 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 (12 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, eggs, oatmeal, onion, Cheddar cheese, ketchup, salt, and pepper using your hands. Form into tiny meatballs about 1 inch wide.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs, and cook, turning frequently, until browned, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the meatballs to a baking dish. Cover with barbeque sauce.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheat oven, until sauce is thick and meatballs are cooked through. Serve hot.

These meatballs have been in my family for generations. The barbeque sauce adds a special kick! I serve these every Sunday during football season and every week they disappear!
