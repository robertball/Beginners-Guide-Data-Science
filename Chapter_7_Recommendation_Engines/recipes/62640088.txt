Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
2-1/2 teaspoons  baking powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried basil or marjoram, crushed
12 oz can (1-1/2 cups) beer
1  cup  shredded cheddar cheese
4 oz can diced chilies, drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Grease bottom and 1/2 inch up sides of an 8x4x2-inch or 9x5x3-inch loaf pan; set aside. (You can also use an 8 or 9-inch glass casserole dish.)
In a large bowl stir together dry ingredients. Add beer, cheese, and chilies (or jalape√±os). Stir just until combined (batter should be lumpy).
Spoon batter into prepared pan. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until golden.
Cool in pan on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from pan. Serve warm, or cool completely on wire rack.
