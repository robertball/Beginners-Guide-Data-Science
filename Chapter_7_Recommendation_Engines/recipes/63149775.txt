Ingredients
2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup fresh basil leaves
3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped toasted walnuts
Pinch red pepper flakes
2 cloves garlic, halved
1/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
2 teaspoons olive oil
6 ounces whole-wheat fettuccine
6 soft sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil), cut into thin slivers
Grated zest of 1 lemon

Directions:
Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli is tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and run under cold running water, then drain again.
Place the broccoli, basil, cheese, walnuts, 1/2 teaspoon salt, red pepper flakes and garlic in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the broth and oil and process until smooth.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to package directions. Drain and transfer the fettuccine to a large bowl. Add the pesto, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon zest and toss to coat well.
