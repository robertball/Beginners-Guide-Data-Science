Description: 
Setting out to duplicate the coconut margaritas we had in Costa Rica, my first attempt was awful! I surfed the internet for a good recipe with little luck. I then took what I'd learned from my first nasty try and the ideas I picked up online and after about 5 or 6 attempts I came up with this. Enjoy!
