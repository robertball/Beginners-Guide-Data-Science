Ingredients:
1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips (6 ounces)
1/4 cup ground almonds
1/2 cup sour cream
4 cups vanilla wafer crumbs (Nilla wafers)
1 1/2 cups icing sugar
3/4 cup butter
1/3 cup cocoa
3/4 cup Baileys Irish Cream liqueur
1 cup finely chopped pecans
dark chocolate for dipping

Directions:
In a medium sized saucepan combine the butter and chocolate chips, over low to medium heat melt the chocolate chips, stir until smooth, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
In a large bowl combine ground almonds, vanilla wafer crumbs, icing sugar, cocoa and pecans, whisk to combine.
Stir in sour cream, Bailey's Irish Cream Liqueur and cooled chocolate mixture, mix until combined, if too dry add more Baileys, if too wet add more vanilla wafer crumbs.
Cover with saran wrap and chill overnight.
The next day form balls with a scoop to keep sizes the same, place on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer to firm up.
Once the balls are firm, dip the balls in the melted chocolate and place on waxed paper to set the chocolate.
Once the chocolate is set, place the balls in candy cups and store in a Tupperware container in the fridge for up to 6 weeks.
