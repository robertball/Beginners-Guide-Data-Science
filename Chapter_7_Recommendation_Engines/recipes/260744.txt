Ingredients:
12 jalapeno peppers
1/2 (8 ounce) package pepper Jack cheese (such as Tillamook®)
12 slices bacon
toothpicks

Directions:
Slice caps off the jalapeno peppers; reserve. Core and seed the peppers.
Cut pepper Jack cheese into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut each slice into sticks the thickness of a pencil. Stuff jalapeno peppers with as many cheese sticks as will fit. Secure caps back on the jalapenos, using at least 2 toothpicks per pepper.
Wrap 1 slice bacon around each jalapeno pepper. Keep bacon secure by skewering the end on one of the toothpicks.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill jalapeno peppers, watching for flare-ups, until bacon is browned, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I never liked the thought of cream cheese in my jalapeno poppers so this variation uses sticks of Tillamook® pepper Jack cheese to turn up the heat and flavor. Your friends will love this if they can handle the heat.
