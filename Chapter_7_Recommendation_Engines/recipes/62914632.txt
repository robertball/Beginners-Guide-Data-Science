Ingredients:
1 whole chicken or combination of boneless skinless chicken breasts and boneless skinless thighs
1 celery rib
1/2 onion
1 Tablespoon instant chicken bouillon
Enough water to cover chicken with 3 inches above
Sliced celery
Sliced carrots

Directions:
Cook chicken in water with celery rib,1/2 onion and 1 Tablespoon instant chicken bouillon.  (I use Maggi brand, which I love)  When chicken is tender, remove from broth to cool.  Strain broth and return to pot in which it was cooked.  Place chopped vegetables into broth & cook until almost tender.  Return cut up chicken to mixture.  Add more canned chicken broth if needed OR more water & another teaspoon instant bouillon.  Drop in a handful or two of noodles and simmer until noodles are tender but not too soft.
