Ingredients:
1 pound thick sliced bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.   Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Arrange bacon on baking sheet in a single layer with the edges touching or slightly overlapping. Lay a sheet of foil over the top loosely to prevent spattering all over your oven!
Bake in preheated oven to desired degree of doneness, 15 - 20 minutes. Remove top foil about 5 minutes before its finished baking for final crisping(I pour off the excess grease at this point,too.) Remove bacon from the baking sheet with tongs or a fork, and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.  You can brush the bacon with maple syrup or brown sugar near the end for a twist.

Description: 
This is the way to get crisp bacon without having to constantly turn it, watch over it, or get burnt by splatters of grease. It 'fries' up flat and doesn't curl, which looks great beside a breakfast plate of eggs, and makes BLT sandwiches much easier. Very nice when feeding a family or crowd.Modified from: Bacon for the Family or a Crowd
