Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1 (15 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 1/2 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs
2 cups oil for frying, or as needed
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or heavy deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and milk. Place seasoned bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip artichoke hearts in the egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs until they are fully covered.
Deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until deep golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain excess oil. When all the pieces have been fried, place on a serving tray and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
