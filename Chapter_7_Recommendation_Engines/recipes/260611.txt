Ingredients:
2 cups masa harina flour (Mexican corn masa mix)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups hot water

Directions:
Place masa harina and salt in a bowl; stir well. Add 1 cup hot water and stir well with a wooden spoon. Add remaining 1/2 cup water; mix until well combined. Knead until a soft dough is formed. Cover with a kitchen towel and let it rest for 1 hour.
Shape dough into golf-ball size balls. Cover the tortilla press with plastic wrap and press the dough balls to make the tortillas.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until lightly golden, about 1 minute. Flip and cook for 1 minute more.
