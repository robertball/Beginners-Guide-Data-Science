Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds ripe nectarines
2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter or stick margarine, cubed
1 egg white
2/3 cup crushed macaroons
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats

Directions:
Peel nectarines and remove pits; cut fruit into 1/2-in. slices. Place in a bowl; add the blueberries, sugar and nutmeg. Drizzle with lemon juice; toss lightly. Transfer to a shallow 3-qt. baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray.
In a bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter and egg white; mix well. Stir in macaroon crumbs and oats. Spoon over the fruit mixture. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly around the edges.

Description: 
A peachy use of the season's bounty is Marilyn Schroeder's fruitful dessert. 'I bring this juicy crumble to get-togethers of all kinds,' she writes from Alexandria, Minnesota. 'Crushed macaroons make a delightfully different topping for the blueberries and nectarines. For a special treat, serve it with low-fat frozen yogurt.'
