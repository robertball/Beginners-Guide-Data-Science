Ingredients:
1 pound of Brussels sprouts
1/8 cup pine nuts, finely diced
Balsamic vinegar
Olive oil
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Trim and peel away the outer leaves of each Brussels sprout and then half them.
2. Slide the Brussels sprout halves onto the skewers, about six to eight halves per skewer.
3. Line a baking dish with parchment paper and places the skewers halved-side up.
4. Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar over each skewer, trying to “fill up” the Brussels sprouts.
5. Bake the skewers at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes until they are cooked and crispy.
6. Plate the skewers on a serving tray and cover them with shaved Parmesan and the pine nuts.
