Ingredients:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1-2 Tbsp minced garlic
2 cups vegetable broth
6 medium red potatoes, diced
1 cup baby carrots, chopped
2 cans whole kernel corn
2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp garlic powder
2 cups soy milk, divided
1/4 cup flour
2 Tbsp dried parsley

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute the diced onion in olive oil until translucent. Add the garlic and saute until the onions are slightly carmelized and the garlic is slightly browned. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a large stock pot, add the vegetable broth, potatoes, carrots, corn, salt, pepper, garlic powder and 1 1/2 cups of soy milk. Bring to a boil.  Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer. Add the onions & garlic. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until potatoes and carrots are tender. Stir together the remaining soy milk and flour, then add to the pot. Simmer for 10 minutes or until thickened. Add parsley and serve.
