Ingredients:
10 sticks of rhubarb
4 tbsp water
8 tbsp white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup demerara sugar
1 1/2 cups flour

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 180C/350F
Cut the rhubarb into 1 inch square chunks. Mix the water and white sugar together in a pot on the stove. Once fully incorporated add in the rhubarb and leave over medium-high heat until the rhubarb is soft. If needed you can add more water.
Rub the butter into the flour and sugar to make the crumble topping.
Once rhubarb is soft transfer to an oven-save baking dish and sprinkle the crumble topping over the rhubarb and bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes, or until the crumble topping is crisp and golden-brown and the rhubarb filling has softened and is bubbling.
Remove and allow to cool slightly before serving with double cream.
