Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) loaf Italian bread
1 cup milk
1 package McCormick® Pork Gravy Mix
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese, divided
5 tablespoons dill pickles, coarsely chopped, divided
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared yellow mustard
1/2 cup cubed ham
1 cup deli-sliced roast pork cut into bite-size pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place bread on baking sheet. Cut an oval on top of bread and remove bread center to make room for the dip. Tear removed bread top and bread center into bite-size pieces. Set aside for serving.
Whisk milk gradually into gravy mix in medium saucepan. Stirring frequently, cook over medium heat until gravy comes to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the cheese, 4 tablespoons of the pickles, mayonnaise, and mustard. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese is melted. Stir in pork and ham.
Spoon dip into bread. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese.
Bake 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bread is warm. Sprinkle dip with remaining 1 tablespoon chopped pickles. Serve with bread pieces.
