Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon ground ginger
Noodle Bowls:
1 1/2 cups water, divided
4 stalks celery, halved lengthwise and cut into 2-inch sticks
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
1/2 yellow bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
10 prawns, peeled, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 (7 ounce) packages fresh udon noodles

Directions:
Combine soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and ginger in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until ready to use.
While sauce simmers, combine 1/2 cup water, celery, and bell peppers in another small saucepan over medium heat. Cover and cook without stirring for about 10 minutes. Drain and keep covered.
Combine remaining 1 cup water and udon noodles in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles and return to the saucepan over medium heat. Stir 1/3 of the sauce into the noodles; cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Move noodles to the side of the saucepan and add prawns. Cook until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes.
Divide noodles evenly between 2 bowls. Sprinkle prawns with lemon juice while still in the saucepan and stir to coat. Divide vegetables evenly on top of the noodles; divide prawns on top of vegetables. Spoon remaining sauce on top to taste.

Description: 
This is my own creation. It's fast, easy, nutritious, and affordable. Great for dinner on a weeknight when everyone is busy. I will halve the recipe when I'm only cooking for myself or double it when I am cooking for my whole family because it converts easily. Also, one recipe will feed 4 children, as portion sizes are generous.
