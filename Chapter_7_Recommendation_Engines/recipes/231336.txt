Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 cup milk
1 cup crushed saltine crackers
1 onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (14.5 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup

Directions:
Mix ground beef, milk, saltine cracker crumbs, onion, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Shape mixture into a narrow loaf and place onto a baking sheet; cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cut loaf into 1-inch-thick slices and sear the 'steaks' in the hot skillet until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Insides will still be pink. Arrange slices in a roasting pan. Spread mushroom soup over steaks.
Bake steaks in the preheated oven until mushroom soup is bubbling and meat is no longer pink inside, about 1 hour. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a meat slice should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
First had this dish at an Amish church in rural Ohio. I will never forget the delicious smell of that church kitchen! After a little questioning, a kind woman gave me the recipe. Great for a plan-ahead meal.
