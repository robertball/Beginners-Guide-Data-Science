Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) frozen rump roast (or chuck- not english)
1 cup white wine or corona like beer
2 (7.75 ounce) cans Mexican style hot tomato sauce
3 tablespoons crushed garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro (or more)
option- add jar of salsa and omit some of the garlic and S&P;

Directions:
Place the frozen roast in the slow cooker. Pour the wine and Mexican style hot tomato sauce over the top. Season with garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
Cover, and cook on Low for 9 hours. When done, the roast should shred easily with a fork. Shred the roast into the juices, and mix in the chopped green onions and cilantro.
For food safety reasons- probably best to NOT use a frozen roast. So- use thawed roast and cook 5 hrs on low.
