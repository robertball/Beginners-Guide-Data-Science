Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package frozen petite peas
1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
1 pint heavy whipping cream
2 (3 ounce) packages smoked wild salmon, pulled into small pieces
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
1 lemon, zested and juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place peas in a large colander in the sink.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until chewy and still firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain fusilli over peas.
Return fusilli and peas to the pot. Add heavy cream and smoked salmon; mix well to combine. Season with salt and black pepper. Pour into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Combine bread crumbs, olive oil, parsley, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a small bowl; mix lightly with a fork. Scatter topping over casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I make this easy-peasy, one-pan pasta dish for new parents or stressed-out friends and it always seems to make the evenings go a little more smoothly. The smoked salmon and green pea combo plays up the salty-sweet flavors loads of people crave, and the lemon zest/breadcrumb topping brightens up what could be an over-the-top rich dish.
