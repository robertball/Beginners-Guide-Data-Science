Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons vinegar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch thick slices
1 cup beef stock
salt to taste

Directions:
Whisk together vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, cumin, chili powder, and garlic in a  bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the sliced beef, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.
Bring beef to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Transfer beef and lime juice marinade to a large baking dish. Add beef stock and cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven until beef is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Allow meat to rest for 10 minutes before shredding with 2 forks. Drain and discard about 80% of liquid from meat and season with salt before serving.

Description: 
We just got tired of hamburger tacos and decided to try something authentic! We love the lime infusion flavor in the meat. Serve with tortilla shells, lettuce, cheese, guacamole and salsa.
