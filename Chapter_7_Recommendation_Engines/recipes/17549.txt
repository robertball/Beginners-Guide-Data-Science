Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
2 cups sour cream
2 eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup orange liqueur
1 cup white chocolate chips
1/8 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch Bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix and pudding mix. Add the sour cream, eggs, oil and orange liqueur. Mix until smooth and well blended, then fold in the white chocolate chips. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, until cake springs back to the touch. Allow cake to cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. When cake is cool, dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

Description: 
This is a very rich and moist cake that is one of my husband's favorites, and very easy to make.  We have also substituted Peach Schnapps for the orange liqueur with great results.
