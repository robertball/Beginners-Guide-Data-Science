Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water (105 degrees to 115 degrees)
1 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/2 cup shortening
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons grated orange peel
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
ICING:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 teaspoon grated orange peel

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, shortening, sugar, orange juice and peel, salt, eggs and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/4 hours. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape each into 12 balls. Roll each into a 10-in. rope.  Tie into a knot and tuck ends under. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks. Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over rolls.

Description: 
Baking is my favorite pastime, and I normally have my freezer well-stocked with breads, muffins and cookies. This recipe for rolls with a refreshing orange flavor has been in the family as long as I can remember. We especially enjoy them for breakfast and brunch.
