Ingredients:
2 boneless chicken breasts
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (18 ounce) bottle barbecue sauce, divided
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on all sides. Place in slow cooker and pour 1/4 cup barbecue sauce and vinegar on top.
Cook on Low for 3 hours.
Combine brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.
Pour out all the liquid from the slow cooker and add remaining barbecue sauce. Sprinkle chicken with brown sugar-spice mixture.
Cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
