Description: 
Bread made in the slow cooker actually turns out a decent loaf, and it's very easy because this is a no-knead recipe. It is also quick because it requires only one rise; the second rise happens in the slow cooker.
 
Adding seeds or rolled oats not only adds flavor, it also makes it easier to release the bread from the slow cooker.
