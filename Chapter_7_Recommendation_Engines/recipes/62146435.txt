Ingredients:
2 8-oz packages of cream cheese, softened
1 1-oz package of dry ranch dressing mix
3/4 C. salsa
1 4-oz. can diced green chiles
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1.5 C. shredded Pepperjack cheese
3/4 lb. sliced deli ham
8 10-inch flour tortillas

Directions:
1. Let cream cheese sit at room temperature until softened, about 2 hours. In large bowl, mix cream cheese, ranch mix, salsa, green chiles, and cayenne pepper, using a whisk to eliminate large clumps.
2. Warm tortillas individually in the microwave for ten seconds so they are easier to roll up. Spread approx. 1/4 C. of the cream cheese mixture onto each tortilla, leaving an inch around all sides.
3. Sprinkle approx. 1/5 C. Pepperjack cheese over the cream cheese mixture. Top with 2 slices of deli ham, trying to cover as much of the tortilla as possible.
4. Roll up the tortillas as tightly as possible. Pile them onto a plate, cover, and refrigerate for several hours. Slice into 1.5-inch rounds and serve.

Description: 
Every time I host or attend a get-together, friends request that I bring these wrap-ups. They are spin on the traditional ham and cream cheese rollups, with a bit of kick from the Pepperjack and a deliciously zesty flavor. The creamy filling works well on it's own as a chip dip, too.
