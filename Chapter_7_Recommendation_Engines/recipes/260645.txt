Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/2 cup butter
3 white mushrooms, sliced
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped scallions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 (10 ounce) can stewed tomatoes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 ounces all-purpose flour
1/2 lemon (optional)
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, scallions, and garlic until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add wine, broth, tomatoes, and parsley. Bring sauce to a boil. Stir and reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.
Place shrimp and flour in a resealable plastic bag; shake and mix until shrimp is well coated. Stir shrimp into the scampi. Cook until shrimp are opaque, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce and shrimp over the pasta; squeeze lemon juice on top. Season with salt and pepper.
