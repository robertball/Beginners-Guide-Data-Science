Ingredients:
1 16 oz. package dried pasta
1 25 oz. jar vodka sauce or 3 cups tomato sauce
1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400F.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Add salt and let the water return to a boil.  Add the pasta and cook it until almost al dente (follow the package directions but stop a minute or two before the pasta is completely tender). Drain the pasta.
Return the pasta to the pot and add the vodka sauce.  Mix it all up, stir in the mozzarella, then spoon the mixture into a 3 quart baking dish and sprinkle the Parmesan on top.  Bake the casserole until the top is a bit brown and everything is bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
