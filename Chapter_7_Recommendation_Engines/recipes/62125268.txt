Ingredients:
1 package yellow cake mix plus items to make the cake, or your own yellow cake recipe for 9 x 13 pan
1 8 oz package lowfat cream cheese
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1 container whipped topping
1 3-oz package strawberry gelatin plus ingredients to reconstitute
Sliced fresh or frozen strawberries as desired.
Extra container of whipped topping if desired.

Directions:
Prepare cake mix as stated on box or prepare your own recipe, using 9 x 13 pan.  Bake cake as directed by box/recipe.  Let cool five minutes, then flatten the cake with a piece of waxed paper or a clean tea towel.  If this isn't done while it's hot, it won't flatten enough.  Let cool completely.
Beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar and vanilla until smooth.  Add a small container of whipped topping.  Blend together, then spread the mixture on top of the mashed, cooled cake.
Prepare the gelatin as stated on box.  Pour this over the cream cheese mixture.  Let the gelatin set just a little, then top with fresh or frozen strawberries and refrigerate.  Top with whipped topping or leave as is.
