Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
4 eggs
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled
1/2 cup shortening
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup powdered sugar
Reynolds® Parchment Paper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line several cookie sheets with Reynolds(R) Parchment Paper, set aside.
Combine the granulated sugar, eggs, melted chocolate, shortening, baking powder and peppermint extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until combined. Gradually beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour.
Cover and chill for 2 to 24 hours or until dough is easy to handle.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in powdered sugar and place 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets.
Bake about 9 minutes or until edges are just set. Transfer the cookies on the parchment paper to a wire rack; cool completely.
