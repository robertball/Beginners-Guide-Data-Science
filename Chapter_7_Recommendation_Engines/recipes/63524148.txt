Ingredients:
2cups fresh spinach
1/4 red onion thinly sliced
1 Anjou pear cubed
6 dried dates
Honey flavored goat cheese (I found mine at Aldi)
A handful of grape tomatoes
1 tsp. extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp. apple cider vinegar (I wouldn't substitute for any other kind because of the sweeter flavor this has)

Directions:
Preheat your grill (I used my George Foreman), then slice your dates in half long ways. Spread the inside of the dates with the goat cheese. Not too much because you don't want it to ooze out all over the grill. Then place them on your grill. Heat them only until the dates start to carmelize.
While your dates are on the grill, put together the spinach, red onion, pears, and tomatoes on a plate or in a bowl.
After the dates carmelize, take them off of the grill and cut them in half, in width, not length, and place on salad. Drizzle on the olive oil and Vinegar.
