Description: 
Our home economists modified Penny Auclair's recipe to use up extra cooked ground beef. I tried this when I was going to school full-time and wanted something quick, foolproof and delicious, writes the Amesbury, Massachusetts cook. My family loves it. TIP: For a change, use chicken breasts and chicken gravy instead of ground beef and beef gravy, Penny recommends.
