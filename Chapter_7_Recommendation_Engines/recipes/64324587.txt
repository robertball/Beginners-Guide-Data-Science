Ingredients:
2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin, divided
1 clove(s) garlic, minced
1/4 pounds spinach, fresh, tough stems removed
salt, to taste
peppercorns, black, freshly ground, to taste
2 piece(s) chicken, breast, boneless, skinless, (6 ounces each)
2 ounce(s) cheese, goat, reduced-fat
4 whole toothpicks, wooden

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â°F.
Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in spinach and cook, stirring constantly, until spinach is wilted and liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Season well with salt and pepper and transfer to a plate. Wipe skillet dry with paper towels.
Beginning at the thickest end of 1 chicken breast, carefully insert a sharp knife into center and cut a pocket as evenly as possible, leaving a 1" border on three sides. Repeat with remaining breast. Open each pocket, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then fill evenly with goat cheese and spinach. Seal each with two toothpicks and season outside with salt and pepper.
Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, turning once, until well browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until juices run clear, about 8 minutes. Serve hot.
