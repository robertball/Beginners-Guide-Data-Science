Ingredients:
4 cups old-fashioned oats
2 cups raisins
2 Tablespoons cinnamon
1 Tablespoon Molasses
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 13x9-inch pan with cooking spray.
Mix dry ingredients (including raisins) together in a bowl; add wet ingredients, stirring well.
Spread into the prepared pan, evenly pressing into the corners and out to the sides. (Use parchment paper to press into pan evenly.)
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown, 20-25 minutes, using slightly less time for chewier bars and slightly more time for crunchier bars.
Allow the the bars cool for 5 minutes in the pan before removing. Use a sharp knife to cut into bars. Let the bars cool completely and store in an airtight container. Can be frozen in individual bags.
