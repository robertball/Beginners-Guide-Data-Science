Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) pie crusts, baked
10 slices bacon
8 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded
1 small head fresh broccoli, diced
4 green onions
2 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
5 eggs, beaten
2 cups half-and-half
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 pinch cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Evenly distribute bacon across bottom of each pastry shell, followed by half of cheese. Add broccoli, scallions, and tomatoes, then cover with remaining cheese.
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, half-and-half, nutmeg, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Pour half of mixture into each pastry shell.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake an additional 45 minutes, until quiches are set in center.
