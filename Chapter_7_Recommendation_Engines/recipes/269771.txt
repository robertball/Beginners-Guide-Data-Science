Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
2 poblano peppers
1 1/2 cups Mexican-style sour cream
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 cubes vegetable bouillon
2 garlic cloves, peeled
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook poblano peppers over a gas flame, turning periodically with tongs or a fork, until skin is charred on all sides, about 7 minutes. Seal peppers inside a plastic bag; allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 8 minutes. Remove and discard skins and seeds.
Place peppers, sour cream, water, chopped cilantro, vegetable bouillon cubes, garlic, and black pepper in a blender; blend until creamy.
Pour sauce into a large pot over low heat; bring to a boil. Drain spaghetti and add to the sauce. Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Top with Parmesan cheese and cilantro leaves.
