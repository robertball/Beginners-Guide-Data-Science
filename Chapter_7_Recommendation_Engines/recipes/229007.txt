Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unprocessed wheat bran
3/4 cup lightly packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
2 large apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons cold butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Whisk flour, bran, 3/4 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat milk, vegetable oil, and eggs in a separate bowl. Pour liquid ingredients into the flour mixture and stir just until mixed. Gently stir apples into the batter and fill prepared muffin cups about 3/4 full.
Mix 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a bowl; cut the butter into the brown sugar mixture until the streusel topping is crumbly. Sprinkle about 1 heaping teaspoon of topping onto each muffin.
Bake muffins in the preheated oven until browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe has 1 cup natural bran which makes this recipe good with fiber. Also can use applesauce or sour cream instead of vegetable oil. I found that a little applesauce with the chopped apples and a little streusel topping in the middle makes a nice middle of muffin if you would like to make a gourmet muffin. I have found
