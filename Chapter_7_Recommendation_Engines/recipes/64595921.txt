Ingredients:
4 Large green zucchinis, cut lengthwise
2 organic eggs, beaten
1-2 cups panko bread crumbs
Dried spices of choice: Garlic salt, oregano, pepper etc

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly spray some oil onto two baking sheets and set aside.
On the mean time have two bowls out and place beaten eggs in one and panko breadcrumbs and spices in another. Dip zucchini pieces in the eggs followed by the panko breadcrumbs making sure you cover them with the eggs and panko through all sides. I do this step twice, egg, panko, egg and panko again.
Bake zucchini for 10-15 minutes, then turn each piece onto the other side and bake further another 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.
Serve immediately with your favorite sauce.
NOTE: If your panko breadcrumbs are too large you can place them in the food processor to make them finer. Additionally, you can season panko breadcrumbs with dried spices. Any of your choice will work!
