Description: 
This is another very old recipe from my very old Irish recipe book.  Although nettles are not as commonly eaten in Ireland today, this weed saved many a family during the famine.  Make sure to wear gloves when handling nettles, and use only the leaves, discarding the stems and stingers.   Bear in mind that the sting cooks out entirely!
