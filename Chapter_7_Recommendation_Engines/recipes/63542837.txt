Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspooon vanilla
2 cups coarsely grated zucchini (loosely packed)
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
In the bowl with a hand mixer or of an electric stand mixer, beat 3 eggs until frothy.
Gradually add 2 cups sugar.
Slowly add in 1 cup vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
Beat until thick and lemon colored.
Stir in zucchini (see notes for other variations).
In a medium bowl, whisk together to combine 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt.
Stir dry mixture into wet mixture, stirring to combine.
Add chopped walnuts, pecans, raisins or dates, if desired.
Spray two bread loaf pans with Baker's Joy, or grease and flour to prevent sticking.
Pour batter into pans and level off with the back of a spoon.
Bake for approximately 1 hour or until done (I cook them for 30 minutes, rotate the loaves and then check after 15 additional minutes for doneness, etc).
Allow loaves to cool in pan for 10 minutes, then run a knife along the sides to loosen bread and remove from pans.
Cool on wire rack.
Brush tops of loaf with melted butter while still warm.
