Crumble bacon and sausage into the pan and evenly distribute
Spread the shredded cheddar cheese evenly on top of the meats
Beat the eggs and mix into the cream and half & half
Pour the egg & cream mixture over the cheese and meat in the pan.  Pour slowly so that you don't move the meat and cheese around too much.
