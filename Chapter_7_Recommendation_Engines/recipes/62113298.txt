1/2c Sugar
2 1/2c Brown Sugar
3t Vanilla
2 whole eggs
2 egg yolks
5 1/2c Flour
2t Salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325.  Spray a 9x13 pan with non-stick coating and line bottom with parchment paper.
In a mixer bowl, cream butter and sugars.  Add vanilla, mix well.  Add eggs & yolks, one at a time, mixing after each addition.  Scrape the bowl.
In a seperate bowl, sift flour, salt and baking soda.  Slowly incorporate the flour mixture into the butter mixture until blended.  Fold in the chocolate chips.
Divide the batter in half.  Place one half in the refrigerator, and the other half spread out in the bottom of prepared pan.  Bake at 325 for 20 minutes, or until mostly done.  Allow to cool for about 5-10 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the cheesecake batter by beating the cream cheese.  Slowly incorporate the sugar.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Pour the cheesecake batter into the partially cooled pan.
Drop the rest of the cookie batter by rounded teaspoons on top, aiming to cover all of the cheesecake.
Bake at 325 for 50 minutes, or until cake tester inserted in middle comes out clean.
Refrigerate the bars when cool.
