Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons water
1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms

Directions:
Thoroughly mix 1/4 cup soup, beef, bread crumbs, onion and egg in a large bowl. Shape the beef mixture firmly into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) burgers.
Heat the oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the burgers and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat.
Add the remaining soup, Worcestershire, water and mushrooms to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the burgers are cooked through.
