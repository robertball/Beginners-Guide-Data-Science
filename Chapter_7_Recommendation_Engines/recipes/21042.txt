Description: 
An easy appetizer to take to a gathering! I use a dish that has a bowl in the middle and put the tortilla rollups all around the bowl. There are never any of these green chile pepper spiced treats left!! The cream cheese may be heated in the microwave for 1-2 minutes to make it spread more easily. The rollups work best when the unsliced rolled tortillas are refrigerated several hours before slicing.
