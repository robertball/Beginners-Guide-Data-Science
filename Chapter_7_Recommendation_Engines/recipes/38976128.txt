Ingredients:
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup powdered sugar
2 cups shortening
3/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 large egg, beaten
4 1/3 cups cake flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
sugar, for decorating

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°.
In a medium bowl, cream together the sugars and shortening using an electric mixer.
Mix on slow speed 30 seconds, then scrape down the bowl with a spatula.
Increase speed to medium and mix for 3 minutes.
Slowly add vanilla and beaten egg while mixing.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the mixing bowl, mixing on slow speed until just blended. Do not overmix.
Scoop with an ice-cream scoop and roll in sugar.
Place directly on cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with palm of hand.
Bake at 375° for 9-10 minutes. Cookies are done when small cracks appear and are pale golden. Ideally, the edges do not brown.
