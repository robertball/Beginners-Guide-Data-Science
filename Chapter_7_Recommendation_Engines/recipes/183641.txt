Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
5 eggs, separated
2 tablespoons butter
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Sift flour, sugar, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Pour the milk slowly into the dry mixture while stirring. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating until well blended before adding the next egg yolk.
Place the egg whites in a separate bowl; beat until egg whites form stiff peaks. Gently stir 1/3 of the egg whites into the batter. Fold in the remaining egg whites.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in an 8 inch skillet over moderate heat. Pour in half the batter and cook about 4 minutes or until browned on the bottom. Loosen edges and slide pancake onto a plate using spatula. Invert the pancake back into the skillet and cook until both sides are brown, about 2 minutes. Remove to a warm platter and keep warm.
Make the second pancake the same way. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve.

Description: 
Kaiserschmarrn, also known as the Emperor's Pancakes, is one of the most famous Austrian desserts. It is a lightly caramelized pancake with a sweet taste and fluffy texture. After living in Vienna, Austria, for almost two years, I've had my fair share of Kaiserschmarrn, and it is one of the best desserts that Austria has to offer.
