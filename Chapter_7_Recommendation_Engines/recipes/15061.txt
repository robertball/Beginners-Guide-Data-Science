Ingredients:

1 onion, chopped
6 tablespoons paprika
2 1/2 cups ketchup
8 cups water

1 pound chourico - Portuguese smoked pork sausage
5 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2 pound spaghetti

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine the oil and the onion. Saute for 5 minutes, or until onion is tender. Add the paprika, ketchup, water, soup mix, salt and pepper and stir well. Cut the linguica and chourico into 3 inch pieces and add to the soup.
In a food processor or blender, puree the beans in small batches and add to the pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2 to 3 hours. Add the potatoes and simmer for another hour. Break the spaghetti into 3 to 4 inch pieces, add to the pot and simmer for another 15 minutes, or until spaghetti is tender.

Description: 
This is a hearty soup served by my grandmother at many family gatherings. It is an absolute favorite. Tastes even better the next day! It is made with linguica, which is a slim Portuguese sausage heavily flavored with garlic. Linguica can be found in Latin American markets and many supermarkets.
