Ingredients:
500g strong bread flour
10g yeast
10g salt
30g olive oil
390g canned black cherries, drained
100g white chocolate chips
100 chocolate chips
320ml cool water (Â¾ to start, then as needed)
40-50g additional flour

Directions:
In a bowl, put 500g flour, yeast, salt, olive oil (Salt and yeast on opposite sides of bowl.)
Add 3/4 of water to start; more as needed.
If using a mixer, mix until stretchy. If mixing by hand, knead until smooth and elastic.
In bowl, add black cherries, and both kinds of chocolate chips along with 40-50g of flour to absorb cherry juice. Mix until incorporated. (You will need to use your hands if not using a mixer.)
Let rise in bowl until bread has doubled (about 1 1/2 hours.)
Remove from bowl onto floured board and cut in half, and then pat each half into a  rectangle, removing air bubbles.
Roll out each piece into large rope.
Plait, and let prove for another 1 1/2 hours.
Bake at 400f for 20 minutes, then lower temp to 365 and bake for another 20-25 min.
