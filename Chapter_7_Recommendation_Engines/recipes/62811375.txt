Ingredients:
3 Cups Masa Harina
2 Cups Warm Water/Broth
1 Tablespoon Salt
1 Quart Oil for frying

Directions:
Mix together masa harina and salt with water, adding the last bit of water in tablespoons until dough reaches desired consistency. It should not be too dry, but not too sticky either.
Form 2 inch balls out of dough.
Flatten each ball to a half inch thick circle.
Fry each circle at 400F 30 seconds on each side or until surface just begins to get toasty, and remove from oil before cooked through.
When the circles are cool enough to handle, but still very warm, pinch the edges up all the way around each one to form little "boats".
Return to oil and fry until golden and cooked through.
Serve with a variety of toppings such as beans, cheese, and meat.
