Ingredients:
8 ounces salted cod fish
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 onions, chopped
3 tomatoes, chopped
2 red bell peppers, chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 pinch red pepper flakes
6 leaves lettuce
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced

Directions:
To remove excess salt from the fish, bring the fish to a boil in a large pot of water. Drain the water, and repeat the process. Drain the fish, flake, and press liquid out.
In a large skillet, saute oil, onions, tomatoes,  and peppers for 2 minutes. Mix in flaked saltfish, lemon juice, and hot pepper. Cook mixture at a low heat until the moisture has almost completely evaporated.
Pile the mixture into the center of a serving dish, and arrange lettuce and avocado around it.
