Ingredients:
1 slice bread
1/2 teaspoon cream cheese, softened
2 pineapple chunks, cut into squares
1 green grape, sliced length-wise
1 raisin
2 sunflower seeds
6 carrot sticks

Directions:
Cut bread into a circle with a round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass; discard excess bread. Spread cream cheese onto the bread circle.
Place one pineapple chunk on each side of bread, near the top, to make cat ears. Place sliced grape below the pineapple to make the eyes.
Press raisin into the center of the bread to create a nose; arrange sunflower seeds under the raisin to make a mouth. Place 3 carrot sticks horizontally on each side of the raisin to create whiskers.
