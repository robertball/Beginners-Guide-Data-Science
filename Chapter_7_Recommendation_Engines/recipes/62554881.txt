Ingredients:
2/3 cup packed brown sugar (original recipe 1 cup)
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4-1/2 cup prepared horseradish (original recipe 1/4 cup)
1 Tablespoon Dijon or Grainy Mustard (or to taste)
1 Tablespoon of Worchestire sauce
taste of tabasco sauce (optional)
1/4 cup Barbecue sauce
2 pounds Turkey kielbasa sausage, sliced thin

Directions:
In a slow cooker combine the sugar, ketchup and horseradish. Add the sausage, and mix well. Cook on High until it starts to boil.  Reduce heat to Low, and cook until sauce thickens, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
I have found through trial and error, it is better baked in the oven rather than the slow cooker. Oven cooking gives it more of a "candied" apperarance, whereas the crock-pot version is more watery. If you want to try it the oven way, just well-grease or spray a 13 X 9 dish and bake at 350 for 90 minutes, stirring after every 30 minutes (or until it's as done as your family likes it. We prefer it a little dark.
