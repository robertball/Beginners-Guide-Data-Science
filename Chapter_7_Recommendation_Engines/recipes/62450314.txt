Ingredients:
25 large Roma tomatoes – preferably ripe and red
1 4oz can mild green chilies
3 large jalapenos
3 ring of fire chilies
2 large white onions
2 large green peppers, seeded
2 medium red peppers, seeded
2 tsp. minced garlic
¾ Cup vinegar
1 T. pickling spice
1 T sugar
1/2 T cilantro, chopped
1 Can tomato paste (if you need to add color/taste due to green tomatoes)

Directions:
Blanch and remove skin from the tomatoes
TIP: Prepare all of the tomatoes the day before and then package in batches – this will let some of the water drain out too
Remove some or all of the seeds from the hot peppers if you do not want hot salsa.  Experimenting is the best apprach here.
Chop all the veggies into big chunks nas then use a food processor to chop all of the vegetables to the desired consistency, tomatoes too.  Do not put too many in processor at one time or they will not chop evenly.
Add 1 habanero pepper to each batch if you want really hot salsa
Put all ingredients in a STAINLESS STEEL pot and then bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 20 mins
Put hot salsa into hot, sterilized jars and process for 30  - 35 mins (25 – 30 mins for pints/500 ml)

Description: 
Wonderful Salsa - leave all the seeds in the peppers if you like it hot, reduce if you prefer milder salsa.  the amount of juice in your tomatoes will affect the spicyness as well. more juice=less heat.
