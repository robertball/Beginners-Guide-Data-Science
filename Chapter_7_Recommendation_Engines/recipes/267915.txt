1 (10 ounce) can green enchilada sauce
1 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Heat oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Add onion and jalapeno peppers; cook until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in flour until incorporated.

Description: 
Change things up this winter by making chili with chicken instead of beef. For a milder version, you can substitute a green bell pepper for the jalapenos. Garnish with cheese and cilantro if desired.
