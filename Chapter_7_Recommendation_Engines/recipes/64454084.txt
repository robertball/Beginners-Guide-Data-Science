Description: 
The trouble with most vegan ice creams is texture and flavor. If you use just coconut milk, you end up with something that tastes watery, the coconut cream (not cream of coconut) is coconut milk with twice the fat, which helps in the flavor and texture departments. The corn syrup helps smooth out the texture as well. You end up with a delicious, rich, velvety chocolate ice cream that will have people wondering if it really is vegan or not.
