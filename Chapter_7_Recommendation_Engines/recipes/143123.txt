Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) frozen skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 (8 ounce) can low sodium tomato sauce
1/4 cup water
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning
1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans
4 cups baby spinach leaves
2 tablespoons fat-free sour cream
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1/2 cup salsa

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking dish.
Place the chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Mix the tomato sauce, water and taco seasoning in a small bowl; pour sauce over the chicken.
Bake in preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes.
Divide spinach between two plates. Place the chicken breasts on the spinach beds and spoon half the black beans over each piece. Divide sour cream, shredded cheese and salsa to top each salad.

Description: 
I call this diet haters' diet food because simple substitutions mean you won't feel deprived.  You shouldn't miss the tortilla chips because you have delicious black beans instead, and you still get the yummy spicy Mexican flavor and cheese. While not necessarily authentic, this salad is easy to make!  If you have time, it's is also wonderful topped with onions and maybe fresh jalapenos.
