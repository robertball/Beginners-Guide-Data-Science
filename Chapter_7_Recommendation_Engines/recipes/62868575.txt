Ingredients:
2 1/2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast, cubed
1/2 lb. onion, diced
4 carrots, peeled and diced
4 celery ribs, chopped
4 oz. butter
4 oz. olive oil
TT italian seasoning
TT minced garlic
TT salt
1 1/2 t. pepper
TT chicken base (NOT boullion)
1 g. chicken stock
NOODLES (home-made):
1 egg
2 T. milk
1/2 t. salt
1 c. flour

Directions:
Cook chicken in olive oil and italian seasoning. Set aside.
Cook vegetables in the same pan as the chicken, using the remaining butter and seasonings, until tender.
Put chicken and vegetables into the stock. Bring to a boil, then a low simmer. Add noodles at the end.
Taste and add chicken base as needed.
FOR NOODLES:
Mix all ingredients together.
Roll out onto a well-floured countertop and cut into desired sizes.
Add to soup when almost finished. Noodles are done when they float and don't taste doughy.
