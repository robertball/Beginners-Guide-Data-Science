Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup chopped black olives
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon oil
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups cooked shredded chicken
8 flour tortillas
oil for frying, or as needed
toothpicks

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; stir flour into butter until smooth. Add onion to flour-butter mixture; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix black olives, lemon juice, oil, paprika, black pepper, and salt into onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken into mixture and remove skillet from heat and cover.
Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan or deep-fryer.
Fill tortillas with chicken mixture. Roll tortilla around filling and secure with a toothpick.
Fry the rolled tortillas, working in batches, in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer fried tortillas to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon or tongs.
