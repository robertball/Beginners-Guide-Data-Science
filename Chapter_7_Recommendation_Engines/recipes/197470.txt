Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups water
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
1 cup kim chee
1/2 cup sliced cucumber
1/4 cup sliced carrots
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon Korean chile powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon water, or as needed
1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained

Directions:
Bring the rice and 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, ginger, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the kim chee, cucumber, and carrot. Pour in the soy sauce and rice vinegar. Season with salt, pepper, and chile powder. If the mixture becomes to thick, add 1 tablespoon of water. Gently stir in the tuna and continue cooking until the fish is heated through. Serve with rice.

Description: 
This is my favorite Korean dish and I eat it weekly at restaurants here in South Korea. It uses simple, cheap ingredients to create a spicy and filling dinner. If you like, you can add a fried egg to the side for extra protein, and some shredded sea weed (gim). Sprinkle the top with a few sesame seeds.
