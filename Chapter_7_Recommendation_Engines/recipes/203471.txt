Ingredients:
1 cup rye flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon caraway seed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon honey
1/4 cup water, or as needed

Directions:
Combine the rye flour, all-purpose flour, caraway seed, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. Stir in the canola oil and honey. While stirring with a fork, slowly add the water until the dough comes together in a ball. Cover and rest for 10 minutes.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Divide the dough into 4 sections, rolling each piece out on parchment paper to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into desired shape then place on a baking sheet. Prick each cracker a few times with a fork.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are brown and the crackers are crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove immediately to a cooling rack.
