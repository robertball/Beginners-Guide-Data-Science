Ingredients:
2 lbs	Pork loin, boneless roast
1/2 tsp	Garlic powder
1/2 tsp	Black pepper
1 tbsp	Brown sugar
1/2 tsp	Chili powder
1/2 tsp	Salt
1/2 tsp	Cumin
1/2 cup	Beef broth, reduced-sodium
1 tsp	Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup	Apple cider vinegar
2	Sweet onions
8	Sweet potatoes, medium-size
4 Tbsp Stubb'sÂ® Original All Natural Bar-B-Q Sauce (for drizzle) ((you may have to make your own if you are whole 30ing))

Directions:
Gather the spices, brown sugar (1/4c apple juice if you are a whole 30er), apple cider, beef broth, and worchestershire sauce (there is a whole 30 approved brand). Mix together well to make a wet rub. Rub pork well with the wet rub. Rough chop the onions and place in the bottom of a crock-pot. Place pork on top of onions. Cook on low for 6-8 hours, or on high for 4-6 hours.
Prepare sweet potatoes by piercing with a fork several time all over the potato. Place in micro wave for 5 minutes. Check for done-ness by poking with a fork, if it goes in easily it is done. If it is not done keep cooking in 3 minute intervals, checking for doneness each time.
To serve, shred pork well. Cut a sweet potato down the middle and press the ends to open, scoop a good amount of pulled pork onto/into the sweet potato and drizzle with b-b-q sauce.
