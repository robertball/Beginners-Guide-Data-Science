Ingredients:
1/2 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry Sheets
3/4 cup Prego® Traditional Italian Sauce
1/4 cup Pace® Picante Sauce
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup sliced pitted ripe olives

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 15x10-inch rectangle and place onto a baking sheet. Prick the pastry with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes or until the pastry is golden.
Stir the Italian sauce and picante sauce in a small bowl.  Spread the sauce mixture on the pastry to within 1/2-inch of the edges. Top with the cheeses and sprinkle with the olives. Bake for 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Cut the pizza into 8 pieces.
