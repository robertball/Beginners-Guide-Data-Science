Ingredients:
2 egg whites
16 fresh sage leaves (0.4-0.5 oz)
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (1 lb total weight)
2 oz prosciutto, thinly sliced
Â½ c seasoned bread crumbs
1 lemon, quartered

Directions:
1.    Preheat the oven to 375. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2.    In a shallow bowl, lightly beat the 2 egg whites. Place the bread crumbs on a separate shallow bowl or plate. Set aside.
3.    Lay out the four chicken breasts and press four sage leaves into the top of each breast. Lay the slices of prosciutto over the top of the sage. Carefully dip a chicken breast stack into the egg whites, wetting both sides, then coat the breast in bread crumbs. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining breasts. Press any remaining bread crumbs into the tops of the chicken pieces. Bake about 12 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Garnish with lemon wedges to squeeze over the top.
