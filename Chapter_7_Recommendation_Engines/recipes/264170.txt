Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 large egg
3/4 cup chocolate chips, or to taste
1 cup lightly packed dandelion petals

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
Stir flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center. Whisk milk, sugar, oil, and egg together in a separate bowl until evenly blended. Pour into the well and stir until batter is just combined. Gently stir in chocolate chips. Fold in dandelion petals until well blended.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.
