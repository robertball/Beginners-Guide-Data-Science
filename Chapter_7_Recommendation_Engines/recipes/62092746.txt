Ingredients:
2/3-3/4 loaf of pound cake
4 c. strawberries, divided (about 1 qt.)
1-1/3 c. blueberries, divided
4 c. Dole Berry Blend or other 100% juice
4 tsp. agar powder*
1 pt. heavy cream
4 Tbsp. mild-flavored honey

Directions:
Slice pound cake 1/2-3/4-inch thick.  Cover the bottom of a 9x13" pan with cake slices.
In a saucepan, sprinkle agar over fruit juice and let soak for 15 minutes.
Slice 1 cup of strawberries.
Simmer agar in juice until dissolved.  Let sit until thick, then stir in sliced strawberries and 1 cup of blueberries. Pour over pound cake and let sit until juice is firm.
Whip cream until foamy.  Add honey and continue whipping until peaks form.
Spread sweetened whipped cream gently over juice.
Place blueberries over whipped cream to form the blue field of the American flag.
Cut remaining strawberries into halves or quarters (depending on size) and place on whipped cream to form stripes.
*If you cannot locate agar, you can use unflavored gelatin.  You will need 4 envelopes.  Soften gelatin in 1 cup of the juice.  Boil the remaining 3 cups and stir into the softened gelatin mixture.  Gelatin will need to be refrigerated for each of the subsequent steps, as it does not set up at room temperature (as agar does).

Description: 
I liked the looks of the Wave Your Flag Cake by Jell-O, but I didn't like all the sugar and chemicals.  This is my all-natural version.
