Ingredients:
Topping:
1 tbsp. light wihipped butter or light buttery spread (like Brummel & Brown)
1/4 cup brown sugar (not packed)
7 pineapple rings packed in juice, drained
7 marashino cherries
Cake:
Half of an 18.25 box (about 1 1/2 cups) moist-style yellow cake mix
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup club soda
1/4 cup no-sugar-added applesauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray a round cake pan with nonstick spray and set aside.
Place butter in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave for about 15 secons, just until melted.
Add brown sugar and mix well.
Spread mixture evenly along the bottom of the cake pan.  Set aside.
Blot pineapple rings and cherries with paper towels to remove any excess moisture.  Lay pineapple rings in an even layer in the cake pan, and  place one cherry in the center of each pineapple ring.  Set aside.
To make the batter, combine cake mix with backing powder in a large bowl.  Mix well.  Add club soda and applesauce, and stir until smooth.
Evenly pour batter into the cake pan over the fruit layer.  Bake in the oven until a toothpick comes out clean. 30-35 minutes.
Allow cake to col completely.  Firmly and securely place a plate over the pan, and carefully flip so the plate is on the bottom.  Gently life pan to release the cake.
Cut into 8 clices
