Ingredients:
5 pounds pork roast
7 cups sauerkraut
1 (46 fluid ounce) bottle tomato-vegetable juice cocktail
1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the Pork Roast in the center of a large roasting pan.
In a large bowl combine the sauerkraut and tomato-vegetable juice. Sweeten to taste with the white sugar. Pour this mixture around the pork roast.
Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven until the roast has an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 30 minutes per pound. Remove the foil for the last 15 minutes of cooking.
