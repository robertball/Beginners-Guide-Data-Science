Ingredients:
1 whole Beef Brisket, Trimmed Of All Fat (5 To 8 Pounds)
1 bottle (24 Ounce) Ketchup Or Chili Sauce (make Sure It's Kosher)
1 package Onion Soup Mix (make Sure It's Kosher)

Directions:
Place trimmed brisket into a large baking pan.
Mix ketchup with onion soup mix. Add 1 cup of water or more to make it slightly thin.
Pour sauce over the meat, cover pan with foil, and marinate 12 to 24 hours in the fridge.
Place covered pan into a 275-degree oven and walk away for 6 to 8 hours, depending on how large the brisket is. Check tenderness when brisket has been cooking several hours: stick in two forks and pull in opposite directions. Meat should come apart easily.
When meat is done, remove from oven and place on a cutting board. Slice against the grain; don't be disturbed if meat totally falls apart! That means it's good.
Either return the sliced meat to the sauce until serving, or place meat on a platter and spoon sauce over the top.
