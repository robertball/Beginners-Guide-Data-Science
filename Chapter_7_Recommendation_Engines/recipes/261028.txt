Ingredients:
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Wrap the handle of a wooden spoon with aluminum foil. Balance between 2 tall cans.
Spread Cheddar cheese on the prepared baking sheets into four 6-inch circles placed 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts and is lightly brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Cool for 2 to 3 minutes. Lift with a spatula and drape over the wrapped wooden handle; cool until set, about 10 minutes.
