Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
3 large onions, diced
2 large yellow bell peppers, chopped
2 large red bell peppers, chopped
2 serrano chile peppers, diced
1 (1.25 ounce) package hot chili seasoning (such as McCormick®)
1 pound 80% lean ground beef
2 (16 ounce) cans light red kidney beans (such as Bush's®), rinsed and drained
1 (16 ounce) can great Northern beans (such as Bush's®), rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can tomato puree (such as Contadina™)
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes (such as Hunt's®)
2 cups ketchup (such as Hunt's®), or as needed
1 habanero pepper, diced
3 tablespoons white sugar
4 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Sargento® Authentic Mexican) (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute until translucent, 6 to 9 minutes. Add bell peppers. Saute until soft, stirring occasionally, 6 to 9 minutes. Stir in serrano peppers and hot chili seasoning; continue mixing for another 3 to 6 minutes. Transfer onions and peppers to a large pot.
Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 6 to 9 minutes. Transfer to the large pot.
Pour kidney beans, Northern beans, tomato puree, and diced tomatoes into the pot. Add ketchup in order to achieve desired consistency. Stir in habanero pepper and sugar. Simmer chili over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 36 minutes. Top with Mexican cheese blend.

Description: 
This spicy beef chili is a recipe I whipped together after getting bored with the soup-like chilis that are all too common among our friends and families. The style is spicy, yet sweet and mildly thick. The ingredients should be easily found in any supermarket. Serve with French bread and butter.
