Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chili-lime seasoning (such as Tajin®)
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2  eggs, or more as needed
2 tablespoons hot sauce
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small squares
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Combine flour, garlic powder, chili-lime seasoning, black pepper, seasoned salt, Cajun seasoning, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl.
Mix eggs and hot sauce together in a separate bowl until well blended.
Dip chicken pieces in egg mixture; coat lightly in flour mixture. Dip into eggs again and coat thoroughly in flour mixture.
Heat oil in a large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) until a drop of water dropped on the pan sizzles. Add chicken; cook until crispy and golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
