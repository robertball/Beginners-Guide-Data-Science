Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 cup cornmeal
1 teaspoon salt
1 pound Italian sausage
2 garlic cloves, minced

Directions:
Combine water, cornmeal and salt in a double boiler or heavy saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, brown the sausage and garlic in a large skillet; drain. Cool slightly. Cut sausage into 1-in. pieces; return to the skillet. Add parsley, tomatoes and tomato paste; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat.
Spread half of the cornmeal mixture in a serving dish; top with half of the sausage mixture. Repeat layers. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.

This recipe came from my mom, who brought it over from Europe. When I first made it, everyone wanted to know where I got the recipe. I've copied it numerous times for friends.
