Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups water
1 (6 ounce) package raspberry flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 (12 fluid ounce) can very cold evaporated milk
1 cup fresh raspberries for garnish

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in gelatin until completely dissolved, then place into refrigerator until cool (but not solid).
Pour evaporated milk into a large bowl, and whip with a hand mixer until fluffy and doubled in volume. While continuing to beat, slowly pour in cooled gelatin. When all of the gelatin has been incorporated, pour the mixture into a mold or bowl and chill until set, about 3 hours. Once set, serve garnished with raspberries.

Description: 
This is a deliciously light dessert that works well for summer picnics or even between cake layers. My Peruvian mother-in-law was kind enough to give me this recipe, and I thought you might like it, as well.
