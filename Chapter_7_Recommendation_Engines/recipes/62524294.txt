Ingredients:
12	ounces boneless beef chuck
2       cans green beans drained (or 16 oz. frozen)
1	5 ½ ounce package dry au gratin potato mix
½	teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
3	cups water
1 ½	cups half and half or light cream (I used ¾ cup half and half) you could probably get away with whole milk.
Finely shredded Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
1.	Trim fat from meat.  Cut meat into ¾ inch pieces.  In a 3 ½ to 4 quart slow cooker combine the meat, green beans, dry potatoes, sauce mix from potatoes, and thyme.  Pour the water into the cooker.
2.	Cover and cook on low heat setting for 7 to 8 hours or on high heat setting 3 ½ to 4 hours.
3.	If using high heat setting, turn to low heat setting.  Stir half and half into potato mixture.  Cover and cook about 15 minutes more or until heated through.  To serve, ladle stew into bowls.  If desired, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
