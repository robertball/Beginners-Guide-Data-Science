Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups shredded zucchini
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients. In another bowl, beat the eggs, oil, sour cream and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in zucchini and nuts.
Transfer to two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 60-65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 15 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
'Sour cream makes this the best quick bread I've ever come across,' notes Audrey Lavoie. The Centerville, Ohio bake adds plenty of chopped pecans for a fun crunch that enhances the loaf's zucchini flavor.
