Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
1 (14.5 ounce) can pitted tart red cherries, undrained
1 (12 ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed
1 cup fresh blueberries or frozen blueberries, thawed
1 cup SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons butter
Optional topping: Frozen low-fat vanilla yogurt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees  F.
Unroll and fit one piecrust into a 9-inch pie plate; set aside.
Drain cherries, raspberries, and blueberries (if frozen), reserving 1 cup of the juices. Set berries and juice aside.
Combine SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener and cornstarch in a medium saucepan; gradually stir in reserved juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to boil. Boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in butter and reserved fruit. Cool slightly and spoon mixture into pie shell.
Unroll remaining piecrust; roll to 1/8-inch thickness: place over filling. Fold edges under and crimp. Cut slits in top to allow steam to escape.
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until crust is golden. Cover edges with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning, if necessary. Cool on a wire rack. Serve with a scoop of frozen low-fat vanilla yogurt, if desired.
