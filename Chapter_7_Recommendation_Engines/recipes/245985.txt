Ingredients:
Meatballs:
cooking spray
1 teaspoon olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Sauce:
1 (14.25 ounce) can low-sodium beef broth
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste (optional)
1/4 cup light sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish lightly with cooking spray.
Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Let cool briefly, about 5 minutes.
Combine onion mixture, turkey, bread crumbs, egg, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoon parsley, allspice, and nutmeg in a large bowl; mix well to combine. Form mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Transfer to baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Pour beef broth into a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Add flour; seal and shake vigorously until flour is dissolved.
Pour beef broth mixture into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoon parsley, black pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in sour cream and meatballs. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe as a way to lighten up the original dish. Nobody in my family even realized they were eating turkey! Serve over egg noodles if desired.
