Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup butter, softened
1 egg
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
3 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Add egg and vanilla; continue to cream until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended.  Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C ).
Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place onto a cookie sheet.  Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart. Lightly grease the bottom of a glass, dip it into the granulated sugar, and press the cookies down slightly. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on wire racks.

Description: 
A  lot like a sugar cookie but ten times better. These cookies have a wonderful rich flavor, a very nice side to ice cream.
