Description: 
A cross between a scone and a crumpet, these easy to make biscuits will be the star of any meal, and you'll love that you don't need to heat up an oven. I searched for years before finding a bacon and cheese version of this recipe, which I modified to make this plain version that I love. When I finally found it I was amazed at how easy these are to make!
