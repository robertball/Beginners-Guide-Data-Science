Ingredients:
4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush the skin-side of each piece with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.
Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and sprinkle half the seasoning mixture evenly over the 4 chicken thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle remaining seasoning mixture on top. Place chicken thighs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, skin-side up.
Fry in the preheated air fryer until chicken is brown and juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
