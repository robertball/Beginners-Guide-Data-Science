2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup unsweetened apple juice
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon fresh grated lemon zest
1 tablespoon butter
6 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup golden raisins (optional)

1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Coat an 8-inch square baking dish with cooking spray; set aside.
Whisk together SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, flour, cinnamon, apple juice, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a medium bowl; set aside.
Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add apples and cook, stirring often, until softened, 8 minutes. Stir in apple juice mixture and bring to a boil; stir in raisins, if desired. Spoon apple mixture into prepared baking dish.
Topping Instructions:  Combine flour, SPLENDA(R) Granulated Sweetener, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; add butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal.
