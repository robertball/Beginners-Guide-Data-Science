Ingredients:
Vanilla Ice Cream
2 1/8 cups All purpose gluten free flour
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup granulated sugar
13 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 egg at room temperature, beaten
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoons cornstarch
3 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

Directions:
Pour the ice cream into any of the molds.
Put the molds into the freezer for 1 hour or until firm enough to hold a stick in place, and place a popsicle stick in the center of each. Return to freezer & freeze solid { At least 4 hours}.
Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheets with unbleached parchment paper & set them aside. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt & sugar, whisk to combine well.
Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients & add the butter, egg, and vanilla, mixing to combine after each addition. The dough should be thick but relatively soft. Divide the cookie in half placing each in a small bowl. Add the cornstarch to 1 half & mix to combine, kneading with clean hands at the end. Add the cocoa powder to the other half & mix to combine, kneading with clean hands at the end. Roll out 1 piece of the dough about 1/3 inch thick between 2 sheets of unbleached parchment paper. Uncover the top sheet of parchment paper & using a pastry wheel, pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough into rectangles of roughly the same size, each about 2 inches x 1 1/2 inches, Place about 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Gather & reroll scraps. Repeat with remaining piece of dough. Place the baking sheets, one at a time, in the center of the preheated oven & bake until just set & not shiny on top { 8-9 Minutes}. Don't overbake. Remove from the oven & allow to cool for 5 minutes before crumbling in your palms into small crumbs. Combine the chocolate & vanilla crumbs in a bowl & mix.
Remove the ice cream pops from the molds by running warm water along the outside of each mold & lifting the pops out. If the pops are melted when you remove them, place them on parchment-lined cutting board or other flat surface & place back in the freezer until firm. Remove the frozen pops from the freezer & press into the cake crunch mixture carefully but firmly to help the mixture adhere to all sides of each pop. Serve or wrap tightly & freeze until ready to serve.
