Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup sliced almonds
water (1 inch in bottom of pan to steam)
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, divided
1 bunch asparagus, rinsed and trimmed (trim about 2 in. off bottoms of spears)
1 pinch garlic pepper

Directions:
Over medium-low heat melt butter in a small pan. Add almonds and stir. Keep an eye on almonds and butter, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. You want a nice rich even browning.
Meanwhile, in a separate medium/large sized saucepan, insert steamer basket and add water until you have just under an inch of water in it (make sure the water level is below the bottom of your steamer basket). Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and turn heat up to high.
As soon as water comes to a boil, add asparagus to steamer basket in saucepan and cover. Reduce heat to medium-high.
Steam for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of your spears.
Once almonds have browned, remove from heat.
Place cooked asparagus on a serving dish.
Add garlic pepper and remaining tablespoon lemon juice to the butter and almonds. Stir and then pour all over asparagus.
Serve immediately.
