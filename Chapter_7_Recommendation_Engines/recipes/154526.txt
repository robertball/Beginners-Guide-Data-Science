Ingredients:
5 medium beets, scrubbed
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup mayonnaise
20 pitted prunes, chopped
3 cloves garlic, pressed
salt to taste

Directions:
Place the beets into a saucepan and fill with just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer over medium heat until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 20 minutes. Drain and rub off peels. Run under cold water until cool enough to handle, then grate using the largest setting. Place in a serving bowl.
Stir the walnuts, prunes and garlic into the beets, then mix in the mayonnaise and season to taste with salt.

Description: 
This beet salad works great as a side dish.  It's garlicky, creamy, sweet, a little crunchy, and a little salty.  Enjoy this authentic Russian recipe that everyone in my family always makes.
