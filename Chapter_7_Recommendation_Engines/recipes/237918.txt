Description: 
Divine recipe! This is a great marinade for any cut of beef, but it's d-i-v-i-n-e to use on steak. It contains basic ingredients that, when combined and allowed to blend, will give you a tender, juicy piece of meat every time! Don't be afraid it's too salty as written, it's not! Add any spices to your taste and soak overnight!
