Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 thinly-sliced boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
Salt and pepper
4 teaspoons whole-wheat flour, divided
1 medium shallot, minced
2 tablespoons drained capers
1/2 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Directions:
Warm oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Pat chicken breasts with paper towels to thoroughly dry. Season chicken with salt and pepper, then lightly coat with flour, using about 1 tsp for each breast.
Lay chicken in skillet; cook 2 to 3 minutes, until golden brown, gently pressing down on breast to ensure equal browning. Reduce heat to medium. Turn breasts; cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, until golden brown and cooked through.  Remove breasts to a serving platter.
Reduce heat to low; add shallots and capers to skillet. Cook 30 seconds, stirring. Add broth and juice, cook 1 minute, until incorporated and thickened, stirring. Stir in parsley, pour sauce over chicken. Serve immediately.

Description: 
In minutes, you will have a completely satisfying Phase Two & Three main dish you'll make again and again. Feel free to double the recipe for a crowd (but use two skillets), or halve the recipe for an intimate dinner. Make sure to buy thinly sliced breasts - they are usually sold four to a package. If you cant find them, slice a medium-sized breast crosswise, resulting in a 1/2-inch thick piece, about 4 oz in weight. Place each piece between two sheets of plastic wrap and lightly pound to flatten to an even thickness.
