Ingredients:
6 Large Red Potatoes
½ Onion
½ Can or 1 Small Can of Petite Peas
1 Cup of Diced Celery
4 Eggs
Salad Dressing
Mustard
1 Cup of Diced Cucumber

Directions:
First peel the potatoes (peeling them is optional, but make sure you take out the bad spots) and dice them into small pieces and boil them. Hard boil your eggs at the same time. Shell the eggs. Store potatoes and eggs in the fridge until cold or run cold water over them until they are extremely cold. It doesn't matter how big you cut the vegetables are, how small they are is your choice. In a large salad bowl put your cut up vegetables and eggs in. Lastly, put about 3 tbsp. of Salad Dressing in; be careful not to put too much in. Also, put a squirt of mustard in for flavor and color (optional). Store in the fridge until you’re ready to eat.
