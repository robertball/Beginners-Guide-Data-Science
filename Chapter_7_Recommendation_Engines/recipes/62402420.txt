Description: 
I came across this recipe many years ago in a locally printed magazine where anyone could submit their favorite hoiday recipe and story.  This came from a lady in Pelham Alabama whose grandmother made this cake every Christmas.  She wrote it later became her own family tradition to bake this wonderful cake.  It is a wonderful cake, not too fruity and makes the entire house smell like the holidays.  I hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I have over the years.
