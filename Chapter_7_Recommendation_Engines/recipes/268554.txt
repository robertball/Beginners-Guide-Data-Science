Ingredients:
6 ounces chopped dried mango
3 1/2 cups unsweetened flaked coconut, divided
8 tablespoons coconut oil
2 teaspoons agave syrup, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place mango in a bowl and cover with cold water. Soak until mango has softened, about 2 hours. Drain well.
Combine mango, 2 1/2 cups of coconut, and coconut oil in a blender; blend until well combined and smooth. Add agave syrup if mixture is not sweet enough. Place in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until mixture has hardened, about 2 hours.
Roll into small balls and dredge in remaining 1 cup coconut flakes. Refrigerate until serving.

Description: 
You need only 3 ingredients for these delicious vegan truffles and they are 100% natural. You can sweeten them with agave syrup if you like but I think they are sweet enough as is.
