Description: 
When the American Colonies were being settled Journey Cakes were a common food because they traveled well. Originally consisting of only cornmeal, water and salt and cooked on a griddle recipes evolved into what we now know as Johnny Cakes or Cornbread. This version includes the goodness of pure Maple Syrup and is wonderful on it's own or drizzled with additional Maple Syrup.
