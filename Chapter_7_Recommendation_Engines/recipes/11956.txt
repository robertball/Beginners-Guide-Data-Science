1 fresh poblano chile pepper, seeded and minced
1 clove garlic, minced

Directions:
Cook the pasta in a large pot of 4 quarts boiling salted water until al dente. Add the poblano pepper to the boiling water when you add the pasta. Drain water from pasta and remove poblano pepper.
Using a blender, puree together the poblano pepper, garlic, onion and cream.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the blended sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked and drained pasta and grated mozzarella cheese. Cook for 10 minutes. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This recipe relies upon a Mexican way to cook pasta. For a heartier variation stir in a little cooked and diced chicken. Poblano peppers are a dark green chile with a flavor that can range from mild to slightly spicy. They are usually around 4 to 5 inches long and are sometimes known as Ancho or Mulato chiles.
