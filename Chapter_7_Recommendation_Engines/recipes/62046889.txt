Ingredients:
1/4 pound bacon, about 4 slices, chopped
1/2 medium onion, chopped
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 can whole kernel corn, undrained
1 can chicken broth (or water)
salt and pepper, to taste
1 can evaporated skim milk
1 cup milk
1/4 cup flour
Old Bay Seafood seasoning (or other seasoning as desired)

Directions:
In large saucepan, brown bacon until crisp. Add onion and saute until just tender.
Add potatoes, corn with liquid and chicken broth. Salt and pepper.
Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer for 20 - 30 minutes.
In small bowl or cup, whisk together 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup flour. Add to pot, along with the evaporated skim milk and the rest of the milk.
Simmer until warmed through and thickened.
Adjust seasonings as desired.
Notes: I have also made this with all regular milk, sometimes whole, sometimes 1 or 2%. You could also use half and half if you want it extra creamy. You can also make this a vegetarian soup by using soy bacon and vegetable broth.

Description: 
A wonderful creamy soup loved by kids and adults alike.There are any number of variations. I don't think I've ever made it the same way twice. That's why I decided now would be a good time to write down the recipe.
