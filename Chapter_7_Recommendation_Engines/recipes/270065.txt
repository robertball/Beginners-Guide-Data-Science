8 1-inch-thick beef tenderloin steaks
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Pat meat dry and season with salt and black pepper to taste.
Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add fillets and cook to desired doneness, 4 to 5 minutes for medium. Transfer filets to a serving plate and pour off fat from the skillet. Add wine and bring to a boil to deglaze pan. Stir in stock and cream and boil sauce until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add tomatoes and basil and blend well.
Pour sauce over beef on the serving plate.

Description: 
Simple. Elegant. Delicious. Great recipe for very special occasions. I serve with garlic mashed potatoes (or sometimes wild rice), green beans with cherry tomatoes (recipe on this site), green salad with sweet poppy seed dressing (my published recipe on this site), and homemade sweet dinner rolls (recipe on this site). Enjoy!
