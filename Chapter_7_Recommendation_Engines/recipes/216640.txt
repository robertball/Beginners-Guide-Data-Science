Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and chopped
1 large butternut squash, peeled, seeded and chopped into 1-inch pieces
2 stems fresh thyme
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
3 cups water, or as needed to cover
2 cups Silk Pure Almond Original
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
4 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds, for garnish

Directions:
Heat a 5-quart soup pot over medium-low heat; add olive oil and heat for 1 minute. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add apple, squash, thyme, bay leaf, nutmeg and enough water to cover ingredients. Turn heat to medium high and cook for 15-18 minutes, stirring occasionally, until squash is tender. Stir in Pure Almond and heat through.
Remove from heat, remove thyme stems and bay leaf and allow mixture to cool for 5 minutes. In two to three separate batches, puree soup in a blender or food processor until smooth and creamy. Return to saucepan and reheat. Add nutmeg and lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in warm bowls garnished with toasted sliced almonds.
