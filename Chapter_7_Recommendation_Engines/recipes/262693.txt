Description: 
I have this for breakfast most mornings. The extra calcium is a plus. I add honey and granola for a delicious and filling breakfast. You can use your imagination with additions such as fresh fruit, preserves, or even chopped nuts. I have made this with flavored yogurt, but I prefer plain. You can even use the yogurt fluid (whey) instead of water in baking recipes.
