Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 bunch fresh asparagus
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1/2 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray.
Snip the white ends off of the asparagus so that all of the stalks are roughly the same length. Lay the stalks on a baking sheet so that they are all touching.
Drizzle asparagus stalks with olive oil. Shake the onion soup mix packet to mix up any settled ingredients; sprinkle over asparagus.
Bake in the preheated oven until softened and lightly browned, 25 to 35 minutes.
Remove from oven; sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top of the asparagus. Continue baking until cheese is melted and starting to brown, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
I never liked asparagus growing up until I tried this baked asparagus recipe that my aunt made. Now I eat it almost every week. Highly recommend this recipe for kids who are fussy about eating asparagus or vegetables. If you like asparagus, you will love this! Super easy to make.
