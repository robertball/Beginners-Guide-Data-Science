Ingredients:
1 potato, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 carrot, sliced
6 cups water
1/2 (16 ounce) package soft tofu, drained and cut into cubes
1 ounce wakame seaweed
10 white mushroom caps, quartered
8 tablespoons miso paste with dashi
2 tablespoons chopped scallions, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Place potato cubes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer almost soft, about 7 to 10 minutes. Add carrot slices and boil until tender, 3 to 5 more minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, bring 6 cups water to boil in a medium saucepan. Add tofu and wakame seaweed, cook for 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, miso paste, and cooked potatoes and carrots. Reduce heat to low and cook for 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped scallions.
