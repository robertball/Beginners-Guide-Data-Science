Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless pork chops, cut into small pieces
1 T. olive oil
1 ½ lbs. ground beef
1 small, minced onion
3 T. chili powder
1 T. minced garlic
1 T. seasoning salt
1 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. dried oregano
4 cans chili beans, ( I like to mix different brands, i.e. “San Antonio style”, and regular)
3 cans Mexican style stewed tomatoes, chopped
2 T. brown sugar
1 tsp. liquid smoke

Directions:
Heat olive oil in large sauté pan, and brown pork.  Transfer pork to slow cooker.  In the same pan, brown ground beef, minced onion, garlic, and spices.  Transfer this to slow cooker as well.  Add beans, and stewed tomatoes, brown sugar, and liquid smoke to slow cooker, mix, and cook on low for 6-8 hours.  Serve with corn chips, sour cream, grated cheese, jalapenos, and chopped onion.

Description: 
I tried for years to come up with a fabulous chili recipe, and this is it.
I prepare it in a slow cooker, but you could do it faster on the stovetop.
