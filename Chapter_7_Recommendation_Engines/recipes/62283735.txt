Ingredients:
8-9 Asparagus spears
1/2 16 ounce phyllo dough thawed
1/4 c butter, meled
1/4 Parmesan Cheese finely grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Snap off tough ends of asparagus. Unwrap phyllo pastry and cut stack in half, lengthwise. Reserve remaining dough for a later use. Cover remaining phyllo lightly to keep dough from drying out. Take one piece of phyllo and brush lightly with melted butter. Sprinkle with cheese. Place 2 to 3 asparagus spears on short end of phyllo. Roll up, jelly-roll style. Place each piece, seam side down, on a baking sheet, brush with butter and sprinkle with cheese. Repeat until all the asparagus spears are rolled. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
