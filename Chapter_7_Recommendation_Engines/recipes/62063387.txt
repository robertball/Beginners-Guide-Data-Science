Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
1 C all purpose flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
3/4 C milk
1 C vegetable oil for frying
1/2 C honey
1/4 C dijon mustard
sesame seeds to sprinkle

Directions:
Blend honey and mustard in a small bowl and set aside.
Cut chicken into 1/2 x 2 inch strips. Mix flour, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl. Dip chicken into milk and roll into flour mixture to coat well. Place chicken on waxed paper.
Pour 1/4 inch of oil into a large heavy skillet.  Heat over medium high heat until it reaches about 350 degrees F.
Divide chicken into batches.  Place chicken in an even layer in hot oil and fry, only turning once for about 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.
Serve with sauce and spinkle sesame seeds just before eating!!  Enjoy!

This is the perfect appetizer! My neighbor turned me on to this 4 years ago and I've been making it ever since! (My family as even requested this with a side order of mashed potatoes and a veggie!!!)
