Description: 
I took this Bob's Red Mill recipe and made my own b my lowering the fat and sugar.  The pumpkin makes this moist and flavorful, and really very healthy!  Great alternative to fattening holiday breads, just add your favorite nuts/fruits.  Just add cream cheese frosting, and it becomes a fabulous desert.
