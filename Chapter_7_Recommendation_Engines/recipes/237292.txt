Ingredients:
1 quart olive oil for frying, or as needed
5 tablespoons coconut milk
1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
1 egg
2 tablespoons almond flour
2 tablespoons coconut flour
2 teaspoons honey
1/4 teaspoon guar gum
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep fryer or in a large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat coconut milk, all-purpose flour, egg, almond flour, coconut flour, honey, and guar gum together in a bowl using a hand blender until batter resembles thick pancake batter.
Drop batter by rounded spoonfuls, working in batches, into the hot oil; fry until donuts are dark brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove donuts with a slotted spoon. Pour confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll donuts in confectioners' sugar until coated.

Description: 
I had so much trouble finding GF donuts that I had to play around in the kitchen to make one myself. The consistency is light, airy, and resembles a yeast donut. Enjoy!
