1 small box, any flavor, jello
7 envelopes Know gelatim
1/2 cup water

Directions:
In a pan mix together Jello and the envelopes of gelatin. They must be totally blended before water is added.
Stir in the water. Don't worry, after it starts getting warm the mixture should smooth out.
Heat on medium until all the gelatin is disolved.
Pour into candy molds. If you do not have molds, pour into a flat dish large enough so the mixture is around 1/4 inch thick. Place molds or pan in the freezer to help candy set.
When solid, pour out of the molds or cut into bite size pieces.
