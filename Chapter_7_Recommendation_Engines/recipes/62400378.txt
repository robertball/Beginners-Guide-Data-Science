Ingredients:
6 eggs (not large ones)
3 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable shortening
1 tsp vanilla
5 to 8 cups flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 cup buttermilk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Cream together eggs, sugar, and shortening.  Stir in Vanilla.
Sift together 5 cups flour, the baking soda and baking powder.
Add dry ingredients to the egg, sugar, shortening mixture, alternating with buttermilk.
At this point, you can add more flour to just make a workable dough that will roll out, but still be very soft.  More flour will get worked into dough as it is rolled.
Spread dough onto floured surface and sprinkle top with just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to rolling pin.
Roll to about 1/4 inch thickness, or as desired.  Cut with biscuit or cookie cutter, and place 2 inches apart on parchment lined baking sheets.
Bake at 350 for 17 to 20 minutes.  Allow to cool slightly before removing to cooling rack.

Description: 
These are the tea cakes my grandmother was famous for.  Since she was a little of this and a bit of that sort of cook, obtaining this recipe was a matter of watching her make them while madly taking notes and measuring for her.  My mother prefers them really thin and slightly crisp.  I want mine thicker and soft all the way so it's all personal preference.
