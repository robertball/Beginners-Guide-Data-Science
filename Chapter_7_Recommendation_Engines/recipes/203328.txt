Ingredients:
1/2 cup small pearl tapioca
1 mango - peeled, seeded and diced
14 ice cubes
1/2 cup coconut milk

Directions:
Fill a pot with water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the tapioca pearls, and return to a boil. Cook the tapioca pearls uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Cover and remove from heat, allowing pearls to rest for 30 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, then cover and refrigerate.
Place mango and ice in a blender and blend until smooth. Divide chilled tapioca pearls in 2 tall glasses, then layer the mango mixture over and top each glass with a 1/4 cup of coconut milk.
