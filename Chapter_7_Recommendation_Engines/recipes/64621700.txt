Ingredients:
1/2 red & orange bell pepper, small, cut into 1" cubes
1/4 red onion, medium, cut into 1" cubes, separated
4 oz. portabella mushrooms, baby, halved
1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
1/4 tsp. sea salt
3/4 c. sugar snap peas
1 zaucchini, small, sliced 1/4" thick
1 summer squash, yellow, small, sliced 1/4" thick
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp. basil, fresh, snipped
1/2 c. walnuts, coarsely chopped

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 F.  Place bell peppers, onion, and mushrooms in a large bowl and toss with olive oil and salt.  Place in a single layer on a large baking sheet, making sure not to crowd vegetables.  Cook for 10 minutes.
2.  Add snap peas, zucchini, yellow squash, and garlic and stir lightly.  Top with walnuts and cook for 5 to 10 minutes more, or until all vegetables are crisp-tender and walnuts are toasted.
3. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and toss well.  Sprinkle with basil.

Really good recipe. I made it without the walnuts; that just seemed a little weird.
