Ingredients:
4 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups milk
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded Gouda cheese
3 tablespoons crumbled cooked bacon

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes in a 1-1/2-qt. microwave-safe dish; add water. Cover and microwave on high for 8-10 minutes or until tender.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, saute onion in butter until tender. Add spinach. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Remove from the heat.
Drain sweet potatoes. Spread half of the spinach mixture into a greased 11-in. x 7-in. baking dish. Top with half of the potatoes and cheese. Repeat layers. Sprinkle with bacon. Cover and bake at 375Â° for 10-15 minutes or until bubbly. Yield: 4 servings.
