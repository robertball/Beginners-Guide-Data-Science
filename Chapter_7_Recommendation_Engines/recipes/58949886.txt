Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2lbs or 5 each mashed overripe bananas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, mix together sugar, brown sugar and vegetable oil. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. If the top of the loaf begins to brown too much before it is done baking, loosely cover the top with foil to prevent over-browning.

Description: 
This banana bread bakes up into a dense and chewy loaf that packs a big banana punch.  To make mine budget friendly I ask the produce manager at my local grocer for any old bananas they may have in back, they are usually free or sold at a significantly reduced price. I also replaced the butter with vegetable oil to save some money without sacrificing flavor.Modified from: Banana Banana Bread
