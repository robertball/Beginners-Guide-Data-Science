Hasselback Potatoes Recipe

Ingredients:
olive oil (to drizzle)
2 large potatoes
shredded cheese for topping
butter stick
cheese (I used Pepper Jack, the original recipe calls for Parmesan)
sea salt
garlic powder
sour cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
Place two wooden spoons in the bottom of the potato, as shown in the picture. This will help you prevent cutting through all the potato, as you should only cut like 7/8 of the potato. Start sliding the potato, without cutting through all the potato.
Thinly slice butter. Place them in the potato openings, alternating with cheese slices (Ranchero, or Parmesan). I placed them in aluminium foil before placing them in the baking tray, because I figured butter would melt. Also because it's easier to transfer to serving plate.
Drizzle some olive oil on top of the potatoes and sprinkle some sea salt. I used sea salt with fine herbs.
Bake for 45 minutes - or until fully cooked.
Top with sour cream and shredded cheese.
