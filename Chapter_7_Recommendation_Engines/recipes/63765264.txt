Ingredients:
1 bag white chocolate chips
1 box Rice Chex cereal , about 9 cups
1 cup powdered sugar
1 cup funfetti cake mix
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter
2-3 tablespoons colored sprinkles (optional)

Directions:
Lay a piece of waxed paper on a cookie sheet and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and cake mix and set aside.
Place the Chex cereal in another large bowl.
Melt the white chocolate chips and butter in the microwave. Time depends on your microwave â€“ I microwave mine for about a minute, stir, and see how much longer it needs.
Once the chocolate is melted, mix in vanilla and gradually pour the chocolate over the chex cereal and stir until each piece is coated.
Quickly add the sprinkles and stir to combine.
Then gradually add the cake mix mixture and stir until all of the cereal is well coated.
Pour the puppy chow onto the cookie sheet and let it cool for at least 15 minutes.
Once cooled place in sealed container or ziploc bags
