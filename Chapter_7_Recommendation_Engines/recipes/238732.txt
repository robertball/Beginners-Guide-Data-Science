Ingredients:
4 cups milk
1/4 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder, or more to taste
1/2 cup plain kefir

Directions:
Preheat a yogurt maker or slow cooker on Low.
Whisk milk and dry milk powder together in a saucepan over medium heat until almost boiling, about 4 minutes. Cool milk to lukewarm (100 to 110 degrees F/38 to 45 degrees C).
Gently stir kefir into milk mixture until just blended. Pour mixture into yogurt containers or slow cooker. Cook on Low
Cook on Low until desired level of tartness and yogurt consistency is reached, 4 to 10 hours. Chill yogurt in the refrigerator, at least 2 hours.

Description: 
This recipe is my variation of one that came with my yogurt maker. It's easy to create Greek yogurt from this, too!  Simply strain the yogurt in a colander lined with fine cheesecloth or coffee filters. Using kefir at the start creates a much more tart yogurt from the start; it tastes a lot like Sana from Europe. You can substitute plain yogurt with live active cultures for the kefir, if desired. Save 1/2 cup of yogurt to use a starter, if desired. Eat yogurt within a week.
