Ingredients:
3 slices bacon
cooking spray
2 eggs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Place bacon slices in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain slices on paper towels. Crumble into pieces and set aside.
Spray another skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Crack eggs side by side into the skillet; season with salt and black pepper. Cook until egg whites are set and firm, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip eggs. Sprinkle bacon pieces and Cheddar cheese over one egg. Continue cooking to desired doneness and cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes more.  Place second egg on top. Transfer to serving dish.
