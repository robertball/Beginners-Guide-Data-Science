Ingredients:
1 cup of sugar
6 Tbsp butter
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
heat sugar on moderately high heat in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart or 3-quart saucepan. as the sugar begins to melt, stir vigorously with a whisk or wooden spoon. as soon as the sugar comes to a boil, stop stirring. you can swirl the pan a bit if you want, from this point on.
once caramel is dark amber in color, immediately add the butter to the pan. whisk until the butter has melted.
remove from heat. add vanilla. slowly add the cream to the pan and continue to whisk to incorporate.
whisk until caramel sauce is smooth. let cool in the pan or pour into heat-proof container to finish cooling. store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
