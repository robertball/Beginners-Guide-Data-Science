Ingredients:
2 pounds small- to medium-size red potatoes, unpeeled
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. salt
Freshly ground pepper to taste
4 cups cooked, cubed chicken
1 (10.75 ounce) can 98% fat-free condensed cream of chicken soup
1/2 cup fresh or bottled salsa
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 9 x 13 inch casserole with nonstick cooking spray.
Boil whole potatoes about 20 minutes, just until they pierce easily with a fork. Do not overcook or allow potatoes to become mushy. Cut into fourths.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and garlic and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute till potatoes begin to turn golden-brown. Pour potatoes into prepared baking dish and top with chicken.
Stir together cream of chicken soup and salsa in a small bowl. Pour sauce over chicken and potatoes and stir gently to coat. Sprinkle with cheese.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.
