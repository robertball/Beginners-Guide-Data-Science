4 tablespoons butter
1 clove garlic, minced
3 (3/4 inch thick) slices French bread, cut into cubes

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large saute pan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add bread cubes, and toss to coat.  Spread on a baking sheet.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until crisp and dry.  Check frequently to prevent burning.  Cool.
