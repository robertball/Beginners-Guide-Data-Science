Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless beef sirloin cut into 1-inch cubes
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
All purpose flour for dredging
4 tbsp unsalted Kerrygold Irish Butter
1/4 cup canola oil
4 medium onions, chopped
2 cups beef stock
2 cups Guinness Stout
5 carrots, peeled and thickly sliced
4 parsnips, peeled & thickly sliced
1 medium turnip, peeled & cut into 1 inch pieces
Mashed or boiled potatoes for serving.

Directions:
1. Season the meat with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. In a stockpot or large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter with the oil. Working in batches, cook the meat on all sides for 5 to 7 minutes, or until evenly browned. Remove from the pot. Stir in the onions and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until soft.
2. Return all the meat to the pot and add enough beef stock and the Guinness to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low cover, and simmer for 60-70 minutes, or until the meat is nearly tender. Add the carrots, parsnips, and turnip, and cook for 30-40 minutes, or until the meat and vegetables are tender, and the stew is thickened. (If not thick enough, mix 2 tbsp of flour with 1/2 cup water until smooth. Stir into the stew and cook for 5 minutes longer or until it reaches desired consistency)
3. To serve, ladle the stew into shallow bowls and serve with potatoes.
