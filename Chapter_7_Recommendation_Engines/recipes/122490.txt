Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple tidbits
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup walnut halves
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
3 eggs
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Drain pineapple, reserving juice. Add water to juice to measure 1-1/4 cups; set aside.
Pour butter into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Sprinkle with brown sugar, cranberries and walnuts. Top with pineapple.
In a mixing bowl, combine dry cake mix, eggs, oil and reserved pineapple juice. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour into prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before inverting onto a large serving platter (top will have an uneven appearance).
