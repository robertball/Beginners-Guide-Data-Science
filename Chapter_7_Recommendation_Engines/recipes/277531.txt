Ingredients:
1 (15.25 ounce) package red velvet cake mix
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons peppermint extract
Filling:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup butter, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix cake mix, oil, eggs, and peppermint extract together in a bowl.
Roll the dough into walnut-size balls and space about 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cookies start to crack, about 8 minutes. Take out of the oven and let cool on the pan for about 5 minutes before moving to a cooling rack.
Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add powdered sugar a little at a time to reach desired consistency, or to sweeten to your liking.
Spread filling between 2 cooled cookies.

Description: 
I made these for a Christmas party this year and have been asked to make them again for 2 other parties. The perfect combination of chocolate and peppermint. I added a little green food coloring into the cream cheese frosting for a festive touch.
