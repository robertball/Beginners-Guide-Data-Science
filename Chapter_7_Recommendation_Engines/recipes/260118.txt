Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package pork breakfast sausage
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
1/2 cup milk
1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
2 cups spaghetti sauce
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sausage to a bowl. Wipe out skillet.
Pour milk into a small bowl. Place 1 egg roll wrapper on a plate; top with 1 tablespoon each cooked sausage, spaghetti sauce, and shredded mozzarella cheese. Brush edges of wrapper with a light coating of milk. Fold sides over filling as if wrapping a small burrito. Repeat with remaining wrappers, sausage, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella cheese.
Heat the same skillet over medium heat; lightly coat with vegetable oil. Place 3 to 4 pizza rolls in the hot skillet. Cook until the rolls are browned on the bottom, about 1 minute; flip and cook 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining rolls, adding more oil to the skillet as necessary.
