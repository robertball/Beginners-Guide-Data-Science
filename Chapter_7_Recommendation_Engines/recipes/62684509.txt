Ingredients:
1 cup chicken or turkey broth
1 cube chicken bullion
1 cup water
1 pound thinly sliced deli turkey
8 slices provolone cheese
4 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise
1 Onion

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Open the hoagie rolls and lay out on a baking sheet.
Heat chicken stock, bullion cube and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat to make a rich broth. Place the turkey slices in the broth and warm for 3 minutes. Arrange the meat on the hoagie rolls and top each roll with sliced onion and 2 slices of provolone.
Bake the sandwiches in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or until the cheese just begins to melt. Serve the sandwiches with small bowls of the warm broth for dipping.
