Ingredients:
1 recipe Homestead Cornbread
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/8 cup rubbed sage
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 egg
3 1/2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Cook an 8x8 pan Homestead Cornbread, with medium-browned edges.  Use a fork to break bread into crumbles, keeping some larger pieces.  This should be a coarse uneven mixture with larger and smaller pieces.  Transfer to large baking sheet and spread out to cool.  Let cornbread sit for about 30 minutes before proceeding.
Combine cornbread, onion, celery, sage, salt and pepper in a bowl.  Spray 13x9 baking pan with cooking spray.  Transfer cornbread mixture into pan.
Beat egg into chicken broth until mixed well.  Pour over cornbread.  The amount of broth to add may vary each time so you just have to rely on your judgement.  It should be a little "soupy" with the broth puddling in places, but some cornbread still sitting above the broth.
Bake uncovered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until liquid is mostly absorbed and top is nicely browned.

Description: 
Every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas we had this amazing Cornbread Dressing.  It was one of our favorite things to have for holiday dinners at my grandma's house.  But, my grandma didn't make it herself.  Here's how it would go.  She would say, One of you girls go across the street and get the dressing.  So my sister or I would go.  Across the street meant the nursing home across the street where my grandma was the administrator.  Lou was one of the cooks and she was so nice to make this for us every holiday.  This is her dressing recipe.
