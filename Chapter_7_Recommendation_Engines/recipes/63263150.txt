Homemade Pizza Dough Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F)
2 1/4 ounce packages active dry yeast
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp salt
2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for the bowl
6 cups bleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
herbs to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the yeast, oil, sugar and water and stir gently to dissolve. Let the mixture stand until the yeast comes alive and starts to foam, 5 to 10 minutes.
Combine salt and flour in a stand mixer and pulse a few times to mix.
Slowly add yeast mixture to flour on lowest speed until the flour incorporates.
When dough starts to come together, increase to medium speed and mix until dough forms a ball, about 2 minutes.
Check dough for feel, if sticky, add flour, if crumbly, add water.
Turn dough into itself a few times on a lightly floured surface, kneading until smooth and elastic.
Coat the inside of a large bowl with more oil and move dough ball to that.   Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until it doubles in size, about 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
If refrigerating, let it cool in fridge for about 45 minutes and punch down and put into a Pam coated zip lock bag.   It will slightly rise in the fridge, so leave a small corner open to allow air to escape.   Allow to double in size before making the crust, or for a thin crispy crust, use the dough straight out of the fridge.
Top and bake at 400.
