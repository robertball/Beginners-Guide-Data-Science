Ingredients:
5 to 6 c flour
1 box yellow cake mix
2 pkgs quick rise yeast
2 1/2 c warm water
1/4 c melted butter
1/2 c sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
Frosting:
6 Tbsp softened butter
3 c powdered sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
2-3 Tbsp milk

Directions:
In a mixing bowl combine 4 c flour, dry cake mix, yeast & warm water until smooth. Add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface & knead until smooth & elastic, about 5 min. Place in a greased bowl turning once to grease the top. Cover & let rise until doubled, about 45 min.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface & divide in half. Roll each half into a 14" but 10" rectangle. Brush w/ butter & sprinkle w/ cinnamon & sugar. Roll up jelly roll style starting w/ the long side. Cut each roll into 12 slices & place each roll cut side down in 2 greased 13" by 9" pans. Cover & let rise until almost doubled, about 20 min.
Bake at 400 for 10-15 min. Cool for 20 min. For the frosting cream butter, powdered sugar & vanilla. Add enough milk to achieve desired consistancy. Frost warm rolls
