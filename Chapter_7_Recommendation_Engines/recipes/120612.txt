1 cup sugar
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup instant coffee granules
2 tablespoons hot water
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
Additional sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine sugar and oil. Dissolve coffee in water; add to sugar mixture and mix well. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to the sugar mixture.
Roll into 3/4-in. balls, then roll in additional sugar. Place 2 in. apart on lightly greased baking sheets; flatten with a fork. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until edges are firm. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
I created this recipe because I wanted an easy-to-make cookie that folks can't resist. These tempting treats have a hint of coffee flavor and aren't overly sweet.
