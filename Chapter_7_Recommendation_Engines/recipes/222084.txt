Ingredients:
1 pound ziti pasta
1 onion, chopped
1 pound lean ground turkey
2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
1 carrot, chopped
6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced
1 1/2 cups reduced-fat sour cream
6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and ground turkey until onion is translucent and turkey is no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Add spaghetti sauce and carrot; simmer until heated through, about 15 minutes. Layer ingredients into prepared baking dish as follows: half the ziti, Provolone cheese, sour cream, half the sauce mixture, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining sauce mixture. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
Bake in preheated oven until cheeses are melted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
I love pasta but it is not always the healthiest thing to have for dinner. To make this one a little less guilty, I use turkey and add a carrot to the sauce. So tasty!
