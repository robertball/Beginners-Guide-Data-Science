Ingredients:
CRUST:
-1 cup Ginger Snap crumbs
-1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
-1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
CHEESECAKE:
-4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
-3/4 cup white sugar
-3 eggs
-1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
-3/4 cups apples(use from apple filling topping apples and food process until in chunky applesauce)
-1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon
-1/4 teaspoon of Nutmeg
APPLE FILLING TOPPING:
-1/2 cup unsalted butter
-3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
-1/4 cup water
-1/2 cup white sugar
-1/2 cup packed brown sugar
-7 apples - peeled, cored and sliced (use a mixture of 2 Granny Smith, 2 Red Delicious and 3 McIntosh apples)
CRUMB PIE TOPPING:
-1/4 cup brown sugar
-1/3 cup white sugar
-1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons flour
-1 teaspoon nutmeg
-1 teaspoon cinnamon
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-1/2 cup butter
-1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the Ginger Snap crumbs, 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans, and melted butter; press into the bottom of a 9 inch spring form pan.
In a large bowl, combine cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar. Mix at medium speed until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Blend in vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix in the 3/4 cup of apples you have food processed to the batter; pour filling into the crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes. While cheesecake is cooking you can prepare the apple filling topping and crumb topping.
For the apple filling topping, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to form a paste. Do not let it brown too fast or it will begin to burn. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and apples and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer until apples soften and are cooked. Place in a Tupperware container in the fridge until you're ready to serve.
For the Crumb topping mix brown sugar, white sugar, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Melt butter and stir into the crumb mixture, then add in the chopped pecans and put away.
After the 60 minutes is up check the cheesecake. The cheesecake will look under cooked and wiggly when done. Use a thermometer to be sure. At 160-165 degrees Fahrenheit the cheesecake is done and the thermometer will come out clean. Once the cheesecake is done turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake on the oven rack for an hour with the door cracked about 6 inches. Once the cheesecake has cooled some, loosen cake from rim of pan with a knife. Let cool overnight. Before serving the cheesecake place the apple and crumb topping on the cheesecake before removing
