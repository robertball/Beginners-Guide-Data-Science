Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
3 cloves garlic, peeled
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon paprika
1 (4 pound) pork tenderloin
1/4 cup dry sherry
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water

Directions:
Place olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, brown sugar, thyme, dry mustard, and paprika into a food processor and blend. Pour marinade into a zip-top bag, add pork tenderloin, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Transfer pork and marinade into a Dutch oven.
Bake in the preheated oven for 3 hours.
Remove pork from Dutch oven and set aside on a plate, reserving drippings in the pan.
Heat drippings in the Dutch oven over medium heat on the stovetop. Add sherry and deglaze the pan, making sure to scrape up any stuck-on pieces with a wooden spoon.
Mix cornstarch and water in a separate bowl until completely mixed; add to sauce in the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes. Slice pork tenderloin and serve with sauce on the side or poured on top.
