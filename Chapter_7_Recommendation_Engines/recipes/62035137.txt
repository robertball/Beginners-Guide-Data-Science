Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed, or 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped finely
1/2 teaspoon dried sage, crushed, or 1 teaspoon fresh sage, chopped finely
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 medium boneless pork loin chops (about 1 pound total)
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam
2 tablespoons orange juice
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
Thyme sprigs for garnish (optional)

Directions:
1. Combine thyme, sage, salt and pepper, rub over pork chops, coating evenly.
2. Heat butter and olive oil together in a non-stick skillet until melted. Add pork chops to skillet. Cook over medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender and no longer pink, turning only once with tongs. Remove from the skillet and keep warm in a 200ยบ oven.
3. Stir together the jam, orange juice and vinegar; add to skillet. Bring to boiling and boil gently uncovered for about 2-3 minutes or until sauce is reduced to desired consistency (sauce thickens upon standing). Pond the sauce on the plate and top with pork chops. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if desired.

Description: 
Succulent herbed boneless pork loin chops paired with a tangy raspberry sauce...heaven on a plate! This is a special family dish or perfect for company. I accompanied it with smashed potatoes and julienned steamed carrots. My husband can't wait to have it again.
