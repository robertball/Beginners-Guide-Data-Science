Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour, or as needed
2 cups spelt flour
2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
1/4 cup flax seeds
2 1/2 cups warm water
1/2 cup natural peanut butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine wheat flour, spelt flour, oats, and flax seeds in large bowl.  Stir in water and peanut butter.  Knead dough on a lightly floured surface, mixing in more flour as needed until dough is smooth and no longer sticky.  Roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick.  Cut with small cookie cutters into desired shapes, and place 3/4 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.
Bake 40 minutes.  Turn oven off; leave biscuits in oven until completely cool.

Description: 
A great, crunchy all-natural treat for our furry four-legged friends. If you don't have spelt flour, you can use all whole wheat.
