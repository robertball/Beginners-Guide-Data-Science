Ingredients:
2 skinless chicken leg quarters
1 large garlic clove
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tbsp dried rosemary
250 ml beer
1 medium yellow onion
3 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp corn starch

Directions:
Put the chicken into a large bowl. Peel and crush the garlic clove. Add salt and fresh ground pepper to taste and 1 tbsp rosemary. Pour the beer over the chicken and let rest for at least 30 minutes.
Remove the chicken from the beer marinade. Pat dry with paper towels. Reserve the marinade.
Peel the onion and slice it in half, then into 1/4 inch slices. Sprinkle the corn starch over the chicken to coat it completely. In a Dutch oven, heat the oil. Add the chicken.  Brown the chicken on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Add the onion. Remove the garlic from the marinade and add it to the Dutch oven. Add a bit of marinade to keep everything from burning. Saut√© until the onion is tender and translucent.
Add the remaining marinade and the remaining tablespoon of rosemary. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to remove the browned bits. Turn down the heat, simmering the chicken until the sauce has reduced and thickened and the chicken is no longer pink inside.
Serve hot.
