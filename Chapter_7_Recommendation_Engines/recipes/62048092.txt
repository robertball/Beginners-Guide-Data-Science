Ingredients:
8 large ripe cucumbers, washed
3 green peppers, washed and seeded
3 red peppers, washed and seeded
2 large onions
1 medium bunch celery, cleaned
4 cups white vinegar
1 cup water
5 cups sugar
5 Tablespoons mustard seed
1 Tablespoon each, salt and tumeric

Directions:
Grind the vegetables (make sure you leave chunks and don't puree); put into a large pot, with the juices, sugar, vinegar and spices.  Cook for about 2 hours or until transparent, on medium heat, stirring frequently.  Fill the hot, sterilized pint jars to within 1/4 inch of top.  Wipe the lip of each jar and top with sterilized rings and lids.  If the lids do not click down on their own within a half hour, then put them in a boing water bath for 10 minutes.

This is a wonderful homemade addition to any grilled or roasted meat.  This recipe has been handed down to me by my mom who got it from a very dear family friend.  It's even good on hamburgers!
