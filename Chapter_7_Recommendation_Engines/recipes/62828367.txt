Ingredients:
½ 	pound dry white navy beans (soaked according to directions)
OR
3	24 – 32 oz. cans Cannellini or white navy beans
1	whole bundle of celery - chopped
1	large onion – chopped
1	Ham bone (from shank or butt)
1 - 2	pounds  coarsely diced ham*
3 - 4 	32 oz cans of chopped tomatoes
2 – 4	cloves of garlic chopped
2 - 3	Bay leaves
1	Small can tomato paste (Optional)

Directions:
Put chopped celery and onion in sauce pan and boil gently until starting to become crisp-tender.  Do NOT throw away water from celery and onion!
Meanwhile, dice up ham and put in large pot along with cans of tomatoes, garlic and bay leaves.  Simmer until ham pieces fall off the bone – about an hour or two.
Remove the ham bone from pot and let cool.  Remove any ham remaining on bone and put back in tomato mixture.  Add celery-onion mixture with WATER to soup.  Simmer for another hour or two, letter soup simmer down to thicken.
If soup doesn't thicken enough (I like a thick, hardy soup), add tomato paste by mixing some of soup and paste in small bowl to integrate and then adding to soup.
