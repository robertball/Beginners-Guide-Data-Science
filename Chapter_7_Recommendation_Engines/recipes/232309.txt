Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 small green bell peppers, diced
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place spaghetti squash halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until flesh is tender and easily shreds when punctured with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Carefully shred flesh with a fork until it resembles spaghetti.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add ground turkey to vegetable mixture; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Mix black beans, sun-dried tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken bouillon, chili powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, cumin, and red pepper flakes into ground turkey mixture; cook until heated through and flavors have blended, about 10 minutes.
Spoon spaghetti squash onto each plate; top with ground turkey mixture.
