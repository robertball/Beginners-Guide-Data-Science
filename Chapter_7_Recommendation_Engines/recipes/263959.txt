Ingredients:
2 eggs, separated
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cups buttermilk
1/4 cup melted butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form.
Butter enough 3 1/2-inch ring molds to fill your frying pan. Place molds in the pan over low heat. Cover.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.
Combine buttermilk, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture and stir until batter is fairly smooth.
Fold egg whites into the batter until combined. Small bits of egg whites still showing is ok.
Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into each mold and cover the pan. Cook until bubbles start forming at the top, about 5 minutes. Flip pancakes in their molds and cook until set, 3 to 4 minutes more.
