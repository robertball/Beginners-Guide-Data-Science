Ingredients:
2      chicken breasts
1/2   teaspoon garlic powder
1/2   teaspoon salt
1      cube bouillon, crushed
2      potatoes, peeled and cubed
1/2   cup carrots, chopped
1      can cream of chicken soup
3/4   cup sour cream
1      cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2   cup peas
1/2   cup corn
2 9-inch pie crusts

Directions:
Cover chicken with about 1 inch water, and simmer with garlic powder, salt and crushed bouillon 30-40 minutes. Boil potatoes and carrots until tender. Drain. Heat soup, sour cream and cheese until melted. Stir all filling ingredients together. Pour into pie crust. Cover with second crust and crimp edges; cut 2 slashes in top crust to vent. Bake at 400 for 30-35 minutes. Put tin foil around edges of crust until the last 10 minutes to prevent edges from burning.

I just had a family dinner with 11 kids ranging in age from 5 months to 10 years old. I wondered what I could make that would be a crowd pleaser, and REFUSED to lower myself to chicken nuggets. I finally decided on chicken pot pie, all the kids ate it, and many asked for seconds. I buy Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts that you simply roll out and bake.
