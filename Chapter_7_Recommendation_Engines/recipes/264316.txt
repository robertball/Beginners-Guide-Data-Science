Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 large sweet onion, chopped
3/4 cup pea pods
1 head bok choy, roughly chopped
1/2 cup bean sprouts
1/2 (6 ounce) bag baby spinach
3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon chopped ginger (optional)
salt to taste

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Boil on medium-high heat until tender but still intact, about 15 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add pea pods. Add cooked potatoes and increase heat to medium. Cook 5 to 7 minutes more.
Add bok choy, bean sprouts, and spinach to the pan. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; cook about 5 minutes. Add soy sauce and ginger. Cook, uncovered, until juices evaporate and leaves are wilted, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt.
