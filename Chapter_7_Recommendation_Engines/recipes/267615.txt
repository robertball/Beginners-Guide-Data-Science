Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
1 egg, beaten
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
1 tablespoon minced ginger, divided
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
vegetable oil for frying
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 serrano peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons cumin powder
1 tablespoon chile powder, or less to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt to taste
6 fresh curry leaves, or more to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons red chile-garlic paste
1 tablespoon ginger paste
5 drops red food coloring, or more as needed
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add egg, cornstarch, 1/2 of the minced garlic, 1/2 of the minced ginger, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until chicken is completely coated.
Heat oil in a deep skillet and fry chicken pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set fried chicken aside.
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a second skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until crackling, about 1 minute. Add remaining garlic, remaining ginger, serrano peppers, cumin, chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt. Add curry leaves and stir to combine. Add chile-garlic paste, ginger paste, and red food coloring. Stir to create a paste. Add water to thin paste slightly.
Add fried chicken to the the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in cilantro.
