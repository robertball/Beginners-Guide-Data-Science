Title:
Devil's Paste Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon of Dijon mustard
2 cloves of garlic, finely crushed
2 Tablespoons of a fruity chutney - mango, apple, whatever
1 Tablespoon of Worcester sauce (Mushroom Ketchup is good alternative)
A good shake from a Tabasco bottle (or similar)

Directions:
Mix all the ingredients to a paste.
To use, slash the meat, or slash the chicken skin, etc etc etc and spread the goo over and into the slashes. Then broil (or grill, but I prefer broiling as it keeps the juices).
Or maybe make some Devilled Mushrooms, by using the gloop when making Stuffed Mushrooms.

Description: 
A super and quick and easy paste for grilling and broiling. The basis for all those Devilled recipes.
