Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
2 (12 ounce) boneless rib eye steaks, about 1-inch thick

Directions:
Mix the spices together in a small bowl. Rub the steaks lightly with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with the spice rub.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Place the steaks on the grill and cook 5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on how well done you like your steak. Let the steak rest for at least 15 minutes, then slice across grain into thick slices.

Description: 
What makes a steak Tuscan? Its accent! Really, the secret's in the spicesâ€¦ but speaking in an Italian accent is strongly encouraged, too.
