Ingredients:
-Smoked (precooked) spiral sliced ham. (Most of these hams come with different flavor packs for glazing and it doesn't matter which flavor it comes with cuz it's gunna get thrown in the trash.)
-Pork rub
-Mustard
-BBQ sauce

Directions:
-Take ham (flat side facing down) and rub down with mustard. Mustard helps rub stick to meat.
-Put a good layer of your favorite pork rub all over ham.
-Cover with foil and set on counter to get close to room temp.
-Bring smoker up to about 220F using your favorite wood. I like pecan and or mesquite.
-Place ham flat side down in pan and put in smoker.
-Brush with BBQ sauce once internal temp hits about 115F.
-Remove from smoker once internal temp. hits 130F
-Wrap in foil and let rest for 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is really resmoking an already smoked ham. By slow smoking the ham long enough to bring up the internal temperature, it really adds great flavor.
