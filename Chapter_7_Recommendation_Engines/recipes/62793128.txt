Ingredients:
You will need for the dough:
2 1/4 tsp instant yeast
1 1/2 cups water
4 1/4 cups flour
2 Tbsp butter, softened
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp salt
You will need for the topping:
3 Tbsp butter, melted
1/4  1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp kosher salt
Pinch of dried oregano

Directions:
To make the dough:
Mix all ingredients together in stand mixer bowl till dough forms (this will take about five minutes), then knead with the hook attachment for about 2 minutes, or by hand for about three minutes or until very smooth
Roll into a 2-foot long log, then cut into 16 pieces (just cut the log, then logs in half over and over till you have 16 pieces; measuring is for the birds), and place these 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper; cover with a cloth and let them rise until doubled. The original recipe said this would take 45 minutes, but with my A/C cranking it took more like 2 hours, which is fine — just watch for them to get nice and puffy
Preheat the oven to 400F while you melt the butter for the topping
Brush the breadsticks with about half the butter then sprinkle on the salt
Bake until very lightly golden, about 12-15 minutes, while you combine the garlic powder and oregano; pull the breadsticks out and brush them with the butter mixture, then sprinkle on the garlic/oregano mixture
Enjoy!
