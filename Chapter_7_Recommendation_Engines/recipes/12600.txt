Ingredients:
1 cup chopped rhubarb
1 cup fresh blackberries
1 cup raspberries
1 cup fresh blueberries
2 cups thinly sliced apples
2 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, mix together rhubarb, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and sliced apples. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon and nutmeg together and blend with the fruit.
Pour fruit mixture into a 9x13 inch glass baking dish.
For the topping: In a large bowl, mix the oatmeal, flour, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together. Add the butter in little pats and cut into the flour mixture until it looks crumbly, (no big chunks). Sprinkle over the fruit.
Bake at 400 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until topping is brown.
