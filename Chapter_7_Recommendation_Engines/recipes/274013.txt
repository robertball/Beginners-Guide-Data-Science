Ingredients:
1/2 pound bacon
1 (8 ounce) package kluski noodles
3/4 cup chopped onion
4 cups shredded cabbage
1 (12 ounce) container cottage cheese
10 ounces Muenster cheese, cubed
1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed
salt to taste
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/4 teaspoon paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly crispy, about 10 minutes.
In the meantime, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook kluski at a boil until nearly tender, about 7 minutes. Drain.
Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Add onion to the bacon drippings in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage; reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
Stir cottage cheese, Muenster cheese, dill, and salt into noodles. Add bacon, onion, and cabbage and mix well. Turn all ingredients out into a 3-quart baking dish.
Melt butter in the empty skillet and mix in bread crumbs to coat. Top noodle mixture with bread crumb mixture; sprinkle paprika on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top and heated through, 25 to 35 minutes.
