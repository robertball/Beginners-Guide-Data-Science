Ingredients:
16 ounces multigrain elbow macaroni (such as Barilla ProteinPLUSÂ®)
Dressing:
1 cup plain yogurt
3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 head broccoli florets, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
1 cup snap peas
1 cup fresh mushrooms, chopped
1 cup baby carrots, chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cool water, and drain once more. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Mix yogurt, oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, dill, salt, and pepper for dressing together in a bowl using a wire whisk.
Add broccoli, bell peppers, onion, snap peas, mushrooms, carrots, and dressing to chilled pasta; mix well.
