4 chicken breasts
cooking spray
BRINE
1 quart water
1/4 cup salt
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup hot sauce
Coating
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
SAUCE
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar

Directions:
Dissolve sugar and salt for brine in water and add hot sauce.  Cut breasts into strips of equal thickness. Brine in refrigerator for 30 minutes to one hour.   Pour off brine.
Mix coating ingredients.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Place baking rack on baking pan and coat with cooking spray. Coat breasts and place on rack.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven.  Raise oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray each piece with quick shot of cooking spray and turn over.  Spray other side of chicken.  Replace in oven and bake for 10 minutes.
Bloom spices by heating the 3 tablespoons oil until shimmering over medium heat in small pan. Mix other ingredients and add to oil and cook for 30 seconds.  Remove from heat.  Brush on cooked chicken breasts.  Suggest brushing one side lightly at first and adding if you like more heat.
