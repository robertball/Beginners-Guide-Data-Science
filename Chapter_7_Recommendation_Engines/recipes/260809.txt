Ingredients:
6 quarts water, divided
1  whole chicken, giblets removed
5  carrots, chopped
2 cups chopped cabbage
4 stalks celery, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
Â¼ cup white wine (optional)
2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
2 tablespoons dried dill weed
1 tablespoon butter, or to taste (optional)
2 cloves minced garlic
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon ground thyme
2 teaspoons ground white pepper
2  bay leaves

Directions:
Fill a large pot with 4 quarts water. Add chicken; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is coming apart, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat; remove chicken from pot and transfer to a platter. Put a lid on the pot and cover the chicken with plastic wrap. Refrigerate both until chicken is safe to handle, about 40 minutes.
Tear meat off the chicken bones. Skim excess fat off the top of the cooled broth. Add the last 2 quarts water, chicken meat, carrots, cabbage, celery, onion, wine, bouillon, dill, butter, garlic, parsley, thyme, white pepper, and bay leaves. Cook over medium heat until vegetables have softened, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This soup will cure what ails you. Even if it's just hunger. Healthy, low carb, and great for a rainy day. I've been making this recipe for 30 years, and I think this is about as good as it gets. Enjoy with freshly baked biscuits.
