Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup nonfat dry milk powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup apple pie filling

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and brown sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla. Combine dry ingredients; add to the creamed mixture and mix well.
Drop by 1/4 cupfuls 6 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten into 3-in. circles. Make a slight indentation in the center of each; top with a rounded tablespoonful of pie filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 16-20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool for 5 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
'Our three grandsons gobble up these soft, chewy oatmeal cookies at breakfast with some yogurt and a glass of juice,' writes Dolores Kastello of Waukesha, Wisconsin. 'If you don't have pie filling handy, use jam to make the cookie's fruity topping,' she suggests.
