Ingredients:
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups evaporated milk
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie
1 tablespoon butter, diced
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Mix the sugars, flour, and milk.  Pour into crust. ( Grandma always mixed the ingredients directly in the unbaked pie crust, but I have better luck mixing it with a mixer and transferring it to the crust.  )
Dot with butter and sprinkle with nutmeg to look pretty.  Bake 300 - 325 degrees F (150 - 165 degrees C) for 1 hour.

Description: 
This is my all time favorite pie.  My Grandma always made it.  My Mom wasn't much of a baker, so now it is up to me to bake it.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
