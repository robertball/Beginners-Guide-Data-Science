Ingredients:
Souvlaki Marinade:
3/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 large pita bread rounds
1 heart of romaine lettuce
1 red onion, thinly sliced
1 tomato, halved and sliced
1 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to broil.
In a small bowl, mix the balsamic vinaigrette, juice from 1/2 lemon, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over the chicken, seal, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Remove chicken from marinade and place on cookie sheet. Discard remaining marinade. Broil chicken until juices run clear, about 8 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from heat, and allow to sit about 10 minutes before slicing into thin strips.
Open up pitas along the edge, cut half way. Spread tzatziki sauce, stuff with chicken slices, lettuce, onion, tomato, feta to your liking.
