Directions:
Mix together the tea, water, vodka, orange juice concentrate, and pink lemonade concentrate in a large freezer-proof bowl, such as glass or stainless steel, and freeze overnight or several days ahead.

Description: 
This punch was made famous by one of the ladies in my Bunko group, but has now become a favorite for all occasions! Add frozen, chopped fruit chunks to the mix after 'slushing' for a healthy (ha ha) boost!
