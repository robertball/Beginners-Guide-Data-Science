Ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
8 chicken thighs
1 white onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter
1 pound Creole smoked sausage
2 1/2 cups water
1 pound shrimp
2 tablespoons Cajun-style seasoning

Directions:
Boil chicken breasts and thighs with onion and bell pepper in a large pot of salted water, for about 40 minutes or until cooked through and no longer pink inside. Drain, debone chicken and set aside.
In a large saucepan stir together flour and butter over low heat to make a roux; add boiled chicken, sausage and water and bring all to a boil. Cover saucepan and simmer over low heat for about 1 1/2 hours.
Add shrimp and simmer for about 1 more hour, then add seasoning to taste and serve.

Description: 
This is a gumbo recipe that's been borrowed and recombined from three different people's recipes, and this is how it ended up! Laissez les bons temps rouler! Be sure to have some file powder and hot pepper sauce to season to your liking. Serve over hot rice with potato salad and crackers, if desired.
