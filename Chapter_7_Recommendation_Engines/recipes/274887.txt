Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can chickpeas
1 onion, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley, or more to taste
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped, or to taste
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon cumin
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Combine chickpeas, onion, parsley, oil, garlic, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until everything is mixed together. Add flour and baking powder and pulse, until mixture starts to stick together and forms a ball, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Use 2 dessert spoons to remove even amounts of the mixture and shape into 15 small patties. Place patties on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes, turning falafel over carefully after 10 minutes.
