Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix (such as Duncan Hines®)
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup plain yogurt
1/2 (16 ounce) container vanilla frosting
2 (12 ounce) packages dark chocolate candy melts (such as Wilton®)
36 lollipop sticks, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Combine cake mix, water, eggs, and yogurt in a bowl. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes and pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 28 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
Break cake into a bowl and crumble completely using your hands. Mix in approximately 1/2 of the frosting, a little at a time, working it into the cake until it is the consistency of wet sand.
Use a melon baller to scoop equal-sized balls of cake. Roll each ball in your hands to create a smooth shape and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cake. Place cake balls in the refrigerator until firm, about 1 hour; do not freeze.
While cake balls are chilling, pour each bag of candy melts into a separate, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave each bowl at 50% power in 30-second intervals until just melted, 1 to 3 minutes each.
Remove cake balls from refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Dip about 1/2 inch of a lollipop stick into melted chocolate, then about halfway into a cake ball. Use a clean paintbrush to brush melted chocolate onto the cake ball, only around the opening where the stick is. Dip the whole ball into the melted chocolate, using a spoon to help coat. Twirl the pop as you remove it from the chocolate to create a smooth coating. Place coated cake pop into a cake-pop stand or a chunk of styrofoam. Repeat with remaining cake balls.

This is simply the most tasty cake pop with a rich, gooey inside and a firm, elegant outside. My kids love to help crumble the cake!
