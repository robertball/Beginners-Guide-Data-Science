Ingredients:
8 (1-inch-thick) rib loin or lamb chops
3 tablespoon(s) extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon(s) Greek seasoning blend
2 can(s) (15.5 ounces) white beans (cannellini), drained and rinsed
3 clove(s) garlic, minced
1 cup(s) chicken broth
2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 large tomato, diced
1/2 cup(s) crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup(s) pitted kalamata olives
1/4 cup(s) fresh mint, chopped
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Brush lamb chops with 1 Tbsp of the oil and season all over with Greek seasoning blend. Let stand at room temperature.
In a medium saucepan, heat another 1 Tbsp of the oil over medium heat; add beans and garlic. Sauté mixture 2 minutes; add broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes. Uncover; mash beans with a potato masher until creamy. Keep warm.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini; sauté 3 minutes, or until crisp-tender. Remove from heat. Stir in tomato, feta, olives, and mint; season with pepper to taste.
Heat a stovetop grill pan over medium heat, or heat broiler. Grill chops 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. To serve, spoon some white-bean puree onto each plate and top with 2 lamb chops. Spoon zucchini mixture over chops.
