2 tablespoons ketchup
3 tablespoons brown sugar

Description: 
A great sauce for dipping almost any Asian inspired dish in!  Should you desire a thicker consistency than what this recipe yields, dissolve another 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch in 1/8 to 1/4 cup of cold water. Once dissolved, stir the mixture into the sauce and continue to heat and whisk until sauce  thickens.
