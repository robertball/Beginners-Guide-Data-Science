Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup moist prunes, chopped
1 1/2 cups pumpkin puree
1 cup orange juice
3/4 cup milk
2 eggs
2 oranges, zested
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin trays or line with paper liners.
Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in prunes.
Mix pumpkin, orange juice, milk, eggs, orange zest, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Fold into flour mixture. Add melted butter and mix well.
Divide batter between the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
Remove muffins from the oven and place on wire racks to cool, 20 to 30 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar.
