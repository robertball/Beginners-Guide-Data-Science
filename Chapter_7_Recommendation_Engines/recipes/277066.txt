Ingredients:
1 cup canned coconut milk
1/3 cup unrefined coconut oil
1 cup cane sugar
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon lemon extract
1 1/2 cups brown rice flour
1/2 teaspoon gluten-free baking soda
1/2 teaspoon gluten-free baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 (16 ounce) container lemon frosting
1/2 cup coconut flakes
1 tablespoon grated lemon peel

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Stir coconut milk and coconut oil in a small skillet over low heat until liquid, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl. Stir in sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and lemon extract until combined.
Mix together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to coconut milk mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.
Put icing in a plastic bag and snip off one of the bottom corners. Squeeze icing onto cooled cupcakes and sprinkle with coconut flakes and lemon peel.
