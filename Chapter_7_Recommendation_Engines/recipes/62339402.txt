Ingredients:
Equal parts soy sauce, sugar, and water.
cornstarch(optional)

Directions:
Stir together. Boil until sugar dissolves. Thicken with cornstarch and water to desired thickness.
This is very basic. You can add less sugar for a more tart sauce. Season with sesame oil, garlic, ginger, etc. to liven up the flavor. Brown sugar adds a good flavor.
