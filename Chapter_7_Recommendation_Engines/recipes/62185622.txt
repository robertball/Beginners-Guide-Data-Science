Ingredients:
1 TBSP butter
1 small onion finely chopped
2 5 oz cans of oil packed tuna drained
2 TBSP chopped fresh parsley
1-2 tsps capers
2 TBSP parmesan cheese
salt and pepper

Directions:
Melt the butter, and cook the onion til translucent not browned. Mix in the rest of the ingredients and mash well. Prepare your phyllo, if you are doing the cigar shape fine; just make sure to fully enclose the filling. Otherwise do them in a triangle shape. Cut phyllo into strips, putting filling in bottom corner and fold from corner to corner like folding a flag. Fry these in a saucepan with oil about an inch deep until they are hot and golden. Drain, serve with lemon wedges.

Description: 
A triangle shaped fried appetizer famous throughout the Middle East. This is my mothers recipe for her tuna filled ones. If you can find Italian tuna packed in olive oil, this is most preferable.
