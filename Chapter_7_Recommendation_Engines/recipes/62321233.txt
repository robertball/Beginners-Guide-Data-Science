Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
8 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium onion, chopped
1 small scallion, chopped
2 cups peeled and diced eggplant
2-3 cups chopped zucchini
2 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 (13 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); spray a 9 x 13 glass baking dish with cooking spray.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the garlic, onion, eggplant, and zucchini with the garlic until the vegetables have begun to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and black pepper; bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.
Cook the frozen ravioli as directed on the package; drain. Spread the cooked ravioli in a layer into the bottom of the prepared baking dish; spoon the hot vegetables over the ravioli. Sprinkle evenly with the cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
