Ingredients:
1/2 cup dried whole peas
4 cups cold water
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
3 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp parsley - optional
1 tsp, heaping, flour - optional for thickening

Directions:
Wash the peas and soak them 24-48 hours.
Boil the peas in the soaking water for appproximately 1.5 hours. (Stir occasionally so that they don't burn on the bottom of the pan.  You may have to add more water after an hour or so.)  When done, the peas should be mushy when stirred.
Stir in butter, salt, sugar (and parsley).
(Stir in the flour, if you want the peas thickened.)

Description: 
As a precocious Norwegian-Canadian kid, I learned to eat these first and then calmly state, Those were excellent, but they looked like vomit! -- and would instantly get banned from the table.  It was okay, I was full and had eaten the best part of the meal! 
I'm an adult now, and they're still delicious (but vomitous looking --almost like a thick creamed pea soup, but taste better). Give them a chance, you will never eat canned peas again!
