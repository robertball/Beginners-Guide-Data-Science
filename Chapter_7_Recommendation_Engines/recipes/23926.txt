Ingredients:
8 pounds beef brisket
15 cloves garlic, peeled
1/4 cup Greek-style seasoning

Directions:
Make deep cuts into the brisket with a paring knife. Place cloves all the way into the cuts. Liberally sprinkle brisket with Greek seasoning.
Place mesquite wood over gray/hot charcoals.
Put brisket fat side down on the grill. Smoke for 2 hours and do not turn the meat.
Take the meat out and wrap tightly 2 times in extra heavy aluminum foil. Put in the oven for 2 hours on a cookie sheet at 250 degrees F.
Remove from oven and let sit (still wrapped in foil) 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving to let the meat "firm up" and the juice to be absorbed.
