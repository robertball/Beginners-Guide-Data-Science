Ingredients:
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 egg whites

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water

Directions:
In a microwave, melt 1 cup chocolate chips. Stir until smooth; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar until crumbly, about 2 minutes. Add egg whites and vanilla; beat well. Stir in melted chocolate.
Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to butter mixture alternately with water. Stir in remaining chocolate chips. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle.
Shape dough into 1-in. balls. Roll in confectioners' sugar. Place 2 in. apart on baking sheets coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
When I baked these moist fudgy cookies for the first time, my three preschool children loved them! But I like them because they're lower in fat and easy to mix and bake.                        --Maria Groff of Ephrata, Pennsylvania
