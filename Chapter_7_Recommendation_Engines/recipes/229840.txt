Ingredients:
Cake:
2 cups granulated sugar
4 eggs
1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1 (14 ounce) can crushed pineapple, well drained
3 cups grated carrots
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 cup raisins
Icing:
1/2 (250 g) package cream cheese, softened
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups icing sugar
Milk

Directions:
Cake: Combine sugar, eggs, oil and vanilla in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until combined. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl. Add to liquid ingredients; beat until combined. Stir in pineapple, carrots, walnuts and raisins. Pour batter into a greased 12-cup (3 L) Bundt pan or 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) oven until a cake tester inserted in the centre comes out clean (about 60 to 65 minutes for Bundt pan or 45 to 50 minutes for 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking pan). Let cake cool before icing.
Icing: Combine cream cheese, butter, vanilla and icing sugar in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Thin with a little milk, adding 1 tbsp for spreading or about 4 tbsp (60 mL) for drizzling over cake.
