Ingredients:
1 cup Shamrock FarmsÂ® Low Fat Cottage Cheese
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 small yellow onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) jar tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, with juice
3 cups uncooked pasta
2 cups water
1 cup baby spinach, or to taste
1 cup part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Add the Shamrock Farms Low Fat Cottage Cheese to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Set aside until needed.
Heat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat and add olive oil and onion. Cook the onion for 2 minutes and then add in green pepper and garlic. Cook another 4 to 5 minutes and then add in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, pasta, and water. Stir until everything is mixed evenly.
Cover and let simmer for about 30 minutes, until noodles are cooked through. You will need to stir the lasagna a few times to make sure that the pasta cooks evenly. This is especially important if using lasagna noodles because they have a tendency to stick together more.
Once pasta is cooked through, remove the lid and stir in the spinach and 3/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Next, top with the remaining 1/4 cup cheese and then spoon the blended cottage cheese over the top. Cover again and let cook for another 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
