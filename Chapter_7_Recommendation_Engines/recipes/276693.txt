Ingredients:
10 dried, smoked chile peppers
2 tablespoons cumin seeds
2 tablespoons coriander seeds
2 tablespoons caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon multi-colored whole peppercorns
2 tablespoons smoked paprika
1/2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Remove and discard stems and seeds from dried chiles. Slice chiles in half or quarters, if they are large.
Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add chiles and heat through to ensure all the moisture has evaporated. Remove and place on a rack to cool. Place cumin seeds, coriander seeds, caraway seeds, and peppercorns to skillet. Stir seeds and toast until fragrant but not burning, about 3 minutes. Remove and allow to cool.
Grind chiles and toasted seeds with a mortar and pestle into a coarse powder. Add smoked paprika, garlic powder, smoked salt, parsley, and oregano. Continue to blend until all spices are completely combined and pulverized.

Description: 
Harissa powder is the ground spice blend of the spicy, earthy North African paste with a base of smoked chili peppers. It can be used as a dry rub on meats or as a spice in place of any other spice blend in your favorite recipe, such as tacos, tagines, braised meats, curries, or even tofu. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month, or until the expiration date of any of the single ingredients, if earlier.
