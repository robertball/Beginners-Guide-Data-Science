Ingredients:
1 cup Duke’s mayonnaise (one of my Favorites)
1/4  cup Heinz ketchup
1/4 cup chili sauce  ( I prefer Heinz.  DO NOT substitute Thai Chili Sauce)
1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
1/4 cup light olive oil
juice of one lemon

Directions:
Mix all ingredients well and store in refrigerator overnight.  It needs to sit to let the flavors become “acquainted”.   They shouldn’t rush into marriage.
