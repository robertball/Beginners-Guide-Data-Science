Ingredients:
6 tomatoes of choice bite size bites
~ ¼ - ½ cup extra virgin olive oil- can vary
~ 1 ½ tablespoons balsamic vinegarcan vary
Season salt or salt-pepper of choice
8 ounces or 1 block Mozzarella cheesebite size bites
6-8 basil leaves, julienned

Directions:
Wash and slice tomatoes into bite size chunks.
Cut mozzarella cheese in bite size chunks.
Rinse- dry and Julienne basil.
In a medium size bowl add tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.
Sprinkle in your favorite season salt or salt and pepper – taste.
You do not want to drown it in olive oil or balsamic vinegar.  Just enough to coat all ingredients.
Blend all together, cover and chill.
I serve in a type of chilled Martini Glass or something fun! Also sometimes I sprinkle a little grated Romano or Parmesan cheese on top as well.
