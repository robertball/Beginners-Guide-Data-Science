Ingredients:
4 boneless pork loin chops, 3/4-inch thick
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
1 (6 ounce) can frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed
1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 cups cooked brown rice

Directions:
Sprinkle both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper. In a nonstick skillet coated with nonstick cooking spray, cook chops for 3-4 minutes on each side or until browned. Transfer to an 8-in. square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray.
In the same skillet, cook garlic for 1 minute. Stir in the orange juice concentrate, broth and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a boil. Remove from the heat. Pour 1/4 cup sauce over pork.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), basting twice with sauce.
Bring the remaining sauce to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until reduced to 1/2 cup. Serve pork chops with sauce and rice.
