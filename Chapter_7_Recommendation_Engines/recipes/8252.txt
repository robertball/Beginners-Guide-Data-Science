Ingredients:
2 cups egg whites
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 1/4 cups white sugar

1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix confectioners' sugar, cake flour, and cocoa. Sift together 2 times, and set aside.
In a clean large bowl, whip egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar with an electric mixer on high speed until very stiff.  Fold in white sugar 2 tablespoons at a time while continuing to mix.  Fold in flour mixture, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour into a 10 inch tube pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for approximately 1 hour, or until cake springs back when touched.
