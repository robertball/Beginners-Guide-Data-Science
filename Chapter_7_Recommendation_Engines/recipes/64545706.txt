Ingredients:
3 1/2 lbs. chicken wings (about 10 wings)
about 3 sprigs of  rosemary
4 garlic cloves
Lawry’s Seasoned Salt
olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Chop enough rosemary to obtain 2 tbsp. Mince garlic. Combine the two and set aside.
Cut off wing tips. Cut a slit in the flap of skin at the joint to make it more pliable. Rub with olive oil, then with rosemary and garlic mixture. Generously sprinkle with seasoned salt.
Place wings on greased baking sheet(s). Do not crowd. After 30 minutes, drain any liquid that might have accumulated. Bake approx. 50 minutes longer or until brown and crisp.
