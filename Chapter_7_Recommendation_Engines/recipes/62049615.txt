Ingredients:
3 whole trouts (Without the head)
Note:  You can replace another white fish in place of trout.  Tilapia is a good substitute
3 tbsp whole corrainder seeds
3 tbsp whole cumin seeds
3 red dried chillies (dried chillies are very popular in Indian, Indonesian, Thai cuisine.  If you can't find any in your location, you can substitute with one large mexican dried red chilli)
1/4 cup of plain lowfat yogurt
1 tbsp of minced ginger
1 tbsp of minced garlic
1 pinch of red food color
juice of half a lemon or substitute with lime
2 tsp salt
1/4 cup freshly chopped cilantro
Vidalia or any other sweet onion cut into rings

Directions:
Dry roast the corrainder, cumin, and chillie in a pan.  This will release the oils and make the spices aromatic.  After roasting grind them in a chopper to a fine powder.
In a bowl, add the yogurt, spice mixture, salt, food color, minced ginger and garlic, cilantro and lemon/lime juice.
Wash the fish and pat it dry.  Place the fish in a baking dish and pour the yogurt mixture over it.  Cover and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.
After that place in the oven at 350F and bake uncovered for 25 minutes.  Turn the side of the fish and cook for another 25 minutes or until the fish flakes and looks done.
Serve with the onions and some naan bread.
