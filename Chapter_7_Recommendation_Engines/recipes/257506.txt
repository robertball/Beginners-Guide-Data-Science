1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix

Directions:
Combine garbanzo beans, diced tomatoes, roasted red pepper, jalapeno pepper, sriracha sauce, garlic powder, and chili powder in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until beans are soft and heated through, about 15 minutes. Drain all but 1 tablespoon liquid from the mixture.

Pour bean mixture into a food processor; puree to desired consistency. Spoon dip into a serving bowl.

Description: 
I'm always looking for lactose-free dips because I'm lactose intolerant and, well, dips are my favorite. This one is healthy and just spicy enough, and actually tastes like a meaty taco dip with fatty refried beans. Top it off with some soy sour cream and fresh cilantro and dig in with some homemade tortillas.
