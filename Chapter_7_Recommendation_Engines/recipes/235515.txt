Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
10 ounces dried sweetened cranberries
1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste
1/2 cup water, or more as needed
2 small jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely diced
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoons dried cilantro
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened

Directions:
Heat a saucepan over medium heat; add oil. Stir cranberries into hot oil and cook until cranberries absorb most of oil, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix sugar, water, jalapeno peppers, lemon juice, cilantro, and salt into cranberries; cook until reduced and softened, 10 to 15 more minutes. Add more water if needed.
Pulse cranberry mixture in a food processor or blender until very smooth; cool completely.
Stir cooled cranberry mixture and cream cheese together in a bowl until smooth and creamy.

Description: 
This is a fun dip that is both sweet and spicy. I got the recipe by varying other cranberry salsa and dip recipes I have found. I got the idea of the fusion of oil from a friend. There are many ideas for use and a great item to take along when you want to surprise your friends with something they probably have not tried. Serve with TriscuitsÂ®, pita chips, or crackers.
