3 large onions, coarsely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chile paste
1/4 cup tomato sauce
2 cups water

1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons paprika
1 pound Portuguese chourico sausage, casing removed, sliced 1/4-inch thick
2 (19 ounce) cans fava beans, drained

Directions:
Warm the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until golden brown. Stir in the chile paste, tomato sauce, water, parsley, salt, pepper, paprika, and sausage.
Bring the sausage mixture to a boil over high heat; reduce the heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes. Mix in the fava beans and cook 10 minutes for firm beans, or up to 30 minutes for softer beans.

Description: 
I always loved fava beans stewed Portuguese style. But there is always something missing from the recipes I have. I adjusted the spices and added some chourico, a Portuguese sausage similar to linguica or chorizo. I think this version makes a great dish. Make sure you have plenty of crusty bread for dipping in the sauce!
