Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup ground pecans
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon lemon zest
2 cups dates, pitted and chopped
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Combine flour and pecans and set aside.  Beat oil and honey together in a large bowl, then beat in the lemon zest.  Gradually blend in the flour and pecans.
Press the mixture evenly into an ungreased 9 inch square baking pan and bake for 15 minutes.
While this is baking, mix together chopped dates and water in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until mixture softens. Transfer this to a large bowl.
With a wooden spoon, break up the warm dough and turn it into the bowl containing the date mixture.  Add the coconut.  Mix all thoroughly together.
Form  into a log 2 inches in diameter and wrap in waxed paper or foil. (For ease in handling, dust hands with flour.) Refrigerate for a week.  To serve, cut into 1/4 inch slices.
