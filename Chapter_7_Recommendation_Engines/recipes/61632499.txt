Ingredients:
6 pork chops
1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped
2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
1 can (14.5) natural cream of mushroom soup
1 tablespoon cornstarch

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with seasoned salt and pepper.  Place them in a 9x13 inch baking dish. In a separate small bowl, combine the onion, mushrooms and soup. Mix together well and spoon over the chops.
Cover, and bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Uncover, and bake for 15 more minutes. (Note: Time could be less or more depending on the thickness of the chops.) Pork chops are done when their internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Pour the sauce into a medium pot and bring to a simmer. In a small bowl whisk together the cornstarch and 1/2 cup of the sauce. Whisk into the pot and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes longer. Serve with the chops.
