Ingredients:
Steak and Marinade:
1 1/2 pds Beef Skirt Steaks, cut into bite sized pieces
1 Medium Green Bell Pepper, finely chopped
2 Cloves of Garlic
1/4 Cup of Olive Oil
2 TBS Red Wine VInegar
1 TSP Oregano
1/2 TSP Red Pepper FLakes
1/2 TSP Salt and Pepper
2 Bay Leaves
Spice Mixture:
1 TSP Oregano
1/2 Tsp Red Pepper Flakes
1/2 Tsp Salt and Pepper
Bamboo skewers, or metal if you have them.
Green Pepper, or Red Pepper, and Onion for the kebabs. Cut into Inch by Inch squares.

Directions:
Prepare the steak and marinade, leave at least 8 hours, I prefer at least a day.  When ready to prepare add to skewers, I like one beef, one pepper, one onion etc.  But you can try other veggies too.   Preheat BBQ to med-high heat for direct grilling.  Mix up the Spice Mixture, and set aside.  Cook for about 7-9 mins per side, sprinkling with Spice Mixture as you go.

Description: 
An Argentinian based recipe for the BBQ!  Marinates overnight for all the flavours to blend, has a hint of spice.  In our house has been a crowd pleaser for the last few years!!  I make sure and marinate it at least 8 hours, most of the time I prefer a whole day, but it depends on your time constraints!!
