Ingredients:
1/2 cup quick oats
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 Tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar
1 cup milk
1 medium egg
2 Tablespoons melted butter or canola oil
2 Tablespoons sugar or applesauce
Oil for pan

Directions:
Make buttermilk by mixing 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice (or vinegar) with 1 cup of milk.
Add oats to the buttermilk and set aside for 10 minutes so the oats can soften and the milk can thicken.
In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients - flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
In another bowl, mix all of the wet ingredients - egg, oil, and sugar.  Mix in the buttermilk and oats.
Add the dry to the wet ingredients and mix gently.
Heat skillet over a medium high flame and lightly oil.  Use a ladle or measuring cup to measure out 1/8 cup batter.
Flip after 2 minutes or when golden.  Serve warm.
