Ingredients:
for the sliders:
1 package (12) dinner rolls
3/4 cup pizza sauce
12 slices mozzarella cheese
45 slices pepperoni
1/2 cup cooked & crumbled sausage
for the herb butter topping:
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted
1 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese
1 tsp. garlic salt
1 tsp. onion powder
1 tbsp. dried oregano
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350f degrees. Spray the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Slice the rolls horizontally (while still attached) to make a top and bottom bun.
2. Place bottom bun into prepared baking dish. Spread pizza sauce onto rolls.
3. Next, add 6 slices of cheese (covering all of the pizza sauce.)
4. On top of the cheese layer, add all the slices of pepperoni.
5. Sprinkle the top of the pepperoni with crumbled sausage.
6. Add the remaining 6 slices of cheese on top.
7. Then cover all of it with the top bun.
8. Now, make the seasoned buttery topping. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and stir well.
9. Then, using a brush (or a spoon) spread topping all over the sliders. Be sure to get the sides too!
10. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for about 15 minutes.
