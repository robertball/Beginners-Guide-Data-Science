Ingredients:
One Bunch Arugula
8 oz. Pasta (a short shape is preferred  Penne works well)
Two Shallots
1 Tbsp Olive Oil
3 Tbsp Freshly Ground Parmesan Cheese
One Dozen Sun-Dried Tomatoes
One Pot of Water
1 Cup Heavy Cream
1 tsp Dried Marjoram or 1 Tbsp Fresh Marjoram
1/3 Cup Romano Cheese
Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour pasta into a pot of boiling water, occasionally stirring with the lid off. How long the pasta will take to cook depends on the type of pasta you are using (Penne is recommended).
While pasta is cooking, heat the heavy cream, marjoram, and tomatoes in a saucepan. Do not boil – bring to a simmer only.
Mince the shallots; rinse the arugula and shred it into small pieces. Sauté the shallots for four minutes in olive oil, or until softened. Sauté arugula after shallots until wilted (around five minutes).
Going back to the saucepan – let the ingredients simmer for ten minutes, then add grated Romano cheese, stir, then pour into food processor and purée into a thick sauce.
When everything is done; arrange pasta and sautéed ingredients in a bowl, and pour sauce over everything
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top, and serve with salt/pepper to taste.
