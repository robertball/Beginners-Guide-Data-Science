Ingredients:
3/4 cup of self rising flour plus 1 Tablespoon
2 Tablespoons of cornstarch
1 cup of beer at room temperature
1 teaspoon of seafood seasoning like OLD BAY (TR)
1 teaspoon of seasoning salt like LOWERYS (TR)
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika
1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper
1   teaspoon of peanut oil
1   egg seperated

Directions:
Place the flour and cornstarch in a bowl and stir in the beer, oil, seafood seasoning,  garlic powder, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper, black pepper and seasoning salt. Stir enough to leave only a few small lumps. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand in a warm place for 3 hours.  When ready to cook the seafood/onion rings/vegetables/pickles, stir the egg yolk into the batter. Beat the egg white until stiff and gently fold it into the batter. It is recommended you dredge your seafood or vegetables in flour before dipping into batter to then fry.
