Ingredients:
5 pounds sweet potatoes
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
salt and pepper to taste
1 quart vegetable oil for frying
3/4 pound thinly sliced shallots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Prick sweet potatoes with a fork. Bake for 1 hour or until tender; reduce oven temperature to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Scoop potato flesh out of skins and place into a mixing bowl. Slowly beat in the butter and cardamom. Whip until potatoes are smooth and fluffy; season with salt and white pepper. Keep warm in oven.
In a large deep skillet, heat 1 inch of oil until shimmering. Add 1/2 of the shallots to oil and fry until crisp. Transfer the shallots, using a slotted spoon, to a paper towel; season with salt. Repeat the process until all the shallots are fried. Garnish top of potatoes with shallots.
