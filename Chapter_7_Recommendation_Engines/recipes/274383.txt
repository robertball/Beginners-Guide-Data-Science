Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups whole milk
5/8 cup white sugar, divided
1/3 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 1/3 ounces dark chocolate, broken into small pieces
4 egg yolks

Directions:
Heat milk, 1/2 the sugar, and cream in a heavy saucepan until simmering and sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes, being careful not to scorch the milk. Remove milk from heat and whisk in cocoa powder and dark chocolate. Allow to cool slightly.
Meanwhile, beat egg yolks and remaining sugar in a large bowl using a whisk or electric beater until thick and pale yellow. Add about 1 cup of the slightly cooled chocolate mixture in a slow stream to avoid cooking eggs, whisking constantly until well combined. Add the rest of the chocolate mixture and return to the saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir constantly until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes more.
Strain custard through a sieve into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap touching to mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Pour cold custard into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until hardened, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a super-chocolaty Italian-style ice cream - gelato; use the best ingredients possible, because it really makes a difference. I use 70% chocolate for it.
