Description: 
I’ve made  corn every way:  shucked, unshucked, wrapped in foil, not wrapped in foil, seasoned, sugared, boiled and microwaved. This is the easiest and best tasting ear of corn we’ve have so far.   Feel free to dress it up and of course, make a bunch. If you have extra; cut it off the cob and use on a salad- it’s especially good on a bbq chicken salad from this site.
