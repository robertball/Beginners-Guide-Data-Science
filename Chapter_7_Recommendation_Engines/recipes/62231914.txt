2 medium sized onions, chopped
1 16 ounce can stewed tomatoes
1 large green pepper, chopped
4 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup sour cream
1 pound of medium Egg Noodles

Directions:
In large pot over medium heat, heat oil and onions until onions are clear, add paprika and stir. Add chicken pieces and brown. Add can of tomatoes (whole can, juice and all), green pepper and spices.
Reduce heat and simmer for one hour to hour and half until chicken is done.
Pull chicken pieces out and let cool until you can take the bones out. (Yes you need to cook it with the bones because of the flavor that it adds to the gravy).
While the chicken pieces are out add the sour cream and stir well. Add the chicken pieces back in and simmer.
While Chicken is simmering, boil water and cook Egg Noodles according to package directions. Serves chicken over noodles.
