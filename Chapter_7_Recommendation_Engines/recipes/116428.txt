Meanwhile, sprinkle chicken with paprika and pepper. In a large nonstick skillet, cook chicken and garlic in oil for 5-6 minutes on each side or until lightly browned. Arrange chicken over rice mixture. Cover and bake 10-15 minutes longer or until chicken juices run clear and rice is tender.

This homey combination is one of my most requested chicken recipes. It's a snap to assemble using a boxed rice mix. Plus, it's low in calories.                                        --Joyce Unruh of Shipshewana, Indiana
