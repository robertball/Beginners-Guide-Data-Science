Ingredients:
2 cups of rice, brown or white
1 1/2 - 2 Tb of olive oil or butter
3 1/3-3 2/3 cups of broth
2-4 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)

Directions:
Step 1.  Spray the sides and bottom of your slow cooker with vegetable oil spray to keep the rice from sticking as it cooks.
Step 2.  Add two cups of white or brown rice to your slow cooker. Add 1 1/2- 2 Tb of olive oil or cut 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. of butter or margarine into small pieces and arrange it over the rice. Pour in 3 1/3 cups of broth if you are cooking white rice and 3 2/3 cups of the broth for brown rice.
Step 3.  Cover your slow cooker and set the heat setting to high. Cook white rice for two hours and brown rice for three hours. Gently stir the rice once during cooking time.
