Ingredients:
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 large zucchini, quartered and sliced

1 small onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1/3 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
3 tablespoons sofrito
2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir chicken until juices start to run clear, about 4 minutes. Add zucchini, celery, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir diced tomatoes, chicken broth, sofrito, Cajun seasoning, and red pepper flakes into the pot. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer soup until flavors blend together, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This is my version of a spicy low-carb chicken stew I created while starting a flat belly cleanse. I don't measure so the measurements are approximate - adjust to your taste! It just turned out so good I had to share!
