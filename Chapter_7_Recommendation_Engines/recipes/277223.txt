Ingredients:
12 ounces fingerling potatoes, halved lengthwise
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Dipping Sauce:
1/3 cup reduced-fat sour cream
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 tablespoons ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley RanchÂ®)
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.
Place potatoes in a bowl and add olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss until potatoes are coated and transfer to the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer, shaking the basket halfway through, until potatoes are cooked through and crispy, 15 to 17 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, mix sour cream, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, ranch dressing mix, and vinegar in a small bowl.
Remove cooked potatoes to a plate and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.

Description: 
The air fryer does a fantastic job roasting potatoes quickly. On their own, these fingerling potatoes make a wonderful side dish. But they also make a tasty appetizer when served with a tangy dipping sauce. They're also a popular game day snack, suitable for adults and kids.
