Ingredients:
For the pork:
5 cloves garlic
1 tablespoon coriander root, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
2 teaspoons palm sugar
2 tablespoons light soya sauce
400g pork loin or pork tenderloin
For the sauce:
5 Thai chillies, red or green, sliced thin
5 cloves garlic, sliced thin
1 teaspoon palm sugar
2-3 tablespoons fish sauce

Directions:
1. Make the pork marinade first. With a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic, coriander root, black peppercorns, palm sugar and light soya sauce into a paste.
2. Rub the paste all over the pork and marinate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
3. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Mix the sauce ingredients all in a bowl and taste the seasoning. Adjust if necessary.
4. Grill the marinated pork over a charcoal grill until fully cooked, around twenty minutes. Let the pork rest for 5 minutes and slice thinly.
5. Arrange the pork slices on a platter and spoon the sauce over before serving.
