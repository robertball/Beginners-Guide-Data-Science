Description: 
I was given this recipe in the early 1990's, and the brandy in it really makes it tastes like the REAL thing. Use the cheapest liquor that you can find. Vanilla beans can be found pretty cheaply on the Internet if you plan on making a lot. Add to Iced Coffee for a great summer pick-me-up!
