2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon sugar
3 cups thinly sliced cabbage, preferably napa (about 1/4 head; see Tips for Two)
1 small red or orange bell pepper, very thinly sliced
2 tablespoons rice flour (see Note) or cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder, (see Note)
10 ounces raw shrimp, (21-25 per pound), peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 jalapeno or serrano pepper, seeded and mince

Whisk lime juice, soy sauce, sesame oil and sugar in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Add cabbage and bell pepper; toss to combine.
Combine rice flour (or cornstarch), salt, pepper and five-spice powder in a medium bowl. Add shrimp and toss to coat. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring often, until they are pink and curled, 3 to 4 minutes. Add jalapeno and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, about 1 minute more.
