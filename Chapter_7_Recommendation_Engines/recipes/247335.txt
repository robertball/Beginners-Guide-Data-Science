Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
6 tablespoons butter
6 eggs, separated
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Line 2 muffin tins with liners.
Combine chocolate chips and butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir until melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in egg yolks.
Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar with mixer running, beating until peaks are stiff and glossy.
Stir some of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Pour chocolate mixture into the bowl of egg whites and fold until batter is well-mixed.
Scoop batter into prepared muffin tin, filling each cup 3/4 of the way full.
Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are just set in the center, about 25 minutes. Place muffin tin on a wire rack to cool, about 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the tin and let cool completely, about 15 minutes.
