Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled, large diced potatoes
6 cloves of garlic smashed and chopped
1 small finely chopped onion
3 1/2 cups chicken broth from (concentrated paste)
2 cups milk
8 oz "ends and pieces" bacon chopped
1 cup shredded cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium high heat and add chopped bacon &#34;ends and pieces&#34;. Cook until crispy, remove from pan and reserve bacon fat.
In a stockpot add the bacon fat into the pot.  Add chopped onion and caramelize over medium heat. Once the onion has softened and turned a nice golden brown add the chopped garlic to the onions and saute just until softened and fragrant.  Add chopped potatoes and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cook potatoes until tender and begin to fall apart.
Remove stockpot from heat.  Smash down potatoes by hand, be sure to leave some chunks of potatoes, unless you prefer a creamier soup.  Place stockpot back on medium-high heat and stir in the milk.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve immediately.  Top the bowls of soup with crumbled bacon and shredded cheese, or serve on table and let your guests top their own.

Description: 
I left out the ham in this potato soup and opted for topping it with some crispy bacon and some shredded cheese, making this more like a twice baked potato soup!  I purchased the ends n pieces package of bacon at my local grocer, it's much cheaper than the regular slices, and it's perfect for crumbling on top of this soup.Modified from: Delicious Ham and Potato Soup
