Ingredients:
1 box Yellow Cake Mix
1 box (6 oz.) Jell-O Instant Chocolate Pudding Mix, unprepared
½ cup Sugar
4 Eggs
¼ cup Kahlua
¼ cup Rum
1 cup Vegetable Oil
¾ cup Water

Directions:
Mix all of the ingredients together with an electric mixer on a low speed for 4 minutes.  Pour the batter into a greased and floured bundt pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes.  If you want to, glaze the cake ¼ cup Kahlua and ½ cup Powdered Sugar.  Pour it on the cake while the cake is still hot!!
Note:
I oftentimes substitute ½ cup Kahlua for the ¼ cup Rum and ¼ cup Kahlua, if I don’t have Rum.  I think that it is better as needed, but you could make the substitution as needed.  For our purposes, leave the cake un-glazed and wrap the cooled cake carefully in Saran Wrap.  I’ll arrange these on a platter, dusted with Powdered Sugar and surrounded with Strawberries when I deliver them.  You can also add Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans on the top for decoration.

Description: 
This is the most moist chocolate cake that I have EVER tasted. Everyone who tastes it says the same thing. I am surprised that no one has submitted a Kahlua cake before. It will change your life!
