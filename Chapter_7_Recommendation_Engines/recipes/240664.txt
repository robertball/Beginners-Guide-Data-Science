1 cup vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup canola oil
2 eggs, beaten

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat chocolate with canola oil in a large glass bowl in a microwave oven in 30 second increments, stirring between each round of heating, until completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir eggs and coffee granules into the melted chocolate. Sift sugar, cocoa powder, flour, and baking soda together into a bowl; add to chocolate mixture and stir to incorporate fully. Pour coffee liqueur and vanilla extract into the mixture; stir.
Pour brownie batter into an 8-inch square baking dish.
