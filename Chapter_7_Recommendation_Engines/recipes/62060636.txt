Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 8 oz cans Ortega Enchilada sauce
8 flour tortillas - burrito size
1 can Campbells's cheddar soup

Directions:
Saute the chicken in a bit of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper while cooking, adding some garlic powder or Italian herbs if you like.
Once the chicken is partially cooked, remove it from the pan and cut each breast into small bite-sized pieces. Return to pan and continue cooking. Add 4 oz. of enchilada sauce. Remove from heat when chicken is cooked.
Spray a 16x20 glass baking dish with nonstick spray. Spoon the chicken mixture evenly into the tortillas. Roll up and place seam-side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining 12 oz. of enchilada sauce over the filled tortillas. Spoon the cheddar soup over all tortillas. Bake at 350 degrees until the dish starts to bubble.
Serve with side dishes of refried beans and any commercial Mexican or yellow rice.
