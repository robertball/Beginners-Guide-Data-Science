Ingredients:
3 pounds cubed stew meat
2 1/2 cups chopped onions
1 1/2 cups chopped red bell pepper
5 cloves garlic, minced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle amber ale
5 tablespoons medium hot chili powder
1 tablespoon chipotle pepper
1 tablespoon dried Mexican Oregano
1 tablespoon sweet paprika
2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon brown sugar
4 tablespoons beef bouillon granules
salt and ground pepper to taste
2 (15 ounce) cans kidney beans, drained

Directions:
Measure spices together into a bowl.
In dutch oven over medium heat, brown meat until it starts to brown.  Stir in onions and garlic.  Cook until onions are tender, about 5 to 10 minutes.
Add spices, stir and let cook for 1-2 minutes.
Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, beer, brown sugar, beef base, beans, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a slow boil over high heat.  Reduce heat to low.  Simmer, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. It will thicken up as it cooks down.
Taste, and adjust seasonings if desired.
