Ingredients:
1 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs, panko crumbs, or crushed dry stuffing mix
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
4 turkey breast cutlets, 1/4 inch thick
1/2 cup fat free sour cream
1 tsp. dijon mustard
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Mix the bread crumbs and cheese in a shallow dish. Spread both sides of turkey with sour cream & mustard mixture and press into the bread crumb mixture to coat.  Allow crumb mixture to absorb moisture for a few minutes.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place turkey in the skillet and cook 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until lightly browned and cooked through.

Description: 
I came up with this thinking of a different way to serve the turkey breast. The sour cream seals in the moisture and no one would ever guess that it's in there. A great new way to try turkey. This is my husband's new favorite turkey dish.Modified from: Tender Breaded Turkey Cutlets
