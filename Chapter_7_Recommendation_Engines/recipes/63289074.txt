Preheat oven to 375ºF.
Step 2
In a large bowl, whisk together the rice farina, flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda and turmeric.

In a second bowl, whisk together the egg, sugar, and oil, then whisk in the buttermilk.
Step 4
Spray 8 or 9 inch cast-iron skillet with cooking spray. Put the skillet over medium-high heat, add the butter, and heat until the butter melts and is just starting to sizzle. Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides.
Step 5
Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and quickly stir together, using only as many strokes as needed to combine. Scrape the batter into the hot, buttery skillet. Immediately put the skillet in the oven and bake until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cut into wedges to serve
