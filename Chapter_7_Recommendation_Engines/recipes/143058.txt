Ingredients:
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
6 cloves garlic, chopped
3/4 cup finely chopped broccoli florets
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
6 ounces anchovy fillets, chopped
1 cup water
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
1 1/2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 pinch black pepper (optional)

Directions:
Heat 6 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then stir in garlic, broccoli, and mushrooms; cook until lightly browned. Add anchovies and water, cover, and simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in green onions, tomatoes, and parsley, cover again, simmering until vegetables are soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.
While the vegetables are cooking, bring a large pot of water and one teaspoon of olive oil to a boil. Add linguine and cook until al dente, about 7 to 8 minutes; drain. Toss with anchovy mixture and crushed red pepper flakes. If desired, season with black pepper. Serve immediately.
