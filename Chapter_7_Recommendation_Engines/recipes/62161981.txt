Ingredients:
3-4 cups leftover cooked chicken or turkey
1/2 medium onion diced
1 clove garlic
1 large bunch broccoli (or asperagus) crisp cooked
1/2 lb mushrooms sliced
seasoned breadcrumbs
1 3/4 cup milk
1 oxo chicken packet
2 tbsp flour
2 tbsp butter
1 lb cheddar cheese grated(I use extra old white cheddar)

Directions:
Make white sauce:
Over medium-low head, melt 2 tbsp butter in saucepan.  Whisk in flour until it bubbles.  Slowly whisk in milk stirring constantly until thick.  Whisk in oxo chicken packet.  Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese.  I sometimes add a pinch of nutmeg to the sauce.
In a non-stick pan sprayed with pam, saute onion, garlic and mushrooms until tender.  Stir into sauce.
Spray an 8 X 10 casserole with Pam cooking spray.  Layer shredded chicken and broccoli.  Pour sauce over top of layers.  Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and bake at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes until bubbling and browned.  Let rest for 10 - 15 minutes before serving.
