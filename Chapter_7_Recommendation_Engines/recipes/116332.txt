Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
Dash pepper
1/2 pound fresh or frozen bay scallops, thawed
2 tablespoons half-and-half cream
2 teaspoons butter or margarine, melted
1 tablespoon dry bread crumbs

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Toss scallops in flour mixture, a few at a time, and place into two greased 6- to 8-oz. baking dishes. Top each with half the cream, butter and bread crumbs. Bake, uncovered, at 450 degrees F for 18-20 minutes or until scallops are opaque and topping is golden brown.
