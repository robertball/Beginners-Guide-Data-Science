Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup ground flax seed
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
3 cups grated zucchini, or more to taste
1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 8x4-inch loaf pans.
Whisk flour, flax, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Beat white sugar, vegetable oil, applesauce, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in another bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until batter is well-mixed. Fold zucchini and chocolate chips into batter; pour batter into prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing loaves from pans.
