Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum
2 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
1 cup coconut flakes
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1 (10 ounce) package candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)

Directions:
Combine butter and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract and salt.
Sprinkle xanthan gum over flour in a separate bowl; mix together very well. Beat flour mixture into the butter mixture until dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
Mix coconut flakes and pecans in a shallow bowl. Beat egg whites in a small bowl.
Pinch off small pieces of dough and roll into balls. Dip into the egg whites then roll in the coconut mixture. Place 2 inches apart on the greased cookie sheets. Press 3 milk chocolate pieces into the center of each cookie, like eggs in a nest.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Eating wheat is not an option for me. Most gluten-free cookies are sandy and bland. I think you will enjoy these! They're perfect for Easter!
