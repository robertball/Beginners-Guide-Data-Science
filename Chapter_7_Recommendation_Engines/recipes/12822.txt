Ingredients:
3/4 cup teriyaki sauce
2/3 cup dry sherry
4 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon sesame oil
6 (6 ounce) swordfish steaks

Directions:
In a large saucepan combine teriyaki sauce, sherry, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil. Set the marinade aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Place fish in a shallow baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over the fish. Flip the fish over and pour the remaining marinade on the fish. Coat entire fish with marinade. Refrigerate the fish for 1 1/2 hours, turning the fish over often.
Grill the fish over medium-high heat for 4 minutes. Flip the fish over and grill it another 4 minutes. Fish should flake easily with a fork when done. Serve hot!
