Ingredients:
3 quarts of Epsom salts or course sea salts
3 envelopes unflavored unsweetened Kool-Aid powder (one each of three different colors)
3-4 drops of scented Essential Oils which compliment the flavors of Kool-Aid you have chosen (Orange oil with orange Kool-Aid, Lavender Oil with Grape Kool-Aid, Peppermint Oil with strawberry Kool-Aid, etc)

Directions:
Mix one envelope of Kool-aid to 1 quart salts in three separate bowls.  Add 3-4 drops of essential oils to each of the three bowls, in a scent which coordinates with the color. Let sit briefly to absorb, approx 15 minutes.  Alternate colored layers in a glass or plastic container.  To use, add 1/2 to 1 cup salts per bath.
