Ingredients:
4 large portobello mushrooms stems removed
1/4 teaspoon salt divided
Freshly ground pepper to taste
1/4 cup plain dry breadcrumbs (I rip 2 slices of bread into tiny pieces)
1/8 cup minced garlic (I add garlic pepper to the mixture as well as the minced garlic)
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup shredded cheese
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
1/2 cup shredded cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Coat a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan with cooking spray.
Place mushroom caps, gill-side up, on the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Roast until tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine breadcrumbs, Parmesan, basil, oil, the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper in a small bowl. Remove the mushrooms from the oven and top each cap with about 2 tablespoons of the breadcrumb mixture, spreading evenly. Return to the oven and roast until the breadcrumbs are browned, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese and allow to melt.

Description: 
So quick and EASY to make. Nearly no prep time involved, other than to preheat the oven. The husband loved these! Would pair well with grilled chicken breast.
