Ingredients:
1 medium head of cabbage, about 5 C. when sliced
4 T. butter
1/2 C. water
1/4 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp. sugar
good pinch of red pepper flakes, optional

Directions:
Wash the cabbage and slice in half then into strips. Place the cabbage in a 2 quart baking dish (I used my 8" iron skillet). Cut the butter into 4 pieces and place around on top of the cabbage. Pour in the water and then sprinkle with the seasoning. No need to stir. Cover with tinfoil and bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Remove the tinfoil and bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until your desired tenderness. I like mine to get the little crispy tips before I pull it out.
