Ingredients:
2 large very ripe (black) plantains - peeled
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Cut each plantain into two halves and each half into three strips.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Gently lay plantain strips into hot oil; drizzle vanilla extract over plantains and season with cinnamon. Place a cover on the skillet and cook the plantains until browned completely, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
