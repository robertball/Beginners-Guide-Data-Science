Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/8 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound dandelion greens

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine olive oil, vinegar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add leaves and toss until well combined. Lay the leaves in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets and drizzle with remaining olive oil mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until dandelion chips are crisp, making sure they do not burn, 12 to 16 minutes. Leaves will stiffen as they cool.

Description: 
Forget kale chips! Dandelion chips are plentiful, crispy, and yummy - and you can just pick them in your yard! Make sure they have not been treated with pesticides though.
