Ingredients:
2 (10 oz. pkg. fresh, chopped turnip greens, or:
one 27 oz. can "Margaret Holmes" turnip greens
1 small onion, chopped very fine
1 pkg. DRY Knorr Vegetable Soup mix
1 15 oz. can northern beans
1 15 oz. can navy beans
5 cups low sodium chicken broth (the boxed kind)
1 lb. pkg. smoked sausage, sliced thin & cut into
quarters ( I use polish kielbasa)
1 teaspoon tabasco sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook onions in a non-stick 5 qt. pot until transparent and tender.  Add all the rest of the ingredients.  Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer.  Cook until heated through and through and grren peas that are in the dry Knorr you added are done.  Substituing turkey or chicken sausage works fine. With the low sodium ckn. broth and turkey or ckn. sausage-it's healthy and good!

Description: 
The name Turnip Green Soup is horrible-but the soup is delicious!! It's very good in the summer when you don't want a heavy,tomato tasting soup!  It's light and sits well with you!! I like the name Swamp Soup that way my granchild loves it and my husband-but when I called it turnip green soup-and took it to a party everyone said ohh no!! Ugh!! But when I called it Swamp Soup-they cleaned the pot!!!and asked for the recipe!!
