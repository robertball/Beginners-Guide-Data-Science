Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
salt and black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/3 cup olive oil
1 small onion, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Rinse chicken thoroughly inside and out, place in roasting pan.  In a small bowl whisk together garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Take a small paring knife and loosen the skin away from the breast meat.  Spoon some of the olive oil mixture under the skin of the breast and rub into the meat.  Take the remaining olive oil mixture and rub all over the outside of the chicken. Place the chopped onion in the cavity of the chicken.
Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with olive oil and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I take advantage of poultry sales at my local grocer and pick up whole chickens for a great price! I can make this chicken dinner for four for under $5.00.  I season under the skin of the breast to keep the meat moist and juicy.Modified from: Juicy Roasted Chicken
