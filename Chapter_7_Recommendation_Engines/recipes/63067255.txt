Ingredients:
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoon dried Herbs de Province
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons lemon zest
salt and pepper
2 lemons sliced thin
6 Tablespoons olive oil
3 pounds russet potatoes, sliced 3/16 inch thick using a food processor*
6 cloves garlic, minced
8 halibut filets, 6 to 8 ounces each

Directions:
1.	Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Mash butter, herbs, garlic powder, lemon zest and 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper together.  Set aside (can be refrigerated for up to 1 week).
2.	Brush rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. In large bowl, toss potatoes with remaining 1/4 cup oil and garlic *immediately after slicing so they donâ€™t turn brown. Shingle potatoes tightly in 5 rows, lengthwise, on baking sheet (assembled potatoes can be covered in plastic wrap and stored in refrigerator for up to 2 hours).  Season potatoes with salt and pepper and roast until spotty brown and just tender, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through cooking.
3.	Rinse and pat halibut dry with paper towels, season with salt and pepper, and rub herb butter evenly over top of each fillet. Carefully arrange fish on top of potatoes and top each with lemon slices.
4.	Roast fish and potatoes until fish flakes apart when gently prodded with paring knife and registers 140 degrees, about 15 minutes. Gently cut potatoes in squares around each fillet and lift with a spatula onto individual plates to serve.
