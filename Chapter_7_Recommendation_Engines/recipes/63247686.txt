Ingredients:
3/4 c white rice, uncooked
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups milk, divided
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
2/3 cup raisins
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Optional: 1 chopped banana

Directions:
Bring 1 1/2  cups water to a boil in a saucepan; stir rice into salted boiling water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
In a clean saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, 1 1/2 cups milk. Cook over medium heat 10 minutes. Add sugar and cook 5-10 minutes more until thick and creamy. Stir in raisins.
Whisk together remaining 1/2 cup milk and slightly beaten egg. Add some of the hot rice mixture to the egg mixture, and whisk; repeat a couple times and then whisk warmed egg mixture into the pudding. Cook 2-3 minutes more, stirring constantly, just until the very first bubble appears. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla.
Divide into 6 portions. Stir in a chopped banana if desired.
