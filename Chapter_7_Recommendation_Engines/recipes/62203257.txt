Ingredients:
2 8oz tubs of Cool Whip (or 1 16oz)
1 small box of instant vanilla pudding
1 small box of instant chocolate pudding
Milk to prepare the puddings
6 bananas (or as needed, get a bunch)
1 can cherry pie filling
1 yellow cake of choice, homemade or purchased (I use Entenman's Louisiana Crunch Cake)
1 15oz can of crushed pinneaple
Strawberries, kiwis, nuts for garnish (or as desired)

Directions:
Use a big trifle bowl or a cake dome upside down; you can also use any big bowl but the point is to showcase the layers.
Prepare vanilla and chocolate puddings and refrigerate until needed.
Layer the ingredients in the trifle bowl, being careful of the placement as the layers will show up on the side of the dish. Here are the layers starting from the bottom up):
------------
1/2 of the cake, cut into chunks (this is the first layer at the bottom)
------------
Cherry pie filling, spreading evenly.
------------
Sliced bananas, , placing a line of slices flat against the side if you want that effect
------------
Chocolate Pudding
------------
8 oz Cool Whip
------------
1/2 cake, cut into chunks
------------
Crushed Pinneapple, liquid included
------------
Sliced bananas, placing a line of slices flat against the side if you want that effect.
------------
Vanilla Pudding
------------
8 oz of Cool Whip
------------
Garnish as desired (last step) with strawberries, kiwis, nuts, blueberries, etc.
