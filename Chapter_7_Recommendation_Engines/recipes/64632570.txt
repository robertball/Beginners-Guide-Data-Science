Ingredients:
200 gr Enoki mushrooms
1 L clove of garlic, about 1 tbs finely chopped or micro planed
1 tsp sesame oil, not the toasted oil
1/2 tsp finely grated fresh ginger, I micro planed it
1 tsp low sodium soy sauce, I use Bragg brand

Directions:
Cut the bottom 2 inches off of the mushrooms and discard. Gently separate the strands.
Add the oil to a med. size non stick skillet and cook the garlic until just fragrant, about 1 minute, med heat.
Add the mushrooms and stir fry until they begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.
Add the soy sauce and ginger and toss, cooking about 1-2 more minutes.
