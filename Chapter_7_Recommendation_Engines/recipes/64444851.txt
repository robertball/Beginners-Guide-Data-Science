Ingredients:
1 package of white or yellow dry cake mix
1/3 cup butter, room temperature
2 large eggs, divided
29 ounce can of peach slices, drained
8 ounces of Cream Cheese, room temperature
1/3 cup of sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spray a 9x 9 pan with cooking spray.
In a large bowl combine cake mix, butter, and 1 egg.  Set aside 1 1/2 cups of crumbs for topping.  Press remaining crumbs in bottom of prepared pan.  Bake 10 minutes.
Cut Peach slices into 1 inch pieces.  (You can use fresh or frozen peaches if you choose, but due to the short baking time canned seems better).  Spoon into partially baked crust.
In a large bowl combine cream cheese, sugar, 1 egg, and vanilla extract.  Beat with mixer until creamy.  Spoon over peaches.  Sprinkle with reserved crumbs.
Bake 30 minutes.  Chill at least 30 minutes before serving.  Refrigerator leftovers.
