Sweet Dressing for Fruit Salads Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
10.5 oz package of goat cheese (cream cheese makes a good substitute)
1 cup butter, softened or melted
1 cup powdered sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup skim or 1% milk (or enough to reach consistency)
1/4 tsp cinnamon
Fruit to serve

Directions:
Place the goat cheese in a blender or food processor with the butter, sugar and vanilla extract.  Depending on the power of the blender, you may have to fully melt the butter before mixing it in with the cheese.
Begin adding milk until the mixture reaches the desired consistency.  This is not a frosting, so add enough milk that it is not thick.  The consistency will be different based on the type of goat cheese you get.  In most cases, you will want to drizzle it over the fruit, so a resemblance to Ranch dressing, for example, would be optimal.
Blend cinnamon into the mix, or for aesthetic purposes, shake the cinnamon over the top of the dressing just before serving.
Have a nice fruit salad to serve this with.
Do not make this in advance, because after about two days, the goat cheese will begin to clump again (back to its original feta-like state).  You may prefer to re-blend it to maintain consistency, or continue to use as-is.

Description: 
I use this goat cheese dressing to add flavor to under-ripe fruit, as a way to make a fruit salad classier, or even as a spread on toast in the morning.
