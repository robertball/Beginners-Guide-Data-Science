Ingredients:
1 box Duncan Hines® Strawberry Flavoured Cupcake Mix
For cupcakes:
3/4 cup water
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
For frosting:
2 teaspoons water
1/2 cup softened butter

Directions:
Cupcake Instructions: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Line muffin pans with baking cups.
Empty contents of large pouch into a large bowl.
Blend cake mix, water, oil and eggs in a large bowl at low speed until moistened (about 30 seconds).
Beat at medium speed for 2 minutes.
Spoon batter evenly into the 12 cupcake liners (approximately 1/2 full).
Bake in centre of oven at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 18-23 minutes. Cupcakes are done when toothpick inserted in centre comes out clean.
Cool 5-10 minutes in pan, then remove and place on wire rack to cool completely.
Frosting Instructions: Mix softened butter with electric mixer on high for 1 minute or until light and fluffy. Scrape.
Slowly add frosting mix to butter while mixing on low speed for an additional 1 minute. Scrape.
Add water.
Start mixing on low. As frosting starts to come together, gradually increase speed to high. This step may take up to 3 minutes.
Mix on high for an additional 3 minutes.
Fill provided pastry bag with frosting (place bag in tall glass to make filling with frosting easier).
Cut approximately 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) from the tip of the pastry bag.
Insert cut pastry bag into top of cupcake and squeeze gently to fill cupcake with approximately 1 tablespoon of frosting.
Slowly remove pastry bag and swirl approximately 1 tablespoon of frosting on top.
