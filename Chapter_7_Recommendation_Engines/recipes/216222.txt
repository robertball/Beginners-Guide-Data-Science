Ingredients:
Cookie Base:
1 (1 pound 1.5 ounce) pouch Betty Crocker® double chocolate chunk cookie mix
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons water
1 egg
Filling:
8 tablespoons butter or unsalted butter, divided
3/4 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla
Topping:
1/2 cup whipping cream
2 cups semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup butter or unsalted butter
2 tablespoons instant espresso powder

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, stir cookie base ingredients until soft dough forms. Spread in bottom of ungreased 13x9-inch pan. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or just until set. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, in 1-quart saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and 3/4 cup chocolate chips over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Set aside to cool.
In large bowl, beat cream cheese and remaining 6 tablespoons butter with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. On low speed, beat in powdered sugar, cinnamon and vanilla until blended. Beat in cooled chocolate on medium speed until well blended. Spread filling over cooled base. Cover; refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.
In 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, 2 cups chocolate chips, 1/4 cup butter and the espresso powder over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and smooth. Cool until lukewarm, about 10 minutes. Pour chocolate topping over filling; spread to cover bars. Refrigerate uncovered until set, at least 2 hours or overnight. For bars, cut with wet knife into 9 rows by 4 rows. Store covered in refrigerator.
