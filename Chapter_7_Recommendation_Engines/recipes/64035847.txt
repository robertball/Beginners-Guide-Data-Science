Ingredients:
6 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
5 oz cup water
2 tablespoons dark corn syrup
3 oz melted unsweetened chocolate
1 teaspoon vanilla or coffee extract

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine confectioners' sugar, water and corn syrup. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches a temperature of 92 degrees F (33 degrees C.) Mixture should be thin enough to pour, but thick enough to coat cake. Stir in the chocolate chips and extract.
To cover cake:  Frost cake smoothly with buttercream and place on a cooling rack with a cookie sheet underneath. Pour fondant over iced cake, flowing from center and moving out in a circular motion. Touch up sides with a spatula.
