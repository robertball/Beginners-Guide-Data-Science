Ingredients:
olive oil
1 1/2 cups minced onion
1/2 cup minced carrot
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 pounds boneless chuck roast, trimmed and cut into cubes
1 teaspoon salt, divided
3/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 cup dry red wine
1 large can chopped tomatoes
1/2 cups fat-free, lower-sodium beef broth, if needed
2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano (I used marjoram, near the end)
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
1 bay leaf, or several if you are like me!
1 (10-ounce) package cremini mushrooms, quartered
3/4 cup (1/4-inch-thick) sliced carrot
a bit of sugar to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (I skipped this)
1 tablespoon chopped parsley

Directions:
1. Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 1 TB oil to pan. Add onion and chopped carrot; sauté 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic; sauté for 45 seconds, stirring constantly. Remove from pan.
2. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan. Place flour, 1/2 salt and pepper in a zip lock bag. Toss beef pices. Add half of beef to pan; sauté 6 minutes, browning on all sides. Remove from pan. Repeat as needed.
3. Add wine to pan, and bring to a boil, scraping pan. Cook until reduced to 1/3 cup (about 5 minutes). Return meat and the onion mixture to pan. Add tomato and next 5 ingredients; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover, and stir in sliced carrot and mushrooms. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until meat is very tender, stirring occasionally. Discard bay leaf. Stir in remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, basil, and parsley.
