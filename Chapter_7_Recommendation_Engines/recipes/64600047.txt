Description: 
I made this blend because I don't have access to premixed versions. It gives a spicy kick to your favorite pickled foods like eggs, cucumbers, and other vegetables. What I like about it is that is adds a great flavor, not just piquancy. I chose not to add cinnamon and cloves because I think the allspice is enough to cover that woodsy flavor.
