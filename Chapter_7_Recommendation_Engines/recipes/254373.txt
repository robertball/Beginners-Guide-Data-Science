Ingredients:
Dressing:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon honey, or more to taste
2 unpeeled Granny Smith apples
1 unpeeled Red Delicious apple
1/2 lime, juiced
1 tablespoon pine nuts

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, white balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and honey in a small bowl to make dressing.
Cut Granny Smith and Red Delicious apples into noodles using a spiralizer fitted with the large shredding blade.
Place apple noodles in a large bowl and toss with lime juice to keep them from turning brown. Pour in dressing; mix gently until salad is combined.
Place pine nuts in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Toast pine nuts, shaking often, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle pine nuts over salad.

Description: 
Let the spiralizer do all the work for you and then enjoy a fresh, crisp, crunchy apple salad with a mild vinaigrette dressing that comes together in minutes. You can use whatever apples you like just as long as they're fresh and have a firm texture. To keep the apples crisp, add the vinaigrette dressing right before serving.
