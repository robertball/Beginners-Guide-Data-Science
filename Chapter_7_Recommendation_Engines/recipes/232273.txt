Pour 1/4 cup white wine into mushroom mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; add cream and 2 tablespoons white wine. Cook and stir until gravy is creamy and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Description: 
An ambrosial sauce that is irresistible! This is excellent atop smashed potatoes or as a sauce for long, flat pasta.  Adjust seasonings for a variety of complex flavors! Common substitutions include paprika and cayenne in lieu of the Italian herbs used here!
