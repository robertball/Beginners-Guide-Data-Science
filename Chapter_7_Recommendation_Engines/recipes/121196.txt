Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg yolk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons raspberry or strawberry preserves
confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add egg yolk; mix well. Stir in the flour by hand. On a lightly floured surface, gently knead dough for 2-3 minutes or until thoroughly combined.
Roll into 1-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets. Using the end of a wooden spoon handle, make an indention in the center of each. Fill each with 1/4 teaspoon preserves. Bake at 350 degrees F for 13-15 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove to wire racks. Dust warm cookies with confectioners' sugar if desired. Cool.
