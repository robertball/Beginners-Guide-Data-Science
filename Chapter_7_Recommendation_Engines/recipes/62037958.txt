Ingredients:
2 1/2 to 3 cups Unsweetened Apple juice
3 qt. chunked sliced nectarines
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup chopped lemon balm leaves
1 or 2 large apple (fuji, granny smith, jonagold, jonathan)
2 tsp. nutmeg
3 Tbsp. honey
2 Tbsp. lemon juice

Directions:
Fill a large bowl with cold water, add 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. Cut the nectarines into chunks and keep them in the lemon water to prevent browning. In a large, heavy bottomed pot, place apple juice, nectarines, nutmeg, honey, 1/4 C lemon juice, lemon balm, and apple. Stir to prevent scorching. Let simmer 30 minutes or until thickened. Ladle into warm, sterilized canning jars, leaving 1/2" head space at the top of the jar. Screw the lids on tightly and turn upside down for 5 minutes. Turn jars right side up and allow to cool. The chutney will be ready in one week. It tastes good warmed over vanilla ice cream, by itself on a bed of lettuce, or with cottage cheese.
