Ingredients:
1/4 cup soft margarine
4 ripe pears, peeled and thinly sliced
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/3 cup brown sugar
3 eggs, lightly beaten
2 Tbsp granulated sugar
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp sifted icing sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.
In a microwavable measuring cup, microwave margarine on high for 15-20 seconds.  (If it's not completely melted, stir or swish until the remaining lumps melt.)
Remove half the margarine and place in a large mixing bowl.
Transfer remaining margarine into a large, microwavable dish.  Add pears, cinnamon, and brown sugar.  Microwave on high for 4-5 minutes until pears are soft.
Meanwhile, while the pears are cooking, combine reserved margarine, lgihtly beaten eggs, granulated sugar, milk and flour in a large bowl.  Mix until smooth.
When the pears are cooked, transfer into a lightly oiled pie pan.
Pour the batter over the pears.
Bake in pre-heated 425 F oven for 20-25 minutes or until puffed and brown.
Carefully remove pan from oven and shake gently to loosen pears.
Invert carefully onto a large plate. Sprinkle with icing sugar.
Cut into 8 wedges. Serve.

Description: 
I forget who gave me this recipe approximately 30 years ago, but it ROCKS!  I ran into it again a few days ago and decided to try it again.  The egg mixture is more of a custard than a pancake, but my beloved picky eater hubby loves it and says it's a Keeper.  High praise indeed!  Definitely not diet fare.
