Add the water, the bouillon cubes, and the vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 10 minutes or so until the liquid is absorbed.
Remove the pot from heat.

Serve hot.

Description: 
Rather than a risotto, I use pearled barley for this orzotto. Prep time is almost nil if you have a food processor to deal with chopping the onion for you. I like serving this with asparagus and Quorn chicken. Parmesan balsamic sauces go well on both alongside this.
