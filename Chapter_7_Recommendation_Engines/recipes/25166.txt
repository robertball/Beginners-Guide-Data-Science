Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 small sweet onion, diced
1 cup fresh shelled green peas
1/2 cup low sodium, low fat vegetable broth
1/2 pound sugar snap peas, trimmed
1/2 pound snow peas, trimmed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
1 medium head radicchio

Directions:
In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium low heat.  Add the onion and saute until transparent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the green peas and the broth, and cook for about 3 minutes.  Add the snap peas, snow peas and parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.  Cook, covered, for about 3 more minutes.
Remove the inner leaves from the radicchio and spread the outer leaves out to make a bowl.  Fill the hollow with the pea mixture and garnish with additional Italian parsley.

Description: 
If you like fresh peas, this is the way to go.  It must be done in the Spring with fresh peas.  Careful not to get over grown peas, which are woody.  Look for smaller peas, and you will LOVE this spring time pea medley.  It's BEAUTIFUL, too!
