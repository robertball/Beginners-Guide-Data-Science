Ingredients:
1 sheet puff pastry, thawed
1 apple, diced
2 teaspoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cloves
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 1/2 tablespoons water
1 egg, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.
Roll puff pastry sheet out with rolling pin until itâ€™s almost half the original thickness.
Cut out circles with the rim of a glass or cookie cutter.
In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and water and whisk together. Set aside.
In a small sauce pan over medium heat, combine remaining ingredients and cook for 2-3 minutes until apples start to soften.
Add cornstarch mixture and continue cooking until liquid cooks off. Remove from heat, set aside.
Spoon about a tablespoon of the apple mixture onto the puff pastry circles.
Fold the puff pastry over creating a half circle and pinch the sides together. Place on baking sheet.
Brush each folded circle with the egg wash.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
