Ingredients:
1/4 cup roast chicken drippings
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
2 cloves garlic, chopped

Directions:
After roasting a chicken, remove it from the roasting pan and place on a serving tray to rest. Leave the oven on. Pour off excess drippings from the roasting pan, leaving just enough to coat the broccoli. Toss broccoli and garlic in the drippings until coated and place in the still hot oven. Roast for 5 to 8 minutes, until tender.

Description: 
Split breast chicken roasted with my favorite seasonings blend, taken out of the oven to rest.  In its place, fresh broccoli spears and sliced garlic roasted until tender.  Pure laziness, pure genius.
