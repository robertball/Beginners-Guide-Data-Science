Ingredients:
6-3/4 inch thick boneless pork chops
1 tablespoon butter
pepper to taste
dash of thyme
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/8 cup minced garlic
1/4 cup low sodium soy, or aminos soy
1 cup low sodium beef broth
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon dried hot peppers
2-3 teaspoons corn starch
1/4-1/2 cup water

Directions:
Season the meat with pepper and thyme on both sides.  Sear the meat in hot butter in large skillet (I used a vintage electric Faberware stainless steel fry pan) on med-high heat, careful not to burn, about 5 minutes each side.  Remove meat and place on platter to the side.  Meanwhile, reduce heat a bit, then add into the hot butter, meat & grease drippings the onion and garlic for just about one minute.  I have the liquids & hot peppers mixed in a bowl ready to pour into /onion/garlic/grease/butter and stir well to distribute the bits.  Add meat back into the liquids and cover, simmer for 30 min. until done and tender.  Then remove meat to hot platter, and in separate bowl, mix the corn starch and water then stir into liquid mixture quickly, stir till slightly thickened.  Drizzle some over meat, and use the rest of the liquid as gravy for potatoes or whatever you like.
