Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 dash ground nutmeg
1 dash ground black pepper
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup chestnut puree
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup grated Romano cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, whole wheat flour, salt, nutmeg and pepper; mix.   Make a well in the center and add eggs and  2 tablespoons olive oil; beat well.  In a bowl combine chestnut puree and 1/2 cup water; add to egg mixture. Incorporate flour and egg mix. Dough will be very stiff. Adjust with more flour or water. Knead for 10 minutes and allow dough to rest for 5 minutes.
Cut off a handful of dough.  With a rolling pin, roll 6 inch wide strips, 1/16" thick. Use a pasta machine if you have one. Dust strips with flour. Allow to slightly dry on muslin cloth. Cut into long pasta 1/4" wide. Dry for 30 minutes.
Add pasta to a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water with a tablespoon of oil.  Boil for 5 minutes; drain.  Mix pasta with olive oil, minced garlic, Romano cheese, salt and pepper.  Serve immediately.
