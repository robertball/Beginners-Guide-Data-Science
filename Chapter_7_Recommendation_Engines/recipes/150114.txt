Ingredients:
2 pounds yuca, peeled and sliced lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Place the yuca into a pan and fill with enough water to cover. Stir in salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, cover, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and place yucca on a serving plate.
Meanwhile, place the olive oil, onion, garlic, and lemon juice into a pan. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes. Pour the hot olive oil mixture over the yuca, and serve immediately.
