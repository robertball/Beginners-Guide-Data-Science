Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cold unsalted butter
1/3 cup fresh cranberries
1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
2 eggs
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, white sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut unsalted butter into flour mixture with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cranberries and hazelnuts.
Beat 2 eggs and buttermilk together with a fork in a small bowl; add egg mixture to flour mixture and mix until the dough starts to come together and is just moistened. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Turn dough out on a lightly-floured surface and pat dough into a 1-inch thick circle. Cut circle in half with a sharp knife and cut each half into four sections. Gently transfer each section with a floured spatula to the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk 1 egg and cream together in a small bowl. Brush egg-cream mixture over each scone.
Bake in the preheated oven until the scones are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes. Remove to a wire rack.
Stir confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a bowl until desired glaze consistency is reached. Drizzle glaze over warm scones.

Description: 
I make these for teachers for Valentine's Day, but they are wonderful any day of the week. They are tender and flaky and lemony. You can use dried cranberries (which I do) and leave out the nuts if you'd like. The glaze is wonderful, and I haven't found a person who doesn't just love these scones.
