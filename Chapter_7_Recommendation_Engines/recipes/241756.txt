Description: 
My daughter is vegetarian so I came up with this alternative to hot bacon dressing for spinach salad. This is great if there are vegetarians at your table. I serve crumbled bacon on the side so we still get the delicious flavor of hot bacon dressing! You can substitute Dijon mustard for the honey Dijon mustard, if desired.
