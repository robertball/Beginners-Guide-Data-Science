Ingredients:
Muffins:
3 egg, at room temperature
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup coconut sugar
1 lemon, zested
1 teaspoon lemon extract
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups almond meal
1 cup fresh blueberries
Glaze:
1/2 cup coconut butter, melted
1/2 cup raw honey
lemon, juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners.
Whisk eggs, coconut oil, coconut sugar, lemon zest, and lemon extract together in a bowl. Sift salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; stir in almond meal using a rubber spatula. Mix egg mixture into almond meal mixture until batter is smooth; fold in blueberries. Scoop batter using an ice cream scooper into prepared muffin cups, filling 3/4-full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool.
Mix coconut butter, honey, and lemon juice together in a bowl until smooth; drizzle over muffins.
