Ingredients:
7 cups washed and diced red potatoes
2/3 cup diced celery
2/3 cup finely chopped onion
1 1/2 cup diced cooked ham
1 leek
6 1/2 cups water
4 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
2 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, leek, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a great way to use up leftover ham! The red potatoes make it faster, because you don't need to peel them. This makes a large pot, and leftovers freeze well. Delicious!Modified from: Delicious Ham and Potato Soup
