2 cups pecans
2 cups gluten free pretzels
4 cups of rice chex mix

½ cup grated parmesan cheese
For ranch mix:
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried dill
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried chives
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Preheat oven to 250 degrees and line two large baking sheets with parchment.
Melt butter in a microwave safe glass dish.

*You can make the ranch mix in advance and store in a tightly sealed jar.  Try using 2 tablespoons of each ingredient and use this in dressings, to coat meats, or to make more buttery ranch snack mix!

Description: 
I created this delicious gluten-free Chex mix for Gluten Free Living Magazine, and it has been a family favorite for us.  Don’t let the seemingly long ingredient list dissuade you.  This snack mix makes a party-size batch that you can store in the fridge for up to a week.  Pull it out and share it with last-minute guests - if you can control yourself!  It's savory, buttery, salty and has a little punch of tart flavor from the cranberries.  Make a huge batch - it'll go fast!
