one jar of Mrs. Richardsons Carmel
3 heath or scor bars
1 cantainer cool whip thawed

Directions:
Make the cake according to the directions on the box. When you take it out of the oven immediately poke wholes in it with a wooden spoon, be liberal with the wholes so all the goodness soaks down.  Then pour one can sweetened condensed milk, and about 3/4 jar of the carmel(enough to cover).  Place in the refrigerator to cool all the way through.
