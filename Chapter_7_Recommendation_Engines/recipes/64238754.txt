Ingredients:
3 cups flour
1 tsp salt
1 cup shortening
3/4 cup cold water

Directions:
Can use a little extra salt as you like
This amount of water will make a very soft dough.  Use a little less for a dryer mix.
Cut shortening in with a pastry cutter.  Cut until shortening is in small pea-sized balls.
Compress dough by hand into a flattened ball and work lightly.  Don't knead thoroughly as you would with bread dough.  Rather, just compress and roll a few times to get all the dry bits mixed in.  But try to preserve the layers of shortening between flour for a flaky result.
Roll dough out thinly and place in pie shell.
