Ingredients:
1 pound elbow macaroni
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 quarts milk
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound American cheese, cubed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
3/4 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 5 to 7 minutes or until just less than al dente; drain.
In large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add flour all at once and stir vigorously until combined.  Add milk a little at a time, stirring constantly until all milk is incorporated and sauce is smooth.  Stir in pepper, American cheese and tomatoes.  Stir until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth (if cheese starts to stick, reduce heat).  Place macaroni in a 10x15 baking dish.  Pour cheese mixture over macaroni, and sprinkle with bread crumbs.
Bake 15 minutes, or until top is golden.

Description: 
Most recipes for macaroni and cheese use cheddar; this one uses American cheese. My mom learned to make this in Home Economics class in the 1930's and it has been a favorite in my family since then.
