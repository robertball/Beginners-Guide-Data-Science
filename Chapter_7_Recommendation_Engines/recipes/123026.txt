Ingredients:
1 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
17 tablespoons sugar, divided
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup baking cocoa
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup chopped pecans, divided
1 (13 ounce) package Rolo candies

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, 1 cup sugar and brown sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Combine flour, cocoa and baking soda; add to the creamed mixture and beat just until combined. Stir in 1/2 cup pecans.
Shape dough by tablespoonfuls around each candy. In a small bowl, combine remaining pecans and sugar; dip each cookie halfway.  Place with nut side up on ungreased baking sheets.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 7-10 minutes or until top is slightly cracked. Cool for 3 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

Description: 
This is my favorite recipe for bake sales and bazaars. Each delightfully sweet chocolate cookie has a fun caramel surprise in the middle, thanks to Rolo candy. Dipped in pecans before baking, they look so nice that they sell in a hurry.
