Ingredients:
6 strips bacon
5 Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into eighths
1/2 cup butter
1 small sweet onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pint half-and-half
3 (15 ounce) cans chicken broth
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from skillet and crumble. Reserve drippings.
Place potatoes in a pot; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, covered, until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; saute until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in bacon crumbles, reserved bacon drippings, flour, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat; add the boiled potatoes, half-and-half, and chicken broth. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add sour cream and 1 cup Cheddar cheese; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Garnish soup with remaining Cheddar cheese and parsley.

Description: 
The thickest and most delicious potato soup ever. I created this soup after having a similar soup at a restaurant.  Incredible comfort food with ease! It's a very simple recipe to adjust to your taste. My family always asks for this soup in the winter. Garnish with chives, bacon crumbles, and Cheddar cheese.
