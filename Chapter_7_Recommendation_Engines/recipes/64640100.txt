Ingredients:
8 oz. baby spinach leaves, divided
1 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and Italian herbs, drained
1 large yellow onion, sliced
1 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1/2" pieces
6 cloves garlic, sliced
1 pound dry linguine
2 t. Italian seasoning
2 t. salt
1 t. fresh ground pepper
1 t. crushed red pepper flakes
4 cups chicken stock
1 cup white wine or 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup lemon juice
4 oz. Parmesan cheese, shredded

Directions:
Combine 1/2 of the spinach with the tomatoes, onion, chicken, garlic, linguine, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper in a 5 quart pot over medium-high heat.  Pour chicken stock and wine over top.  Cover and bring to a boil.
Cook 7-9 minutes until pasta is al dente.  Toss pasta with tongs occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot. There will still be some liquid in the pan when the pasta is done cooking.
Turn off the heat and add the cheese to the pasta.  Toss pasta with tongs until the cheese melts.  Toss in the remaining spinach.
