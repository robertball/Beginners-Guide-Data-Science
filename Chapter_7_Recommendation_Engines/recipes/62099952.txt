Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 1/2 cups sifted flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 eggs
1/2 tsp almond extract*
3 peeled apples, sliced paper thin
1/2 tsp allspice (or cinnamon)
1 cup confectioner's sugar
3 tbsp hot water (or as needed)
1/2 tsp vanilla or lemon extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Cream butter and sugar; blend in flour and baking powder.
In separate bowl, beat eggs and almond extract; add to flour mixture and beat until well-blended.
Press half the dough into bottom of a greased 13" x 9" x 2" pan - dough will be a bit sticky.  Lightly oiled hands will make this step easier.
Spread apples over dough and sprinkle with allspice.
Drop teasponfulls of remaining dough over top and press down slightly to cover apples (does not  have to totally cover the apples - dough will rise and spread when baking)
Bake for 35 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool and spread with icing, then cut into squares.
ICING:
Mix together confectioner's sugar, hot water and extract into a thin icing.
