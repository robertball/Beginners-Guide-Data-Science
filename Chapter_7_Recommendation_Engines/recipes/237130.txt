Ingredients:
1 1/2 (8 ounce) packages tri-color pasta
Dressing:
1 cup mayonnaise, or to taste
3 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste

2 cups frozen green peas, thawed
6 carrots, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1/2 sweet onion, diced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the tri-color pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Rinse pasta under cold water until cool; drain.
Whisk mayonnaise, milk, vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl until smooth. Add pasta, imitation crabmeat, peas, carrots, celery, green pepper, and onion; mix until evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate to let flavors combine, at least 5 hours.
