Peanut Butter Tofu with Snow Peas Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
One carton extra-firm tofu (14 ounces)
1 tsp coconut oil or other cooking oil
1/2 lb Asian noodles, like soba
1 cup snow peas or snap peas, trimmed
2 tsp curry paste
1/2 cup coconut milk (or sub other milk and coconut oil)
2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
1 tsp sugar
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1/2 cup peanut butter

Directions:
Cut the tofu block into two slabs, then cover on all sides with lots of paper towels and set some plates or a skillet on top to weigh it down and remove water.  Let sit for 15-20 minutes, then cube the tofu.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Lightly salt and add snow peas for 30 seconds; remove and set aside.  Cook the noodles according to the package directions; when they’re done, drain and rinse them in cold water to stop the cooking and set them aside.
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil.  Add the tofu cubes, turning after about two minutes and repeating until each side is lightly browned. Lightly sprinkle with salt and remove from heat, but you’ll be adding the sauce to the pan with the tofu.
While you’re searing the tofu, whisk together the peanut butter and coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the curry paste (you may want more or less, to taste), soy sauce, lime juice, and sugar and whisk to combine.
Dump the sauce into the tofu pan and add the noodles and snap peas.  Let the flavors combine over medium heat for a minute or two before serving.
