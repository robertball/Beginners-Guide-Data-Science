Ingredients:
kosher salt for rimming glasses (optional)
ice cubes
1/2 cup silver tequila
1/4 cup sweetened lime juice (such as Rose'sÂ®)
1/4 cup triple sec
1/4 cup lemon-lime soda, or to taste

Directions:
Rim 2 margarita glasses with salt if desired, and fill with ice. Pour the tequila, sweetened lime juice, triple sec, and lemon-lime soda into a shaker filled with ice, hold your hand firmly over over the top of the shaker so the top doesn't pop off from the carbonated soda, and shake vigorously. Pour into prepared margarita glasses, and serve.

Description: 
A successful and upscale Mexican cantina nearby makes the best margaritas I've ever tasted. They look, smell, and taste 'purer' than any others I've had. I always assumed they were using all top-shelf ingredients, until I found out their secret. . . lemon-lime soda! Now I'm able to re-create them at home.
