Description: 
At Christmas I serve friends and family Nannie's Cheese Logs in gift trays, and this spin off on my family's Cheese Log recipe was at the top of the list. It's fire hot and it's right up a man's alley for tailgating and parties. Best served with tortilla chips. Can store nicely for a week before serving.
