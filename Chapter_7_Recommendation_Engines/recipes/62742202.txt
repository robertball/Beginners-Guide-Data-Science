Ingredients:
4 medium sweet potatoes or 3 large
3 green onions
1/4 teaspoon fresh pepper
1 teaspoon Kosher salt
2 Tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 F
Puncture sweet potatoes with a fork, place on parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 35 to 50 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes.
When a fork goes through the sweet potatoes easily, they are ready.  Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes, or until you can handle them.
While the potatoes cool, finely chop the green onions.
Slice the sweet potatoes lengthwise while still warm and peel the skin away.  Discard the skin.
Place the potatoes in a bowl, add butter, green onions, and season to taste.  Toss and server immediately.
