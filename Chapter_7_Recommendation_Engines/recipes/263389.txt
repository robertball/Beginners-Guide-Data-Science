Ingredients:
1 pound uncooked jumbo shrimp, in shell with heads attached
1/8 cup cornstarch, or more as needed
3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided
10 cloves garlic, pressed
1/4 cup onion, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
3 scallions, chopped
1 1/2 tablespoons minced jalapeno pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper

Directions:
Use kitchen shears to cut long whiskers and sharp head point off of the shrimp. Place cornstarch in a bowl. Roll in cornstarch to coat lightly and evenly, brushing off excess.
Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and saute until red and golden, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate and wipe out skillet.
Heat remaining peanut oil in the same skillet. Add garlic, onion, and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant and soft, about 1 minute. Add scallions, jalapeno, and coated shrimp. Cook and stir for 30 seconds while seasoning with most of the salt and pepper. Garnish with remaining salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
This intense, flavor-packed, Vietnamese classic was actually introduced to me at a popular night spot in New York's Chinatown. Salt-and-pepper shrimp are meant to be eaten whole, body, shell, head, everything. More often than not, they are deep-fried, but after trying it both ways, we actually prefer pan frying them in less oil.
