Description: 
I love lamb burgers and I've been daydreaming recently about a lamb burger based on the famous Greek casserole, Moussaka. For those of you who don't know, moussaka is a stunning blend of spiced ground lamb, tomato, and eggplant, topped with a creamy, cheesy white sauce. I decided to integrate the eggplant right into the burger itself, instead of topping the burger with cooked slices.
