1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning

2 pounds grouper fillets
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 lemon, juiced

Preheat the oven broiler. Cover a medium baking dish with foil.
Melt butter with cream in a saucepan over medium heat, and blend in Creole mustard. Cook and stir until thickened. Mix in crab and shrimp. Season with Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook until heated through.
Place grouper in the prepared baking dish, and rub with olive oil, lemon juice, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
I modeled this after dishes I've had in restaurants at the beach. You can use any white fish. I served the fish and sauce over rice. It's fast, easy, and delicious!
