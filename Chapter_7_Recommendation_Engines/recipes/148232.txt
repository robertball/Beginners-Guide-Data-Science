Ingredients:
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon chile paste
2 tablespoons orange marmalade
1/2 pound cooked shrimp
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
3 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 orange bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
2 cups sugar snap peas
1 sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, chili paste, and orange marmalade together in a small bowl.  Stir shrimp into the marinade; refrigerate for one hour.
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Cook the orange pepper, red pepper, sugar snap peas, and onion in hot oil until they just begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss the marinated shrimp, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil into the vegetables; continue to cook until shrimp is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Serve over hot jasmine rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds.
