Ingredients:
3 cups white sugar
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 very ripe bananas, mashed
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2/3 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9x5-inch loaf pans.
Mix sugar, pumpkin puree, flour, mashed bananas, oil, eggs, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves together in a large bowl. Pour in water slowly, mixing until batter is well blended.
Divide batter between prepared loaf pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes; turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
