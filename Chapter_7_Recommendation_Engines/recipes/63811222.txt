Bacon Cheeseburger Eggrolls Recipe

Ingredients:
ground beef
bacon
shredded cheese
eggroll wrappers
vegetable oil for frying (optional)
Condiments

Directions:
1. Brown your ground beef and season it like you would do a hamburger.
2. I seasoned mine with Creole seasoning, a few dashes of  worcestershire sauce.
3. After done, I drained the grease and then added in bacon that I had already prepared and chopped into pieces.
4. Wet your eggroll wrapper and place it in front of you so it looks like a diamond rather than a square.
5. You want the filling to go straight from corner to corner.
6. Fill with ground beef and bacon mix and top with a nice heap of shredded cheese.
7. Roll by taking the bottom corner and tucking it under the filling.
8. Then bring in both sides and continue to roll.
*Your wrapper needs to be wet so it will stick and
not come apart when cooking.
9. I deep fried mine for added crispiness but you can place in the oven at 325 until brown.
