Ingredients:
1 whole fryer chicken OR chicken pieces (legs, thighs, breasts)
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 tbsp seasoning salt
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp onion powder
1/2 tbsp lemon pepper spice
1/2 tbsp salt
1/2 tbsp basil
1 tsp oregano
pinch cayenne pepper
2-3 cups flour
2 cups oil for frying OR deep fryer

Directions:
Pour chicken broth into large mixing bowl.
wash chicken pieces, pat dry/
Place chicken pieces into chicken broth and let soak while preparing flour mixture.
In a large shallow dish, combine flour and all spices & herbs until well blended.
Remove chicken from broth one piece at a time and dredge in flour mixture,  coat evenly.
Drop chicken, a few pieces at a time into HOT oil and fry until golden brown and juices run clear. ( about 10 min. per side).
Drain on paper towel, serve.
I like to serve with roasted potatoes and your choice of vegetable
but also goes great with fries and a garden salad.
(Also works well with boneless skinless chicken breasts, and will not dry out)
