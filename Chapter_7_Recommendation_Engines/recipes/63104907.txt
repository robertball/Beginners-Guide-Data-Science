Ingredients:
1 lb chicken breast or chicken tenders
1 T olive oil
1/2 tsp Pepper, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder
3 cups frozen broccoli
1 lb mostaccioli pasta (or your favorite pasta)
Alfredo Sauce:
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup cream cheese
1 cup heavy cream or half and half
2 tsp minced garlic
1 cup parmesan cheese (yes, even the Kraft variety will work)
parsley (dried or fresh) 1 tsp dried, 1 T fresh

Directions:
Put water for pasta on to boil. While waiting for pasta to boil, prepare chicken breasts. If preferred, using a meat tenderizing mallet, put chicken in a gallon size ziploc bag and hammer chicken breast to 1/2 inch uniform thickness. Combine garlic powder, onion powder and pepper or sprinkle directly on chicken breast. Heat 1 T oil in skillet and when shimmery, add chicken breast and cook five min each side over medium heat until done. Remove chicken from pan and set aside. If boiling, add pasta to water and cook according to package directions. Add frozen broccoli to water with pasta. In the chicken pan, make alfredo sauce. Melt butter and garlic. Add cream and cream cheese and simmer for five min. Using a wisk, break down cream cheese until incorporated. At the end of five min, add parmesan and parsley. Mix until melted. Strain pasta and broccoli. Slice chicken and add pasta, broccoli, chicken, and sauce to a single bowl. Pepper to taste and enjoy!
