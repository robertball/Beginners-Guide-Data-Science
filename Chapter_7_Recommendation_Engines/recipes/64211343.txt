Ingredients:
1-2 lbs Thin sliced chicken breasts
1/4 c Dark Beer
2 T Vegetable oil
2 T Vinegar
2 T Taco seasoning
salt and pepper

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except chicken into a gallon ziploc bag.
Add chicken breasts, one at a time, ensuring it is well coated before adding the next.
Give chicken a good shake, then remove all air from the bag, and refrigerate.  Let marinate between 1 hr and overnight for best results.
Heat a skillet over medium high heat.  Add chicken breasts one at a time, leaving space between each one.
Cook for 10 minutes or so, until the first side is done.  It should easily release from the skillet without sticking.  If it sticks, give it a little more time.  Flip chicken breasts as they finish, and brown the other side.  There should be little to no liquid in the skillet.
Remove from heat and let rest 5 minutes
