1/2 C sugar
1 C flour
1-1/2 t baking powder
1/8 t salt

1 can tart cherries
1 C cherry juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Blend together the butter and first 1/2 cup sugar.
Add flour, baking powder, salt, and milk to make a batter.
Put the batter in an 8 or 9 inch square pan.
Pour cherries and juice over batter, then sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup sugar on top.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35-45 min or until dough is done. Batter will rise and cherries will be in a sauce on the bottom.
