Ingredients:
canola oil - as much as needed to submerge chick peas at least 1inch
2 cans Chick peas (Garbanzo beans)
1 teaspoon Pink Salt
1 teaspoon Garlic Salt or garlic powder
1 teaspoon fine brown sugar
2 tablespoon Goya Adobo Seasoning
1/2 tablespoon Cumin
1/2 tablespoon black pepper

Directions:
Get your canola oil or oven ready. If you have a deep fryer set it to 375F. If your doing this in the over, set it to 400F.
Empty chick peas from can and strain ALL water. After you strain the water from the can, pour chick peas into bowl layered with paper towels. Shake them around and try to absorb as much water as possible. GIve it at least 10min to dry out.
After oil reaches optimal temperature, place the chick peas tray or pot. Be very careful, its known  to pop and splatter. Leave them in oil for 15min for a very crispy texture, leave in longer for more crunch.
If your going to use the oven, leave in for about 45min at 400* for that nice crispy texture. Play around with the temperature and times to get your perfect taste.
After all is baked or fried up, mix up the salt, sugar, seasoning, cumin, black pepper etc and then toss them on the hot sizzling peas in asap! You want to sprinkle the seasoning and mix up the peas while they are flaming hot. This will allow the seasoning to blend well. A brown paper bag for mixing works great!
