Ingredients:
1 head romaine lettuce
1 1/2 cup garlic-stuffed green olives
4 or 5 fresh white button mushrooms
1 cup feta cheese crumbles
2 Tbsp caesar dressing
1 tsp ranch dressing
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp canola oil
2 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp white sugar
freshly ground sea salt to taste
freshly ground pepper to taste
1 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Tear lettuce into bite-size pieces and rinse well. (Don't forget to shake excess water off of the lettuce!) Strain and rinse garlic-stuffed green olives before slicing in half. After rinsing, slice mushrooms vertically. Combine with feta crumbles in a large bowl.
In a small bowl, mix dressings, oils, lemon juice, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper with a whisk. Pour over salad and toss well, until all is coated with dressing.
Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately.
