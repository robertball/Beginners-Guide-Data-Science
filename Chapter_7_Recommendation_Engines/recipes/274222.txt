Description: 
Chicken soup soothes the soul (not a scientific fact yet, but it may as well be). In this Thai version, we infuse the broth with coconut milk, fragrant curry paste, fresh ginger, and cilantro to wake up the senses. If you're looking to clear congestion, add a few slices of fresh jalapeno to the stock mixture while it simmers. Remember to saute the chicken just until no longer pink, otherwise the pieces may become tough in the finished soup.
