Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth
3 cups split lentils
4 andouille sausage links, cut into cubes
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 (10 ounce) packages cremini mushrooms, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Combine chicken broth, lentils, sausage, cumin, chili powder, and turmeric in a large pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the lentils are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Stir mushrooms into the broth mixture; continue cooking until the mushrooms are tender, about 10 minutes more.

Description: 
Just threw it together one evening and it was a smokey delight. Has great flavor and is even better the next day. Has a split pea-like soup texture, and the andouille gives it a nice little kick. You can use kielbasa instead if andouille is too spicy. Or, for a little less heat, use chorizo.
