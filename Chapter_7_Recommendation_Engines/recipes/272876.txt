Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 purple eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1 sweet onion, cut in 1/4-inch slices
1 sweet red bell pepper, broadly sliced
2 sandwich rolls
2 slices provolone cheese

Directions:
Preheat a panini press.
Spray 1 side of each eggplant slice with cooking spray. Turn slices over and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and oregano, then spray with cooking spray. Place eggplant slices in the panini press and close the lid. Add 2 slices of onion and 4 pieces of red bell pepper to the panini press and close the lid. Cook veggies for about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast sandwich rolls and place on individual serving plates.
Place 1 slice of provolone on the bottom half of each roll, then add grilled eggplant, onion, and bell pepper slices. Cover each with top half of the roll and enjoy.

Description: 
This quick and easy grilled eggplant sandwich is a healthy substitute for a burger, and it tastes great! I cooked the eggplant and other veggies in a grill press to save time, but you could also use a grill pan or barbecue grill to prepare them.
