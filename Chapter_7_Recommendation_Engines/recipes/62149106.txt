1/4 cup white wine (whatever you are sipping will do)
1 tbsp. capers, drained
1/4 cup of chicken stock
a squeeze of lemon
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Dredge the tilapia fillets in plain flour.
Mix Romano into flour.
Dip the fillets in the egg, and dredge a second time through the flour and cheese mix.
Heat up a pan and pour some olive oil into it.
Place the Romano crusted tilapia fillets in the frying pan and fry them until they are brown on both sides.
Remove the Romano crusted tilapia fillets from the pan and keep them warm.
Add some more olive oil to the pan and saut√© the garlic in the oil.
Add white wine, capers and chicken stock to the frying pan.
Squeeze lemon juice over the frying pan and season with salt and pepper.
