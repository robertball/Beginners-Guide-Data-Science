Ingredients:
1 package of bacon
1 can green peas
1 package fresh sliced mushrooms
1 box penne pasta
For sauce:
1/2 cup butter
1 clove garlic
1 cup heavy cream
1 egg yolk
2 cups fresh grated Parmesan cheese (Make sure to use fresh triangle shaped Parmesan for best taste)

Directions:
1) Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt the water, add the penne, and cook until al dente. (Don't salt the water until after the water is boiling or it will scar your pot)
2) In another pan cook bacon until crispy, drain and set aside.  Meanwhile,in a small pot cook peas until they are just done.  Drain and cover peas with lid until sauce is ready.
3) Sauce:
In a large skillet melt butter and simmer garlic on low heat.  Stir often but do not burn garlic as it will turn bitter.
Pour 1/4 of the cream in a bowl, add the egg and beat until well blended.  Add the mushrooms and the remaining cream in with the butter and garlic.  Raise heat to medium-high and when the cream starts to simmer whisk constantly.  Slowly start to add the cream/egg mixture, but not too fast or the egg will curdle.  Whisk until well blended then add 1 cup of the Parmesan.  Whisk the cheese until it is well blended into the sauce then add the rest of the Parmesan, and whisk until smooth.  4)Immediately pour cheese sauce over pasta, add bacon, peas, mushrooms, stir lightly until blended, and enjoy!
