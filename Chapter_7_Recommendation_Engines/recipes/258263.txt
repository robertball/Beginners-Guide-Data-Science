Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, broken into florets
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups 1% milk
2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 ounces mature Cheddar cheese, grated

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Place cauliflower in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking dish.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Add flour and mix using a whisk or wooden spoon until smooth and mixture pulls away from the side of the saucepan, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk, a little at a time, and whisk continuously until sauce is thickened but still pourable, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until melted; season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over all of the cauliflower. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe for cauliflower cheese but it's pretty versatile. You can use the cheese sauce with any vegetables you have handy. I often put a layer of cooked kale or broccoli on the bottom, then arrange the cooked cauliflower florets on top. You can change the flavor of the sauce by adding different cheeses you might have in your fridge. It takes a bit of elbow work to make the sauce but it's worth it. This is delicious served with roast beef or lamb.
