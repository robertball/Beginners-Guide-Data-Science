Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 beaten egg
1 (15 ounce) jar chunky salsa
1 1/2 cups dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Lightly mix the ground chuck, onion, brown sugar, egg, salsa, and bread crumbs in a bowl, and spoon into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the meatloaf is cooked all the way through and the top is browned. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
I make salsa from my garden, then can for later, and use to make this awesome meatloaf. I use garlic, fresh tomatoes, peppers and onions all from my garden. You can use commercially-made salsa, too.
