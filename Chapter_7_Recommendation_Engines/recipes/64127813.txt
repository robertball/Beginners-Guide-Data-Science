Ingredients:
2 pounds chicken thighs and/or drumsticks
3/4 cup separated of your favorite barbecue sauce(I use Sweet Baby James)
Nonstick spray or 2TBS olive oil

Directions:
Grease the inside of your slow cooker with the nonstick spray or wipe with olive oil. This will ensure an easy cleanup.
Dump the chicken into the slow cooker. (I have even placed it in there frozen. Just increase the cooking time).
Carelessly dump 1/4 cup of the sauce over the chicken and then cook on low for 7 hours until the chicken is fully cooked. I wait until it has at least an internal temperature of 170 degrees.
Preheat the broiler in your oven. Place the chicken pieces skin side up on a baking dish. Brush on about 1-2 TBS of Barbecue sauce onto each pieceof chicken. Broil the chicken on high broil for about 4 minutes. When the skin is blackened and sticky to your liking take the chicken out of the oven and serve.

Description: 
Get that crispy sticky skin on barbecued chicken that you make primarily in the slow cooker. Just finish it off in the broiler and everyone will think you marinated the chicken and labored over a hot grill. I have even dumped the chicken in the slow cooker in the form of a frozen block straight out of the freezer and still it comes out wonderfully. I use Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce and I always have a satisfied family. Tender, fall-off-the-bone meat with crunchy sticky skin. Yum! Happy slow cooking y'all.
