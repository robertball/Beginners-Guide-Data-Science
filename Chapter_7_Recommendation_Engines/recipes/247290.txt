Description: 
I found a recipe online for nectarine jam. It stated that nectarine skin has natural pectin and jam would set as long as the fruit wasn't peeled (Note: no pectin listed in the ingredient list). Just for fun, I decided to experiment with the microwave. The result was oh, so delicious. I made mine in the microwave-safe cup of the Magic Bullet® and blended it right in the cup.
