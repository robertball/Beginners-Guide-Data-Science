Ingredients:
1/2 lb. Ground Spicey Italian Sausage
1 Lg. packaged pizza crust (I use Boboli)
Olive Oil
Garlic Salt
1-14 oz. jar prepared pizza sauce (save some for dipping!)
12 oz. package Shredded pizza cheese. Provolone, Mozzarella or 3 cheese Italian is GREAT!
1 package Pepperoni or Turkey Pepperoni
1 Chopped or Julienne'd Bell Pepper
1 Chopped or Julienne'd white Onion
2 C. Sliced Mushrooms (We like Baby Bella's)
1/2 C. Finely Shredded Parmesan (can use canned parmesan if you prefer)
Crushed Red Pepper

Directions:
Brown Italian sausage in skillet, drain off excess grease. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place Pizza crust on pizza pan or on pizza stone. Rub around edge with Olive Oil and sprinkle garlic salt around prepared edges. Spread Pizza sauce over base of crust just up to the lower edge. (You will have some sauce left over) Sprinkle on the bag of Shredded cheese of choice. Layer on Sausage, Pepperoni, Bell Pepper, Onion and Mushrooms. Sprinkle shredded Parmesan over top. Place pizza, still on the pan, into preheated oven and bake 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is bubbly but crust is not over-baked. Let pizza rest for 5 minutes, then slice pie style or in squares and serve with heated remainder of pizza sauce for dipping and crushed red pepper to individual taste.
