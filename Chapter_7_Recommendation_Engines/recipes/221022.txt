Ingredients:
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 pear - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1 crisp apple - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1 Asian pear - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups cold water
4 large lettuce leaves
4 sprigs watercress
4 fresh strawberries, sliced
1/4 cup low-fat yogurt
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup black raisins
1/4 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Toast walnuts in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until walnuts are fragrant and begin to release oil, 7 to 10 minutes. Set aside to cool thoroughly.
Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl of cold water; place pear slices, apple slices, and Asian pear in the water, about 5 minutes; drain.
Arrange 1 lettuce leaf, 1 watercress leaf, and 1 sliced strawberry decoratively on top of each other on 4 salad plates.
Whisk yogurt, mayonnaise, and vinegar together in a small bowl for the dressing; season with salt and black pepper.
Combine black raisins and golden raisins in a small bowl.
Place 3 to 4 slices pear, apple, and Asian pear in fan-shape on each lettuce leaf.
Sprinkle raisins and walnuts, and drizzle dressing over fruit slices.
