Ingredients:
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/4 pounds flank steak, trimmed
Nonstick cooking spray
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 10 ounce bag baby spinach

Directions:
1. Whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, brown sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary and minced garlic and half the black pepper in a small bowl. Place the steak in a resealable bag, pour in the marinade and turn to coat. Refrigerate for a minimum 4 hours, turning occasionally.
2. Heat a grill pan over medium high heat and mist with cooking spray. Remove steak from marinade and season with 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. Grill 5 minutes per side for medium rare or 7 minutes for medium. Transfer steak to a cutting board, sprinkle with another 1/8 teaspoon salt, tent with foil and let rest 10 minutes.
3. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and saute 1 minute; season with remaining salt and black pepper. Add half the spinach and saute until wilted, about 1 minute. Add remaining spinach and saute until just wilted, 1 minute more. Slice steak and serve with the spinach.
