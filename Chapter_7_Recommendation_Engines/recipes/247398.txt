Ingredients:
24 Original Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®
1/4 cup cream cheese spread
1/3 cup strawberry marshmallow fluff
8 fresh strawberries, hulled and cut into thirds
1 (1 ounce) square sweet chocolate baking bar

Directions:
Arrange 24 Pretzel Crisps(R) on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Combine cream cheese spread and strawberry marshmallow fluff in a small bowl; mix well. Top each Pretzel Crisp(R) with a small spoonful of strawberry fluff mixture and spread slightly. Add a strawberry slice to the top of each.
Place the chocolate in a small, microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high, in 20 second increments, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted. Place the melted chocolate into a pastry bag or small zip-top bag. Take a tiny snip off of the tip of the pastry bag (or the corner of the zip-top bag) with a scissors. Drizzle the chocolate over the Pretzel Crisps(R).
Refrigerate until ready to serve.
