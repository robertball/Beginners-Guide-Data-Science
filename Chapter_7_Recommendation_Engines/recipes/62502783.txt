Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
8 slices thick cut bacon
1/2 loaf bread
10 saltine crackers
1 egg
1 medium apple
1/3 cup apple cider
1 tsp garam masala
salt
pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Between two pieces of plastic wrap, pound each chicken breast with a meat mallet until thin and pliable.  Season with salt and pepper, then set aside.
In a large bowl, rip up the bread.  Break the crackers and toss them in, too.  Peel and dice the apple, then add to bowl.  Add egg, apple cider, garam masala, and salt/pepper to taste.  Mix with hands until well combined.
Stuff each chicken breast with the stuffing, securing with toothpicks if necessary.  Wrap each stuffed breast with two bacon slices and place in 9x13 baking dish.
Cook uncovered for 35-40 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and bacon is cooked.

Description: 
This is a twist on one of my basic but favorite ways to prepare chicken.  Boneless, skinless breast is stuffed with an apple stuffing, then wrapped in bacon for a wonderfully flavorful autumn main dish.
