Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, diced
2 large onions, chopped
3 tablespoons crushed garlic
2 pounds cubed beef stew meat
6 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles brown ale (such as NewcastleÂ® Brown Ale), or as needed
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 bay leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 pounds fingerling potatoes
1 pound baby carrots
1 cup diced green bell pepper

Directions:
Place bacon in a Dutch oven or large pot; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir onions and garlic into bacon and cook until onions are translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add beef; cook and stir until beef is thoroughly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
Pour enough beer over beef mixture to almost fill the Dutch oven; add Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cover Dutch oven and bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, adding more beer as needed, until beef is almost tender, about 2 hours. Add potatoes, carrots, green bell pepper, and enough beer to cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
