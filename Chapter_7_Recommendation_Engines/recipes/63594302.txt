Ingredients:
1 cup whole pecans
1 teaspoon vinegar
3 egg whites
pinch of salt
1 cup sugar
zipper baggie
wooden spoon
tape
Bible

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300Â°. THIS IS IMPORTANT...don't wait until you're half done with the recipe.
Place pecans in zipper baggie and let the children beat them with the wooden spoon to break them into small pieces.  Explain that after Jesus was arrested, He was beaten by the Roman soldiers.  Read John 19:1-3.
Let each child smell the vinegar.  Put 1 teaspoon in the mixing bowl.  Explain that when Jesus was thirsty on the cross, He was given vinegar to drink.  Read John 19:28-30.
Add egg whites to the vinegar in the bowl.  Explain that eggs represent life and that Jesus gave his life to give up life.  Read John 10:10-11
Sprinkle a little salt into each child's hand.  Let them taste it and brush the rest into the bowl.  Explain that this represents the salty tears shed by Jesus' followers, and the bitterness of their own sin.  Read Luke 23:27.

Beat with a mixer on high speed for 12 to 15 minutes until stiff peaks form.  Explain that the color white represents the purity in God's eyes of those whose sins have been cleansed by Jesus.  Read Isaiah 1:18 and John 3:1-3.
