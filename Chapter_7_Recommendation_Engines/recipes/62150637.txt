Description: 
I learned the basics of this recipe when I was in high school back in Columbus, MT.  I have added the broccoli because it suits my adult tastes but the base dressing of mayo, buttermilk, and sugar is what really sets this recipe apart from the rest!
This slaw is excellent as a side dish or as a topper a BBQ pulled pork sandwich.
