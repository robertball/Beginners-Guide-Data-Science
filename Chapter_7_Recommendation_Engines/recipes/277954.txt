Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds pork cutlets, cut into bite-sized pieces
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon sesame oil
nonstick cooking spray
Sauce:
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup rice vinegar
4 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Place pork, cornstarch, and sesame oil in a bowl and toss to coat. Let sit for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray. Place pork in the basket of the air fryer and spray top of pork with cooking spray.
Cook for 10 minutes. Shake the basket and cook pork until desired crispness, about 10 minutes more.
While the pork is cooking, combine sugar, vinegar, ketchup, and soy sauce in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk constantly until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat to low and keep sauce warm until ready to use.
Transfer pork to a bowl. Pour sauce on top of the pork and toss to coat.

Description: 
Skip takeout and make your own sweet and sour pork at home. I like to toss some egg rolls in the air fryer while it is hot so that the meal has that full Chinese takeout feel to it. Serve over rice if desired.
