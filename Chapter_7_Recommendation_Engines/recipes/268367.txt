Ingredients:
2 quarts whole milk, or more as needed
1 cup Carolina gold rice
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs, at room temperature
1 cup raisins, or to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place milk, rice, and sugar in a large pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Beat eggs in a bowl. Add a small amount of the rice mixture to the eggs to temper them. Pour mixture into the pot; add raisins and vanilla extract. Let cook until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes more. Add more milk if pudding gets too thick. Pour into a serving bowl and sprinkle cinnamon on top.
