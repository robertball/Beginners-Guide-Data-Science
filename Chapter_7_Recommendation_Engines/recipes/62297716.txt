Ingredients:
MEATBALLS:
1 lb. lean ground beef or 1/2 lb. ground beef
and 1/2 lb. ground pork
1 tsp salt
1 egg beaten
1/4 cup dry breadcrumbs
1/3 cup grated precorino romano or parmesan cheese
2 tbsp. dried parsley or 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
1 tsp. garlic powder
3 tbsp. grated onion
CHICKEN STOCK:
To make your own chicken stock you need
1 whole chicken (approx 3 lbs.) or you can use pieces
3 carrots - sliced
3 celery stalks - sliced (use celery leaves too
1 large onion quartered
6- 8 chicken cubes (or you can fill soup pot 1/2 with
water and use two boxes store bought chicken
broth
Salt & pepper to taste
1 tsp. dry basil
1 tbsp. dried parsley
2 cups slivered baby spinach
(you can substitute escarole if you prefer)
1 cup Acini di Pepi Pasta (uncooked)
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHICKEN STOCK, YOU CAN USE 4 BOXES OF PURCHASED CHICKEN BROTH, ADD CARROTS, ONIONS AND CELERY AND SIMMER 20 MIN.  ADD YOUR MEATBALLS AND PASTA AS DIRECTED BELOW AND THEN ADD YOUR SPINACH.

Directions:
Place chicken in large pot, add water to cover.  Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes skimming off foam.  Add vegetables and seasonings and continue to simmer for 30 minutes more (or until chicken is cooked through).  Remove chicken - you can cut chicken up and use in another recipe.
Meatballs:
In a large bowl combine meat ingredients; shape into small balls and place on cookie tray.  Bake in 325 deg. oven for 15 minutes, remove and pat with paper towels to remove excess grease.  Add meatballs and pasta to chicken broth and bring to a boil, turn down to simmer and continue cooking 10 minutes.  Add spinach and cook approx 2 minutes more.
