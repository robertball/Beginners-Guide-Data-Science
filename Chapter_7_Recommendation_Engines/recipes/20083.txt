Description: 
Velvety asparagus soup, lovely green color, great with crunchy rolls.  My friend gave me this recipe, it originally used chicken broth.  When my daughter became vegetarian, I modified it with vegetable broth instead!  It also doubles easily.  This soup will tempt even asparagus haters!
