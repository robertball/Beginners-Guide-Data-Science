Ingredients:
8 chicken thighs, skin on
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup minced green onion
3 tablespoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons honey
2 garlic cloves (or as much as you like), minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and minced
1 16oz. jar La Victoria Salsa Suprema (mild or hot)
1 fresh jalapeno, sliced (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place chicken skin side down in a large baking dish.
Combine remaining ingredients in a bowl and then pour on top of the chicken.
Bake uncovered for 45 minutes.
Turn the chicken over in the dish and bake for another 15 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and chicken is no longer pink.
The sauce is SOOOOO good served over white rice, however, chicken thighs are extremely fatty so make sure you skim the fat first. Enjoy!
