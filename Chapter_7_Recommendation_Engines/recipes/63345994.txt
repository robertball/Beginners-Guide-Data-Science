Description: 
This cheesy cornbread is fun to make; it's loaded with onions and jalapeno flavor too!  The onions don't overpower the flavor.  Using a large onion is the trick, small onions are too strong.  
If your feeding those who can't take the heat, use one jalapeno instead of the 4 this recipe calls for.
