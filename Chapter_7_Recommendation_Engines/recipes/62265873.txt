2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stick butter softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs

In a bowl, combine the flour, baking soda and salt. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Beat in bananas. Gradually add the dry ingredients, beating just until combined. Fold in blueberries.
Pour into three greased 5-3/4-in. x 3-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
