Description: 
A flavorful chicken stew that uses exotic spices and nice vegetables served over whole-grain couscous. This recipe was actually a real chicken contest winner! Vegetables and even meat can vary according to taste, but I find squash, carrots, bell peppers, and lamb work well in this recipe. Even though the spices seem strange, the flavors are subtle but fragrant! A real favorite at home.
