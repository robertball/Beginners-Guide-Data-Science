Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups small pasta shells OR 1 1/2 cups macaroni
2 cups milk
3 tablespoons flour
10 slices processed American cheese
1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)

Directions:
Cook shells or macaroni according to the directions on the package and then drain them.
While the pasta is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 1/2 cups of the milk to a boil.
In a cup or small bowl (the measuring cup works well), use a fork to stir the flour into the remaining half cup milk until it's relatively smooth.  Pour the flour and milk mixture into the boiling milk a little at a time, whisking constantly to stop lumps from forming.
Continue whisking for at least one minute after the sauce returns to a boil in order to cook the flour.
Bring the heat to low and stir in the cheese slices until the sauce is smooth.
Taste the sauce and add as much salt as you see fit.  I use 1 teaspoon.
Pour the sauce into the pot of drained pasta and stir it all together.
Enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe produces a mild, smooth macaroni and cheese that my boyfriend, Paul, loves.  You can substitute sharp cheddar cheese if you want something stronger.  Either way, it's yummy and the sauce will be done before the noodles have finished cooking!  As a side dish, it makes enough for 4 or 5 people, and as a main dish, it will feed 2 or 3 hungry ones.
