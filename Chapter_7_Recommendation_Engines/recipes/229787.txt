Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
1 leek, cleaned and finely chopped
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk
1 egg
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, plus additional for garnish
1/2 teaspoon fresh or dried thyme

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Lightly spray a 12-cup muffin pan* with non-stick cooking spray.
Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Cook leeks until softened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.  Divide leeks among muffin cups and top with 2/3 cup of Cheddar cheese.
Blend fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk, egg, sun-dried tomatoes and thyme in a blender or food processor for about 20 seconds or until tomato is minced.  Pour fat-free or low-fat lactose-free milk mixture over cheese in muffin cups and top each with remaining cheese.  Bake 30 minutes or until tops and edges are browned.  Cool in pan for 3 minutes; serve warm or cold.  Top with additional pieces of sun-dried tomato, if desired.
