Ingredients:
Hummus Base:
2 16oz. cans Garbanzo beans (drained and rinsed)
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 Tbsp minced garlic
6 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp water
2 Tbsp Tahini (optional if you don't have any)
Add to hummus:
2 eggs
1/2 cup fine bread crumbs
2 large carrots, finely shredded (I used a cheese grater)
1/2 an onion chopped (can be caramelized or raw)
1 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp lemon pepper
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp cumin
6 slices cooked turkey bacon sliced into small strips (optional)
A few Tbsps olive oil for cooking

Directions:
Blend garbanzo beans, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, water and tahini in a blender.  Pulse in blender until thick and smooth.
Pour hummus base into a large mixing bowl and stir in eggs completely.  Then add the bread crumbs, shredded carrots, onion, garlic salt, lemon pepper, onion powder, cumin, onion, and turkey bacon until thoroughly mixed.  Be gentle with the mixture, do not whip or beat, just stir.
Coat the bottom of a large skillet with a very thin coat of olive oil and heat on medium heat.  When oil is hot drop a large spoonful of the falafel mixture onto the skillet and gently flatten into thick disc with the back of the spoon.
Cook for 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown.  Place on wire rack with paper towels underneath. Serve immediately.

I wanted hummus for dinner but the hubby is a hearty eater so I figured meet in the middle and make falafels! Well, I got a little creative :) Great with Taziki sauce or you can get all crazy and use jalapeno jelly like me.
