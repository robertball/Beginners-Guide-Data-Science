Title:
Fruity Fiber Bomb Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 cup dried pitted prunes
1 cup dried pitted apricots
1/2 cup dried pineapple chunks
1/2 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup sultana raisins (the tiny dark ones)
1 cinnamon stick (2 inches long)
4 whole cloves (not ground)
1 shot of your favourite liquor (optional)

Directions:
Place all dried fruit in a fine sieve and rinse under cold running water to wash out the sorbic potasium used to preserve them.  Let it strain in the sink briefly.  Place in a small  saucepan and add water just to cover the fruit.  Drop in the cinnamon stick and the cloves.
Cover with a lid and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes.
Turn off the heat and let stand until the sides of the pan are barely warm (the fruit will be nicely plumped up). At this point you can add the liquor of your preference (one shot only). Best is brandy.  Good options are vodka, whiskey and gin. Avoid sweet liquors as they overpower the taste.
Transfer to clean glass jars with a lid and refrigerate. It will keep for 2 weeks.

Description: 
An excellent addition of stewed dried fuit over breakfast cereal, yogurt, ice cream or as a side dish with dark meats (turkey thighs, pork tenderloin and game).  I like it in a scoop size bowl to accompany fragrant teas in the afternoon.
