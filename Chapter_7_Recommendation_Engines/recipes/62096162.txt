Ingredients:
4 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup flaxseed, sesame, or sunflower seed
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup grapeseed or canola oil
1 tsp vanilla or almond extract
1/2 cup chopped almonds or walnuts
3 cinnamon graham crackers, crushed
2 tbsp brown sugar
1 cup raisins or dried cranberries

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the honey, oil, and extract.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, seeds, salt, and chopped nuts.
Stir liquids into dry ingredients slowly, until absorbed.
Spread the granola across a shallow baking pan, so that the mixture is about an inch thick.
Bake for about 1 hour at 375 degrees, or until slightly dry and browning. Stir every 8-10 minutes while baking so to avoid burning.
Remove from oven and immediately transfer back to large mixing bowl. Stir in graham, brown sugar and dried fruit.
Cover and let cool. Will stay fresh at room temperature for about 2 weeks.
