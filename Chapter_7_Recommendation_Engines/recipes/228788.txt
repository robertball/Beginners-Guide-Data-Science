Description: 
I got this super-easy recipe from a restaurant back in the 90s. It is a must-have whenever I serve sweet potato fries. Plain Greek yogurt and sugar-free syrup can be substituted to make it lighter. Feel free to adjust the amount of ingredients depending on your tastes. Hope you enjoy!
