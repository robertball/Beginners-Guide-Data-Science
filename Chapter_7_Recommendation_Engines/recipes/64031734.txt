3. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the banana,1/2 cup of peanut butter, honey, buttermilk, oil, eggs and vanilla extract until smooth.

5. Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top into an even layer.  Add the remaining peanut butter in small teaspoons vertically   down the loaves.  Using a butter knife,swirl the peanut butter through the batter. Bake until a toothpick or thin knife inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes for 1 large loaf; 45 minutes to 1 hour for mini loaves.
6.  Let cool for at least 10 minutes.
