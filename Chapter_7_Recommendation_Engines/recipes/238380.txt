Ingredients:
2 cups chopped green tomato
2 cups peeled and chopped tart green apples
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup chopped raisins
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie

Directions:
Combine tomatoes, apples, brown sugar, raisins, vinegar, butter, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large saucepan; cook and stir over medium-low heat until bubbling and slightly reduced in volume, about 25 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Press 1 pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.
Pour green tomato filling into the pie crust; top with the second pie crust, crimping the edges together to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Decrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue baking until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is 'The Holidays' for me. I remember the smell filling the house 60 years ago when my mom was cooking it. At the end of the tomato season, when the remaining tomatoes in the garden will not ripen, this is a great use for them. A note from my mother: I put a heaping teaspoon of tapioca on the bottom crust before I fill it. It will absorb some of the liquid.
