Ingredients:
4 tilapia fillets (frozen is just fine)
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1 (10-ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained
aluminum foil
salt and pepper to taste at the table

Directions:
Use a 6-quart slow cooker.
Lay a length of foil on your counter top and place the fish directly in the middle.
Dribble balsamic vinegar and honey over the top of each fillet, and place a handful of drained mandarin oranges on top (my kids like to drink the juice!).
Fold over foil and crimp the edges to form a packet.
Put the foil packets into your slow cooker, and put the lid on.
Cook on high for two hours, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. If your fish was frozen, it may take another 30 minutes or so, but you should still check it after two hours.
Season to taste with some salt and pepper at the table.
