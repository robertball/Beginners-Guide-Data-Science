Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 large egg
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
1/2 pound leftover meatloaf, or more as desired
2 1/2 tablespoons chili powder
2 tablespoons crushed bay leaf
2 tablespoons cumin
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 egg yolks

Directions:
Sift flour into a bowl. Add butter, egg, water, and vinegar. Combine, mashing with your hands, until dough is well blended and sticks together.
Put meatloaf in a bowl and add chili powder, crushed bay leaves, cumin, garlic powder, and salt. Mash together until well mixed.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Add meatloaf and cook until hot and browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick spray.
Flour a work surface and roll out dough. Cut out 10 circles.
Add an equal amount of meatloaf filling to each circle. Fold dough over and use a fork to enclose and seal empanadas. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk egg yolks in a bowl and brush over empanadas.
Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.
