Ingredients:
3 pounds bone-in pork shoulder roast
1 onion, sliced
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
6 cups water, or as needed to cover
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, or to taste
1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese
20 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1/4 cup vegetable oil, divided

Directions:
Bring pork shoulder roast, onion, garlic, and 1 package taco seasoning to a boil in a large pot with enough water to cover. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender and no longer pink in the center, 2 to 3 hours. Check water level every 45 minutes, adding more as needed. Reserve about 1 cup cooking liquid.
Shred pork with a fork, discarding excess fat and bone. Stir in tomatoes, refried beans, green chiles, and remaining package of taco seasoning. If the mixture is too dry, add reserved cooking liquid.
Spread pork mixture evenly down the center of each tortilla; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese. Fold bottom and top edges of each tortilla over filling; roll sides up to enclose filling completely.
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil a large skillet over medium heat; fry burritos in batches, seam sides down, until tortillas are golden, about 2 minutes per side. Drain fried burritos on a paper towel-lined plate.

Description: 
Pork butt roast and taco or burrito seasoning are a combination to die for! This recipe originally came from my Aunt Pennie. I've tweaked it to our liking though. My whole family loves these! When we have friends over for dinner, this is the perfect meal to prepare. I usually make about 20-24 burritos from one batch of filling. Serve with lettuce, tomato, green onion, sour cream, salsa, avocado, black olives, and Cheddar cheese, if desired.
