1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon dried thyme
2 chicken thighs, skin removed
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced celery
3/4 cup water
1 small bay leaf
1/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a resealable plastic bag, combine 2-1/4 teaspoons flour, salt, pepper and thyme. Add chicken and shake to coat. In a small skillet, brown chicken in butter. Remove chicken and set aside. In same skillet, saute the mushrooms, onion and celery until crisp-tender. Return chicken to the pan. Add water and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 30-35 minutes or until chicken juices run clear, turning occasionally.
Place remaining flour mixture in a bowl; stir in milk until smooth. Stir into pan juices. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Discard bay leaf. Sprinkle with parsley.
