Description: 
I always think of squash as a Winter dish, but  it great year round. This microwavable side dish is a terrific time saver and a fantastic veggie that is just cheesy-good. Great served as a side with lemon grilled chicken or served atop some garlic pasta noodles with a choice glass of wine. Your choices are unlimited, so start creating and bon appetite!
