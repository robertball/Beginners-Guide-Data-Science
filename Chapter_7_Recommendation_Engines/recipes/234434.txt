Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoons chopped black olives
12 sea scallops
2 teaspoons seafood seasoning (such as Old BayÂ®)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
12 slices prosciutto

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish with butter.
Place olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and olives in a food processor; pulse until finally chopped.
Season scallops with seafood seasoning, salt, and pepper. Fold each slice of prosciutto in half lengthwise. Rub tomato mixture over scallops and wrap each with a slice of prosciutto. Arrange wrapped scallops on the prepared baking dish, seam sides down.
Bake in the preheated oven until prosciutto is crispy and scallops are opaque, about 15 minutes.

If you like bacon-wrapped scallops, you will love these. They are a little more expensive to make but well worth it!
