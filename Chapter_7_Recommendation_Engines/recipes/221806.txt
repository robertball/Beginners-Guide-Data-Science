Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package frozen French fries
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups beef broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups cheese curds

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Spread fries in a single layer over prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, about 15 minutes.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in flour vigorously. When mixture bubbles, reduce heat to low; cook and stir until the mixture thins, about 2 minutes. Whisk in beef broth. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy has thickened, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Place fries on a serving plate or in individual bowls. Distribute the cheese curds over the fries; pour hot gravy over the fries and curds. Serve immediately.

Description: 
Poutine originated from rural Qu√©bec province in the 1950s. 
I would say poutine is not second to any other food in Canada. 
I order poutine when I go to diners, but I also buy fresh cheese curd to make my own at home. 
Homemade gravy is really easy and quick to make. 
The only rule I don't follow for authentic poutine is that I don't fry my French fries; 
I bake them in the oven. 
Be careful. This is very addictive!
