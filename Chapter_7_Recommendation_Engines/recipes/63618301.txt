Description: 
I make this recipe all the time, because it's SO easy! It's also great for those who love oatmeal cookies, but don't like raisins! I also like to add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on top, before I put them in the oven, they smell and taste delicious!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!! Enjoy! :)
