Ingredients:
2 hearts of romaine, cut in half lengthwise
olive oil
sea salt
fresh pepper
shaved Parmesan (optional)
Caesar salad dressing (optional)

Directions:
Pre-heat the grill to medium heat.
Place each half of romaine face up on a platter and drizzle with olive oil.
Grill face down for 5 minutes until lettuce begins to char slightly (do NOT close grill or lettuce will become soggy).
Remove from grill.  While still warm, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.  Add Parmesan cheese or serve on the side. Also good with your favorite Caesar salad dressing.  Other toppings to consider:  sunflower seeds, lemon juice, or whatever you want to try!
