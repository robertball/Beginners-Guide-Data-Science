Ingredients:
1/2 cup teriyaki sauce
1/3 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
18 slices of bacon, cut in half (there are usually 18 pieces per package of bacon)
12 large sea scallops, sliced into thirds

Directions:
Whisk teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, and ginger in a medium sized bowl.  Line two cookie sheets with tin foil. Turn oven on to broil.
Place each scallop piece on one end of a piece of bacon and then roll it up.  Stick a toothpick in it to hold it together.
Dip and coat each bacon wrapped scallop in the teriyaki and ginger sauce.
Arrange the bacon wrapped scallops on the first tin foil-lined cookie sheet about 1/2 inch apart.
Broil about 6 inches away from heat about 6 minutes or until lightly charred.
Remove from oven and then transfer the bacon wrapped scallops to the second tin foil-lined cookie sheet pan,  flipping each one over. (This step will save you from having to drain the bacon fat and make cleanup a lot easier...just roll up the tin foil and then throw away).
Return to the broiler for another 6 minutes or until lightly charred.
Arrange on a platter and enjoy!

Description: 
Bacon wrapped scallops lightly marinated in a teriyaki, fresh grated ginger, and brown sugar sauce.  These are always a huge hit at every party I go to. They disappear fast and then I'm always asked for the recipe.  I often hear comments such as What an awesome combination!!! and These are so additive!!
