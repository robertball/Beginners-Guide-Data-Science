Ingredients:
1 cup vegetable oil
1lb cubed steak or round steak
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 egg, beaten
1 1/2 cups plus 3tbsp all purpose flour
3 cups plus 3 tbsp milk

Directions:
Heat oil in large pan. season steak with salt and pepper. Combine egg with 3 tbsp of milk. Put 1 1/2 cups of flour in shallow pan and season with salt and pepper. Dredge steak in flour. Dip steak in egg wash, dredge again in flour. Fry steaks in hot oil, until golden brown; about 3 to 5 min. Remove and drain on paper towels. Carefully pour off the oil, leaving behind 1/4 cup of oil, along with the brown bits. Over medium heat, add remaining 3 tbsp of flour and cook for 3-4 min., whisking constantly, add remaining 3 cups of milk, 1/2 at a time, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 8-10 min. whisking constantly. The gravy should thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. If it is too thick, add a little milk to thin it.
