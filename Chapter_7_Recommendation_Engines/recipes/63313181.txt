Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cups milk
Ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a bowl, lightly beat eggs. Whisk in sugar, salt and vanilla. Warm milk; slowly add to egg mixture. Pour through a strainer into a 1-1/2-qt. round baking dish. Sprinkle with nutmeg. Place baking dish in a larger pan. Fill a larger pan with hot water to 1 in. Bake at 350Â° for 55-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. (This is a very soft custard and will giggle even after chilling.) Cool to room temperature. Chill until serving. Yield: 8-10 servings.
