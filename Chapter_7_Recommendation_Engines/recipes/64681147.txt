Ingredients:
4 boneless chicken thighs and 2 breasts cut up however you like them (free range/organic veg)
5 organic celery stocks diced
1 large organic onion diced
1 bag of organic baby carrots (just throw them in as is).
2 garlic bulbs (organic bulbs are smaller) largely diced, I keep the small cloves whole
1 Tbsp Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken Base
32 ounces of chicken bone broth
32 ounces of chicken broth
1 Tbsp olive oil
Fresh ground salt and pepper
1 tsp red pepper flakes
2 -1/2 tsp herbs de provence (do not substitute)
2 bay leaves (remove before serving)

Directions:
Put (6 Qt or Larger) Instant Pot on saute and add olive oil, onion, garlic, and celery, saute for 3-5 minutes.
Add everything else, cook on soup setting, when it's done let pressure go naturally, takes about 20 minutes.  I do not add noodles to mine, however, if you wanted to add noodles, probably need to be using bigger than 6 Qt pot, but I would release pressure after about 10 minutes instead of naturally, add the noodles and stir into pot, set Instant Pot on manual for 3 minutes, quick release when done.  Yum

This is so easy, quick, and delicious.   There is no reason to ever have canned chicken soup again.
