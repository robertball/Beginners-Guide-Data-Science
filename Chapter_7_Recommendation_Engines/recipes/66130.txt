4 cups peeled, cored and chopped red tomatoes
4 cups chopped cabbage
3 cups chopped onion
2 cups chopped cucumber
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup chopped red bell pepper

2 quarts vinegar

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the green tomatoes, red tomatoes, cabbage, onion, cucumber, green pepper, and red pepper. Mix with the salt and let stand for 12 to 14 hours in a cool place, if not the refrigerator. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
Prepare 8 pint jars with lids and rings by sterilizing and keeping hot. Set aside.
In a large pot, combine the brown sugar, celery seed, cinnamon, mustard seed, ginger, garlic, cloves and vinegar. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add vegetables, and simmer for another 30 minutes.
Bring vegetables to a boil from a simmer and ladle into hot jars, leaving 1/4 inch headspace. Secure lids and rings. Process in a boiling water canner for 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate any jars that fail to seal properly.
