Ingredients:
6 eggs
3 Black Tea bags (my preference, you may use some other Chinese tea bags if you like)
1 Green onion-white part
3 slices of ginger
20 Sichuan Peppercorn
6 Anise seed
4 Bay Leaves
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce

Directions:
Wash the eggs thoroughly then place them in a pot. Add water until all the eggs are covered. Put the pot on the stove, and bring it to a boil. Then turn the stove to medium heat, and boil the eggs for about 8 minutes.
Drain the hot water, and quickly add some cold water in the pot. This will dramatically lower the temperature of the eggs, and it will prevent the shells from sticking to the eggs when you peel them.
When the eggs are totally cool, pick up two eggs with both hands and smack them together lightly--this will create cracks on the shells so the flavor of the spices will go into the eggs later.
Fill another pot with water, and bring it to a boil. Then put in all the spices. Follow by adding the salt, sugar and soy sauce. Turn the stove to low heat and keep it simmering for at least 10 minutes.
You may transfer the spice water to another container, add the eggs, and keep them soaking in the spice water for at least 4 hrs. Then you are ready to bring your Cha Ye Dan to your picnic the next day.

Description: 
Cha Ye Dan mean Tea Leaves Eggs (Eggs cooked in tea and herbs) in Chinese. Cha Ye--tea leaves, Dan--Eggs. You use tea and Chinese herbs as spices to roast the hard-boiled eggs. The eggs soak up the flavor of the tea and herbs, which makes them no longer boring.
