Ingredients:
20 (3 inch) unbaked tart shells
1/3 cup butter, softened
1 1/4 cups brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon cold water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pastry shells on a baking sheet.
Beat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth and creamy; beat in brown sugar and honey. Beat egg, lemon juice, water, vanilla, and salt into butter mixture just until combined; stir in raisins. Fill tart shells 1/2-full with butter mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and pastry is golden, about 30 minutes.
