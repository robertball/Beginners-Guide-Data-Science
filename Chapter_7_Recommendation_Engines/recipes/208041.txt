Ingredients:
2 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 pounds thick whitefish fillets, cut into large chunks
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon black cumin seeds
1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds, lightly crushed
1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds

Directions:
Bring the tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, salt, and water to a boil in a four quart saucepan; reduce heat to medium and maintain a simmer.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the fish in the oiled skillet until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to the saucepan.
Heat a separate skillet over medium heat, and toast the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, black cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and fenugreek seeds until fragrant, just a few seconds. Stir the spices into the saucepan. Simmer until the flavors integrate, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.

Description: 
A delicate Bengali fish curry. In India, the best parts of a fish are often reserved as a fillet and served grilled, broiled, or cooked alongside a fish stew or curry containing the less attractive portions of fish. The contrasting texture combination is worth trying at your dinner table.
