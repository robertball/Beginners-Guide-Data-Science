Ingredients:
1/2 box rotini pasta, cooked and drained
1/2 pkg soy ground beef crumbles
1 can crushed tomatoes
1 can tomato sauce
1 large onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 T olive oil, or less
1 tsp chopped garlic
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp dried italian seasoning
1 tsp dried parsley
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp white or black pepper
1 T sugar
1 - 1/2 c shredded mozzarella
2 string cheeses, sliced thinly

Directions:
While pasta is cooking, saute onion, pepper, and garlic over medium heat.  When veggies have softened a bit, add frozen soy crumbles and stir until thawed.
Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and seasonings (crush dried spices between fingers to release more flavor).  Taste for adjustments and tweak to taste for salt, pepper, sugar and garlic needed.  Cover and simmer 5 - 10 min, stirring occasionally.
Drain pasta and mix thoroughly with sauce.  Place half the pasta/sauce in a casserole dish, cover with half the cheeses. Add remaining pasta/sauce, and cover with remaining cheeses.  Refrigerate or bake.
When ready to bake, remove from fridge 1/2 hour in advance to allow casserole to come to room temperature. Bake at 300 degrees 30 - 40 min.  Serve with Parmesan cheese, rolls, and a green salad.
