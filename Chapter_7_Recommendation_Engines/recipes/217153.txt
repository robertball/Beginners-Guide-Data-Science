Ingredients:
5 eggs, beaten
2 cups milk
1 (8 ounce) jar chunky salsa
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) package shredded Mexican-style cheese blend
salt and black pepper to taste
1 pound ground beef
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk together the eggs, milk, salsa, bell pepper, onion, and Mexican-style cheese in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in the taco seasoning, then spread the meat mixture into the pie crust. Pour the egg mixture over the beef.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool for 10 minutes before serving warm.

Description: 
A great (and man-pleasin') breakfast or brunch main dish! Prepare the taco meat the night before and keep refrigerated; warm in microwave next morning to really speed up this dish! I especially love serving this for Football Brunch... Holds 'em over till halftime so I can watch the game too! Serve with sour cream and enjoy!
