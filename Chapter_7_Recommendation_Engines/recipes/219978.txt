Description: 
This is as close as one can get to the famous restaurant 'bar scheez; spread my mother loved, Win Schuler's®. It became a staple in our house. The horseradish gives the spread that interesting bite. You'll have people begging you for the recipe and you won't be able to stop eating it! You can start with less horseradish and increase to your taste. Serve with crackers, pita or bagel chips, or pretzels. Even great with celery sticks! Store leftovers in refrigerator in airtight container.
