Description: 
Everyone's favorite Indian take-out dish, made at home quickly and simply. Even husbands can do it! Chicken thighs can hold up to a long, slow cook time; they may shred if left in for too long but the dish will still be just as delicious. You can easily double this recipe. It freezes well.
