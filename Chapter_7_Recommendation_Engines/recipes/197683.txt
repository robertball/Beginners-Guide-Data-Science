2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 pinch sea salt

1 dash crushed red pepper
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Whisk the oil, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper together in a small bowl; add the chickpeas and toss to coat. Spread into a single layer on a baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned and slightly crispy, about 45 minutes.
