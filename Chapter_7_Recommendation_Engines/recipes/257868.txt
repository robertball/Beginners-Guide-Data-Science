Ingredients:
1/4 cup walnuts
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup quinoa
1 1/4 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon toasted walnut oil
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir walnuts until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; swirl to coat. Add shallots; saute until tender, about 1 minute. Add garlic; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add quinoa; cook and stir until toasted, about 2 minutes.
Mix vegetable stock, thyme, and salt into quinoa mixture; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed and quinoa is tender, about 12 minutes.
Mix quinoa, walnuts, chives, walnut oil, and black pepper together in a bowl.
