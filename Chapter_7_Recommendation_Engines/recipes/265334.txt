Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups yellow squash, cubed
2 1/3 cups zucchini, cubed
salt to taste
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch chopped fresh parsley
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a serving platter in the oven to warm.
Place yellow squash and zucchini in a colander in the sink, season with salt, and allow to drain.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to the warm serving platter.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet and cook yellow squash and zucchini until softened and lightly brown on all sides, 5 to 10  minutes. Add garlic and parsley and season with pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Add to spaghetti on the platter and sprinkle with 1/2 the Pecorino Romano cheese. Serve with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese.
