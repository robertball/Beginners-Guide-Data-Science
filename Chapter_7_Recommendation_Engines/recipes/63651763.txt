Ingredients:
2 cups butter salted (if using unsalted butter add 1 tsp table salt)
2 cups sugar (white or raw)
11 oz. melted chocolate
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1 cup almonds, roasted and salted

Directions:
Spread 1 cup roasted and salted almonds on a rimmed cookie sheet.
Melt butter in a large 3.5 qt. pot. Once butter is melted add sugar and heat over med-high heat, while stirring constantly, until temp reaches 340 degrees (on gas - 360). Pour over almonds on cookie sheet.
After 5 minutes, sprinkle chocolate over toffee and allow the heat from the toffee to melt the chocolate. After ~2 minutes, spread melted chocolate over entire surface. (Original recipe - melt chocolate and 5 minutes after toffee is poured over almonds spread melted chocolate over toffee). Sprinkle on 1/2 cup chopped almonds over melted chocolate. Once the toffee has set a bit but is not yet brittle (~10-15 minutes) use a pizza cutter to cut the toffee. Cool the toffee before serving. (Cooling in the refrigerator this takes about 20 minutes.)
