Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 slices bacon
1 onion, sliced
2 cups chicken broth, divided
2 cups apple cider, divided
2 apples - peeled, cored, and sliced
4 sage leaves
2 sprigs fresh thyme
4 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Season chicken thighs with salt and set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until browned on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
Place bacon into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and drain excess grease from the skillet.
Add onion to the skillet and cook over medium heat until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup apple cider. Cook until reduced by 1/2, about 10 minutes. Add cooked bacon, apples, sage, and thyme; let simmer for 2 minutes. Add remaining chicken broth and cider.
Return chicken to the pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook and stir until chicken thighs are no longer pink in the centers, about 15 minutes.
Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Remove the pan from heat and add butter, swirling to combine with sauce. Pour over chicken.
