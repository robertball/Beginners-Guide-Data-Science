Ingredients:
24 chicken drumsticks
2 tbsp granulated onion powder
2 tbsp granulated garlic powder
2 tsp cumin
1 tablespoon smoked paprika (use hot for more spice and heat)
2 tbsp salt
2 tsp black pepper
8 oz orange juice concentrate (pulp free)
1 cup good Bourbon
1 cup pure maple syrup (imitation not recommended)
2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup light brown sugar
wood chips for smoking
aluminum pan

Directions:
Soak wood chips in water for 2 hours.
Pre heat your grill to 200.
Place onion, garlic, cumin, paprika, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Add chicken and toss to coat well.
Place wood chips in the aluminum pan and set directly on the heat source of your grill.
Smoke chicken at 200 degrees for 1 hour. After 1 hour increase temp to 325 and cook until chicken reaches 160 degrees internal temp.  About 30-40 mins.
Meanwhile make the glaze by combining the remaining ingredients in a large sauce pan.  Reduce by 1/3 and sauce thickly coats the back of a spoon.
Remove chicken from the grill and turn up to 450 degrees.  Brush the chicken with the glaze and return to the grill for another 10 minutes to set the glaze and char slightly.  Be careful not to burn the chicken at this stage. Serve immediately.
You can do this in the oven and cooking time will vary depending on the cut of meat you are using.

Description: 
Perfect balance of sweetness and spice to coat wings, drumsticks or chicken breasts. Can be used for oven roasting but becomes something special on the BBQ grill!  This is also very good on a pork loin or chops as well as ham.
