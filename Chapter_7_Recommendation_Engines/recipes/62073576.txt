1 quart freezer bag (ziplock type)
1/2 cup milk (I used fat free, but try other types if you like)
1/2 tsp extract (vanilla, pineapple, etc)
1 1/2 tbls sugar (for taste)
6 tbls of salt or rock salt
Ice

Directions:
Pour milk, extract, and sugar into small freezer bag. Mix around to blend ingredients quickly and seal
Fill large freezer bag with ice and the salt.
Place sealed smaller bag into the ice bag and seal. Shake and mix and move it around for about 10 minutes or until it thickens. Let the kids devise different ways of mixing the ice cream, taking turns. This makes about 1/2 cup of ice cream.
