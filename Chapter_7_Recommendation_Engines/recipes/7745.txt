Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups butter, softened
2 cups chopped pecans
3 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup cream

Directions:
Grease and flour the bottoms of three 9 inch layer pans.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1/4 cup butter or margarine in a heavy skillet over medium heat.  Add pecans, and brown for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring frequently.
Cream 1 cup butter or margarine in large mixing bowl. Gradually add 2 cups white sugar, and cream until light and fluffy with mixer on high speed.  Blend in eggs one at a time, beating well on medium speed after each addition.  Sift together flour, baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  At low speed add sifted ingredients alternately with milk and vanilla extract, beginning and ending with dry ingredients.  Blend well after each addition.  Stir in 1 1/3 cups of the toasted pecans.  Pour batter into pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, until cake is golden brown and springs back when lightly touched in center.
To Make Frosting:  Cream 1/4 cup butter in mixing bowl.  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt, confectioners' sugar and cream. Beat until smooth and of spreading consistency.  If necessary, thin with additional cream.   Blend remaining 2/3 cup pecans into frosting.  Fill and frost the cake.
