Ingredients:
3 cups grated cauliflower
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 large egg
1/4 cup real bacon bits
1 tablespoon diced chives
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place grated cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook on high for 2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
Wring cauliflower in a clean dish towel, squeezing out as much moisture as possible. Transfer cauliflower to a large mixing bowl. Add Cheddar cheese, egg, bacon bits, chives, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix well.
Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Divide cauliflower mixture into 6 equal portions, making sure to leave space between each one. Flatten with your hands and shape into ovals.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes. Turn broiler on low and broil until crispy, about 5 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes to firm up.
