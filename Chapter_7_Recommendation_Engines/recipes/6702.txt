In a large bowl, beat together the sugars and sunflower oil.  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into the bowl while stirring occasionally.  Beat the eggs together, and gradually stir into the batter until everything is combined.  Mix in carrots, pecans, and vanilla until well combined.  Pour batter into prepared pan.
