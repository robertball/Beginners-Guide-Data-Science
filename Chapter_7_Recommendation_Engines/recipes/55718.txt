Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) onion, peeled and chopped
2 (8 ounce) red bell peppers, rinsed, stemmed, seeded, and chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and pressed or minced
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
1 teaspoon salad oil
1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn kernels, thawed
2 (16 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained (see notes)
1 (19 ounce) can red chili (enchilada) sauce
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
3 cups shredded pepper jack or plain jack cheese
1 1/2 cups crumbled cotija or feta cheese
1 (6 ounce) firm-ripe avocado
Fresh cilantro sprigs, rinsed

Directions:
In a 5- to 6-quart nonstick pan over high heat, frequently stir onion, bell peppers, garlic, and cumin seeds in 1 teaspoon oil until the onion is limp, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in corn, beans, and chopped cilantro; remove pan from heat.
Pour the chili sauce into a 12-inch rimmed pizza pan or 10-inch pie pan. Dip a tortilla in sauce to coat both sides lightly; lift tortilla out, letting excess sauce drip back into pan. Set tortilla in an oiled 10-inch cheesecake pan with removable rim at least 3 inches tall (see notes). Spread 1/7 (about 1 cup) of the vegetable filling level over tortilla. Sprinkle evenly with 1/3 cup jack cheese and 3 tablespoons cotija cheese. Repeat layers, making a total of seven; top with last tortilla. Reserve any leftover chili sauce and remaining jack and cotija cheeses. Cover pan with an oiled piece of foil, oiled side down. Set pan in a rimmed 10- by 15-inch baking pan.
Bake enchilada pie in a 350 degrees regular or 325 degrees convection oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until hot (160 degrees) in the center, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
Before serving, in a microwave-safe bowl, in a microwave oven on full power (100%), heat remaining chili sauce until hot, 20 to 30 seconds. Pit, peel, and slice avocado.
Run a knife between pie and pan rim to loosen. Remove rim, set pie on a platter, and drizzle with chili sauce. Arrange avocado slices in a ring on pie, sprinkle with remaining jack and cotija cheeses, and garnish with cilantro sprigs. Cut into wedges to serve.
