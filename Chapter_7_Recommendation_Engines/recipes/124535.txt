Description: 
HERE'S an easy, tasty dish to make for company that still allows you to spend plenty of time with your guests.    I grew up in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, and food was always the center of attention at our family get-togethers. We think brunch is the best meal of the day to gather and enjoy. -Gloria Rohlfing, York, Pennsylvania
