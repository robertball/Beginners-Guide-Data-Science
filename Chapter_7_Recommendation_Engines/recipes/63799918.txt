Description: 
This is the perfect dish on a chilly evening or a Fall afternoon.  I have been asked for this recipe over and over again, it's always a crowd pleaser!  It's a little spicy, but the sour cream and cheddar balance out the flavors perfectly.  Chicken or turkey can be used interchangeably.
