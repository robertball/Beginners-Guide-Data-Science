Ingredients:
- 6 slices white read cut into cubes
- 2 cups half and half
- 5 T butter
-3 eggs beaten
1 cup granulated sugar
-1 granny smith apple, peeled and diced
-6 oz dried apricots chopped
-4 T golden raisins
-4 T chopped walnuts
-1 oz. brandy
-1 T combined spices
(1 tsp each, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice)
-1 tsp vanilla extract
-¼ tsp salt
-1 ½ cup heavy cream
-½ cup whole milk
-2 eggs
-¾ cups brown sugar
-1 T rum extract

Directions:
For the Pudding:
Preheat oven to 350.
Place bread cubes in a bowl.  In a saucepan combine half and half and 4 T butter.   Heat until butter is melted.  Pour butter mixture over the breadcubes and let stand until all the liquid is absorbed (10 minutes).
Then add beaten eggs and remaining ingredients.
With the remaining butter, grease a 8 x8 inch pan (or pudding mold) and dust with flour.  Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
For the Ice Cream:
Scald cream and milk in a saucepan and add rum extract.
In a separate bowl, beat eggs and sugar until light.
Gradually add a cup or two of the hot milk mixture to the egg mixture and stir to combine.
Pour the egg mix into milk mix and cook on high, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
Refrigerate over night.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the instructions.  Allow the ice cream to “set” in the freezer for at least 4-6 hours before serving.
