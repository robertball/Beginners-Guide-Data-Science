Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) cans refried beans
2 envelopes taco seasoning mix (such as McCormickÂ® Original)
1 (16 ounce) container soft cream cheese
2 (7 ounce) containers prepared guacamole
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, or as needed
72 paper cupcake liners in different colors
2 fresh red chile peppers, seeded and cut into thin strips - or as needed
2 green onions, chopped

Directions:
Stir refried beans and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl. Place soft cream cheese in a separate bowl and stir until the cream cheese is workable; thoroughly mix in the prepared guacamole.
Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spread with 1/2 cup of bean mixture in a smooth, even layer; top with 1/2 cup of guacamole mix in a layer. Roll up the tortilla into a log and moisten the far edge with a little water to seal. Wrap rolled tortillas tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 1 hour to overnight.
To serve, unwrap the rolls and trim off the uneven edges of each roll; cut into 1-inch pieces. Place a piece into each cupcake paper and insert a red pepper strip into the end for a wick. Sprinkle appetizers with chopped green onion.

Description: 
I needed something to bring to my niece's 4th of July party. I wanted something portable, simple to make, and of course really tasty! I love Mexican food so this recipe in inspired from south of the border, yet created in New England. You can adjust the heat on the recipe by using a hotter or milder taco seasoning.
