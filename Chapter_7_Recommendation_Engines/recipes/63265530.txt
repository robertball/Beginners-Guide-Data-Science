Ingredients:
1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened (not melted!)
1 egg
1 egg yolk
2 tsp vanilla
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 1/8 cup flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Cream together butter, egg, extra yolk, sugars, and vanilla just until blended.  DO NOT beat much at all or you will end up with cake-like cookies.
Mix flour, baking soda, and salt.  Mix into creamed ingredients just until almost blended.  You should still see some unmixed flour in the batter.
Add chocolate chips and pecans (if using them).  Mix just until chips are mixed in.  Dough  will be very thick.
Drop 1/4 cup batter onto cookie sheets lined with parchment paper.  Bake at 350 degrees for 7 minutes; rotate cookie sheet and bake for 6 more minutes.  Cookies will not look quite done on top, but they will continue to cook after you take them out.  Tap the pan on the counter to flatten cookies a little and let cool on cookie sheet.
ENJOY!!!
