Ingredients:
1 lb boneless chicken breasts, rinsed and patted dry
1/2 cup plus 1 TBSP Parmesan, freshly grated
1/2 cup flour
3 TBSP butter, unsalted
1/4 cup dry vermouth

Directions:
Dip chicken breasts in 1/2 cup of the parmesan cheese, patting the cheese into the flesh.  Dip in flour, shaking off excess.  In non-stick skillet just large enough to hold the chicken without crowding, heat the butter until the foam begins to subside and in it, saute the chicken over moderately high heat until it is golden on each side.  Transfer the chicken to a baking dish, pour the vermouth over it, sprinkle chicken with remaining parmesan cheese.  Bake covered loosely in preheated 325 degree oven for 15 minutes.
