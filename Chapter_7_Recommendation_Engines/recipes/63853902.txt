Description: 
I got some butternut squash and cranberries (both I am not fond of) in my Bountiful Basket last week. Not having a clue what to do with them, I came up with this surprisingly yummy muffin. This recipe, I made up with what I had on hand. Really very light and tasty, not too sweet, I serve mine with honey or sweetened cream cheese.
