Baked Beans Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 lb bacon, cut in 1/2" chunks (about 6 slices)
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 medium green pepper, coarsely chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped fine
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon maple-flavored syrup. If using pure maple syrup, just use 1/2 tablespoon.
2 large (28 ounces) cans pork and beans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
In a dutch oven or oven-save crock, heat olive oil over medium-low heat.
Add bacon and render down over medium-low heat. When bacon is cooked and starting to crisp, remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon and set aside.
In remaining bacon grease, add onion, green pepper, and garlic. Before stirring the vegetables the first time, sprinkle with salt. Stir frequently until onions are translucent and just start to caramelize.
Add pork and beans, brown sugar,  maple syrup, and reserved bacon. Combine. It will appear liquidy. This is okay, it will thicken when it bakes.
Raise heat to medium and bring to a bubbling simmer.
Bake, covered, in oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Stir only once after the first 1 1/2 hours, scraping the bottom to loosen any sticking beans.
Remove from oven and stir. Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes, covered.

Description: 
These baked beans are great when you don't want to make beans from scratch but want something better than canned beans.
