Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
Mix bran cereal and buttermilk together in a bowl; let sit for 10 minutes.
Beat brown sugar, applesauce, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; stir into bran cereal mixture. Stir flour into bran cereal mixture until batter is well mixed; fold in walnuts and dried cranberries. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer muffins to a wire rack to cool.
