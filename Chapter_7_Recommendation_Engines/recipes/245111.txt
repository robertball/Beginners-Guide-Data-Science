Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, quartered lengthwise, then cut into 4-inch pieces
2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup SwansonÂ® Chicken Broth
1 cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons honey
2 tablespoons honey-vanilla almond milk
1/2 tablespoon sriracha hot chili sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly spray a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Toss carrots in a bowl with the oil to coat. Transfer to a prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Pour Swanson(R) Chicken Broth evenly over carrots; continue to cook until tender, about 10 minutes.
Mix yogurt, honey, almond milk, and sriracha sauce together in a bowl to make a thin drizzling sauce.
Transfer roasted carrots to a serving dish; drizzle with the honey-sriracha sauce.
