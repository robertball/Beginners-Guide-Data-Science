Ingredients:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup butter, room temperature
2 eggs, room temperature
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
2 teaspoons grapefruit juice
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon grapefruit juice
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Cream together the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition then stir in the milk and grapefruit juice. Mix in the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, and salt. Pour resulting batter into a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick or small knife inserted in the crown comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
While the cake is baking, prepare the icing. Place the sugar in a bowl and gradually stir in the water. Add the grapefruit juice and salt; pour over warm cake. It should form a glaze as it cools.

Description: 
This cake is good when you don't want to make something too sweet with cream and icing and stuff. The sweetness comes from just cinnamon, sugar, and a little grapefruit. Use grapefruit slices for garnish. You can use honey with grapefruit zest instead of the powdered sugar and water if you don't like sugary glazes.
