Description: 
No-carb paleo cloud rounds. Fresh out of the oven, they are fluffy and light. Storing them overnight in a plastic bag adds some elasticity to them so they become more bread-like.

The rounds will rise and fall a bit during the bake, but they don't run and flatten only slightly depending on how long you whipped the whites.
