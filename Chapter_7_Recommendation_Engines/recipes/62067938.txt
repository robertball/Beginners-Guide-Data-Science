Ingredients:
4 cube steaks
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 of medium onion
1/2 cup canola oil
2 cups water

Directions:
Coat steak with flour, set aside
Sautee onion in 1/2 cup canola oil
push onions to the side
place steaks in pan and brown on both sides
drain the oil out of the pan
cover the steaks with water and cover
cook 1.5 hrs on low heat
Moisture should evaporate and leave behind a wonderful gravy.
I recommend using an electric skillet for this recipe when doubling.
