Ingredients:
½ lb ground chuck
¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese
4 strips crisp cooked bacon
1 Tbsp Worchestershire sauce
salt and pepper to taste
48 wonton wrappers
one egg, lightly beaten
oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium skillet, crumble and brown ground beef over medium heat. Remove from heat and drain well to remove grease. Transfer to small mixing bowl and cool slightly.
Finely chop bacon. Add bacon, cheddar cheese, and Worchestershire sauce to ground beef. Add salt and pepper if desired. Mix well.
Lay one wonton wrapper on your work surface with one corner pointing toward you. Place ½ Tbsp of filling in the center of the wrapper.
With your finger or a pastry brush, apply beaten egg to the two top edges of the wrapper.
Fold the bottom corner up and over the filling, bringing the edges together to form a triangle. Press gently to seal the edges, pushing air out of the wrapper as you go. Repeat with remaining wrappers. You may choose to leave the wrappers as is, or fold wonton style.
Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Fry several wontons at a time, one minute on each side or until golden brown.
Serve with ketchup and mustard for dipping if desired.
