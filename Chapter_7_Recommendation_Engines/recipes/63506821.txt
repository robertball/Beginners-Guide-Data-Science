Place 1 square of dough into the bottom of a 8-inch square baking dish; using your fingertips, press dough to fit bottom of dish.
Crack eggs, season with salt, pepper and roasted garlic. (You could just use garlic powder)
Layer with 1/2 of your turkey, 1/2 ham, 1/2 salami, 1/2 swiss cheese, and 1/2 roasted peppers. Pour half of beaten eggs over peppers and repeat with remaining meats, cheese, and roasted peppers. And then add the sliced onion and banana peppers.
Pour all but 1 T of remaining beaten eggs over peppers.
Place remaining square of dough on top.
Brush dough with remaining egg and cover lightly with foil.
Bake 20 minutes, remove foil, and bake an additional 20 to 22 minutes, or until golden and heated through. Let cool 15 to 20 minutes then cut and serve.
