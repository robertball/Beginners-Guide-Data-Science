Ingredients:
Loaf frozen bread dough thawed to room temperature
8-10 slices deli ham
4-5 slices swiss or american cheese
1 egg white, beaten

Directions:
Spray counter lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Roll loaf into a 12x16-inch rectangle.
Cover with sprayed plastic wrap and let rest 10-15 minutes.
Remove wrap from dough.
Lay out meat and cheese in a 4-inch wide strip down center of dough.
Make cuts 1 1/2-inches apart on long sides of dough to within 1/2-inch of filling.
Begin braid by folding top & bottom strips toward filling. Then braid strips left over right, right over left twisting each strip once.
Finish by pulling last strip over and tucking under braid. Lift braid with both hands and place on large sprayed baking sheet.
Brush with egg white.
Bake at 350Â°F 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly and slice to serve.

I learned to make this about 5yrs ago & my family loves them. They are so comforting on a cold winter day with some soup & a warm drink.
