Ingredients:
4 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups matzo farfel
1 cup raisins
1 cup dried cranberries
1 cup chopped almonds (optional)
2 cups miniature marshmallows

Directions:
Layer two 2-inch pieces of waxed paper or parchment paper over a sheet of aluminum foil.
Place chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Mix in matzo farfel, raisins, cranberries, almonds, and marshmallows until fully combined.
Divide chocolate mixture into 2 logs about 2 1/2 inches wide. Fold paper and aluminum foil over the logs; smooth the top. Place logs on a baking sheet. Freeze until set, about 30 minutes. Slice into 1/2-inch pieces in the shape of pieces of biscotti.
