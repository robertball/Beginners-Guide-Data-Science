Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 large onion, diced
1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 cups water
2 teaspoons HERB-OX® Chicken Flavored Bouillon Granules
1 cup half-and-half
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
sour cream, if desired

Directions:
In large saucepan, melt butter.  Add onion and saute until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes.  Add squash, water and bouillon granules.  Cover saucepan and bring mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 20-25 minutes or until squash is fork tender. Remove mixture and let cool for 15 minutes.
Place squash mixture into food processor or blender ( in several small batches, if necessary) and process until smooth.  Return pureed squash to saucepan.  Add half-and-half, all-spice, salt and pepper.  Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until warmed through.  Ladle soup into warm bowls and serve.  If desired, place small dollops of sour cream in a circular fashion on top of soup.  Gently run a toothpick through sour cream to create a swirled effect.
