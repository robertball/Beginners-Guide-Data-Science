4 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2/3 cup water

1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 cup cream cheese frosting
1 cup dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour pan.
In a large bowl, mix together pumpkin puree, eggs, oil, water and sugar until well blended. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Stir the dry ingredients into the pumpkin mixture until just blended. Pour into the prepared pan.
Sprinkle some muffins with the dried cranberries. Bake for about 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Muffins are done when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool and pipe frosting onto muffins without cranberries.

Description: 
I love this bread. It is so moist and yummy. I didn't think that my kids would try pumpkin bread so I turned it into muffins and put some cream cheese frosting smiles and dried cranberries on top. They love them and now they ask for this bread all the time. I don't think that I will tell them it is pumpkin. ;)Modified from: Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread
