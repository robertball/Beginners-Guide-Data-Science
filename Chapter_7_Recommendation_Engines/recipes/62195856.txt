Ingredients:
1 packet of active dry yeast
1 tsp white sugar
1 cup warm water at least 110F
2 cups and 3 Tbsp all purpose flour
1 tsp salt
3 Tbsp olive oil
3 Tbsp dried Italian herbs
1 tsp granulated garlic
2 Tbsp parmesan cheese
2 Tbsp of Corn Meal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425F.
In a large bowl combine yeast, sugar, and water. Stir slightly and let rest for about 10-15 minutes. Until creamy in color and frothy.
In a separate bowl combine 2 cups of flour, salt, herbs, and garlic. Stir to evenly combine.
Add the olive oil to the yeast mixture.
Add the flour into the yeast mixture and fold carefully using a stiff spatula. Dough should release from the sides of the bowl, but still be slightly tacky to the touch. Form the dough into a ball and set on a floured surface. Cover and let set for about twenty minutes.
Uncover and roll into a circle, or whatever shape pan your using. Dough should be no thicker than 1/4 inches. Grease pan and coat lightly with corn meal.
Carefully lift the dough onto your pan and using a fork, prick the dough all over the inside to prevent bubbles from raising the crust. Brush the outer edge of the crust with olive oil and sprinkle the cheese over the crust. Bake in the preheated oven for approx. 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Top with your favorite meats, veggies, and cheese. Place back into the oven for an additional 10 minutes. Remove and let cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.
