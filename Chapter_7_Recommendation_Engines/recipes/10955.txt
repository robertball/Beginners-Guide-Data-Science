Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules, dissolved in 1 teaspoon water
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted
1 egg
1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
3 tablespoons shortening

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cinnamon, and salt.
In a large bowl, cream together 1/2 cup shortening, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in coffee mixture, melted chocolate, and egg. Stir in the flour mixture. Cover, and chill for 1 hour, or until dough is no longer sticky. Shape dough into two rolls, 7 inches long. Wrap, and chill for at least 6 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut rolls into 1/4 inch thick slices. Place on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in preheated oven. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks.
In a small heavy saucepan over low heat, melt semisweet chocolate chips and 3 tablespoons shortening, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat. Dip half of each cookie into chocolate mixture. Place on waxed paper until the chocolate is set.
