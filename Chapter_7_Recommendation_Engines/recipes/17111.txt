Ingredients:
1/2 cup pearl barley
1 1/2 cups water
2 1/4 cups canned pumpkin
8 leaves spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed

Directions:
In a medium-size pot, bring water and barley to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover and let cook 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large mixing bowl, combine pumpkin, barley, spinach, cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper.
Lay out a sheet of pastry and place 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture along the center horizontally. Roll the pastry over the mixture, and seal the seams with a little water. Cut stuffed pastry into thirds. Arrange portions on a cookie sheet.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.
