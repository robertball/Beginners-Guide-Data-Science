Ingredients:
1 (8 oz) container of Cool-Whip (light or fat free is fine)
2 (6 oz) containers of yogurt- whatever flavor you want (we like vanilla)
1/2 package of mini marshmallows
Fresh, frozen, or canned fruit that compliments your yogurt flavor (I used 1 can of mandarin oranges and 1 can of pineapple tidbits for this salad)

Directions:
Dump your yogurt into a bowl. Fold in the container of Cool Whip. Mix well. Add marshmallows and fruit. Chill and serve!
*We also love to use strawberry yogurt and add some fresh strawberries.
*If you use canned fruit, make sure you drain it VERY well or it will make your salad runny.
