Ingredients:
Per person:
- 1 can cream soda, chilled
- 3-5 tsp. Butterscotch Sundae Syrup
- 2-3 heaping tbs. Whipped Cream (use real, made of unsweetened heavy whipping cream)
- seltzer or soda water (optional)

Directions:
Pour a little cream soda in a mug and add 3-4 tsp of butterscotch sundae syrup.
Mix well, and add the remaining cream soda.
Add some seltzer or soda water if it is too sweet.
Topping:
Mix a tablespoon of butterscotch syrup in the whipped cream, until turns into a thick, runny foam, like the real beer (color will be the same as beer foam too).
For frozen Butterbeer, pour 1 can into 2-3 separate cups, freeze it for a couple of hours, than mix it in a blender for 2-3 seconds.
Enjoy!

Description: 
Cold version of the famous Butterbeer from the Harry Potter books. Tastes exactly like the Butterbeer in Universal Studios, in Orlando, FL (according to the kids).
Hogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees. (from the book)
