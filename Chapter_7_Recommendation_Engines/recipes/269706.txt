Description: 
Cut some calories the next time you make ranch by using Greek yogurt. This healthier ranch dressing version can be thrown together in 5 minutes, and, unlike bottled dressing, you know exactly what is in it. I like to add a pinch of cayenne for some kick, but I'll leave that up to you.
