Ingredients:
1 pound ricotta cheese
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
2 eggs, beaten
4 egg whites
3/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, flour, salt, vanilla, lemon zest and eggs. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg whites and sugar. Pour into the cheese mixture, and mix until well blended. Roll into balls about the size of a golf ball, and place in a glass baking dish.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown on top.
