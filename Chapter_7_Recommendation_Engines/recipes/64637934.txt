**To brown butter, add not less than an half cup of butter to small sauce pan on medium high heat. Melt butter slowly, once butter has melted it will start to foam.  Reduce heat to below medium and stir. Do not walk away from the pan. Once it starts to turn an amber colour, turn off heat and continue to stir. It will continue to brown. Once it turns a nice medium amber colour, take off the stove and cool. store any leftovers in small plastic container in the fridge for later use, which are many!
