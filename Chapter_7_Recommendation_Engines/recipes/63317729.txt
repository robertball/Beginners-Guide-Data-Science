Shrimp Fettuccine Recipe

Ingredients:
1 16 oz. box of Fettuccine (Creamette brand)
Shrimp, at least 2 pounds fresh shrimp
1 onion, chop
1 bell pepper, chop
some celery, chop
Butter or margarine
Velveeta Cheese (½ of large Velveeta block)
___________________________
3-4 cans of creamed soups
(ONE CAN OF SOUP MUST BE CREAM OF SHRIMP SOUP)
(Combining the soups, depending on how many you are serving you’ll use at least 3-4 cans)
1 can of cream of shrimp soup
1 can of cream of celery soup
1 can of cream of mushroom soup
________________________
Parmesan Cheese
Parsley, opt.  (dried or fresh chopped)

Directions:
Peel and clean the shrimp.
In a large soup pot melt some butter and sauté the onion, bell pepper and celery with the lid on until really soft but not browned.
Depending on how much you want to make, I use at least 3-4 cans of soup (undiluted) and be sure that at least one can is cream of shrimp soup.
Stir on low until all is melted and heated.
Drop in the cleaned shrimp and let it simmer on low.  Do not over cook shrimp.  Shrimp will turn pink when it is cooked.
Cut up the Velveeta into small chunks.  You’re probably going to use ½ of a large Velveeta.
When you know the shrimp is cooked, drop in the Velveeta hunks.  Simmer low to melt the cheese.   Stir gently.
Meanwhile cook the fettuccine and drain.
Add some Parmesan cheese to it, and serve.
TO SERVE: Place the cooked and drained fettuccine in a large serving bowl, top with the shrimp mixture, sprinkle some parmesan cheese and parsley on top.
