Description: 
This luscious, deeply flavored dish, originally created by a Pakistani food cart vendor in Delhi, is a cinch to make in an Instant Pot®. After an overnight marinade in yogurt and traditional spices, you can use an Instant Pot® to cook every step, from toasting spices to cooking aromatics, to adding the tomatoes and chile. You can even make a batch of basmati rice ahead. This dinner will be such a treat.
