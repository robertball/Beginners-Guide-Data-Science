Ingredients:
1/2 cup light coconut milk
2 tbsp chopped mint
2 tbsp chopped cilantro
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (6 oz each)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
Salsa:
1/2 pineapple, sliced into rings
1 large red bell pepper
1 small avocado, diced
1/3 c chopped diced red onion
1/4 c chopped scallions
2 Tbsp chopped mint
2 Tbsp chopped cilantro
juice and zest of 1 lime
1 tsp minced jalapeno pepper
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper

Directions:
1. Combine coconut milk, lime juice and zest, mint, and cilantro in a shallow dish and add chicken breasts. Marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Coat grill or pan with cooking spray, then preheat over medium high heat. Grill pineapple until marks form, 3-4 minutes per side. Remove from grill and let cool.
3. Remove chicken from marinade and scrape off excess herbs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, then grill until cooked through and grill marks form, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board to cool.
4. Chop pineapple and toss in a medium-sized bowl with remaining salsa ingredients. To serve, place a chicken breast on a plate with a scoop of salsa.
