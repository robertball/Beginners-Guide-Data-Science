Description: 
Using your air fryer oven makes whipping up a big batch of jerky as easy as 1-2-3. All it takes is a few ingredients and some patience. Make sure to cut your beef paper thin or plan on a longer drying time. I find it helpful to freeze the beef for an hour for easy slicing. Refrigerate any that is not consumed in 3 days.
