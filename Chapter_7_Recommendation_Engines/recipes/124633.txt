Description: 
I DEVISED this recipe when I needed a quick and easy casserole to take to a friend's birthday party.    I opened a bag of this and a can of that and came up with a dish my family and friends love.    Luckily, I wrote it down when I made it. I had a hunch it was going to be a success! -Debbie Jones, California, Maryland
