Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups (8¼ ounce) whole-wheat flour
½ cup toasted wheat germ
3 Tb honey
1½ tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1¾ cups buttermilk, at room temperature
3 Tb unsalted butter, melted and divided

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, honey, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in large bowl.
Combine buttermilk and 2 Tb melted butter in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until dough just comes together. Turn out dough onto lightly floured counter and knead until cohesive mass forms, about 8 turns. Pat dough into 7-inch round and transfer to prepared sheet. Using sharp serrated knife, make ¼-inch deep cross about 5 inches long on top of loaf. Bake until skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking.
Remove bread from oven and brush with remaining 1 Tb melted butter. Transfer loaf to wire rack to cool. Serve.
