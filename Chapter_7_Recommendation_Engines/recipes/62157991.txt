Directions:
Cut chicken into sized pieces for your desired preperation. In a large bowl mix together flour, pepper, salt, and water. Add chicken and 1/2 cup of oil, stir well.
In a dutch oven or fryer heat oil to 350 add chicken in small batches fry until 4-7 min. or untli golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
This recipe has many variations you can remove salt and pepper if a sauce will be used. The sauces that I have found best are Buffalo wing sauce (3 tbs. melted butter mixed with 1/4 cup hot sauce)or Barbeque sauce. It also can be used for General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Expirement with your own sauces and enjoy.
