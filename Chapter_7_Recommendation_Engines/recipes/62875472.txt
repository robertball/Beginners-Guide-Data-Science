1 1/2 pounds bay scallops, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs
1 tbs. dried minced shallots
1 tbs. dried minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (the good stuff, not the can)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pour melted butter into a 2 quart oval casserole dish. Distribute butter and scallops evenly inside the dish.
Combine the bread crumbs, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, parsley, minced garlic and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle this mixture over the scallops.

Delicious baked scallops with butter and garlic. Bay scallops are the little ones and they tend to be sweeter tasting than sea scallops.Modified from: Baked Scallops
