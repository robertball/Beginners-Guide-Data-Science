Ingredients:
1 cantaloupe melon
1/2 cup+ water
1 cup low-fat or non-fat vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tsp sugar, or to taste (if desired)
ice cubes, as needed

Directions:
1. Wash the melon.  Cut in half then scoop out the seeds and membrane with a spoon.  Cut into 1 inch thick slices then carefully remove the rind.  Cut fruit into chunks.
2. Place the fruit and water into a blender and blend until fruit has liquified.  Pour through a fine-mesh sieve/strainer and press to extract as much juice as you can.  Discard the pulp.
3. Rinse the blender of any pulp and return the melon juice, plus yogurt and cream.  Blend to combine.  Taste and add sweetener or additional water if desired.
4. Divide beverage between glasses with ice and enjoy.

Description: 
A smooth version of a creamsicle using cantaloupe melon instead of oranges.  I created this when I had a cantaloupe to use up quickly and didn't think we could eat it before it went bad.  It sounded good in my mind and ended up tasting just as good!
