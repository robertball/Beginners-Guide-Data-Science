Ingredients:
1 tube refrigerated biscuits
1 1/2 cups Jimmy Dean Sausage/Bacon/Smoked Sausage/Ham/Whatever
1 egg
1 pkg cream cheese
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped green peppers
1/4 cup chopped onion
chopped scallions
paprika
Ms.Dash or other all purp spice
thyme is good too
hot pepper if you feel like it
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Roll out or pinch biscuit dough on a lightly floured surface to form 5-inch rounds. Place each round in the prepared muffin cups, pressing into the base and sides to form a dough cup.
Cook and stir sausage/breakfast meat in a skillet over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes; drain fat. (If the meat is not broken up, place in food processor or chop into tiny bits.)
Place cream cheese in bowl and microwave for about 40 seconds to soften. Add onion, green pepper, egg, and additional cheese, chopped meat and spices to bowl and mix until well incorporated.
Pour cheese/meat mixture into each dough cup, filling each just below the top of the biscuit dough. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top of mixture. Top off with paprika for color.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese mixture is browned and biscuit dough is golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
Serve topped with scallions!
