Description: 
Got this recipe from a friend WAY back in junior high. Super simple and tastes delicious. My kids ask for it all the time. If you love enchiladas, you'll love this recipe. You can use any flavor Doritos速 to suit your tastes. When reheating leftover casserole, stir in a little bit of milk to make it creamy again.
