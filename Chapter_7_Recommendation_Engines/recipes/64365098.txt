Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/3 cup dry white wine
1 medium shallot, diced
1 Tbsp grated lemon zest (from 2 lemons)
Juice from 1 lemon, apx 2 Tbsp (reserve other lemon)
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp fresh thyme leaves
1 bunch thyme sprigs tied with a piece of butcher's twine
3-4 skinless boneless chicken breasts (apx 2lbs), cut in half
2 tsp Kosher salt, divided
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 fresh garlic cloves, thinly sliced
8 lemon slices (from reserved lemon)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Combine olive oil, white wine, shallot, lemon zest, lemon juice, oregano, thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt and pour half into a 9x12 inch baking dish.
Pat the chicken breasts dry and place them over the sauce. Cover the chicken with the remaining sauce.  Sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and pepper to taste. Place sliced garlic cloves over tuck the lemon slices and thyme bundle between the pieces of chicken.
Roast for 20 minutes, turn pieces and cook another 20-25 minutes, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Serve with pan juices poured over the chicken and roasted lemon slices.  I recommend squeezing the roasted lemon over the chicken, it's delicious.
