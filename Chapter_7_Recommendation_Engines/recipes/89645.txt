Ingredients:
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon honey
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 cup fresh blueberries
2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives
4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Pour 1/2 cup chicken stock, vinegar, orange juice, and honey into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium. Dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup of chicken stock, and stir into the simmering sauce. Cook and stir until the sauce thickens and turns clear, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the blueberries and chives, and keep warm over low heat.
Preheat grill to medium high-heat.
Brush salmon with oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve with blueberry sauce.
