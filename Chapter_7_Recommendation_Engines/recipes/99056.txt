Ingredients:
1 cup roasted, salted soy beans (soy nuts)
1 cup roasted sunflower seeds
1 cup dried cranberries
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
1 pinch salt
1 1/2 cups cold water, or as needed

Directions:
Grind soy nuts in a food processor until finely chopped; add sunflower seeds, and grind until fine.  Remove the nuts from the food processor, then grind the dried cranberries until fine.  Return nuts to the bowl of the food processor along with vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and salt.  Pulse to mix thoroughly.  With the processor running, slowly pour in the water until the mixture reaches a spreadable consistency.

Description: 
This homemade peanut-free butter is sweetened with cranberries for a great spread on cut celery, whole grain breads, and fruit. It also pairs well with soft cheese (don't add more salt though).  Feel free to try other dried fruits as well, such as blueberries, cherries, or apples.
