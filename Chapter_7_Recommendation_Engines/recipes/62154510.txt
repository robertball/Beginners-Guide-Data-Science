Ingredients:
16 oz pkg rigatoni (or other favorite pasta)
3-5 boneless chicken thighs or 2 boneless breasts
5-6 fresh cherry peppers (or 6 oz jar cherry peppers, drained and rinsed), chopped into thin rings
5-7 garlic cloves, chopped
1 large shallot, chopped
16 oz jar tomato sauce (plain or basil works best)
1/4 dry sherry
3 Tbl butter
2 Tbl olive oil
1/2 cup milk OR 1/4 cream
several leaves of fresh basil

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package directions. Keep aside.
Cut chicken into desired shapes ( strips or diced).
In a large skillet, heat oil and butter together under medium-high heat. When butter is melted, add garlic and shallot to the pan. Cook until fragrant and shallots are slightly transluscent. Stir lightly.  About 2-3 minutes.
Add chicken to the skillet. Stir occassionally to make sure it cooks evenly, about 5 minutes. Add peppers to pan. If using fresh peppers, cook about 5-7 minutes, until they soften. If using jarred, let it combine with the chicken for about 3 minutes.
Add tomato sauce and mix throughly. Allow to simmer over medium heat for about 7-10 minutes. Add sherry, simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Stir occassionally. Then add milk or cream and simmer for another 5 minutes.
Turn off heat and add torn basil leaves. Spoon over pasta and enjoy!
