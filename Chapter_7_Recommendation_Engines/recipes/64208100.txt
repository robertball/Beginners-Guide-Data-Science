1 box Chocolate Cake Mix
15 oz. Pumpkin Puree
1/2 c. mini chocolate chip
Dark Chocolate Kiss Candy

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Place chocolate cake mix in a bowl.  Add pumpkin puree and mini chips.
Mix well. Rubbing the mixture on the sides of the bowl to ensure there are no 'pockets' of dry mix.
Line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Using a small cookie scooper put 12 scoops on parchment. You will fill two sheets and can still fit a couple of extra in between each scoop, they won't spread much.
Bake for 15 minutes.
Place sheets on cooling rack and place either a kiss or nut of choice on center and gently push.  When cool, the cookie will hold the centered treat just fine.
