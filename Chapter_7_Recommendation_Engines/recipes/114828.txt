Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup chopped dates
1/2 cup chopped prunes
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup egg substitute
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine water, dates, prunes and raisins. Cook over medium heat until fruit is softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat; add margarine and stir until melted. Cool. Stir in egg substitute and vanilla; mix well.
Combine dry ingredients in a large bowl; stir in fruit mixture. Spread into an 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan that has been coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
