Ingredients:
3 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/4 cup oat bran
1/4 cup flax meal
1/4 cup canola oil
2/3 cup honey
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir together first four ingredients. Set aside.
In a small saucepan over medium low heat, combine oil and honey. Stir for 3 minutes, or until mixture starts to bubble. Lower heat slightly and continue to stir for 2 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips, vanilla extract and salt. Stir until completely blended. Pour over dry ingredients. Stir until dry mixture is thoroughly coated.
Pour mixture onto prepared baking sheet, spreading evenly. Lightly press down with spatula. Bake 30 minutes. Turn pan around and bake another 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 15 minutes. The mixture will crisp as it cools. When cool, break mixture into small chunks and store in an airtight container. *If you prefer a finer textured granola, stir mixture every 15 minutes while baking.

Description: 
This 'purely chocolate' granola can be enjoyed many ways ~ on its own as a snack, in a breakfast parfait with fruit and yogurt, or as a breakfast cereal. It's especially good sprinkled on frozen yogurt.
