Ingredients:
4 eggs
1/4 cup(canola, corn or veg.)
1/4 cup sugar
1 tsp vanilla
2 1/2 cups flour
1 Tablespoon baking powder

Directions:
Toss everything into your mixer with the dough hook on and let it mix well.  It will be a sticky dough, so don't increase flour!  Take portions and roll into 1/2 wide "snakes", wrap the end into a knot, tear off, place on cookie sheet and make more until dough is gone.  They will resemble a buttonlike knot about the size of a half dollar or smaller.  These are fun to switch out vanilla for your favorite extract(mine is anise for these!)Bake in 350 preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until JUST slightly browning.  Cool on wire rack then frost with confectioner's glaze(you can add color or extract for variety to the glaze.) Enjoy, they go fast!
