Ingredients:
6 cloves garlic, divided
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
2 (1 1/2 pound) eggplants, sliced paper-thin lengthwise
olive oil
33 1/2 ounces boxed tomato sauce (such as Hunt'sÂ®), divided
1/4 teaspoon garlic granules, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried savory, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (3.8 ounce) can black olives, drained
1/4 cup packed chopped fresh parsley
1 (16 ounce) chickpeas, drained
1 (16 ounce) can white beans, drained
1 tablespoon packed chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Put unpeeled garlic cloves in a dry skillet over medium-high heat. Toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until skins are brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat; when cool enough to handle, remove and discard peels.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Paint the eggplant slices with a light coat of olive oil. Combine eggplant and half the tomato sauce in a lasagna pan. Season with dehydrated garlic, dried savory, salt, and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer eggplant to a bowl.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine olives, 4 of the pan-roasted garlic cloves, and 1/4 cup parsley in a food processor. Blend well. Add chickpeas and white beans. Blend until smooth.
Coat the bottom of the lasagna pan with 1/4 of the remaining tomato sauce. Layer 1/4 of the cooked lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the blended beans, and 1/3 of the cooked eggplant slices. Repeat 2 more times. Finish with a layer of lasagna noodles and the remaining tomato sauce.
Chop the remaining 2 pan-roasted garlic cloves; sprinkle garlic granules and 1 tablespoon parsley on top of lasagna.
Bake in the hot oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
