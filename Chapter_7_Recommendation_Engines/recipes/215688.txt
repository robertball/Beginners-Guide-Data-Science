Ingredients:
3 zucchini, ends trimmed
4 (3 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
1/4 onion, grated
1 tomato, finely chopped (optional)
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Fill a large pot with salted water, place the zucchini into the pot, and boil over medium heat for about 5 minutes to soften. Remove the zucchini, slice in half lengthwise, and allow to cool.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Scoop out the flesh from the zucchini halves, leaving a 1/2-inch shell. Set aside the scooped out flesh in a bowl.
Place the zucchini flesh into a bowl and mash well. Mix in the tuna, onion, tomato, bread crumbs, egg, salt, and black pepper. Lightly stuff the zucchini shells with the tuna mixture. Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil over each stuffed zucchini half.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are slightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
