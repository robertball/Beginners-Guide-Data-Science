Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 ounces cream cheese
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
assorted colors of paste food coloring
24 lollipop sticks

Directions:
In a bowl cream butter, cream cheese and sugar until fluffy.  Add egg and vanilla; beat until smooth.
In a medium bowl combine flour, baking powder and salt.  Add dry ingredients to the creamed mixture.  Stir till soft dough forms.  Divide dough into fourths.  Tint each with a different food color.  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Working with half of each color, shape dough into 3/4 inch balls and for each cookie place 1 pink, 1 green, 1 blue and 1 orange ball together to make 1 large ball.  Shape into a 12 inch long roll (like a snake), starting at one end, coil roll to make a 2 3/4 inch round cookie.  Place cookies 3 inches apart on lightly greased baking sheet.  Carefully insert lollipop sticks into bottoms of cookies.
Bake cookies for 8 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool and store in an airtight container.
