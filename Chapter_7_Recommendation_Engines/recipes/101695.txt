Ingredients:
Streusel Topping:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter
Muffins:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 packets instant maple and brown sugar oatmeal
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat  oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Combine 3 tablespoons flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Use a pastry blender or two knives to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Reserve.
Combine 1 3/4 cup flour, white sugar, baking powder, salt, and the instant oatmeal in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour in the egg, milk, and oil. Stir just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. Evenly sprinkle streusel topping over muffins.
