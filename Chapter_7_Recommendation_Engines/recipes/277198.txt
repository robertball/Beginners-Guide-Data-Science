Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup white sugar
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cream butter, oil, white sugar, and confectioners' sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Stir in vanilla extract.
Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt in a separate bowl. Stir gradually into the butter mixture. Stir in pecans.
Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place onto ungreased cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, 12 to 14 minutes.
Remove from cookie sheets and cool completely on wire racks, 20 to 30 minutes.
