Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
3 tablespoons hot pepper sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
1 cup uncooked white rice
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix the sour cream, onion powder, garlic powder, dill, and parsley in a large bowl until combined; stir in the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, and hot pepper sauce. Mix in the chicken broth, a little at a time, and gently stir in the rice and cooked chicken. Scrape into a 2-quart casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is browned and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.

Empty cabinets inspire creativity :) This is so very easy to make and easy to clean up after. Plus, it's delicious! My husband asks for this at least once a week.
