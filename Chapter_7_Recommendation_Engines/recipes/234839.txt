Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into chunks
1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into chunks
1 carrot, peeled and chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 sweet onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
4 cups chicken stock, or as needed
3 small sweet bell peppers, chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir butternut squash, sweet potato, carrot, celery, onion, and garlic in hot butter until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour chicken stock and sweet bell peppers into butternut squash mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until squash and potato are tender, about 40 minutes.
Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth.
Return pureed soup to pot and season with salt and black pepper.
