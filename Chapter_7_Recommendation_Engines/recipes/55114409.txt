Description: 
This sauce came from a good friend's Italian Mother-in-law.  It is easy, and by far the best homemade sauce I know of.  Great for both Spaghetti and Lasagna.  Pssst...the secret is the sugar!  Also, as I am now vegetarian, it tastes great with out the meat!  Just substitute two tablespoons olive oil for the beef.Modified from: Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce
