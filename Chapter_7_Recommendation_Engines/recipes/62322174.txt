Ingredients:
1 (7 pound) ready-to-eat ham
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup butter
3 cups of baby carrots

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place carrots in the bottom of a foil lined pan.
Place ham on top of carrots.
Heat the brown sugar, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.
Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.
This ham can also be cooked in a slow cooker or in a cooking bag.
