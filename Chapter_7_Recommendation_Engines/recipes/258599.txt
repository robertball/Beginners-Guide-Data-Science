Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup margarine
1 orange, zested
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups dried cranberries
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.
Beat sugar, margarine, orange zest, vanilla extract, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl until blended. Stir in flour, applesauce, and cranberries until dough is well combined.
Drop dough onto baking sheets by tablespoons, 2 inches apart; flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden brown, 6 to 7 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
Very soft and chewy cookies that require little effort and don't even taste vegan, these have an outstanding bold flavor with the orange and cranberry complemented quite nicely by the fragrant vanilla.
