Ingredients:
1 cup butter (softened)
8 ounces cream cheese (softened)
1 Tbsp sour cream
2 cups flour
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup Apricot preserves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees
Blend butter, cream cheese and sour cream in a large bowl
Stir in flour, sugar and salt until well blended
Wrap dough in wax paper and chill at least 3 hours or until firm enough to roll (overnight is better)
Divide dough into thirds.  Keep dough in refrigerator while working on one portion at a time.
On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion to 12-1/2 X 10 inch rectangle.
With fluted pastry wheel, cut into 2-1/2 inch squares.
Place a dot (1/4 tsp) of preserves in center of each square. Bring up two diagonal corners to center, pinching together to seal, or secure with a toothpick.
Place on ungreased cookie sheet, bake for about 12 minutes, until firm but not brown.
Sprinkle powdered sugar on top once cooled
