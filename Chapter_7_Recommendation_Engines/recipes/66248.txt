Spread a thin layer of pesto sauce onto one side of one piece of bread. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto one side of the other piece of bread. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the pesto and mayonnaise. Layer the provolone and mozzarella cheese onto one slice, top with lettuce and tomato, and the other slice of bread.

Description: 
Just made this for myself and it was so amazing that I had to share my recipe! Use fresh smoked mozzarella and not the American version of that stiff mozzarella. Can be found in gourmet and specialty shops. I also add Provolone, but havarti, Swiss or yogurt cheese can also be used. You can make just one sandwich or use a long sourdough or French roll for a semi-large gathering.
