Ingredients:
1 egg
1 Tbsp water
¼ cup dry bread crumbs
1 small onion, grated
2 tsp Dijon mustard
½ tsp each dried thyme and salt
¼ tsp pepper
1 lb lean ground beef
½ cup shredded aged cheddar cheese
4 hamburger buns

Directions:
In large bowl, beat eggs with water; stir in bread crumbs, onion, Dijon mustard, thyme, salt and pepper. Add beef; mix just until combined.
Divide into quarters; shape into balls. With finger, make well in each ball; place one quarter of the cheese in well. Press meat over to enclose cheese. Press into four ¾ inch thick patties. (Make-ahead: Layer between waxed paper in airtight container and refrigerate for up to 24 hours or freeze for up to 1 month. Thaw in refrigerator.)
Place patties on greased grill over medium heat; close lid and grill, turning once, until digital thermometer inserted sideways into center reads 160F, 12-14 minutes. Serve on buns.
