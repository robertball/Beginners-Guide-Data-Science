Ingredients:
6 small red potatoes, halved
6 carrots, peeled and cubed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (divided)
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh rosemary leaves (divided)
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives (divided)
2 cloved of garlic, minced (divided)
1/4 cup prepared mustard
salt and pepper to taste
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin roast

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a pot with enough water to cover, boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes. Drain, cool slightly, and place in a bowl. Toss with olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon thyme, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon chives, 1 clove minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
Sprinkle pork roast with salt and pepper. In a skillet, sear roast on all sides.  Remove from heat.
Combine mustard, 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon rosemary, 1 teaspoon chives and 1 clove minced garlic. Lightly coat seared pork with mixture on all sides.
Place the pork loin in a shallow roasting pan, and cook 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Arrange the potatoes and carrots around the roast, and continue cooking 45 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove from oven, cover with foil, and let roast rest 15 minutes before slicing.
