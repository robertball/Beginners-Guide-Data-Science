Description: 
When our granddaughter Kim hosted the family Thanksgiving dinner at her home for the first time, she served a five-course meal, much to our surprise! For the first course, she ladled up steaming bowls of this rich creamy soup. It was absolutely delicious. -Thelma Reid, Guthrie, Oklahoma
