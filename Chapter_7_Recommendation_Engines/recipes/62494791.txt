Description: 
This is from Foodnetwork.com.  I had sweet potatoes that had been steamed, but we want to try it with roasting the potatoes for a more intense flavor.  I did not have onions in ours, others had mentioned adding some onion.  I did increase the sweet potatoes and broth to an even 2 cups instead of 1.5 cups from the original.
