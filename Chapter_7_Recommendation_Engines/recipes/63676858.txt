Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds baby red potatoes, cut into small bite sized pieces
1/2 regular package uncooked bacon, finely diced
1 medium onion, diced
1/4 bunch celery, diced
8 cups milk
4 cups water
4 chicken bullion cubes (use a cup of the hot potato water to dissolve, then use the cup of hot water in place of one of the above cups of water)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 cup salted butter
3/4 cup flour
1/4 bunch freshly chopped parsley or green part of green onions
1 cup whipping cream
***For garnish:***
Shredded cheese
fried bacon bits
chopped green onions

Directions:
In large pot, boil potatoes in water 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
In saut√© pan, cook bacon until crisp. Drain bacon and place on paper towel over plate to drain more.
Add onion and celery to bacon pan over medium-high heat until tender, about 5 minutes.
To the large potato pan, add milk, water, bullion, salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high heat until mixture is very hot, about 8 minutes, stirring often. Do not let mixture boil.
In small, heavy saucepan melt butter. Add flour and mix well. Cook over medium-low heat until mixture bubbles, stirring 2 to 3 minutes to make a roux.
While constantly stirring soup, add roux slowly until soup is thick and creamy, about 4 minutes.
Stir in parsley, reserved potatoes, and cream.
Garnish with cheese, bacon bits, onions or all three.
Serve hot!
