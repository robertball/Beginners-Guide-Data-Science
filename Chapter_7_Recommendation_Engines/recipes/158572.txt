1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste

Description: 
This very light, fresh dressing works equally well on mixed greens, spinach or romaine, or just drizzled over sliced, fresh, ripe summer tomatoes and fresh basil leaves.   Quick and easy to make fresh, but stores well for up to 3 months in the refrigerator. It's a family recipe brought over from the old country by my nonna (grandma.)
