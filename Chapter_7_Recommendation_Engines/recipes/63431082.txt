Easiest Apple Pie Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
Filo Dough
Apple Pie Filling (Trader Joes)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Take out your thawed Filo Dough and pull two sheets from the pile.
I do this right on the cookie sheet.  Lay the Filo Dough out and spoon a generous amount of the Apple Pie filling into it, then roll.  Continue to do this until all your filling is gone.
Spray the top of the filo dough with baking spray for a nice crisp top.
Optional - You could sprinkle with coarse sugar or after cooked, icing sugar.
