Title:
Rudy's Creamed Corn Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/822008.jpg
Ingredients:
4 lbs. frozen sweet corn
2 8 oz. blocks cream cheese, diced into 1 inch squares
1 stick (4 oz.) salted butter
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
4 TBSP sugar
1 tsp. black pepper
1/2 tsp salt

Directions:
Throw all the ingredients into a crockpot on medium or low for at least 4 hours.  If you need it done faster, cook it on the stove or on high in the crockpot, but it won't taste quite as good since it takes time for the corn to soak up all the flavors. All the cream cheese pieces should be completely melted and will easily break down and combine with the cream and butter to make the "gravy".
Do not over-salt.  There is plenty of salt in the butter and cream cheese.  Over-salting will ruin this dish.
