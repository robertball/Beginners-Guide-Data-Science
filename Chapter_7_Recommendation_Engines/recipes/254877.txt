Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray (optional)
2  sweet potatoes, sliced very thinly
2  Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced
1 large onion, sliced
1 (2 to 3 pound) roasting chicken
2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste
1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the top and bottom of a broiler pan with cooking spray.
Layer sweet potatoes, potatoes, and onion slices in the bottom of the broiler pan.
Place chicken, breast side down, on a work surface. Cut along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears from top to bottom; remove backbone. Flip chicken and splay it open. Press firmly onto breasts with your hands to break the breast-bone.
Brush olive oil over chicken. Season with salt and pepper. Place on the broiler pan top.
Roast in the preheated oven until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.
Let cool before slicing, about 10 minutes. Serve with potato and onion mixture.

Description: 
There is absolutely nothing better than a perfectly roasted chicken. Wouldn't you agree? Perfect juicy meat and crunchy skin... Thanks to my father and his visit this past weekend, I have learned a new method for roasting a hen -- spatchcocking!
