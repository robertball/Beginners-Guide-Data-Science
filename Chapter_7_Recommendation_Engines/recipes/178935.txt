Ingredients:
2 cups almond milk
2 large eggs
2 egg whites
1/3 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 red tea bags
1/2 teaspoon grated orange peel (orange part only)
Whole, natural California Almonds to garnish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Bring almond milk to a boil; steep tea 4-5 minutes or until a desired tea flavor is reached.
Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, whites, sugar and salt in a medium bowl until blended.  Very gradually whisk hot milk mixture into egg mixture and stir until sugar is dissolved. If lumps appear, strain mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl or pitcher.  Stir in orange zest.
Divide mixture between 6 ramekins or tea cups and bake in a water bath until set but still a bit jiggly when shaken, 50-60 minutes.  Let cool, then wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. Garnish with almonds and serve.
