Ingredients:
2 flour tortillas
4 eggs, cooked over easy or over medium
1/2 tomato, thickly sliced
1/2 cup salsa (preferably black bean an corn, but use your favorite)
1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoons sour cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a dry pan wam the tortillas on medium-high heat, occasionally flipping them to warm each side.
Meanwhile, add oil to a frying or saut√© pan and heat on medium. When the pan is hot, add eggs next to each other while being careful not to break the yolks as you drop them in. It is normal for the whites to run together.
As the eggs cook, sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the eggs. Be careful to concentrate most of the cheese on the whites of the egg, as too much on the yolk will break it.
When the tortillas are warm, put one on each plate, evenly divide the salsa and spoon it  onto the center of the tortillas. Place slices of tomato on top and then add 1 dollop of sour cream on top of the salsa and tomato.
When the eggs are cooked, gently slide them out of the pan on top of the other ingredients. Season with cracked pepper and salt. Serve immediately.
