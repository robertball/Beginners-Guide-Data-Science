Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup margarine, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground ginger
2 1/2 cups quick cooking oats

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together butter, margarine, white sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices; stir into the creamed mixture. Mix in oats. Cover, and chill dough for at least one hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls, and place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
By cutting back the sugars and substituting margarine for half of the butter in this recipe as well as using store-brand baking products I used the extra saving to bump up the spices in this recipe.  I was left with a perfectly spiced, soft and chewy cookie.  Add nuts or raisins for a more indulgent cookie.Modified from: Soft Oatmeal Cookies
