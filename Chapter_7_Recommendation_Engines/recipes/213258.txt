Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup butter
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup finely chopped pecans
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
4 ounces frozen strawberries
1 cup whipped cream

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine graham cracker crumbs, flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. Set aside.
Beat the butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until completely blended, then beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the pecans; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of the dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 9 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and 1 cup white sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Place the strawberries in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. Stir strawberry puree into the cream cheese mixture, then fold in the whipped cream.
Assemble sandwiches by spreading the cheesecake filling onto the bottom of a graham cracker cookie, then topping with a similar sized cookie. Repeat until all the sandwiches are assembled. Freeze for at least one hour before serving.
