Ingredients:
2 pears, peeled and sliced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup water
3 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Place the pears, wine, and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Turn heat to medium-low and simmer until pears are soft, about 5-10 minutes.  Remove pears from wine and reserve.
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to potatoes to steam dry for a minute or two.
Stir the reserved pears, evaporated milk, vanilla, brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the sweet potatoes and mash until smooth.  Transfer to a serving dish and serve hot.
