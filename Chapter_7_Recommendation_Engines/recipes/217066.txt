Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 egg
1/2 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 red bell pepper, diced (optional)
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Mix the ground turkey, egg, black beans, red bell pepper, mozzarella cheese, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until blended; form the mixture into 4 patties.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook the turkey patties in the skillet until cooked through and no longer pink the center, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a patty should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

I love these ground turkey burgers! Serve on a bun with barbeque sauce, which is how I like it, or your desired toppings.
