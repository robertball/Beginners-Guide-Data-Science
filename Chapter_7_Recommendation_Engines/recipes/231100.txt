Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds bulk pork sausage
1 pound ground beef sirloin
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1/2 cup reduced-fat ranch dressing
1 pound fingerling potatoes
1 (16 ounce) package baby carrots
1/4 cup barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix sausage and ground sirloin in a large bowl until thoroughly combined; add eggs, bread crumbs, onion, and ranch dressing; mix well. Form into a loaf and place into the center of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Arrange fingerling potatoes and baby carrots around meatloaf and cover dish with foil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour; remove foil and brush meatloaf with barbeque sauce. Bake uncovered until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Let meatloaf rest 5 to 10 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
A delicious, juicy meatloaf that uses ranch dressing for flavoring. I used my stand mixer to blend everything together, and the loaf does not fall apart when slicing!
