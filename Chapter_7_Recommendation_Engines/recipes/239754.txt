Ingredients:
3 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup shredded coconut
1 cup almonds
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup raisins, or more to taste
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup wheat germ
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup canola oil
1/2 cup honey
4 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread oats, coconut, and almonds onto a baking sheet; toast in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.
Mix toasted oats mixture with flour, raisins, brown sugar, wheat germ, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl; add eggs, canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract and mix into a sticky mixture.
Generously grease a baking sheet. Spread the mixture into the baking sheet in an even layer, reaching completely to the edges.
Bake in preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes; carefully cut into bars immediately upon removal from oven.
Let bars cool completely until hard before removing from sheet, at least 30 minutes.
