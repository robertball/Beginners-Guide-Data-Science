Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place macaroni in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
In a large bowl, toss the cooked pasta, grated eggs, olives, onion, and relish with some of the liquid. Mix in mustard and mayonnaise, increasing the amount of mayonnaise as desired. Season with salt and pepper. Top with sliced eggs, and sprinkle with paprika to serve.

Description: 
Basic and super easy macaroni salad that I make for family gatherings. I make mine with dill relish but you could change it if you prefer the sweet. Looks good and tastes even better the next day. The more you make it, the quicker you will get. Can be served right away, or make it ahead of time and keep it in the fridge.
