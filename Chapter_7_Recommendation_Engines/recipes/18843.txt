Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
2 onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 1/4 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can peeled and diced tomatoes
1/3 cup dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 eggplant
1 onion, sliced
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the ground beef, onion and garlic for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir in the tomato paste, water, tomatoes, parsley, thyme, oregano and basil. Set aside.
Slice eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds. Place a layer of eggplant into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x12-inch glass baking dish. Then place a layer of the ground beef mixture over the eggplant, followed by a layer of sliced onion. Top this with 1/2 the breadcrumbs and cheese. Then repeat the layers: eggplant, ground beef mixture, sliced onion and remaining breadcrumbs and cheese.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, remove foil and bake for 20 more minutes.
