Yuca Stew  Recipe

Ingredients:
3 pounds yuca, peeled and cut into chunks
2 ounces bacon
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon canola oil
1 large onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
10 cups water, or as needed
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon harissa spice blend (powder)
2 cups chopped watercress

Directions:
Place yuca into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft enough to mash, 25 minutes to 1 hour.
Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Drain and mash the yuca. Heat olive oil and canola oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add mashed yuca, water, salt, and harissa. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until stew is thickened, 20 to 30 minutes.
Insert an immersion blender into the stew and puree until smooth. Crumble bacon into the stew and stir in watercress. Turn off heat, cover, and let rest for a few minutes. Serve warm.

Description: 
On chilly Brazilian evenings I like to serve our small group this simple recipe. I added harissa, the Tunisian spice blend, to the stew to spice it up, but any pepper sauce will do.
