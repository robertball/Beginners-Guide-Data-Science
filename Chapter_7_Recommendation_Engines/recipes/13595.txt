Ingredients:
1 cup boiling water
1 (6 ounce) package lime flavored Jell-OÂ® mix
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained with juice reserved
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
2 cups heavy cream
1 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
In a large bowl, pour 1 cup boiling water over the gelatin mix. Stir until dissolved, then stir in 1/2 cup pineapple juice. Refrigerate until thickened but not set, about 1 hour.
Meanwhile, place crushed pineapple and remaining juice in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and cool to room temperature.
In a large bowl, blend softened cream cheese and lime gelatin until smooth. Mix in the cooled pineapple. In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form. Fold into gelatin mixture. Fold in chopped nuts. Pour into a pretty crystal bowl, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.

Description: 
This is a great recipe my mom got from my aunt. She has made it every year for Thanksgiving. It is a family tradition for us. It can be made a day or two ahead of time, if you like. It looks just beautiful in a cut crystal bowl. Thanksgiving is not the same without it for us! We just 'gobble' it up! Chopped walnuts can be substituted for chopped pecans.
