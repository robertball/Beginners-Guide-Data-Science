Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak, cut into thin strips
1 onion, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 large celery rib, thinly sliced crosswise
3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste
1 teaspoon chili oil, or to taste
6 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the sirloin strips, and cook a few minutes until the strips begin to brown, but are still a little pink. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook for 2 minutes. Add the celery and ginger, continue cooking until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Season with soy sauce and chili oil. Divide among hoagie rolls and serve.

Description: 
Gingery beef on a chewy hoagie roll, yum.  My oldest son and I love these and could easily wolf the whole batch down - little brother and dad have to fight us for 'em!
