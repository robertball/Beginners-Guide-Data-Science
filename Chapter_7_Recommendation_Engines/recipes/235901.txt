Description: 
We're going to roast a cut of beef, the tri-tip, that many have grilled during the summer. It works so perfectly for this, and it's a very nice size for a dinner party. You can let the uncooked roast age overnight in the refrigerator if you like. The meat is so tender and juicy that you simply have to give it a try.
