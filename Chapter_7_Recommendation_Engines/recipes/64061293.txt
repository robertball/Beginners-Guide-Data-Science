Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 Tbsp granulated sugar
1 Tbsp garlic powder
¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1 ½ sticks (¾ cup) unsalted butter (divided)
1 cup whole milk
1 (8 oz) package shredded mild cheddar cheese
½ teaspoon dried parsley

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Add 1 stick of butter to a small microwave safe mixing bowl.  Microwave for 30 seconds or until butter is melted.  Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, sugar, garlic and ½ tsp salt.  Whisk until well combined.  Add butter and milk and whisk just until flour is all wet, do not over mix.  Add cheese and fold in with a spoon.
Drop heaping spoonfuls onto baking sheet.  Bake for 10-12 minutes, until biscuits are golden brown.
Meanwhile melt remaining ½ stick of butter in small mixing bowl.  Microwave for 30 seconds or until butter is melted.  Add ¼ teaspoon salt and parsley.  Stir with pastry brush.
Remove biscuits from oven, brush with melted butter mixture.  Serve and enjoy!
