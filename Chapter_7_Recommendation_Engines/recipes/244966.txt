Description: 
While trying to eat healthy, I kept stuffing my face with my children's over-processed store-bought granola bars as they were around and so yummy. I came up with these as a way to save my waistline and get some 'healthy' super foods into myself and my kids....they turned out great. 
My 4-year-old son loves these.
