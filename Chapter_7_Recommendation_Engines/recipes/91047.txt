Ingredients:
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
6 pounds Butterball® Breast of Turkey, thawed if frozen
3 large sweet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch slices
2 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled, chopped
1 medium onion, sliced into rings
1/2 cup frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed
1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 teaspoon La Choy® Soy Sauce
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Add flour to large oven-cooking bag; close bag and shake gently to coat inside of bag with flour.  Place bag in 15x10-inch baking pan.  Remove gravy packet from turkey breast; refrigerate for another use or discard.  Dry turkey breast with paper towels.  Place turkey breast, potatoes, apples and onion in bag.
Mix juice concentrate, pepper, thyme and soy sauce in small bowl; pour over ingredients in bag.  Close bag with tie; cut 6 (1/2-inch-long) slits in top of bag to vent.
Bake 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours, or until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of turkey breast reaches 170 degrees F.  Let stand 5 minutes.
Cut bag open carefully.  Transfer turkey breast to cutting board; set aside.  Place sweet potatoes on serving platter; cover to keep warm.  Pour apple juice mixture from bag into 1-quart microwavable cup or bowl (there should be about 2 cups); set aside.  Mix cornstarch and water until well blended; stir into apple juice mixture.  Microwave on HIGH 2-1/2 minutes, or until thickened, stirring after each minute.
Carve turkey breast.  Serve with the sweet potatoes and sauce.
