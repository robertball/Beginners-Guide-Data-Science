Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3  skinless, boneless, chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon extra spicy seasoning blend, or to taste
2 cups frozen fire-roasted corn, peppers, and onions blend, thawed
½ cup no-salt-added black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes, divided
1 (5.6 ounce) package Knorr(<sup>&reg;</sup>) Fiesta Sides(<sup>&trade;</sup>) - Spanish <sup>&reg;</sup>ice
Salt and black pepper to taste
4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
½ cup tortilla strips, preferably chili-lime flavor

Directions:
Season chicken with seasoning blend. Heat skillet over medium-high heat and add oil. Carefully add chicken to oil; cook and stir until fully cooked and no longer pink inside, about 6 minutes.  Transfer chicken to a bowl.
Stir vegetable blend, beans and half of the tomatoes into the same skillet. Cook until coated with oil and vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Transfer mixture to the bowl with chicken.
Stir together Knorr(R) Fiesta Sides(TM) - Spanish Rice and 2 cups water in the same skillet. Bring to a boil; stir. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until rice is tender, about 7 minutes. Stir in chicken and vegetables. Cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir in remaining tomatoes and chopped cilantro. Top with chili-lime flavor tortilla strips and serve immediately.
