Ingredients:
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Place chicken breast halves into prepared baking dish. Whisk lemon juice, honey, olive oil, garlic, and oregano together in a bowl and pour the mixture over chicken breasts.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink inside, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Baste chicken with pan juices every 15 minutes while baking.
