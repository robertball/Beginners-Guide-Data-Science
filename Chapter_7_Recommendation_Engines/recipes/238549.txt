Ingredients:
3 cups cubed cooked chicken breast
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and slivered
⅔ cup mayonnaise
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
½ cup sour cream
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
2 tablespoons melted butter
⅔ cup shredded Swiss cheese
¼ cup slivered almonds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine chicken, cream of chicken soup, water chestnuts, mayonnaise, mushrooms, and sour cream in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until bubbling, about 10 minutes.
Pour chicken mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread crescent roll dough over chicken mixture, covering the whole surface and sealing the seams together; brush with butter. Sprinkle Swiss cheese over butter layer and top with almonds.
Bake in the preheated oven until crescent rolls are lightly browned and cheese is melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
