Ingredients:
For the filling:
Half a roast duck, preferably Beijing-style
8 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes
1/2 tsp. granulated sugar
6 oz. spinach, washed and trimmed
1/4 cup finely chopped water chestnuts
2 medium scallions, thinly sliced
1-1/2 Tbs. minced fresh ginger
1 Tbs. soy sauce
1 tsp. cornstarch
Freshly ground black pepper
To finish the dumplings:
kosher salt, as needed (for boiled dumplings)
vegetable oil, as needed (for pan-fried dumplings)
1 recipe ginger vinegar or scallion-Soy Dipping Sauce

Directions:
Separate the duck meat from the bones and skin; shred the meat finely by hand. Cut the stems from the mushrooms and discard. Squeeze excess moisture from the caps and chop finely. Transfer the duck and mushrooms to a medium bowl.
In a 12" skillet, bring 2 Tbs. of water and the sugar to a boil over high heat. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Squeeze the excess water from the spinach and transfer to a cutting board to cool. Chop finely.
Stir the spinach, water chestnuts, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, cornstarch, and 1/4 tsp. black pepper into the duck and mushrooms. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.
