Ingredients:
20 pounds bone-in ham
1 (20 ounce) can sliced pineapple
2 (12 fluid ounce) cans beer

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).  Grease an 18 quart roasting pan.
Place the ham, with the fattier side up, in the roaster.  Use toothpicks to secure pineapple rings on the ham.  Pour the beer over the ham.  Place lid on roasting pan.
Bake 6 to 8 hours, or until cooked through.
Remove the pineapple rings and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.

Description: 
This is a recipe we have used for the past 5 years.  The beer really tenderizes the ham.  Using beer is probably a Wisconsin thing. We seem to find many uses for it.  But don't worry, the ham will not taste like beer when it is done other than maybe a small hint on the bottom portions. I don't like beer at all, so I was quite skeptical at first, but when I found out that the ham I had at my friend's house for Christmas the year before had beer used to make it, I tried it and have been hooked ever since.
