Description: 
A drink to help soothe sick little ones. Only add honey for children over 1 year old. My daughter calls this 'Teddy Bear' juice because of our honey bear. Great for a sore throat and for people who don't enjoy hot tea. I let my daughter drink as much of this as she wants when she is ill, especially when she has no appetite.
