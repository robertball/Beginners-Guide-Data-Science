Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package baked firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided
12 ounces riced cauliflower (such as Trader Joe's®)
2 onions, chopped
3 scallions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 green bell peppers, chopped
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 red chile peppers, shredded
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Wrap tofu in a paper towel and cover with plate; rest until moisture is removed, about 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add cauliflower; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). (If using a countertop convection oven, preheat to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)). Place baking sheet inside to warm.
Remove paper towel from tofu; discard. Place tofu onto heated baking sheet using heatproof gloves.
Bake in the preheated oven, flipping once, until tofu is heated through, about 3 minutes per side in the conventional oven and 2 minutes per side in the countertop induction oven.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wok on medium heat. Add onions and scallions; cook and stir until onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic. Turn wok to high heat; stir in green peppers.
Combine water and orange liqueur in a bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon liqueur mixture into wok; toss with 2 wooden spoons until mixed. Repeat with remaining liqueur mixture; cook and stir until evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
Sprinkle soy sauce into the wok. Fold in tofu until coated.
Place cauliflower in serving bowls and top with tofu mixture. Garnish with red chile peppers; season with salt.
