Ingredients:
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
3 tablespoons hot chili oil
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound flank steak, thinly sliced (see Cook's Note)
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
1 bunch Swiss chard - rinsed, stems removed and cut into 1/2 inch slices
2 green onions, cut into thin slivers about 2 inches long
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Whisk the chicken stock and cornstarch in a freezer safe bowl until smooth; whisk in the hot chili oil, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, sherry, sugar, soy sauce, and crushed red pepper flakes. Place the beef into the sauce, stir to coat well. Cover and freeze until frozen, about 1 hour. Remove from the freezer and allow to defrost, about 30 minutes.
Heat a wok over high heat until very hot, and pour in the peanut oil. Immediately add garlic, cook and stir in the hot oil until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Mix in the Swiss chard and green onions; cook and stir the vegetables until they turn bright green, about 3 minutes, and then remove from the wok.
Pour the defrosted beef mixture into the hot wok; cook and stir until the meat browns and the sauce forms a glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Return the cooked vegetables to the wok, sprinkle with salt and pepper, mix to combine well; serve hot.

Description: 
This is a traditional Mongolian beef recipe that I have worked on for over a year to perfect. My husband and I love Chinese food, and now we make it at home -- even better than the restaurant!
