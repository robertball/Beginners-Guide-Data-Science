Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can red beets
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup cold water
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 whole cloves
1 small cinnamon stick
6 hard-cooked eggs

Directions:
Pour the beet juice into a medium-size pot. Stir in the brown sugar, vinegar, water, salt, cloves, and the cinnamon stick. Place the pot over a medium heat for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Place the beets into the liquid mixture and let it cook for an additional 2 minutes to allow the beets to heat.
Place the hard cooked eggs (with the shells removed) in a container with a tight-fitting lid.  Pour the liquid and beets into the container with the eggs. Store the container in the refrigerator for approximately 5 days before eating.

Description: 
This pickled egg recipe is one that my Dad has made for years. It takes 5 days before they are ready to eat, but they are well worth the wait!
