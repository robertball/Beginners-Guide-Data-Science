Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 onion, chopped
1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained
1 1/2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
4 cups chicken broth, plus more if needed
3 potatoes, quartered
1 large Granny Smith apple, cored and sliced
12 juniper berries
6 whole black peppercorns
2 whole cloves
1 sprig fresh parsley
1 bay leaf
4 (6 ounce) boneless pork chops, 1/2 inch thick
1 pound kielbasa sausage, cut into 3-inch pieces

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large, deep pot, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring to turn pieces occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon pieces on a paper towel-lined plate. With a paper towel, wipe the bacon grease out of the pot but keep as much of the brown bits as possible. Stir in the onion, sauerkraut, brown sugar, and chicken broth, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the potatoes and apple slices.
Place the juniper berries, peppercorns, cloves, parsley, and bay leaf into a small cheesecloth square, and tie the ends together to make a spice bag (or place the spices into a stainless steel tea ball). Place the spice bag into the pot, and add the pork chops and kielbasa sausage pieces. Add more chicken broth, if needed, to just cover the ingredients. Bring the pot to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, about 1 hour.
To serve, use a slotted spoon to remove the sauerkraut, potatoes, and apple slices to the center of a serving platter. Arrange bacon, pork chops, and kielbasa pieces around the outside of the platter.

Description: 
This is a French recipe, very easy and a real comfort food. An all in one pot meal! I have gotten people who say they don't like sauerkraut to try this dish. They couldn't believe how good it is and asked for more.
