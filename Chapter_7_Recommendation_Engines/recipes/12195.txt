Ingredients:
2 pounds spinach, washed and chopped
1  onion, chopped
½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons dried basil
2  eggs
1 cup feta cheese
¾ cup butter, melted
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough

Directions:
Steam the spinach until just wilted.
In a medium skillet heat the oil until hot and saute the onions and mushrooms. Stir together with the spinach.
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs well.  Stir in the ricotta, feta, and basil.
Butter a deep dish pie pan.  Place a sheet of phyllo on the bottom of the pan, and brush melted butter over the sheet.  Repeat until there are 5 or 6 sheets in the pan.  Spread the ricotta mixture over the phyllo.  Layer 5 or 6 more sheets of filo brushed with butter on top of the cheese.  Spread spinach mixture over the phyllo. Top the pie with 5 or 6 more sheets of phyllo brushed with butter.  Trim dough to the edge of the pie dish.
Bake at 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour, or until pie is golden brown.
