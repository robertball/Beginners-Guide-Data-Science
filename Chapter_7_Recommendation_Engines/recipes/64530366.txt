Description: 
I am so excited to share this recipe with you. I´ve tried making vegetarian bolognese many times, but never really succeeded. This time it turned out really great and it´s now one of my family´s favorite meals. This rich and hearty vegetarian bolognese makes a fantastic family meal. Lentils are not usually my daughters favorite food but this bolognese however has been a huge success.

Another plus about this recipe: it will be good the first day, but even better the second day. So make a big batch and enjoy this bolognese over a couple of days.
