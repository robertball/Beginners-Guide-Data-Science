Ingredients:
For the vegetables:
3 cups peeled, cubed butternut squash, about 1 1/2 lbs
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces, about 3/4 cup
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 small sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch pieces, about 1 cup
1 small red onion, cut into 1" wedges
3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided use
2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
For the chicken:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1/4 teaspoon salt
fresh ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock
1/4 cup white wine
1/8 cup whole-grain mustard
1/8 cup honey

Directions:
Place a baking sheet, 11" x 17" into the oven and pre-heat to 425 degrees.
In a large bowl, combine all the prepared vegetables with 2 Tablespoons olive oil, minced rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, stirring to coat all the vegetables with oil and seasonings.
Place vegetables on the pre-heated baking sheet in a single layer, and roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring half-way through the cooking time.
Once the vegetables are in the oven, pound the chicken to 1/2 inch thickness (I used a cast iron skillet to do this), and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste.
In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1 Tablespoon olive oil over medium heat.
Add prepared chicken breasts and cook 5 minutes on each side, or until done.
Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.
To the same skillet, add wine and stock, stirring up any browned bits, and boil 2 minutes.
Stir in mustard and honey, then add chicken back to the pan and turn pieces to coat.
Serve chicken with roasted vegetables.
