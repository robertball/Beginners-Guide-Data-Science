Description: 
I threw this salad together with ingredients I had in my kitchen one evening. This light and tasty alternative to a regular salad will accompany Mexican dishes perfectly. This also works well served as a dip with tortilla chips and tastes even better a day after making it. Serve as a side dish or as a dip with chips and salsa.
