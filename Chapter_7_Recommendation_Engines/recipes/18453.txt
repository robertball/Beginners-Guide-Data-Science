Ingredients:
3 cups dry black beans
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon milk
1 pinch cayenne pepper

Directions:
Place black beans in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 1 hour, or until tender.
In an electric blender or food processor, process black beans until smooth. Stir in cumin, chili powder, salt, and cilantro; blend. Roll the mixture into balls, allowing 3 tablespoons of mixture per ball.
Place balls between sheets of wax paper and press down on the wax paper to form 1/8 inch thick rounds.
Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet. Fry the cakes 2 or 3 minutes per side.
In a bowl, combine yogurt, milk, and cayenne pepper (to taste). Serve the sauce over the hot black bean cakes.
