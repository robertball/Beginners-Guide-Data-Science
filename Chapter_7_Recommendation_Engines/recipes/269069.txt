Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried red hibiscus flowers
1/4 cup dried white hibiscus flowers
1 cup superfine white sugar

Directions:
Mix red and white hibiscus flowers together, breaking them into slightly smaller pieces.
Place 3/4 cup flowers and sugar in a mini food processor. Pulse until flowers are pulverized. Use the pulse method to ensure the sugar doesn't heat up and melt.
Place remaining 1/4 cup flowers in an airtight container. Cover with sugar mixture. Let infuse for at least 3 days before using.
