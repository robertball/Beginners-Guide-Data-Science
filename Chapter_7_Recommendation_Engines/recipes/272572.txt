Ingredients:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 Thai chile pepper, or more to taste
2 cloves garlic, minced
3 Chinese eggplants, cut into 1-inch cubes, or more to taste
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt to taste
1 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped

Directions:
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add chile and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is golden, about 1 minute. Add eggplants to the fragrant garlic oil. Stir in water and cover. Cook, stirring every few minutes, until eggplants soften, 5 to 8 minutes.
Uncover and stir in soy sauce, sugar, and salt. Stir well and continue cooking until all the water has evaporated and eggplant is coated with sauce, about 5 minutes. Add basil leaves and stir once; remove from heat.

Description: 
Basil is my favorite herb and maybe a reason I love Thai food so much. The soups, curries, and stir-fries taste amazingly different with just few handfuls of sweet basil. This recipe is super easy and cooks in very little time. Serve with freshly cooked jasmine or basmati rice.
