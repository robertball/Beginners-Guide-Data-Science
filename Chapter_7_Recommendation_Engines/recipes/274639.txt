Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta
1/4 teaspoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon chile oil
1 shallot, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 pound fresh sugar snap peas
1/2 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup white table wine
1/4 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon paprika
12 uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 teaspoon salted butter
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 2 tablespoons cooking water and drain pasta. Set aside.
Heat olive oil and chile oil over medium heat in a deep, large pan. Cook shallot and garlic in the hot oil until softened and aromatic, 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar snap peas and bell pepper; continue cooking until peas start to soften, about 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl.
Pour wine into the pan and cook until reduced slightly, 5 to 7 minutes. Combine reserved pasta water and cornstarch in a bowl until starch has dissolved and stir into wine with paprika. Return vegetables to the pan and add shrimp. Cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
Remove from heat. Stir in pasta, butter, lemon juice, and basil until everything is coated and butter has melted. Serve.
