Ingredients:
1 cup white sugar, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 egg
2 cups milk
4 (1 ounce) squares semisweet dark chocolate (such as Baker'sÂ®)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Mix 1/2 cup sugar and flour together in a small bowl.
Mix remaining sugar and egg in another bowl. Add to flour mixture and mix together.
Heat milk in a heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until warm, about 5 minutes; do not let boil. Stir sugar mixture into milk and cook over medium-high heat until it starts to bubble, about 5 minutes, stirring quickly the entire time to ensure it doesn't burn. Let bubble for at least 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate and vanilla extract until smooth.
Pour pudding into serving bowls, cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours, to overnight.

Description: 
This dark chocolate pudding recipe has been in my family for 5-plus generations. I love the fact that I can make something similar to what my great-grandma made in her kitchen over 100 years ago. This pudding is the perfect creamy chocolate blend!
