Ingredients:
4 chicken cutlets, thinly pounded
6 slices very thin prosciutto
4 large sage leaves (or 8 small)
1/2 box frozen spinach or kale, thawed and squeezed with a paper towel to dry
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon flour
1 (12-ounce) can chicken broth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons white wine
Salt and freshly ground pepper
Grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place cleaned and thinly pounded chicken cutlets on a work surface. Season with salt and pepper. Put 1 piece of prosciutto on each cutlet. Add some of the spinach on the next layer, top with a sage leaf, and sprinkle with a little parmesan cheese.
Roll up each cutlet and secure with a toothpick (tuck the sides in, then roll—that will help form a seal).
Heat your skillet to medium heat and add olive oil and butter to coat the pan. Add the chicken and cook until golden brown (2 minutes on each side). Add the flour to the pan and whisk with the butter and scrapings. Add the chicken broth and lemon juice, bring to a boil, then add the wine and whisk until the sauce begins to thicken (under 1 minute). Let simmer for 5 minutes.
Spoon the sauce over the chicken when serving. Don’t forget to remove the toothpicks.
