Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1 pound ground beef
1 pound bulk sweet Italian sausage
1 (16 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
2 large jars tomato sauce, your preference
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook 8 to 10 minutes, drain.
Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain.
Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce.  Simmer 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta, eggs, and Parmesan in a bowl.
Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer.
Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles.
Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese.
Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.
Bake in preheated oven covered with foil for 60 minutes.  Remove foil and cook an additional 30 minutes.
