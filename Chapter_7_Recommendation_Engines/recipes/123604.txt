Ingredients:
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 eggs
4 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING:
1 cup chopped dates
2/3 cup water
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup apricot preserves
ICING:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons boiling water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, let yeast and water stand for 5 minutes.  Add sugar, milk, oil, salt, eggs and 2 cups flour; beat on low 3 minutes.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl; turn once to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Combine first five filling ingredients in a saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened, 7-8 minutes.  Stir in preserves; let cool.
Punch dough down; divide into thirds.  On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 15-in. x 6-in. rectangle.  Place on greased baking sheets.  Spread a third of filling down the center third of rectangles.  On each long side, cut 1-1/2-in. wide strips 1-3/4 in into center.  Starting at one end, fold alternating strips at an angle across filling.  Cover and let rise for 30 minutes or until doubled.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until browned.  Cool on wire racks.  Combine icing ingredients; drizzle over braids.
