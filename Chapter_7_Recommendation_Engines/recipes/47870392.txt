Ingredients:
4 cups whipping cream
1/2 cup sugar
8 egg yolks
1 tbsp. vanilla
1/3 cup sugar

Directions:
Combine cream and 1/2 cup sugar in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat.  Whisk together egg yolks and vanilla until well blended.  Gradually whisk in hot cream mixture until blended.  Do not over mix.  Pour mixture through a fine sieve into a bowl.  Divide mixture among 8 – 3/4 cup heatproof ramekins.  Line a roasting pan with a clean tea towel.  Place ramekins on tea towel.  Pour enough hot water into roasting pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.  Bake at 300 F for 60-65 minutes or until a knife inserted in centre of custards comes out clean.  Remove ramekins from roasting pan.  Place on a rack and let cool.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.  Remove ramekins from refrigerator.  Sprinkle about 2 tsp. sugar evenly over each custard.  Place on heatproof surface.  Using a small blowtorch, caramelize sugar.  Stop torching just before desired degree of doneness is reached, as sugar will continue to cook after flame has been removed.  Refrigerate custards, uncovered, for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours.  Serve with fruit if desired.
