Description: 
I have had this recipe for about 40 years, and in that time I've made a few changes. These cookies are my husband's favorite, so I bake them for him almost every week.    One of my daughter's friends still remembers having these special treats when she stopped in on her way home from school. -Dollie Ainley, Doniphan, Missouri
