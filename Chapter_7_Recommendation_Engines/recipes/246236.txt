Ingredients:
9 graham cracker squares
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 cups miniature marshmallows
1 1/2 cups chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang on sides.
Crumble graham crackers in a bag; pour into a bowl. Stir in butter and brown sugar until well mixed. Press graham cracker mixture into bottom of pan to form crust.
Bake in preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and smells toasted, about 7 minutes.
Remove pan from oven; cover crust evenly with marshmallows. Sprinkle chocolate chips over marshmallows.
Bake in preheated oven until chocolate chips are melted and marshmallows are browned, about 3 minutes.
Let s'mores rest in pan until cool, about 30 minutes. Refrigerate until set, about 45 minutes. Remove from pan and cut into squares.
