Ingredients:
2 cups whole-milk plain Greek yogurt
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup, or to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple extract (optional)
1 pinch salt
1 cup pumpkin puree
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1 cup maple nut granola

Directions:
Whisk together Greek yogurt, maple syrup, vanilla extract, maple extract, and salt until thoroughly combined. Place 1/2 cup of the maple-yogurt mixture in a separate bowl and set the rest aside.
Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice to the 1/2 cup yogurt mixture; whisk until thoroughly combined.
Place a small amount of the maple-yogurt mixture in the bottom of 4 small jars or containers. Top with a portion of pumpkin mixture, followed by a layer of maple granola. Continue alternating layers of maple-yogurt mixture, pumpkin mixture, and granola. Serve immediately or cover and keep refrigerated until ready to serve.
