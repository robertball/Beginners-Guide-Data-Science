Description: 
This French dish uses loads of Mediterranean vegetables and is a perfect way to use up the zucchini flooding your garden! We like to add chicken to ours to make it a whole meal, and we usually serve it over rice. We usually do half a breast per person. This is our family's version, so it doesn't have the eggplant or the fresh tomatoes that you see in most traditional ratatouille recipes (maybe when the kids grow up a little?), but this recipe did get the kids to start eating zucchini and mushrooms, which we never thought would happen!
