Ingredients:
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1/4 cup diced onions
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds lean ground beef
1 cup crushed hot and spicy cheese flavored crackers
Topping:
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup chunky salsa

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the eggs, tomatoes, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.  Gently stir the ground beef and crackers into the egg mixture.  Press into a 8x8 inch square baking pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes.
Remove the loaf from the oven, and drain any liquid from the pan.  Spread a layer of salsa on top of the loaf, and sprinkle with shredded cheese.  Return the loaf to the oven; bake until the meatloaf reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) and is no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
I made this for my wife she is an avid Mexican restaurant visitor. The amount of spice you want in this recipe depends on the RO*TEL® and the salsa. I recommend if you do not like it hot get the mild RO*TEL® and a medium salsa.
