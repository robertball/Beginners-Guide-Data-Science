1 (16 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup uncooked quinoa
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 Lg. onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs

1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
If grilling, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil a sheet of aluminum foil. If baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and lightly oil a baking sheet. Or you could fry in oil on top of stove on medium heat.
Bring quinoa and water to a boil reduce heat to med-low, cover and simmer for 15-20 min or until quinoa is tender and water has absorbed.
In a medium bowl, mash black beans with a fork until thick and pasty.

In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, chili powder, cumin.
Stir egg mixture, vegetables and quinoa into the mashed beans. Mix in bread crumbs until the mixture is sticky and holds together.
Make about 6 patties.
If grilling, place patties on foil, and grill about 8 minutes on each side. If baking, place patties on baking sheet, and bake about 10 minutes on each side.
When frying, fry on each side until golden brown.
