Ingredients:
1 Tbsp. Instant Yeast
1 1/2 c. scalded milk, cooled to lukewarm
1 tsp. salt
3 eggs beaten
1/2 c. sugar
1/2 c. melted butter
5 c. flour

Directions:
Combine 1/2 of flour with rest of dry ingredients and yeast.  Mix eggs and butter and milk, add to dry ingredients, beat till smooth, add remaining flour till dough is smooth.  Dough will be sticky.  Place in greased 32 cup bowl, (Tupperware's Fix N Mix or Thatsa Bowl are perfect) seal and store in refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, divide dough in 2 pieces, roll each in circles, about 1/2" thick.  Cut in triagles, about 8 in each circle, roll from wide end to point.  Place on greased baking sheet point down, about 2" apart.  Let rise in warm place till about doubled. Heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake for 15 minutes or till golden brown.  Do not over bake!  When rolls come easily off sheet and are lightly golden brown on the bottom, they should be done.
Remove from oven, brush butter on top while still hot.

Description: 
Another one of my Mom's best recipes, these have been a family favorite for years, everyone who tastes them raves over them.  They are soft, buttery and oh so good, especially served warm with butter...jelly is optional! :)
