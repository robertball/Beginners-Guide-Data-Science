Ingredients:
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup plain, unsweetened yogurt; homemade adds some nice tang!
5 cloves garlic; minced
1 tbs tomato paste
1 tsp salt
2 tsp oregano
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cardamom
6 breasts chicken; cut into bite-sized cubes
2 yellow onions; diced
2 green onions; diced
2 tomatoes; diced

Directions:
Mix together the lemon juice, canola oil, plain yogurt, garlic, tomato paste, salt, oregano, pepper, cinnamon, and cardamom in a large bowl.
Cut the chicken and place in a large ziplock bag. Pour marinade into bag and swish around to coat the chicken. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.
Preheat a large frying pan (paella-sized) over medium-high heat, lightly oil the pan and saute the onions for about 2 - 3 minutes. Add the chicken and marinade mixture - take care as this may splatter.
Cook until the chicken is just about done. Add the diced tomatoes and green onions for the last minute or two of cooking.
Serve hot over couscous or rice and enjoy!

A little different take on this Middle Eastern dish. I make it almost like a curry dish.
