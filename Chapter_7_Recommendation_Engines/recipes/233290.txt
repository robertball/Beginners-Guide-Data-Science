Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 large onion, diced
1/2 pound shaved rib-eye, chopped
8 hot dogs
8 hot dog buns
1 (8 ounce) jar processed cheese spread (such as Cheese WhizÂ®)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a bowl. Cook and stir rib-eye in the same skillet until meat is no longer red and liquid is evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir onion into cooked rib-eye.
Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook hot dogs in the boiling water until cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Place each cooked hot dog into a bun. Spoon rib-eye mixture over hot dog; top with cheese spread.

Description: 
Hot dogs topped with a Philly cheese steak; what could be better? Perfect for your 4th of July cookout! I prefer using the club rolls because they are sturdier.
