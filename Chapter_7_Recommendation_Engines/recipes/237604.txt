Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 pound bay scallops
1 (1 pound) package bacon
1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed Cheddar cheese soup
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/4 cups milk
1 teaspoon garlic salt
2/3 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute scallops until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; roughly crumble.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
Mix Cheddar cheese soup, Cheddar cheese, milk, and garlic salt together in a bowl. Add scallops, bacon, and pasta; mix well. Pour pasta mixture into a 2 1/2-quart baking dish.
Stir bread crumbs and butter together in a bowl; sprinkle over pasta mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and topping is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes; season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
This is something I threw together and it turned out fantastic! The flavor of the bacon, along with the scallops, mixes so well with mac and cheese. A perfect combo! Add vegetables for a healthier kick. I like throwing in some steamed broccoli or cauliflower.
