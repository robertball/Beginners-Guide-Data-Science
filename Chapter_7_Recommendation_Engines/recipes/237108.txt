Ingredients:
28 ounces ricotta cheese
3 eggs
8 matzah sheets, or more as needed
3 (32 ounce) jars marinara sauce (such as ClassicoÂ® Tomato and Basil)
2 (16 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat ricotta cheese and eggs together in a bowl.
Briefly pass each matzah sheet under warm running water; layer moistened sheets on a plate.
Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a deep 11x15-inch baking dish; top with a layer of moistened matzah sheets, breaking pieces as needed to completely cover marinara. Spread a layer of ricotta mixture over matzah mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over ricotta mixture layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of matzah, marinara, and mozzarella cheese, respectively.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a 'dairy' main meal for Passover that re-heats well. Even the pickiest eaters love this recipe. Vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini, and peppers may be added; steam them al dente first and add to layers. Italian cheese blend can be used in place of mozzarella if desired.
