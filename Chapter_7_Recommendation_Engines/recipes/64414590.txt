Ingredients:
1 cup frozen mixed fruit
1 cup soy milk, vanilla
2 tablespoons dried, organic goji berries
1 teaspoon honey

Directions:
Place all ingredients in a blender, and blend very well.  You will want to blend a bit longer than a normal smoothie to ensure the goji berries are liquified.

Description: 
I was trying to find a way to eat goji berries, which I found to be pretty bland on their own.  This smoothie recipe worked well, and has the benefit of this nutrient-rich superfood.
