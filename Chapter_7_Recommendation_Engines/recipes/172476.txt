Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
5 cloves garlic, chopped
3 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick across bones)

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce and sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved, and stir in the black pepper, garlic, green onions, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.
Place the ribs in a large bowl, and pour the marinade over the ribs. Stir to coat the ribs with the marinade, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Stir the ribs and marinade again, and refrigerate for 1 more hour.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Remove the ribs from the marinade, discard the marinade, and grill the ribs until brown and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Have a spray bottle of water handy in case the ribs flare up.
