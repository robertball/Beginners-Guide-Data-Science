Ingredients:
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
1 cup shredded zucchini (with peel)
1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 6 oz can salmon, drained and flaked
1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp freshly ground pepper
non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
1.  Coat a non-stick pan with the cooking spray.  Sautee the onions until translucent, then remove from heat.
2.  In a medium size bowl, combine the salmon, eggs, zucchini, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Stir in the onions.
3. Form into 6 patties and coat with the remaining 1/2 cup bread crumbs.
4. Coat the pan with the cooking spray, then fry each cake on medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes per side (or until golden brown).  Prior to flipping, moisten the top of the cake with the cooking spray to avoid sticking and promote even browning.
5. Serve hot and enjoy!

Description: 
An updated, healthful version of the classic salmon cake.  Serve over field greens as an appetizer or main course.  To cut out even more fat, use 3 egg whites in place of the whole eggs; for a richer version, fry in oil instead of non-stick spray.
