Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
3 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese with peppermint extract.  Beat in half the confectioners' sugar until smooth.  Knead in remaining confectioners' sugar until fully incorporated.  Shape dough into 1/2 inch balls, place on baking sheets, flatten with a fork, and allow to stand 1 hour to harden.  Store in airtight containers in refrigerator.

Description: 
These are rich, simple mints often seen at wedding receptions, baby showers, and graduation parties, and they make a perfect last-minute addition to holiday candy trays.  Try substituting almond extract for the peppermint.  You can roll them in colored sugar before flattening them, if desired.
