Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quick-cooking oats
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees)
1 tablespoon sugar
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar

Directions:
BRING 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan; stir in oats and butter. Boil, stirring constantly, 1 minute. Remove from heat; let cool to 110 degrees.
STIR together yeast, 1/2 cup warm water, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a 2-cup measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes.
BEAT oat mixture, yeast mixture, flour, salt, and brown sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth.
TURN dough out onto a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic (about 5 minutes). Place in a well-greased bowl, turning to grease top.
COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1 hour or until dough is doubled in bulk.
PUNCH dough down, and divide in half; shape each portion into 16 (1 1/2-inch) balls. Place evenly into 2 lightly greased 9- x 1 3/4-inch round cake pans.
COVER and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 30 minutes or until doubled in bulk.
BAKE at 375 degrees for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
