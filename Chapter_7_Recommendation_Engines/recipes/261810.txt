Ingredients:
1/4 cup orange juice
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger tequila
2 teaspoons grated orange zest
1 1/2 pounds fresh cranberries
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Bring orange juice, tequila, and orange zest to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add cranberries, sugar, and salt; simmer until a jam-like sauce forms, about 25 minutes.
Blend sauce with an immersion blender for a smoother consistency. Let cool; sauce will continue to thicken naturally.
