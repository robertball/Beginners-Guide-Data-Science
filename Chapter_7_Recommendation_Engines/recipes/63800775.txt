Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
4 cloves garlic, sliced
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
24 littleneck clams
20 ounces Scialatielli (recipe follows)
8 ounces arugula, tough stems removed
1/4 cup fresh basil chiffonade
1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
For scialatielli
3 cups "00" flour, plus more as needed
1/2 cup semolina flour
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, preferably medium grind
1 tablespoon very finely chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon very finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 cup whole milk, plus more as needed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. In a large sauté pan, heat the ¼ cup olive over medium-low heat.
Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the clams and 1 cup water. Cover, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams have opened.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta until not quite tender, about 3 minutes. Reserve some of the pasta cooking water and gently drain the pasta. Add the pasta to the sauté pan with the clams and toss gently.
Finish cooking the pasta in the sauté pan, adding a little pasta water if needed. When the pasta is al dente, add the arugula, basil, and parsley, and cook, tossing gently, until the arugula has wilted.
Drizzle with a little olive oil if the pasta looks dry.
