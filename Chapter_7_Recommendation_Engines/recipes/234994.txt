Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/4 cups chopped pecans, divided
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
Cream Cheese Layer:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool WhipÂ®), divided
Pumpkin Layer:
1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 (3 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
1 3/4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Stir 1 cup pecans, flour, butter, white sugar, and 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar together until crumbly. Press pecan mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bake pecan crust in the preheated oven until golden, 20 minutes. Cool completely.
Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Fold 1 1/2 cups whipped topping into cream cheese mixture. Spread cream cheese mixture over cooled pecan crust.
Beat pumpkin, milk, brown sugar, vanilla pudding mix, and pumpkin pie spice together in a bowl with an electric mixer until mixture thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently fold in 4 ounces whipped topping. Spread pumpkin mixture in a layer over the cream cheese mixture.
Spread remaining whipped topping over the pumpkin mixture layer. Sprinkle cinnamon and remaining 1/4 cup pecans over the top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.

Description: 
If you have had lemon lush or chocolate dream dessert, this is the pumpkin alternative. It is a great recipe to use as an alternative to pumpkin pie. It feels less filling when you are filled with Thanksgiving turkey and sides!
