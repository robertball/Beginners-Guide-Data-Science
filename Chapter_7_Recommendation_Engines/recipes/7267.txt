Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ricotta cheese
16 ounces cream cheese
1 cup white sugar
6 eggs
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C.) Wrap the outside bottom of a 10 inch springform pan with foil to prevent water seeping in while baking.
Cream together ricotta cheese, cream cheese and sugar until smooth.  Mix in the eggs one at a time.  Add flour one tablespoon at a time, mixing well. Stir in the sour cream and vanilla. Pour mixture into a 10 inch springform pan.
Place cheesecake in a large rectangular pan filled with 2 inches of hot water. Carefully put into preheated oven without spilling water. Bake for 90 minutes.
After 90 minutes turn oven off, but leave the cake in the oven for another 60 minutes (do not open door).
Cool on counter for 60 minutes and then refrigerate. Serve when thoroughly chilled.
