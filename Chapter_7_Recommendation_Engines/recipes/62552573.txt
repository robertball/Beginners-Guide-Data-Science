Ingredients:
1 - 1 oz square unsweetened chocolate
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 t vanilla
2 eggs
1 cup sifted flour
1/2 cup chocolate malted milk powder (Ovaltine)
1/2 t baking powder
1/2 t salt
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional, of course)

Directions:
Melt the chocolate. (If you use the 3T cocoa powder and 1T butter in place of the solid chocolate, I recommend using some of the butter from the recipe to melt with it to get it smoother for mixing). Cool.  Cream the butter, sugar and vanilla until fluffy.  Beat in the eggs.  Blend in the melted chocolate.  Sift the dry ingredients and stir into the creamed mixture.  Fold in the nuts. Spread in greased 8x8x2 pan.  Bake at 350 degree oven for 20-25 minutes.  Cool.  Frost with malt frosting.
Frosting:
Cream 2T butter with 1/4 cup chocolate malt powder and a dash of salt. Slowly beat in 1 cup sifted confectioner's sugar and enough milk to make a spreading consistency (about 1 1/2T).
