Ingredients:
4 10oz tuna steaks
Marinade
3 Tbsp cup Pimenta Moida (portugues hot chopped peppers)  http://famousfoods.com/anhotchpe16o.html
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp garlic powder
2 Tbsp Hot Paprika
Sauce
1/4 cup Pimenta Moida
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup water
2 Tbsp hot paprika
1/2 tsp salt
1/3 tsp pepper
1 Tbsp garlic powder
2 Tbsp Hot Paprika
For frying
1 stick butter
1 cup olive oil

Directions:
You need a big heavy seasoned cast iron pan to make this.
Mix up marinade ingredients, sprinkle marinade on both sides of fish and place in large ziplock with remainder of of marinade for at least 90 min but no longer than 3 hrs or so.  Discard marinade after.
Fry fish in mixture of butter of olive oil.  Fish cooks at just about  2 1/2 minutes per side at 1/2 inch steaks in super hot fat.
Remove tuna steaks from pan and place on rack or paper towel to drain.
Mix sauce ingredients and add those to pan with fish scrapings.  Cook under medium heat until it reduces just a but, and thickens up.   This should happen before the fish cools off.
Plate the fish with some rice or potatoes (both if you are portugues) and portion some of the sauce out onto the fish.  Remaining sauce should be served on the table as gravy.
Serve with nice crusty bread.

Description: 
Family Recipe, a staple once a year when fresh tuna was available in my area.  It's pretty spicy, so it is generally served with boiled potatoes which are perfect for soaking up the sauce.  
The sauce is awesome and stands up to the very meaty fish.  
For some reason, long lost, my grandmother always asked for the darkest tuna steaks they had. She insisted they were better. 

Pretty sure my grandmother used lard for frying, my aunt says butter and oil do fine.  Any vegetable oil is fine if you don't guy you olive oil by the gallon.
