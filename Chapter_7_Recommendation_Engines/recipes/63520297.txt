Ingredients:
2 frozen loaves of bread dough. (Found in frozen Section of your favorite Grocery Store)
1 stick or 8 oz of unsalted butter
1 large package vanilla pudding (Non-Instant)
2 Tablespoons Milk
2 Teaspoons cinnamon
1 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Cup Chopped Nuts (Optional)

Directions:
Sprinkle nuts in a greased 13 x 9" pan.  If using Pecans, toast them on low heat in a saute pan on top of stove.
Break the partially thawed bread into walnut sized pieces evenly in pan on top of the nuts.
In a Saucepan, on medium heat, add Butter, Milk, Cinnamon, Brown Sugar and pudding until boiling.  Stir frequently.
Pour hot mixture into pan over the dough.  Refridgerate, covered, overnight or 6-8 hours to allow the bread dough to thaw and rise.
Bake uncovered in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes.
Remove from oven and if desired, flip onto a serving tray after allowing to slightly cool so as to avoid burn from bubbling hot sugar cinnamon and bread.
Cut to desired size and serve warm for best results.
