Ingredients:
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup chicken broth, or more to taste, divided
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
2 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 dash chipotle-flavored hot sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Stir black beans, 1 cup chicken broth, tomato paste, and cumin together in a heavy pot over low heat; cook at a simmer until hot, 5 to 10 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion, green bell pepper, and jalapeno pepper in hot oil until the vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes; add garlic and continue cooking just until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to the pot with the beans and stir.
Stir sugar into the bean mixture, adding more chicken broth if you want more liquid in the final product; season with hot sauce and continue cooking at a simmer until the vegetables impart a savory flavor to the broth, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
Quick, healthy, and tastes good. Top with sour cream, if you like. Serve over rice or let it stand alone. You can also add just about anything else to this, that's why it's 'anything goes.' Add browned ground beef or turkey for a meaty, almost chili-like main dish. Garnish with diced hard-boiled eggs. Add chopped olives. Sometimes, I add cooked peas. I love the leftovers with scrambled eggs for breakfast; it's great the second day and in tortillas for lunch.
