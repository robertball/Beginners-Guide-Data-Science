Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
3/4 cup water
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup tortilla chips, crushed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to prepared baking dish.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir in taco seasoning and water; simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add corn and taco sauce; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
Combine cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl until evenly mixed. Spread mixture over spaghetti. Spread beef mixture over sour cream mixture and top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I came up with on the spur of the moment. My family, especially my 2 year old, loved it! Very kid-friendly. Garnish with a dollop of sour cream and shredded lettuce, if desired.
