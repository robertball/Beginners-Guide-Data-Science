Ingredients:
1-1.5 lb shrimp (shelled and devained), or
chicken tenders sliced in half, or
chicken breast cut into strips, or
Tofu cut into strips.
2/3 C Coconut cream (or coconut milk),
1/4 C Chicken Stock,
2 T Lime juice,
Zest of 1 lime,
2 t Ginger - grated/finely chopped,
1/2 t salt,
2-3 T oil and,
1/4 C corn starch (if you're using chicken/tofu),
1/2 C chopped cilantro (coriander),
Optional: 1 T cornstarch + 2T COLD water for thickening.

Directions:
Whisk: coconut cream, stock, lime juice, salt and ginger.
2. If Chicken/Tofu: Lightly (but thoroughly) coat chicken/tofu with corn starch.  Heat pan on high/medium-high heat, add oil, and cook chicken 4-5 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.  Remove from pan and set aside.
3. Add coconut cream mixture in a separate pan (or the same one with excess oil removed).  Cook on medium high for about 3-4 minutes, to allow for a reduction...and then add lime zest.
When finishing the sauce, it should be thick enough to cover the back of a spoon.  If you like a thicker sauce, use the 'optional 1 T cornstarch mixed in 2T cold water'.  Add mixture to your cream sauce, and allow the sauce to come back to a boil.
4a. If using shrimp, add your shrimp to the simmering sauce, and allow them to cook for 1-2 minute, or until done.  Remove from heat.
4b. If using chicken/tofu, add into simmering sauce....allow to rewarm for 1 minute and remove from heat.
After serving into dishes, top with cilantro leaves.
Usually, my wife and I like to serve this meal over rice...but it's good either way.  Enjoy!
