Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 pound beef stew meat
2 tablespoons adobo seasoning (such as Goya®), divided
1 teaspoon garlic granules, divided
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, divided
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander divided
4 cloves fresh garlic, minced
2 cups beef broth, divided
2 russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 ears fresh corn, shucked, cut into 1-inch-thick slices
2 carrots, sliced
1 chayote squash - peeled, cored, and cubed
1 onion, chopped

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Add butter once the pot is hot. Add beef and season with 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and 1/8 teaspoon coriander. Cook until beef is browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Add fresh minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour 1 cup beef broth into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Cancel Saute mode.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 25 minutes. Quick-release the remaining pressure for 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
Stir in potatoes, corn, carrots, chayote squash, and onion. Pour in remaining 1 cup beef broth. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 8 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 12 minutes. Quick-release the remaining pressure for 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add remaining 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, and 1/8 teaspoon coriander to taste.

Description: 
It seems no matter what region you visit in Mexico or Latin America, they have their own version of Caldo de Res. My version is certainly not authentic, but incorporates the main components for a faster preparation.
