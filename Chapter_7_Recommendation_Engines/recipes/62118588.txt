Description: 
This is an absolutely delicious breakfast treat with a cup of coffee. Easy and elegant- what more could you ask for? I know, I know; salt on toast sounds awful. BUT it really brings out the sweetness of the honey and butter. It's best to use fresh cracked sea salt for optimum flavor. Enjoy!
