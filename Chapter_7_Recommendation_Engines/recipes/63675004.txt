Ingredients:
2 cans full fat coconut milk (13.5 oz cans) - unflavored and unsweetened
1/3 cup powdered sugar or to taste (I would have to try it with Stevia and see how it turned out to avoid using powdered sugar)
1 - 4 Tbsp coconut flour or tapioca flour (add 1 Tbsp at a time)
1 Tbsp vanilla extract or to taste

Directions:
Chill the cans of coconut milk overnight in the fridge
Open the cans, drain off the clear liquid and transfer the cream to a chilled bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape all the cream out of the cans
Beat the thick coconut cream in the chilled bowl with a hand mixer until thick and fluffy
Add the vanilla, then gradually beat in the powdered sugar and coconut or tapioca flour, 1 or 2 Tbsp at a time, testing for flavor and consistency
For flavored whipped cream, add some cinnamon, instant coffee, or cocoa powder (you may want to increase the sugar a bit); or replace the vanilla with almond or coconut extract or a liqueur
Using a rubber spatula, transfer the coconut cream to a covered storage container, and chill for 2 hours until the mixture firms. Serve chilled.
**Don't like the coconut "icing" idea??...Then use plain Greek Yogurt instead of Coconut Milk and Almond Flour in place of the coconut flour...
**Toast your almonds before pressing them on the side, you can toast them in a skillet over medium heat until golden, or toast them in the oven under the broiler...Be sure to let them cool completely before using them on your "cake"
