Ingredients:
1 package of active dry yeast
1 cup lukewarm water
1 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 to 4 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
2 Tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Thoroughly mix 3 1/2 cups flour, sugar and salt together in a medium bowl.
Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water, let proof, about 10 minutes.
Add the yeast to the flour mixture, stir and add in olive oil, adding in flour as needed to form a nice ball of dough.
Place the dough ball on a lightly floured surface and knead 8-10 minutes.
Placed dough in a medium lightly oiled bowl, cover with dish towel and let rise in a warm place until double in size.
Punch dough down and knead again about 5 minutes. Allow to rise again for 20 minutes.
Press dough out with hands or roll out to about 1/4 inch thickness.
Bake at least at 425Â° on lowest rack. A stone pan will keep your crust from burning on the bottom and even cooking.

Description: 
We used to have pizza night with our next door neighbors many years ago, the held on to this recipe for a very long time, was handed down in their family. I finally got it out of them eventually. That was well over a decade ago and they have since moved, but I still make this pizza dough.
