Ingredients:
20 whole chicken wings
1/3 c. butter, melted
1/2 c. Frank's Hot Sauce
Salt & Pepper
Cayenne pepper, optional
Bleu Cheese dressing
Celery sticks

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 F degrees
Cut off tip end of wings at joint, if desired or leave whole.  Wash wings and pat dry with paper towels. Place wings on cookie sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper.
Bake for 15 minutes, carefully turn wings over. Bake for another 15 minutes, turn over again. Bake 5 to 7 minutes longer.
While wings are baking, cut up celery sticks and make the sauce.  Melt the butter in a small pan and add the hot sauce.  Heat on low for a few minutes until hot, stirring occasionally.
Remove wings from oven and put in a bowl. Pour sauce over wings and stir to coat.
Serve with Bleu Cheese dressing and celery sticks.
If you like spicier wings, sprinkle cayenne on wings before baking and/or add to hot sauce mixture, to taste.
