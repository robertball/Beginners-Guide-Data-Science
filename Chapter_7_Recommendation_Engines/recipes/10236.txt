Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 egg, separated
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
36 pecan halves
2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate
1/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon butter
1 3/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Cream butter or margarine, gradually add brown sugar, beating at medium speed of an electric mixer until light and fluffy.
Add 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, and vanilla; beating until well blended.
Combine flour, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture, mixing well.
Chill dough at least 1 hour.
Arrange pecan halves in groups of 5 on ungreased cookie sheets, resembling head and legs of turtles.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls, and dip bottoms in remaining egg white.  Press gently onto pecans to resemble turtle bodies.   Bake at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.  Spread frosting on top of cookies.
To Make Frosting:   Combine chocolate squares, milk and 1 tablespoon butter or margarine in a small saucepan; cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate melts.   Remove from heat.   Add approximately 1 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar; beat until smooth.
