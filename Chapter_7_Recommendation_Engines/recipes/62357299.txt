https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
2 tsp ginger root, fresh, peeled and grated
2 tsp low-sodium soy sauce
1 tsp dark sesame oil
1 tsp honey
2 cup(s) packaged coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots)
1 cup(s) cooked pork, finely chopped
2 medium scallion(s), thinly sliced diagonally (white and light green portions only)
Instructions
Mix together the vinegar, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and honey in a medium bowl. Add the coleslaw mix, pork, and scallions; toss to coat. Yields 1 1/2 cup per serving.
Notes
If you like, substitute leftover beef, turkey, or chicken for the chopped cooked pork. If you mix this salad the night before, you’ll find that, though the salad is not quite as crisp by lunch time, the flavors are wonderfully melded. Serve each portion with 8 small, thin rice crackers and up the POINTS value by 1.
If you are toting this slaw to the office for lunch, pack a serving into a container and keep refrigerated until ready to eat. It will keep for up to 24 hours.
