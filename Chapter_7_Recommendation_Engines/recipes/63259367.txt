Ingredients:
2 1/2 pound boneless top loin pork roast
1 cup fresh rosemary
2 tbsp fresh minced garlic
3 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp balsamic salad dressing
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons black pepper
1 lb small red potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
In a food processor, combine rosemary leaves, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper and pulse to make a coarse, wet paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. Spread 3/4 paste on all sides of roast. Place roast, fat side up, in shallow roasting pan large enough to hold roast with 3 inches room around all sides. Roast 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine potatoes and remaining paste. Reduce oven to 350 degrees F. Add potato mixture to pan, arranging potatoes around roast. Continue roasting 40-45 minutes, tossing potatoes halfway through, or until internal temperature of roast reaches 145 degrees F and potatoes are tender. (If roast is done before potatoes, transfer it to a cutting board and return roasting pan with potatoes to oven.) Remove roast from oven and let rest 10 minutes. Slice roast and arrange on platter. Surround with potatoes and serve.
