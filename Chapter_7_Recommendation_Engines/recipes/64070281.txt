Ingredients:
12 strips bacon
2 T unsalted butter
1 onion, diced
1 carrot cut into small chunks
1 1/2 lbs chuck steak
2 T APF
1/2 C beef broth
salt and pepper to taste
Large pinch dried rosemary and/or other savories
1/2 batch Medieval pastry dough for a 9" crust, unbaked

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees.
Weave bacon strips into a lattice, alternating strips over and under each other. Make your lattice as wide as you can reserving any extra strips of bacon. Place the woven bacon and any extra strips on a baking sheet with high edges. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the bacon is crispy. Set aside to cool, but leave the oven on to bake the pie.
Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the onions, carrot, and potato. Cook gently until onion is soft and golden. toss the beef with flour. Add the beef to the vegetables and stir over low heat for 5 minutes or until brown. Stir in any remaining flour and cook for 1 minute longer. Add the broth, salt, pepper and rosemary; mix well, and simmer for 10 minutes, until a gravy has formed. Let the mixture cool.
Place your pie plate face down on bacon lattice. Use sharp knife to cut around pie pan to create circle. Crumble leftover bacon into filling.
Roll out pastry dough and line pie plate, letting it hang over about 2 inches. Pour filling into shell. Cover with lattice, then fold dough over bacon. Bake 40 minutes, or until crust is golden.
