Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups vegetable broth
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or as needed

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Spread corn and pineapple onto a baking sheet.
Broil corn and pineapple in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from oven.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, yellow bell pepper, carrot, garlic, chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper in the hot oil until softened, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine roasted corn-pineapple mixture, onion mixture, vegetable broth, tomatoes, pumpkin puree, black beans, coconut milk, and cilantro in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish each serving with Cheddar cheese.
