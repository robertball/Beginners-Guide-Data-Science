Ingredients:
Crust:
8 whole graham crackers
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, melted
Filling:
4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
1 egg
1 3/4 cups prepared eggnog
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) carton sour cream
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Process graham crackers in a food processor to make crumbs; pulse 1 teaspoon sugar, ginger, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon with crumbs once or twice to combine. With processor running, drizzle butter into crumbs just to incorporate. Press graham cracker mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch spring form pan.
Bake crust in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; cool on wire rack.
Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. Stir 3/4 cup sugar, flour, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl. Beat sugar mixture into cream cheese until smooth; beat in egg. Slowly beat eggnog into cream cheese mixture, followed by vanilla extract. Pour cream cheese filling into spring form pan over the crust. Tap pan lightly on a work surface to release air bubbles.
Bake in the oven for 1 hour.
Spread sour cream over filling. Return to oven and bake 5 more minutes.
Cool in pan on a rack until cool to the touch, about 30 minutes, before refrigerating to chill thoroughly. Sprinkle with ground nutmeg to taste before serving.
