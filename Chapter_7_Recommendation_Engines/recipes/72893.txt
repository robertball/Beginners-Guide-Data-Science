Ingredients:
3 large potatoes, scrubbed
1 cup milk
1 (1 ounce) package dry Ranch-style dressing mix
1 pinch garlic salt
1 quart oil for frying, or as needed

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
Cut potatoes into wedges or fries, and soak in a bowl with milk. Stir together the ranch dressing mix and garlic salt; place on a plate or in a bag. Drain potatoes, and roll in the seasonings to coat.
Place potatoes into the deep-fryer in batches so they are not too crowded. Fry for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and season with leftover seasoning mixture.
