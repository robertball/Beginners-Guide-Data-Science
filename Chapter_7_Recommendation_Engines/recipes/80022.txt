Ingredients:
4 boneless beef chuck eye steaks, cut 1 inch thick
1 1/2 cups purchased fresh pineapple chunks packed in juice
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1-1/2 inch pieces
1 small red onion, cut into 8 wedges
1/3 cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Soak four 12-inch bamboo skewers in water 10 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile drain pineapple, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine pineapple juice and hoisin sauce in small bowl.  Place steaks in food-safe plastic bag.  Pour 1/4 cup hoisin-pineapple mixture over steaks; turn to coat.  Close bag securely and marinate in refrigerator 30 minutes to 2 hours.
Alternately thread pineapple chunks, bell pepper pieces and onion wedges onto skewers.  Place in glass dish; brush 1/4 cup hoisin-pineapple mixture on kabobs.  Cover and marinate in refrigerator up to 2 hours.
Remove steaks and skewers from marinade; discard marinade.  Place steaks and kabobs on grid over medium, ash-covered coals.  Grill steaks, covered, 10 to 14 minutes until steaks are medium rare to medium doneness and vegetables are crisp-tender, turning occasionally.
Meanwhile combine remaining hoisin-pineapple mixture, apricot preserves and lemon juice in small saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until hot.  Serve steaks with kabobs and sauce.  Sprinkle with cilantro.
