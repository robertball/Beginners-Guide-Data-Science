Ingredients:
1/2 cup sesame seeds
4 cups all-purpose flour
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons water
5 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup olive oil
1 egg, lightly beaten

Directions:
Toast sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over low heat until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Keep a close eye as they change color very quickly.
Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture and add water, milk, melted butter, and olive oil; stir well until dough pulls together. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Divide dough in to 8 parts and roll each part into a 6- to 8-inch long rope. Join ends together and seal to form a ring. Place rings on prepared baking sheet, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush rings with beaten egg and sprinkle generously with toasted sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crusty, about 20 minutes.
