1 clove garlic, grated
2 zucchini, grated
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Great Value Fiesta BlendÂ®), or more to taste

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease an 8-inch baking pan.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add zucchini, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Increase heat; cook and stir until zucchini is almost soft, about 7 minutes. Drain excess liquid and transfer to the prepared baking pan.
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and Mexican cheese blend over zucchini.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and starts to turn brown, about 7 minutes.
