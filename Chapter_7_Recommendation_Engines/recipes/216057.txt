Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup vegetable shortening
3 tablespoons cold butter
1/3 cup buttermilk, or as needed
2 teaspoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Whisk the flour and salt together in a bowl. With a pastry cutter, cut the shortening and butter into the flour until the chunks are the size of small peas. Stir in buttermilk and vegetable oil with a fork until the dough is moistened and beginning to gather together. Form the dough into a compact shape.
Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a ball. Roll out each pie crust  between 2 sheets of parchment paper.
