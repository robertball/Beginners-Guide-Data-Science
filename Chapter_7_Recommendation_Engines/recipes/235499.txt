Ingredients:
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon granulated sugar, divided
6 eggs
3 cups 2% milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ripe but firm bananas, sliced
2 tablespoons butter, softened
6 (1/2 inch) slices egg bread

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 11 x 8-inch glass baking dish.
In a large bowl, combine cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, milk and vanilla; set aside.
Slice bananas and arrange evenly in the bottom of the baking dish. Butter bread slices on both sides and cut into cubes; sprinkle over top of bananas to cover. Pour egg mixture evenly over top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of sugar.
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour or until knife inserted in centre comes out clean and top is golden brown and slightly puffed. Let cool slightly before serving.
