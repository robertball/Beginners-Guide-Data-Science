6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 strips bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place Brussels sprouts on a baking sheet; sprinkle garlic and bacon evenly over the top. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until sprouts are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes.
Place sprouts in a serving bowl. Toss together and drizzle with remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper and top with Asiago cheese.
