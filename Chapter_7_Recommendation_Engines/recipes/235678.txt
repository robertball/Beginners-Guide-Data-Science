Ingredients:
Biscuits:
2 1/2 cups baking mix (such as BisquickÂ®)
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup raisins
Glaze:
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon warm water
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Whisk baking mix, white sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in milk until dough is just combined. Fold raisins into dough. Knead dough about 10 times and roll out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut round biscuits using a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter; arrange on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir confectioners' sugar, water, and vanilla extract together until glaze is smooth; drizzle over warm biscuits.
