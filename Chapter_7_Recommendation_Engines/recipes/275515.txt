Ingredients:
6 tablespoons soy sauce
5 tablespoons packed dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons finely chopped scallions
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger root
4 salmon fillets
vegetable oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, scallions, vinegar, sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sesame oil, Sriracha(R), garlic, and ginger together in a bowl.
Place salmon fillets in a shallow baking dish. Pour marinade over top and marinate for 30 to 60 minutes, turning once.
Brush the cooking grates on an outdoor grill until they are clean. Preheat the grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove salmon from the marinade and blot gently with paper towels to remove excess. Brush salmon generously on both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Discard remaining marinade.
Place salmon fillets, flesh-sides down, on the preheated grill. Close the lid and cook until you can lift fillets up with tongs without them sticking to the grate, 6 to 8 minutes. Turn fillets and cook to desired doneness, about 2 to 3 minutes more for medium-rare. Slide a spatula between the skin and flesh and transfer fillets to serving plates.
