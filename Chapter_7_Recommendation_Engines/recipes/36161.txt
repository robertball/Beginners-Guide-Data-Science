Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 onion, chopped
3/8 cup raisins, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped flat leaf parsley
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
salt and pepper to taste
skewers
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat grill for high heat.
In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, onion, raisins, and parsley. Season with cayenne pepper, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg, sugar, salt, and pepper, and mix well. Form into 6 flat sausages around skewers. Lightly brush sausages with oil; this prevents sticking to the grill.
Arrange skewers on hot grill grate. Cook for approximately 15 minutes, turning occasionally to brown evenly, until well done.
