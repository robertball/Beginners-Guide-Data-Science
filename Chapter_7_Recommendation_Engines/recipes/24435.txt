Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup molasses
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar
4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
In a large bowl, stir together the butter, molasses, sour cream, brown sugar and vinegar until smooth and well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger and cinnamon; stir into the molasses mixture. Dough will be very stiff when complete.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be iced, when cooled, with any standard icing recipe.

Description: 
This is a great replacement for the standard gingerbread recipe.  The cookies turn out soft, and the flavor is not sharp or hot.  It has been a family tradition with my family throughout every holiday season.
