Incredible Disappearing Pumpkin Pie Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
One can (15 oz) prepared pumpkin
1 Tbsp corn starch
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 Tbsp butter (must be very soft)
1 1/2 cups half and half
1 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
Pie Shell- One deep dish, or two regular size

Directions:
Mix the spices and cornstarch into the canned pumpkin, along with the butter and sugar.  Add the eggs and half and half, mix well- a minute or two on medium speed will do.  Once there are no lumps, and the mixture is an even color, pour into the crusts.  It will be very soupy at this point.  Bake at 450 for 15 minutes, then turn the oven down to 350 for another 50 minutes.  Serve with a dollop of whipped cream on top.

Description: 
This pie was the hit of Thanksgiving- I had to make another one the next day!  My kids, who never even liked pumpkin pie in the past, were fighting over who got the last piece.
