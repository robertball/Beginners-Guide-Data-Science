Ingredients:
24 fresh figs
1 cup cognac
1 cup mascarpone cheese
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 cups toasted hazelnuts
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves

Directions:
Using a marinade injector baster, inject figs with about 1 tablespoon cognac, dividing the amount equally amongst the figs. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients.
In a medium bowl, blend remaining cognac, mascarpone cheese and 3/4 of the confectioners' sugar. Chill in the refrigerator while preparing remaining ingredients.
In a blender or food processor, mix toasted hazelnuts, mint leaves and remaining confectioner' sugar. Place the mixture in a medium bowl.
Remove stems from figs, and cut in half lengthwise. Fill halves with equal portions of the cognac and mascarpone cheese mixture. Roll in the hazelnut mixture. Arrange on a medium serving platter, cheese side up, and chill in the refrigerator until serving.

Description: 
This has been a hit at many dinner parties. Figs are stuffed with a creamy, rich mascarpone cheese and cognac mixture, then rolled in toasted hazelnuts. Garnish with whole hazelnuts and mint leaves when serving. If an injector is unavailable, marinate the figs in 1/2 cup cognac for approximately 30 minutes.
