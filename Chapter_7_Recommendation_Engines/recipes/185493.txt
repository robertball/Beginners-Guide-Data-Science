Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons hot buffalo wing sauce
1 loaf Italian bread, cut in half lengthwise
3 cups shredded meat from a rotisserie chicken
8 slices pepperjack cheese
1/4 cup roasted red bell peppers, drained and sliced (optional)

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
Combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and hot sauce in a small bowl.  Spread both halves of the bread with the mayonnaise mixture.  Place chicken on bottom half of bread; layer bacon and cheese on top of chicken.   Fold the top half of the bread over the bottom, and wrap with foil.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Add a layer of red pepper slices on top of the bacon and cheese, if desired. Cut into slices, and serve.
