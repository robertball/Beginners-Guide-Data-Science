Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup shortening
1/4 cup honey
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup raisins
1/4 cup crushed walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.
Mix flour, baking soda, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat shortening with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth; add honey and mix for 2 minutes. Stir flour mixture into shortening mixture, alternating with applesauce, until batter is smooth. Fold in raisins and walnuts. Spoon about 2 1/2 tablespoons batter into each muffin cup.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
