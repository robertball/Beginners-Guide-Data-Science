Ingredients:
1 (17.25 ounce) package frozen puff pastry sheets, thawed
1 cup NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE ® Milk Chocolate Morsels, divided
1 large egg, beaten
1 (2 ounce) bar NESTLE® TOLL HOUSE® Semi-Sweet Chocolate Baking Bars, broken into pieces
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoons hot water

Directions:
PREHEAT oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 2 baking sheets.
UNFOLD one pastry sheet on lightly floured surface. Roll out to make a 10-inch square. Cut into 4 squares. Place 2 tablespoons morsels in center of each square. Brush edges lightly with beaten egg and fold squares to form triangles. Press edges to seal. Place on prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Repeat with remaining pastry sheet. Brush top of each pastry with beaten egg.
BAKE for 15 to 17 minutes or until puffed and golden. Cool on baking sheets for 2 minutes; remove to wire racks to cool completely.
MELT baking bar and butter in small, microwave-safe bowl on HIGH (100 percent) power for 30 seconds; stir. Microwave at additional 10- to 20-second intervals, stirring until smooth. Stir in sugar. Add water, stirring until icing is smooth, adding additional water, if necessary. Drizzle icing over pastries.
