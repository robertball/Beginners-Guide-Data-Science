Ingredients:
5 pounds russet potatoes
1 Dozen hard boiled eggs
1 Purple or Red Onion Chopped
1 Jar Vlassic Kosher Pickles Chopped (Don't go with cheap store brand)
1/2 cup reserved juice from pickle jar (this is my own twist to the recipe to cut back on mayo)
1/2 Cup Bestfoods or Hellman's Mayonaise (Don't go cheap or pay the price with taste)
1 teaspooon yellow mustard
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel and cut potatoes into 1 inch squares
add to salted boiling water (enough to cover)
cook till fork tender (approx 15 minutes)then drain
Boil eggs for 12 minutes then add to an ice bath.
Once cooled peel eggs them chop them up.
Chop Onion
Chop Pickles
To assemble
Place cooled potatoes in large bowl
Add pickle juice and stir
Add Egg/Onion/Pickles
Mix
Add Mayo and Mustard
Stir till all combined
If you feel it is too dry, add more mayo not juice.
Salt and Pepper to taste
Cover Tightly and refrigerate over night to set
Important note:  If you do not let it cool down before adding to frig, condensation will form on the lid and drip down into your salad, not a good thing!!!

This is a family recipe handed down over three generations, and is always a crowd pleaser.  I know it is a simple recipe, that is the perfection behind it. I swear to you, make it as written and everyone will want to know your secret!! I am demanded to make this for every picnic, pot luck, birthday, etc during the spring and summer.  The good thing to changing how I make it? No one will bug you to make it again!!
