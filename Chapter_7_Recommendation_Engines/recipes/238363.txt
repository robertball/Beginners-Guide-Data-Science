Ingredients:
2 Haas avocados - peeled, pitted, and sliced
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup slivered almonds, finely chopped
sea salt to taste

Directions:
Arrange avocado slices on a platter or several appetizer plates.
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat until butter begins to bubble and foam. Cook and stir chopped almonds in hot butter until golden and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer almonds to a paper towel-lined plate to cool.
Top each avocado slice with almonds and sea salt.

Description: 
Super fast! I think this makes a nice energy boost after a workout, but I often serve it when friends are dropping by as a quick appetizer. You can substitute an interesting salt, use salt substitute, add roasted garlic, etc. There are numerous possibilities.
