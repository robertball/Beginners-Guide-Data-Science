Ingredients:
4 cups fat-free chicken broth
2 (4.5 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers, drained
2 cups shredded cooked chicken meat
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or to taste
1 cup cooked white rice
1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced
1 cup diced Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Pour broth into a soup pot, or large saucepan, and bring to a simmer. Add the chile peppers, chicken, garbanzo beans, oregano, chipotle peppers, rice, salt and pepper. Return to a simmer, and cook for 30 minutes. If the soup is too thick, you can add a little more broth. Ladle into serving bowls, and top with sliced avocado and cheese cubes.
