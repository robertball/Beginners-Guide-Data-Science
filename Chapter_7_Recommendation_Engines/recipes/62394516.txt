Ingredients:
8 oz. uncooked medium shells pasta
4 cups of a combination of the following:
black beans
corn kernels
diced red pepper
cubed Monterey Jack cheese
grilled chicken breast chunks
2 cups chili lime dressing*

Directions:
Cook the pasta until done to desired tenderness and drain well. Al dente is best since soaking in dressing can cause the pasta to become mushy. Cool completely.
Toss with beans, corn, red pepper, cheese, chicken chunks and dressing.
Chill for an hour before serving.
