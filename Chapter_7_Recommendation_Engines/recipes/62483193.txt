Ingredients:
1 Box any brand Pene Pasta (or wheat Pene)
1 Jar of Classico Garlic & Herb Alfredo Sauce
6 Large Boneless Chicken Breasts (cut/cubed)
1/2 Medium Yellow Onion (minced)
Fresh Ground Pepper to taste
Crushed Red Pepper to taste
1 Regular size bag Italian Cheese Mix Shredded
1 Handfull of fresh Mushrooms (chopped)
1 Regular bottle of Caribbean Jerk 30 Minute Marinade

Directions:
**Chicken first**
-Saute chicken in 1/4 cup of Caribbean Jerk Marinade with onions, crushed red peppers, and some pepper.
**Then Pasta**
-Boil Pene Paste until it's tender.
**Mixture** -Preheat Oven 350-
When Chicken and noodles are both finished, mix them together in a large mixing bowl with the jar of Alfredo Sauce, Mushrooms, the whole (rest) of the bottle of Caribbean Jerk Marinade. Stir well then put mixture in 9 x 13 inch baking pan (I use glass pyrex)and cover with cheese mixture. Bake at 350 until cheese is golden.
*Can be eaten immediately, but still tastes great if you put it in the fridge and bake it later.
