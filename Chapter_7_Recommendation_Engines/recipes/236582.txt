Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
2 (4 ounce) fillets mahi mahi
1 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
1 pinch ground white pepper
1 3/4 cups milk
1 (1.2 ounce) package creamy pesto sauce mix
4 ounces fresh crabmeat
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Directions:
Heat a small amount of the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Season mahi mahi with oregano, salt, and white pepper; cook in skillet until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 10 minutes per side.
While fish cooks, whisk remaining olive oil, milk, and creamy pesto sauce mix together in a saucepan over medium-low heat; cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir crabmeat into the sauce.
Transfer cooked mahi mahi to plates and spoon sauce over the fish.
