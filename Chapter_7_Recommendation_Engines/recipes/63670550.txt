1 tbs olive oil
1/2 head cauliflower
1 8oz package mushrooms
1 zucchini
1 red/orange/yellow bell pepper
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (2 ounce) can black olives, sliced

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the onion for 5 minutes in a splash of olive oil. Add the vegetable mixture and garlic, and saute for 10 more minutes. Mix in the olives, green chile peppers, tomatoes with green chile peppers, taco sauce and refried beans. Stir mixture thoroughly, reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
Spread a thin layer of the meat mixture in the bottom of a 9x14 and 8x8 casserole dish. Cover with a layer of tortillas followed by more meat mixture, then a layer of cheese. Repeat tortilla, meat, cheese pattern until all the tortillas are used, topping off with a layer of meat mixture and cheese.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is slightly brown and bubbly.
