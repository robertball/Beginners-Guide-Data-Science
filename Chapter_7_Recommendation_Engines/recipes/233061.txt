Ingredients:
2 egg whites
2/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup miniature chocolate chips
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Add vanilla extract and stir. Fold chocolate chips and pecans into the mixture. Drop by teaspoonful onto prepared baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 minute. Turn oven off and let cookies continue to bake as the oven cools until light and crispy, 5 hours to overnight.
