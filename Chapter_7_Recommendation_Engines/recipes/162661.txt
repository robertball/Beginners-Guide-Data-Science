Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried lima beans, soaked overnight
2 smoked ham hocks
8 cups water
5 cups shredded cabbage
1/2 cup butter
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 pound smoked sausage, sliced (optional)

Directions:
In a large pot, combine the lima beans, ham hocks, water, cabbage and butter. Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and set a lid on top but leave a crack for steam. Simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Remove the lid, add the tomatoes and sausage; simmer with the lid on until beans are completely tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
