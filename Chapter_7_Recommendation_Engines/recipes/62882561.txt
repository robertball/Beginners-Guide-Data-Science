1 cup pecan halves
1 1/2 cups all-purpose baking mix
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 (18.4-oz.) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenderloins
2 large eggs

Vegetable cooking spray
Garnish: green onion curls

Directions:
Place pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan.
Bake at 350° for 10 minutes or until lightly toasted, stirring occasionally.
Process toasted pecans, baking mix, salt, and pepper in a food processor until pecans are finely ground. Place 1/2 cup pecan mixture in a large bowl. Add chicken, tossing to coat.
Whisk together eggs and buttermilk. Dip chicken in milk mixture; dredge in remaining pecan mixture. Arrange chicken in a single layer on a lightly greased aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Lightly coat tops of chicken with vegetable cooking spray.
Bake at 425° for 20 to 25 minutes or until chicken is golden brown. Arrange on a serving platter, and garnish, if desired.
