Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) box Betty Crocker速 SuperMoist速 yellow cake mix
1 1/4 cups water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
2 (12 ounce) containers Betty Crocker速 Whipped fluffy white frosting
Yellow food color
3 orange wedge candies
2 nonpareil candies (1-inch chocolate rounds topped with white sprinkles)
2 chocolate chips

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F (325 degrees F for dark or nonstick pans). Grease bottoms and sides of 1 (8-inch) round cake pan, 1 (9-inch) round cake pan and 1 (10-oz) custard cup with shortening or cooking spray.
Make cake mix as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Pour 2/3 cup batter into custard cup; pour 2 cups batter into each cake pan. Bake custard cup 20 to 25 minutes and cake pans 25 to 30 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes. Remove cakes from custard cup and pans; place rounded sides up on cooling racks. Cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Spoon frosting into large bowl. Stir in enough food color until desired yellow color. Using serrated knife, cut rounded top off 8-inch cake. Place 8-inch cake, cut side down, on serving plate; spread 1/2 cup frosting over top. Place 9-inch cake, rounded side up, on frosted cake. To 'crumb-coat' cake, spread thin layer of frosting over side and top of layered cake to seal in crumbs. Freeze cake 30 to 60 minutes.
Reserve about 1/2 cup frosting. Frost side and top of cake with remaining frosting. Place custard cup cake, rounded side up, 1 inch from edge of layered cake for head. Directly opposite head, place 2 orange candies, side by side, for tail shape. Frost head and candy tail with reserved frosting.
Add nonpareil candies to head for eyes; add chocolate chips to center of eyes, attaching with small amount of frosting. Cut rounded side of remaining orange candy to within 1/4 inch of flat side. Using sugared fingers, press cut halves of candy to make them thin to form upper and lower halves of beak. Push 2 toothpicks through beak and insert under eyes.
