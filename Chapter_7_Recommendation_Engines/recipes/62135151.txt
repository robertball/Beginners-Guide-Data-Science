Ingredients:
1 - 4 lb Chuck Roast
1 can Campbells Condensed Beef Consomme
1 can Campbells Condensed French Onion Soup
1 pkg McCormick Au Jus Mix
2 c Water
3/4 cup Red Wine, I use Merlot
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Garlic Powder
1 1/2 tsp Pepper
1 tbsp Worchestershire Sauce
1 tbsp Soy Sauce
12 slices Mozzarella
12 slices Provolone
6 tbsp Butter
12 Hard Rolls

Directions:
Trim excess fat from the roast.  If it is a bone-in roast, do not remove the bone.
Place in the crock pot.
Whisk the Au Jus mix with the water.
Pour the consomme, french onion soup, Au Jus mix and wine over the roast.
Add the salt, garlic powder, pepper, worchestershire and soy sauce.
Cook on low for 7 hrs.
Continue to remove fat as needed.  Leave the bones in until ready to slice.
One hour before serving, remove the roast from the crock pot, remove bones, if necessary, and slice.
Return meat to crock pot.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Slice the hard rolls, butter them and place in the oven for 10 mins.
Remove from oven.  Top the bottom half with the roast and then a slice of mozzarella and/or provolone.
Return the rolls, including the tops, to the oven,  Let the tops continue to brown and the cheese melt.
Remove from oven.
Serve the sauce in individual ramekins for dipping.
I use the leftover sauce as a base for French Onion Soup.  It freezes very well.
