4 tablespoons butter
1 cup onion, chopped
1 1/2 cups skim milk
4 cups bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon dill
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon rosemary

Saut√© the onions until soft, about 8 minutes.
For bread machines: add all ingredients, including onions, in the order recommended by your manufacturer and start on dough setting.
By hand: Mix all ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough hook, including onions, for 8 minutes.  Spray pam into a bowl and place dough inside.  Cover with a damp cloth and leave in a warm place for 2 hours.
Put dough on a floured surface and divide into two equal pieces.
Shape dough into loaf shape desired, and place on a baking sheet sprayed with Pam.  Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and place a pan of water on the lowest rack.  Bake loaves for 25 minutes or until golden brown.
