Ingredients:
16 fresh asparagus spears
16 slices sandwich bread, crusts removed
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
8 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place asparagus in a skillet with a small amount of water; cook until crisp and tender, about 6-8 minutes.  Drain and set aside.
Flatten bread with a rolling pin.  Combine the cream cheese, bacon and chives; spread 1 tablespoonful on each slice of bread.  Top with an asparagus spear.  Roll up tightly; place seam side down on a greased baking sheet.  Brush with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Cut roll-ups in half.  Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.

Description: 
These roll-ups are simply divine. A friend shared the recipe after serving them at a church brunch, where they disappeared fast. They make a unique finger food, a side dish at supper or a lovely lunch served with soup.
