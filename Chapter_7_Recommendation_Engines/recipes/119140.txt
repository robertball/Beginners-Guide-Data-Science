Ingredients:
2 eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
3/4 cup sugar
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup jelly or jam

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine eggs, oil, extracts and lemon peel until well blended. Beat in sugar (mixture will become thick). Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; gradually add to egg mixture. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 in. apart onto ungreased baking sheets.
Spray the bottom of a glass with nonstick cooking spray, then dip in sugar. Flatten cookies with glass, redipping in sugar as needed. Place 1/4 teaspoon jelly in the center of each cookie. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until set. Remove to wire racks to cool.
