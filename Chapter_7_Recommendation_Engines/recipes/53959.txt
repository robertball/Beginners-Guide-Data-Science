Ingredients:
4 cups water
1 (16 ounce) package Portuguese chourico sausage, diced
2 potatoes, diced
1/2 head cabbage, coarsely chopped
3 carrots, diced
1 small onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, diced
1 (15 ounce) can mixed vegetables, drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper
2 tablespoons cornstarch (optional)
2 tablespoons water (optional)

Directions:
Place the water, chourico, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, onion, celery, canned vegetables, parsley, garlic powder, celery salt, and red pepper in a large pot. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to simmer the soup until the vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. If soup is too thin, stir in cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken.

Description: 
This is a nice winter soup that will warm you up after being outside in the snow! This is great as a meal with some crusty French bread. I sometimes add a can of white beans.
