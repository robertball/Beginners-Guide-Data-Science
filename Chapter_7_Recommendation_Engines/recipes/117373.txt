Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg
3/4 cup applesauce
1/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1 cup confectioners' sugar
4 1/2 teaspoons milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg, applesauce, and melted butter; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Fold in the cranberries. Fill greased or paper lined muffin cups two-thirds full.
Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
In a small bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar and milk and whisk until smooth. Drizzle icing over the cupcakes.
