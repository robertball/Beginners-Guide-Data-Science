Ingredients:
3 pounds beef sirloin tip roast
4 cloves garlic, peeled and halved
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Secure roast with cooking twine.
Make 8 (1/2 inch) slits around the roast, and insert 1/2 garlic clove into each slit. Sprinkle with fresh ground pepper. Place on a rack in roasting pan.
Roast in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F, and insert meat thermometer into roast. Continue cooking about 1 hour, or to desired doneness; remove from oven. Loosely cover with foil, and let roast stand 15 minutes before slicing.
To serve, slice thinly against the grain, and use pan drippings for gravy.

Description: 
This was my mother's signature recipe. Slice lengthwise, very thinly. Also delicious chilled, with spicy mustard on tiny party rolls.
