Description: 
This recipe includes bacon which makes it taste better, of course.  Use homemade bacon instead of store bought bacon bits because the flavor is better.  My mother always slices the cabbage really thinly which gives the slaw a great texture; but when pressed for time I bagged mix which works fine.  For best flavor be sure to use all the ingredients since the combination is what makes this special.
