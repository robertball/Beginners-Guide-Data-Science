Description: 
This is an authentic Mexican rice dish from Jim Peyton, and despite it's somewhat odd sounding ingredients, it is fantastic!!! Great with any meat dish. I sometimes make this for myself for dinner, with nothing but the rice and a glass of white wine to enjoy with it. Leftovers heat up well, too.
