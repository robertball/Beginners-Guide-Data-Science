In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, oil and vanilla. Add apples and sugar; beat for 1 minute. Combine the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg and baking powder; add to apple mixture until blended. Stir in walnuts.
Pour into a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Combine the confectioners' sugar and brown sugar; sprinkle over cake.

Description: 
At the campground where my husband and I have a trailer, the campers hold and auction of baked goods every Fourth of July. I donated this moist bundt cake last year and it brought in the highest bid! I often use black walnuts in place of regular walnuts because they add a special flavor.
