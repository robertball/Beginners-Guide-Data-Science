Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
4 cups water
4 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (6 ounce) package long-grain and wild rice mix (such as Near EastÂ®)
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine chicken, water, and broth in a large pot over medium heat. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the middle, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook carrots, celery, and onion until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside.
Remove chicken from broth, cut into cubes, and return to broth. Add rice to the broth, reserving seasoning packet, and simmer 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Add flour and reserved rice seasoning packet; cook and stir to create a paste, about 2 minutes. Add milk and whisk to combine. Add milk mixture to the pot with the soup. Stir and simmer until soup thickens, about 5 minutes more.

Description: 
This soup is so rich and satisfying (and surprisingly low in fat). I came up with this recipe after trying to kick my addiction to the chicken and wild rice soup served at my favorite fancy Italian sandwich shop - and I think this version is even better! It will make enough to feed the whole family, plus plenty for leftovers.
