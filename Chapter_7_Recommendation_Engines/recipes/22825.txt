Ingredients:
6 slices bacon
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
1 large potato, peeled and diced
2 cups clam juice
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
5 drops hot pepper sauce
2 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, drained
1 (6.5 ounce) can large shrimp, drained

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, place the vegetable oil, onion, carrots and celery. Slowly cook and stir 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Mix in the bacon, potato, clam juice, tomatoes, tomato sauce, white pepper, seasoning salt, parsley, marjoram, garlic powder, thyme, mustard, Cajun seasoning and hot pepper sauce. Reduce heat and simmer until the potato is tender, about 20 minutes.
Mix in the clams and shrimp. Cook approximately 5 minutes more and serve.
