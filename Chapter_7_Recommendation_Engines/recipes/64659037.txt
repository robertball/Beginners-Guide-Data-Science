Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/3 cup Honey
3/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup lime juice (or juice of 2 limes)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 2 minced garlic cloves)
1/4 cup sriracha sauce
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Other ingredients:
4 bone-in chicken thighs (~2lb worth)
3 tbsp unsalted butter, divided into 2 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp.
4-6 cloves garlic (peeled and minced)
Â½ red onion, chopped
4 small gold/red potatoes, cubed
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped (stem/seeds removed)
1 carton of cherry tomatoes, cut in half
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
juice of 1 fresh lime
12 oz fresh green beans (or one can, drained)
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tbsp honey
1 green jalapeno, diced/seeded (optional)
1/4 cup Sriracha
1-2 Green onion sprigs, sliced (to garnish)

Directions:
1. Combine ingredients for marinade and mix well. Place in re-sealable plastic bag with chicken thighs and let sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours, turning over half way through
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
3. place a large *oven-safe* skillet (or dutch oven) over medium-high heat; add 2 tablespoons of butter. When butter has melted, add the chicken (after draining/discarding the marinade) , skin side down, and sear until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. (This will melt out most of the fat underneath and will leave a nice crispy skin.) flip over and grill another couple of minutes. Then remove chicken and set aside.
4. Drain the extra fat and oil in the skillet, then add 1 tablespoon of butter. When butter has melted, add garlic and onion to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then mix in bell pepper, green beans, tomatoes, lime juice, potatoes, and sprinkle with salt & pepper, and cook for 5 minutes. Mix carefully while cooking.
5. Remove skillet from heat and return chicken to the skillet, skin side up. Mix Sriracha, jalapeno, honey and brown sugar together in a bowl until smooth, then pour primarily onto the chicken, and a bit onto the vegetables.
6. Place pan in oven and roast until completely cooked through, about 30-35 minutes. Garnish with chopped green onion and serve.

Description: 
This is a 1-skillet sriracha chicken dish.  I like the concept of 1-skillet dishes because it cuts down on time and the flavors seem to meld together well.  Make sure to use an oven safe skillet or pan (eg, no plastic parts.  I use cast iron).
