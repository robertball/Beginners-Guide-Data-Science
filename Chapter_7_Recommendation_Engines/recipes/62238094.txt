Ingredients:
1 c baby carrots
4 Irish red potatoes, cubed
1 lb-2 lb turkey ham
6 cloves of garlic
1/2 head cabbage, cut into 4-6 wedges
1-2 c low sodium chicken broth
12 pearl onions, peeled

Directions:
Place carrots and potatoes into slow cooker.  Place turkey ham, flat side down, on top of veggies.  Place the whole cloves of garlic into the pot and place the wedges of cabbage over the top of the ham.  Pour in broth until it is about 1/2 way up the pot.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  In the last 30 minutes of cooking, add the onions (this keeps the onions from getting too soggy and falling apart).
