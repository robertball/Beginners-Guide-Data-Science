Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix
FROSTING:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened

1 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
3 drops green food coloring
TOPPING:
1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened

Directions:
Prepare cake batter according to package directions. Pour into a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
In a bowl, combine the frosting ingredients until smooth. Spread over cooled cake.
For topping, in a microwave-safe bowl, melt chocolate chips and butter; stir in extract. Spread over frosting. Refrigerate until set.

Description: 
My husband works for a mint farmer, so I'm always looking for recipes with mint in them. I received this recipe at my bridal shower. My friend wrote 'Easy and pretty' on the top corner of the recipe card - and it's so true.
