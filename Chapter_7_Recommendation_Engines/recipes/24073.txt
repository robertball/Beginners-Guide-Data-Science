Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package HERSHEY速'S KISSES速 Milk Chocolates
1/3 cup whipping cream
2 teaspoons butter, softened
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 (10.75 ounce) loaf frozen loaf pound cake, partially thawed
1/2 cup whipping cream
10 HERSHEY速'S HUGS速 Chocolates

Directions:
Remove wrappers from chocolate pieces.  Combine 46 chocolate pieces and 1/3 cup whipping cream in small saucepan.  Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until smooth.  Remove from heat.  Stir in butter and vanilla until smooth; transfer to medium bowl.  Refrigerate until firm enough to spread, about 1 hour.
Slice cake horizontally to make 3 layers.  Arrange bottom layer on serving plate.  Evenly spread 1/3 cup KISSES filling over layer; top with second layer and spread with 1/3 cup filling.  Place remaining layer on top.  Beat 1/2 cup whipping cream until thickened; fold in remaining filling.  Refrigerate a few minutes if a more firm consistency is desired.  Frost top, sides and ends of torte.  Refrigerate about 6 hours.  Remove wrappers from remaining chocolates.  Garnish torte before serving.  Cover; refrigerate leftover torte.
