Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, very finely diced
1 large bell pepper, (any color) finely chopped
3 large cloves garlic, minced
16 oz. of diced tomatoes with juice (use the kind with the spices in)
4 cups chicken broth (or 2 cups water & 2 cups broth)
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup uncooked rice (if serving as soup)
9 oz. of creamy peanut butter
chopped roasted peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Cook onion, bell pepper, and garlic until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with their juice, vegetable broth, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
Add rice to soup and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 25 minutes, or until rice is tender.
When rice is cooked, whisk in peanut butter and return to a simmer, and serve. Garnish with chopped roasted peanuts, if desired.

Description: 
Tomatoes and peanut butter? YES! The first time I tried this at a health food restaurant, I was hooked. About 5 years of tweaking the recipe to my personal taste has created a spicy, sweet favorite amongst my friends and family. Luckily there is always enough for everyone!Modified from: West African Peanut Soup
