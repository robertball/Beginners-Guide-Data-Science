Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup white whole wheat flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 cups milk
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat.
Sift whole wheat flour and white whole wheat flour into a mixing bowl and add baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.
Combine milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until combined. Mix into flour mixture until evenly blended, being careful not to overmix, as having lumps in the mixture is okay.
Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
This is my family's favorite pancake recipe that I threw together one day. It's inspired by fall (my favorite season!), using spices found in pumpkin pie. Use of whole wheat flour is a wholesome twist! Feel free to add fresh berries before or after cooking the pancakes!
