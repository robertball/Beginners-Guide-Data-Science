Ingredients:
1/4 cup fresh rosemary
1/4 cup fresh mint
1/4 cup fresh thyme
Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt
Ground black pepper to taste
4 lamb chops (3/4 inch thick)
1 tablespoon Spectrum Organic Frantoio Olive Oil
1/4 cup minced shallots
1/3 cup aged balsamic vinegar
3/4 cup Imagine Organic Low Sodium Free Range Chicken Broth
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a small bowl or cup, mix together the rosemary, mint, thyme, Hain Pure Foods Iodized Sea Salt and pepper. Rub this mixture onto the lamb chops on both sides. Place them on a plate, cover and set aside for 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.
Heat Spectrum Organic Frantoio Olive Oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place lambs chops in the skillet, and cook for about 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium rare, or continue to cook to your desired doneness. Remove from the skillet, and keep warm on a serving platter.
Add shallots to the skillet, and cook for a few minutes, just until browned. Stir in vinegar, scraping any bits of lamb from the bottom of the skillet, then stir in the Imagine Organic Low Sodium Free Range Chicken Broth. Continue to cook and stir over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until the sauce has reduced by half. Note: If sauce is removed from heat too soon, it will be thin. Remove from heat, and stir in butter. Pour over the lamb chops and serve.
