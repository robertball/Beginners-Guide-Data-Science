Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package bacon, chopped, or to taste
1 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar
2 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 dash ground cinnamon, or to taste
2 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
Combine flour and sugar in a bowl. Mix in eggs. Mix in milk and water gradually. Stir in butter. Add vanilla.
Brush a pan with oil; bring to medium-low heat. Add a portion of batter; tilt pan to spread batter into an even, thin layer. Cook until bottom just begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is lightly browned, about 2 minutes more. Transfer crepe to a plate, separating finished crepes with sheets of parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining batter.
Place a crepe on a plate. Sprinkle a portion of bacon on top; drizzle with maple syrup. Continuing stacking as many crepes and toppings to your liking. Top the final layer with a sprinkling of cinnamon.
