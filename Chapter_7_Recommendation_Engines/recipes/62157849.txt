Ingredients:
1/2 pound American cheese or Velveeta, grated or chopped
1 can condensed Cream of Tomato soup
2 cups milk
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1 tablespoon sugar
Ritz crackers or toast

Directions:
Grate the cheese.  (If you're using Velveeta, just chop it up.  It's too soft to grate.)
Melt the butter in a saucepan, then stir in the flour.
Add the soup, milk and sugar to the saucepan.
Heat almost to a boil, then stir in the cheese.  Be careful not to let it boil.
A little onion and pinch of dried mustard can be added if you are making this for an adult, or a non-picky child.
Serve over crackers or toast.
