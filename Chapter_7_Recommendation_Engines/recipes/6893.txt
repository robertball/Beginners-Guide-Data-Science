1 cup white sugar
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

In a mixing bowl, beat eggs until frothy.  Beat in oil and sugar.  Blend in sour cream.  Add flour  mixture, and stir until combined.  Put 1/2 of the batter in the bottom of a greased 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the cinnamon mixture over batter.  Top with remaining batter by putting dabs here and there.  Sprinkle remaining cinnamon mixture over top.  Cut through batter with a knife to give a swirling, marbled effect.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour.  After loaf stands for 10 minutes, remove from pan to cool on rack.
