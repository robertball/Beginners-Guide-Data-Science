Ingredients:
1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed
1/2 cup minced garlic
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 gallons peanut oil for frying
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
12 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup chopped fresh ginger root

Directions:
Fill an outdoor deep-fryer with the peanut oil (see tip below), and heat to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). This will take about 30 minutes.
Rub the turkey with minced garlic, salt and pepper on the inside and outside. Fill the cavity with rosemary, garlic cloves and ginger. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to marinate.
Remove the herbs and garlic from the cavity of the bird, and discard. Make sure the opening at the neck of the turkey is at least 2 inches wide. Trim skin back if necessary. This will prevent pressure from building inside. If the turkey has a pop-up doneness indicator, it must be removed beforehand.
Place the turkey in the fryer basket, or hanging device, and slowly lower it into the hot oil. Be sure to maintain the temperature of the oil while it is frying. Cook for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature is at 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh.
Carefully remove the turkey from the hot oil, and turn off the deep-fryer. Let the bird cool for 5 minutes, then pat dry.

Description: 
This is one of the most flavorful and moist turkeys you will ever savor. Easy to prepare, a definite hit at parties, this is how Thanksgiving was meant to be enjoyed! I like to use about a 16-pound bird.
