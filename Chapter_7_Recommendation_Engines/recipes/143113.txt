Ingredients:
1/2 small onion, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
1/3 cup imitation sour cream
2 tablespoons cornmeal
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon hot sauce
1/4 cup cornmeal
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Cook the onions in 1 1/2 teaspoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until soft and translucent.
Pulse the garbanzo beans, imitation sour cream, cornmeal, garlic, cumin, coriander, salt, and hot sauce in a food processor until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the onions; cover and chill for 30 minutes.
Place 1/4 cup cornmeal in a shallow dish. Form the garbanzo bean dough into 6 patties, 1/2-inch thick; roll the cakes in cornmeal.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the falafel cakes until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.

For those of us meat-a-tarians at a loss for what to feed our vegan and vegetarian friends, this recipe works really well.  Serve the falafel cakes in pocket pita with fresh sliced vegetables and cucumber sauce or tahini. Even the meat eaters love this recipe!
