Ingredients:
1 pound ground meatloaf mix (beef, pork veal)
4 slices white bread
1/3 cup milk
1 egg, beaten
1 small onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup butter
2 cups water
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Directions:
Place meatloaf mix in a large mixing bowl; crumble bread over meat and knead with hands to combine. Add milk and egg to meat mixture. Knead onion, nutmeg, cloves, salt, and pepper into meat mixture until well-combined. Form mixture into six equal-sized balls.
Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir meatballs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir water, tomatoes, beef broth, and onion soup mix into Dutch oven; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until meatballs are tender and cooked through, about 1 hour.
