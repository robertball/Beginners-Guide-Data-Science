Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup butter or margarine, softened
2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, softened
1 3/4 cups white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
5 eggs
2 egg whites
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and softened butter until it is crumbly about pee sized granulars. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-in. springform pan. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Set oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 5 eggs and the whites and mix thoroughly. Add cream and mix only enough to blend.
Pour filling over crust  and bake for 10 minutes at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Reduce temperature  to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and continue to bake for one hour. Turn oven off, but leave cake in for another hour. Don't worry if it looks a little jiggly in the center.
Chill overnight. This is imperative! If desired, top with your favorite fruit or serve plain.
