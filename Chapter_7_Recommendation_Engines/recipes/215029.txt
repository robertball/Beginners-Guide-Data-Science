Ingredients:
2 pounds red potatoes
3/4 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onion
2 dill pickle spears, chopped, or more to taste

2 cloves garlic, minced
1 dash onion salt

Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Slice potatoes into a large bowl.
Combine mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt, onions, pickles, mustard, horseradish, celery seed, salt, pepper, garlic, onion salt, and garlic powder in a small bowl; mix until combined. Pour dressing over sliced potatoes and toss to coat. Gently stir in eggs.
Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.

Description: 
This potato salad is amazing ... it takes some time to make but is SO worth it. It gets its creaminess from sour cream, mayonnaise, and yogurt.
