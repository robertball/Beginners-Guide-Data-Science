https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
3 large yukon gold potatoes
Sufficient full-strength homemade chicken stock for pressure cooking, usually 2-3 cups
1-2 cloves garlic, very finely minced
2-3 TBSP Salted Butter, softened
3 TBSP Regular cream cheese, softened (optional)
Heavy Cream, if needed
Salt, if needed

Directions:
Slice potatoes 1/4 inch thick in rounds.  Place evenly in a steam basket inside pressure cooker.
Add sufficient chicken stock (usually 2-3 cups is sufficient) and secure lid.
Bring up to 15 pounds pressure and once this has been attained cook for 9-10 minutes.
After cooking time is up, use 'Quick release method' to relieve pressure, or place cooker in sink and run cold water on its lid until pressure is relieved, which usually happens within a few seconds.
Carefully remove sliced potatoes from steam basket and drain remaining stock.
Place butter and garlic in empty pressure cooker on medium heat and saute for 90 seconds.  Add potatoes back into cooker and mash, adding cream cheese and also a small amount of cream if necessary, but usually the cream is not required.  Serve.

Description: 
These potatoes are unlike any other!

The difference with these is that they are pressure-cooked with chicken stock, which gives the potatoes so much flavour, and sometimes eliminates the need for milk or cream and salt!

I made this recipe just yesterday for someone that doesn't like mashed potatoes, and they loved it!

One note, DO NOT USE ANYTHING BUT FRESH GARLIC.  I can't make myself any clearer...you will outright ruin this if you use anything else, especially the pre-chopped stuff in a jar.
