Ingredients:
2 ounces rice vermicelli
8 rice wrappers (8.5 inch diameter)
8 large cooked shrimp (peeled and cut in half)
1/2 cup cooked chicken
1 1/3 tablespoons chopped fresh Thai basil
3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 leaves lettuce, chopped
1/2 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup thinly sliced cucumber
1/2 lime
1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
sprinkle of water

Directions:
Bring a medium saucepan of water to boil. Boil rice vermicelli 3 to 5 minutes, or until al dente, and drain.
Fill a large bowl with warm water. Dip one wrapper into the hot water for 1 second to soften. Lay wrapper flat.
In a row across the center, place 2 shrimp halves, a handful of vermicelli, basil, mint, cilantro, lettuce, carrot and cucumber, leaving about 2 inches uncovered on each side. Squeeze lime over ingredients.
Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, mix peanut butter and hoisin sauce until warm and well blended.  Thin with water if required.
Serve sauce with spring rolls.
