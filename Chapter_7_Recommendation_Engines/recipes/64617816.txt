Ingredients:
2 cups crunchy peanut butter
½ cup (1 stick) butter, softened
3 - 4 cups powdered sugar  Coupons
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups crispy rice cereal
16 oz chocolate candy coating (CandiQuik)
¼ cup roughly chopped salted peanuts (optional)

Directions:
Combine peanut butter and butter together in a large mixing bowl and mix until well combined.
Stir in vanilla extract.
Gradually add in the powdered sugar, half a cup at a time until mixture is nice and smooth and you can easily form balls.
Stir in crispy rice cereal.
Shape into 1 inch balls and refrigerate for 30 minutes on a waxed paper lined baking sheet. (You can also freeze for 20 minutes.)
Melt candy coating following melting directions on package.
Dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate using a toothpick or dipping tools (I use these.)
Transfer to wax paper and sprinkle chopped peanuts on top immediately.
Let candy stand until the chocolate is firm.
Store in an airtight container.
