Ingredients:
1 lb skirt steak, thinly sliced against the grain
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 teaspoons canola oil, divided
1/2 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 2-3 cloves)
2 scallions, thinly sliced

Directions:
Pat the steak dry then add to a resealable plastic bag. Add the cornstarch to the bag and toss to coat all of the steak evenly. Transfer the steak to a fine mesh strainer and shake off any excess cornstarch. Whisk the water, soy sauce, brown sugar and red pepper flakes together in a medium bowl to make the sauce and set aside.
Set a large wok or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the oil. When hot, add the ginger and garlic, stirring just until fragrant, about 15-30 seconds. Add the sauce to the pan and cook for 2 minutes (it won't thicken up yet, so no worries if yours is thin). Transfer to a bowl.
Increase the heat to high, and add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Add the beef and cook until browned on all sides (this will happen quickly - just a few minutes). Add the sauce back to the pan with the beef and continue cooking until the sauce reaches your desired consistency - the longer you cook it, the thicker it will become. Add the scallions to the pan, stir to incorporate then remove the pan from the heat. Serve the beef over rice and garnish with extra scallions, if desired.
