Ingredients:
BREAD:
1 loaf french baguette, sliced on the bias
1/4 cup olive oil
3 t minced garlic
PESTO:
1 small jar pesto (or homemade ... I can't get it right)
TOMATO TOPPING:
2 roma tomatoes, chopped
1/4 red onion, minced (more or less to your taste)
splash of olive oil
1 t basil (more or less to your taste)
Feta cheese, crumbled
GARLIC BALSAMIC VINAGARETTE:
2 cloves of garlic
1/4 t salt
1 T minced shallot
2 T balsamic vinegar
1/4 c olive oil
*optional:  1/8 t honey if wanting sweeter taste

Directions:
1) Make vinagarette, if planning to serve with bread and let sit***** see instructions below
2) Make tomato topping by combining tomatoes, olive oil, basil, and red onion in small bowl.
3) Saute garlic in 1/4 cup olive oil, for just a minute or so - enough to infuse oil with garlic (don't burn!)
4) Brush infused oil onto 1 side of baguette slices - you may sprinkle with additional garlic powder/salt/granuals if desired
5) Grill (brushed side down) on hot griddle or grillsheet until nicely browned
6) Take browned garlic bread sices, and a) spread with a thin layer of pesto, then b) a spoonful of tomato topping, and c) finish with crumbled feta cheese.
*******Vinagarette Instructions********
Mince garlic and mash to a paste with salt.
In a bowl whisk together garlic paste, shallot, and vinegar and add oil in a stream, whisking until emulsified.

Description: 
I was drug kicking and screaming to The #1 Pizza Place in Tulsa - a little hole in the wall named The Hideaway - I quickly shut my yap and gobbled down their lovely Pesto Bruschetta (followed by an incredible deep dish pizza that truly warranted their claim to fame).  This is simply a copykat recipe I made up.
