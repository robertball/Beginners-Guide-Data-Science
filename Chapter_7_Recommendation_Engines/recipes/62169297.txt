Ingredients:
Pastry for a 9" double pie crust
1 1/2 lbs ground pork
1 tbsp fennel seed (or to taste)
1 tbsp hot pepper flakes (optional, or to taste)
1 tsp salt
5 eggs
1 1/2 cups grated Asiago cheese
1/2 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Brown the pork in a skillet over medium heat with the fennel, hot pepper flakes, and salt.
Cool, then mix with the eggs, cheese and bread crumbs.
Line your pie plate with the pastry and fill with meat mixture. Place top crust over filling, be sure to cut steam vents into the pastry.
Bake in the 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 and continue baking for 20-30 minutes, until pastry is browned and filling is bubbling a bit.
Cool a bit, serve immediately, or chill and serve later.

Description: 
This pie appears every Christmas at my family's gatherings, and has for several generations.  It is very dense, rich, and oh, so good!  Cut the finished pie into one inch pieces to serve as an appetizer, rather than an entree.  Substitute Sharp Cheddar for the Asiago if you prefer, and try an 8-inch square pan instead of a pie plate.  Good cold or warm.
