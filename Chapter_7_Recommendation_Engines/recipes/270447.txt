Ingredients:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup shortening (such as Crisco®)
1 cup powdered sugar
4 teaspoons maraschino cherry juice
4 drops red food coloring
3/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon cherry flavoring (such as Wilton®)
3/4 cup drained, chopped maraschino cherries
48 milk chocolate kisses (such as HERSHEY'S), or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Whisk flour and salt together in a small bowl.
Combine shortening, powdered sugar, cherry juice, red food coloring, and cherry flavoring in a large bowl. Add flour mixture and mix well. Stir in maraschino cherries.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls; arrange 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are light golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately top each cookie with a chocolate kiss, pressing firmly. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely.

My grandma loved chocolate-covered cherries, so I combined 2 recipes to come up with these yummy cookies. She loved that I made a special cookie just for her. These are also Jessie's favorite cookie.
