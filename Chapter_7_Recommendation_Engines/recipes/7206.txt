Ingredients:
2/3 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 cups self-rising flour

Directions:
In a large bowl mix together the buttermilk, oil, and mayonnaise. Gradually stir in the flour and mix until all ingredients are combined.
Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. If dough is sticky knead in a little extra flour. Pat the dough out to about a 1/2-inch thickness. Use a biscuit cutter to cut dough into pieces. Place into an oiled cast iron skillet. Allow biscuits to rest in the pan for 10 minutes.
Bake in a preheated 425 degree F (220 degrees C) until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.
