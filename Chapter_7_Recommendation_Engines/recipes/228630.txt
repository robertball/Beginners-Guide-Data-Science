Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) whole pork tenderloin
1 (24 ounce) bag baby potatoes, unpeeled (optional)
1 (20 ounce) can sauerkraut, undrained
1 cup water
1/4 cup butter, cubed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place whole pork tenderloin into a slow cooker. Arrange potatoes around the pork; pour the sauerkraut and juice over the pork and potatoes. Add butter cubes, salt, and black pepper. Cook on Low until pork is tender, 8 to 10 hours. Add more water after 8 hours if mixture seems dry.

Description: 
Super-easy slow cooked pork tenderloin with sauerkraut and potatoes. Use a slow cooker liner for effortless cleanup. This is also good served with mashed potatoes if you don't want to use the whole baby ones. 

I usually double the recipe as the leftovers are even better the next day.
