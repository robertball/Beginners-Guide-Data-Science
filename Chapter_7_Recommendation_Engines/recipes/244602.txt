Ingredients:
3/4 cup coconut milk
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon hot sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 (4 ounce) fillets swai fish, cut into 3-inch pieces
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water

Directions:
Mix coconut milk, garlic, soy sauce, salt, hot sauce, and black pepper together in a large skillet or wok; add swai fish. Cook over medium-high heat until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes.
Stir cornstarch and cold water together in a bowl; mix into fish mixture and cook until sauce is thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.

Description: 
Basa is a mild white fish. This recipe is very quick to make. I serve it with a side of coconut rice to use up the rest of the coconut milk in the can and the fish is done before the rice finishes cooking.
