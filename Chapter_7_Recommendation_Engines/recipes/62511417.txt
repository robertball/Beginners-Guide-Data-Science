Ingredients:
1 2 Lb Pork Roast
1 750 ML bottle of Captain Morgans Spiced Rum
1 Can of Pineapple Circles.  (You can dice your own too.  We didn't)
1 Can of crushed Pineapples
1 Whole Orange
1 Jar of Maraschino cherries
2-4 "Pinches" of Brown Sugar

Directions:
Defrost your Roast first. (To whatever point you want.)
Put in a can of diced Pineapple into the bottom of the crock pot.  Spread them evenly to make sure that the entire bottom part of the crock pot is covered.
Put the roast in to the crock pot.
Take out a fork and stab the roast as many times as you like. BUT... Not all the way through the roast.
Sprinkle the Brown sugar over the top of the roast first.  Now, Take a shot glass and fill it up with the spiced rum, spread it over the top of the roast. (Do this three times.)
Cover roast with 3-4 Pineapple Circles.  Put a Maraschino cherry in the center of each Pineapple circle.
Take your orange and slice it however you like to slice oranges.  Put the pieces so that they surround the actual roast.  Put a few on top of the roast too.
Turn on the crock pot to low, let it cook 6-8 hours.  Flip it over two hours in to the cooking, and then again at the five hour mark.  The 6-8 hour cooking period is totally up to you, we cooked this roast originally for 7 hours.
