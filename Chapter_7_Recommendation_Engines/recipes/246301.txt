Ingredients:
8 fresh morel mushrooms
butter-flavored cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon finely chopped red bell pepper
1 tablespoon thinly sliced green onion, including green part
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (6 ounce) can lump crabmeat
1 egg
2 tablespoons finely chopped celery leaves
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
4 dashes hot sauce, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place mushrooms in a large bowl of salted water. Soak until clean and soft, 8 hours to overnight.
Drain mushrooms, rinse well, and set out to dry on a clean towel.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Chop mushroom stems finely. Cut mushroom caps in half lengthwise; place cut-side up in a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add chopped mushroom stems, red bell pepper, and green onion; cook and stir until green onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; allow to cool, about 10 minutes.
Mix cream cheese, crabmeat, egg, celery leaves, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and sea salt together in a large bowl. Fold in cooled onion mixture. Place a dollop of filling in each mushroom cap with a small spoon.
Mix bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a small bowl. Sprinkle on top of filled mushroom caps.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
