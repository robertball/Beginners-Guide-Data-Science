Ingredients:
1 - 6 ounce can of organic tomato paste
1/2 cup room temperature water
1 Tb. organic olive oil
1 tsp. organic oregano
1 tsp. organic basil
1/2 tsp. organic thyme
1/2 tsp. organic fennel seeds, crushed
1/2 tsp. sea salt
1/2 tsp. organic garlic powder

1/2 tsp. organic freshly ground black pepper (finely ground)
1/2 tsp organic crushed red pepper flakes (use less if you like it less spicy, or omit completely)

Directions:
Empty the contents of the 6 ounce can of tomato paste into a small mixing bowl.  Add the 1/2 cup of room temperature water, olive oil, oregano, basil, thyme, crushed fennel seeds, sea salt, garlic powder, onion powder, finely ground black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes.  You can use less crushed red pepper flakes or omit them completely if you do not like spicy foods.

Description: 
The easiest pizza sauce recipe on Earth with the tastiest results!  You don't even have to cook this easy one minute pizza sauce.  It is ready to use right away, or you can store in in the fridge for up to one week.  It also freezes wonderfully to use at a later date.  

I prefer to use only organic ingredients, but you can use conventional ingredients if that is what you have on hand.  You can check out the video on YouTube at:  https://youtu.be/dfIiRFEGYLk

It is really that easy!

This recipe yields enough sauce for two 14-inch round pizzas, about 8 ounces total.
