Ingredients:
To make light brown sugar
4 cups granulated sugar
1/4 cup unsulfured molasses
-----------------------------------------
To make dark brown sugar:
4 cups granulated sugar
1/2 to 2/3 cup unsulfured  molasses

Directions:
Place white sugar in bowl of mixer.  Whisk for a few minutes to break up any clumps.
Add desired amount of molasses.
Mix for several minutes until completely blended.
Store in an airtight container.
*NOTE* Freshly made brown sugar can smell very strong.  I prefer to let mine sit a few days before using it.  The flavor also blooms a bit more after a few days.
