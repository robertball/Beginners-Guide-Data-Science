Description: 
All the flavors you love in crack slaw are here in a tidy cabbage wrap! Using ground beef, some Asian flavors, and toppings, create a tasty lunch that each person can customize. Don't want any heat? Leave out the Sriracha. Want more heat? Add some crushed red pepper. Can't stand cilantro? Use fresh parsley, instead. Make these the way you like them. Serve with additional coconut aminos or soy sauce, if desired.
