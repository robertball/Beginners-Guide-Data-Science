Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced
2 chicken breasts, diced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
1 cup mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chicken, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
Drain pasta. Add Alfredo sauce to the chicken; bring to a simmer. Stir in mozzarella cheese and cook until melted and well combined. Stir in pasta.
