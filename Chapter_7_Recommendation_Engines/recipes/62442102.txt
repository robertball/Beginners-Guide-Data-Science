Ingredients:
4 Large garden tomatoes or 6 Medium Garden tomatoes
1/2 Tbsp. minced garlic
1 small onion (diced)
2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 Tbsp. Lemon juice (per pint)
1 tsp. salt (per pint)
1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper
1/4 tsp. thyme
1/4 tsp. oregano
1/4 tsp. basil
Makes 2 pints - will need 2 canning jars with secure lids & rings and the "Ball" Discovery Canning Kit is recommended.

Directions:
Rinse your fresh tomatoes in cold water. Remove the core of each tomatoe and make an X with a knife on one side of the tomatoe.
Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. When boiling, place your 4 large tomatoes in the water for approx. 1 minute then remove and place in a bowl filled with cold water. (This is called blanching)
Remove the skin from the tomatoes (it will just peel away easily.) Chop tomatoes into small sections, remove the inner core and discard.
In a saucepan heat 2 Tbsp. olive oil, add onions and minced garlic and sautee for 2 minutes.
Then add the chopped tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Use a spatula to press down on the tomatoes to soften them for canning. After 4 minutes add Pepper, thyme,oregano, and basil.Simmer for 1 more minute.
**Prepare your jars by washing them in hot water - keep your jars warm until your ready to add the tomatoe mixture - this will prevent the jar from cracking from extreme temperature change**
While your tomatoes are simmering get a large kettle and fill 3/4 with water and begin to boil.
Pat dry jars and add 1 Tbsp. Lemon juice and 1 tsp. salt to each pint.
Gently and carefully fill your tomato mixture into your 2 pint jars. Making sure to leave 1/2" between your mix & the jar lid (this is called head space). Place seal lid and ring on jars snuggly - but do not over-tighten.
Place both pint jars into the "Ball Discovery Canning Kit" Basket and place into boiling kettle for 40 minutes.
Remove basket by handle after 5 minutes and place each jar on a kitchen towel to cool.
DO NOT TOUCH THE JARS WITH YOUR BARE HANDS -YOU WILL GET BURNED.
Allow the jars to sit in place for 24 hours to completely seal and cool.
The jars are completely sealed when you press the middle section of the jar and it does not flex inward.
