Ingredients:
Filling:
1 1/2 lbs ground beef
2 large onions, finely chopped
1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
3 med carrots, shredded
1 1/2 c mild cheddar cheese, shredded
4 eggs
Salt & Pepper, approx 1 1/2 t salt
Wei-Chun Thin Spring Roll Wrappers, 3 pkgs of 25 each
LaChoy Sweet & Sour Sauce

Directions:
Combine & mix well (with hands) all filling ingredients & set aside in the refrigerator until ready to wrap.
Make sure the spring roll wrappers are completely thawed before using, otherwise you will have a difficult time separating them.  Place about 1 Â½-2 teaspoons of the filling on the wrapper & roll tightly.
Suggestions: Do not use food processor to chop the onions or green onions as it will make the filling watery.  If you want spicier lumpias, add more pepper and green onions.
The lumpias can be frozen up to 3 months, raw.
Cooking:  Thaw completely, if frozen.  Heat enough cooking oil at medium heat to completely submerge lumpias.  Fry about 15 minutes until golden brown.  Move lumpias around while frying to avoid sticking together.  Place on paper towels to drain.
