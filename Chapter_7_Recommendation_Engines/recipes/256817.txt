Ingredients:
1/2 pound raw shrimp - peeled, deveined, and cut into small pieces
1/2 pound albacore tuna, cut into small pieces
3/4 cup lemon juice, divided
3/4 cup lime juice, divided
1 mango, peeled and diced
3/4 cup pale ale (such as Going to the Sun IPA)
1 tomato, diced
1/2 yellow onion, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1 teaspoon mango hot sauce
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
2 strips bacon, chopped
1 head napa cabbage, leaves separated
1 head radicchio, leaves separated

Directions:
Combine shrimp and albacore tuna in a small bowl; cover with 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 lime juice. Cure in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Combine remaining lemon juice and lime juice, mango, pale ale, tomato, yellow onion, jalapeno pepper, mango hot sauce, and sriracha sauce in a bowl. Refrigerate until flavors combine, at least 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Spread bacon pieces on the lined baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 20 to 30 minutes.
Drain shrimp and tuna; toss with mango mixture to combine. Divide mixture among napa cabbage and radicchio leaves. Sprinkle bacon on top.

Description: 
The temperatures keep creeping up as winter gives way to spring and eventually summer. With these sun-filled days, lighter fare for dinner is more in order. Ceviche, fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, meets the requirements for a great summer dish: quick, fresh, cooling. 
This particular recipe features the Going to the Sun IPA from the Great Northern Brewing of Whitefish, Montana.
