Description: 
This experiment in flavor is definitely worth writing down and sharing!  On an,  I'm hungry, no plans to cook, mid morning, what's in the pantry, kinda day,  I discovered this one.  I love it, pretty sure you will too.  Remember, as good as it is just after making, it's always going to be better in a few hours :)
