Ingredients:
2 ripe Roma Tomatoes
1/2 medium onion
1 medium jalapeno, minced
1 c white basmati rice
2 T olive oil
2 minced garlic cloves
1 c chicken broth
1/2 16 oz bag of frozen mixed vegetables (beans, corn, carrots)
1 T tomato paste
3/4 t salt
1/2 c minced cilantro
1/2 lime, juiced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer under cold water until water runs clear, about 90 seconds.  Shake vigorously to remove water and set aside to drain while you continue on.
Rough chop tomatoes and onion and process in a food processor until smooth.  You should have about 1 cup.  If not, add salsa or tomato juice until you have 1 cup.
Heat olive oil in heavy fry pan until hot.  Add rice taking care not to drip any water in as it will sizzle and pop.  Stir until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and add garlic and minced jalapeno.  Cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 1/2 min.
Stir in broth, pureed tomatoes and onions, tomato paste, mixed veggies and salt.  Increase heat to medium high and bring to a boil.
Transfer mixture to oven proof casserole dish with lid.  Cover tightly and place in preheated oven until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, approximately 30 minutes.  Stir after 15 minutes.
Stir in cilantro and drizzle with lime juice.

Description: 
My husband insisted that the rice from his favorite Mexican restaurant was yellow rice and really wanted to be able to duplicate it at home.  This is my attempt.
