Ingredients:
1 kg whiting fillet
1 cup of flour
1/2 stick of butter
1 tbsp oil
1 tbsp of capers
2 tsp of finely chopped garlic
1 lemon
salt (to taste)
black pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Season the whiting fillets with salt, pepper and the juice of half the lemon. In a large sauté pan, put the oil and half the butter over medium heat. Put the flour in a plate and keep it, along with the whiting, next to your sauté pan. While butter is melting, take the fillets and dredge them lightly in flour. When butter is bubbling, add the fillets, being careful not to crowd the pan - it´s better to work in batches. Cook until golden on both sides.
After all fillets are cooked and in a separate dish, turn up the heat under the sauté pan a little and add the remaining butter. Cook until butter is starting to brown, then add the garlic and right after turn off the heat, then add capers and the juice of the other half lemon. Pour this sauce on the cooked fillets and serve immediatly.

Description: 
Meuniere is a classic that can´t go wrong. Traditionaly it is done with sole, but I used whiting with impressive results, and so decided to spread the joy. ;-)
