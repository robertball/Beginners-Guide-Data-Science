Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons baking powder
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Measure flour, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl.  Stir to mix.  Pour melted butter and water over flour mixture.  Stir with fork to make a ball.
Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead gently about 10 times.  Pat into a flat circle 3/4 to 1 inch thick.
Cook in a greased frying pan over medium heat, allowing about 15 minutes for each side.  Use two lifters for easy turning.  May also be baked on a greased baking sheet at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes.
