Ingredients:
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 (2 pound) beef flank steak
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
2 tablespoons butter, softened

Directions:
If grilling, heat gas grill, igniting all burners on high for at least 10 minutes. If broiling, adjust oven rack to highest position and heat broiler.
Mix salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders and cayenne in a small bowl. Rub steak with oil; coat both sides of the meat with the spice mixture.
If broiling, place steak on a broiler pan or wire rack set over a shallow pan; broil, turning once, until well browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium. If grilling, place steak on hot grill rack; cover and cook, turning once, until grill marks form, 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare or to desired doneness. Remove and let rest 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix blue cheese and butter in a small bowl. Slice meat thinly against the grain and place on each serving plate. Smear with butter, and serve immediately.
