Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups heavy cream
2/3 cup milk
1 to 2 cinnamon sticks
1/3 cup sugar
4 large egg yolks, room temperature
Pinch of salt
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine cream, milk, and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and let steep for 1 hour. Remove cinnamon sticks, and discard. Add half of the sugar, and stir to combine.
2. Prepare an ice-water bath. In a large bowl, combine the remaining sugar, egg yolks, and salt in a large bowl. Stir to combine. Return cream to a boil and, very quickly, pour it into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Set aside for 3 minutes. Add vanilla and strain through a fine sieve. Discard solids. Place bowl in the ice-water bath to cool mixture completely, stirring occasionally, 20 to 30 minutes. Will keep, refrigerated, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days
