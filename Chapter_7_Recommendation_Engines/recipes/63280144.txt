Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
oil for frying as needed

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Stir in milk, and mix until the dough comes together.
Add more flour if necessary to be able to handle the dough.
On a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth, at least 5 minutes.
Let the dough rest for 5 minutes.
Heat oil in a large, deep heavy skillet to 400 degrees F.
Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.
Break off 3/4 cup sized pieces of dough, and shape into round discs 1/4 inch in thickness, making a thinner depressed area in the center.
Fry dough in the hot oil until golden on both sides, turning only once.
Drain on paper towels.
