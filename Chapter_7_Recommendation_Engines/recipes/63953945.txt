Ingredients:
1/8 cup Green Puree (2 tbsp.)
2 tbsp. tomato paste
1 tsp. salt
1/4 c. wheat germ
1 large egg, beaten
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil, for browning meatballs

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the Green Puree and tomato paste, mixing well (with the back of a fork) until the green color turns brownish.  Mix in salt, wheat germ and egg, and finally add the ground meat and mix with hands until well combined.  Using damp hands, pinch off about 2 teaspoons of meat and gently shape mixture into mini meatballs.
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large (10-12 inch) nonstick skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking.  Add meatballs in four batches to avoid overcrowding.  Allow to brown on all sides for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally.  Reduce heat to low and cook through for another 10 minutes.  Transfer to a plate and add more oil as needed for the next batch.
Alternatively bake meatballs in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes, flip and return to over for another 10 minutes.
