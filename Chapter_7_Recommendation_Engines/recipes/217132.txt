Ingredients:
1 small onion, very thinly sliced
3 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 large cloves garlic, very thinly sliced
2 cups dry red wine
2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons dried thyme
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons tomato paste (optional)

Directions:
Place half the sliced onions into the bottom of a slow cooker. Season the roast on all sides with 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and lay the roast on top of the onions. Place the remaining onions and garlic on top of the roast.
In a large bowl, mix the red wine, diced tomatoes, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, rosemary, oregano, basil, thyme, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper; pour the wine mixture over the roast. Cover the slow cooker, set the cooker to Low, and cook until tender, 8 to 10 hours.
If desired, thicken the sauce at the end of cooking by whisking tomato paste with pan juices until thoroughly combined. Set the cooker on High heat, and cook an additional 10 minutes.
