Ingredients:
1 lime, cut in wedges
1 large Granny Smith apple, coarsely grated
2 cups coleslaw mix
1/2 cup finely chopped jicama
2 green onions, diced into 1/4-inch pieces
1/4 cup shredded carrot
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper

Directions:
Squeeze 2 lime wedges over apple pieces to prevent browning. Toss in a bowl to coat. Add coleslaw mix, jicama, green onions, carrot, cilantro, and jalapeno pepper. Stir in olive oil, rice wine vinegar, and remaining lime juice; add sugar, salt, and black pepper. Toss to mix. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Toss before serving.

Description: 
I love coleslaw but I don't love the fat and calories from mayonnaise. This slaw is light, fresh, and the perfect topping for fish or shrimp tacos, or it can hold its own as a side dish. Every time I make it I'm asked for the recipe! The Granny Smith apple is the key ingredient that sets this apart from other slaws of this type.
