Ingredients:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1 (16 ounce) bottle Newman's Own Lighten Up Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
2 tablespoons fresh herbs
6 cups baby spinach, washed, stems removed
1/2 cup raspberries, washed
1 ounce feta, crumbled
1/4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place chicken in oven-safe baking dish. Tenderize chicken slightly with mallet or fork. Whisk together Newman's Own Lighten Up Low Fat Sesame Ginger Dressing, spices, and herbs. Pour over chicken breasts, turning breasts a couple of times. Breasts do not need to be submerged in dressing, but the dressing should fully cover the bottom of baking dish. Bake chicken 45 minutes.
Dry spinach leaves in a salad spinner or between two clean dish towels. Combine with raspberries, feta, and nuts in large bowl; toss to mix.
Once chicken breasts are fully cooked, remove from oven and rest 3 to 5 minutes. Add small amount of Newman's Own dressing to the salad and toss. Slice chicken into strips and serve over salad.
