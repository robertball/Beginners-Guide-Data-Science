Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunks
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 large fresh jalapeno peppers, stems removed
1/4 cup sliced onion
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 (6 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 (12 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Add the pork to skillet and stir to coat with oil. Place the jalapeno peppers into the pan and cover; allow to simmer 20 minutes. Uncover and remove the jalapenos from the pan; chop roughly and set aside. Continue cooking the pork, uncovered, until it browns completely and the liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.
Mix in the onion and garlic; cook and stir about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook 1 minute more. Pour the tomatoes and chopped jalapenos into the pan and stir through the pork. Season with the cumin. Stir, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer another 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is a spicy pork dish with much flavor that goes really well with Mexican fideo (vermicelli pasta) or white rice. Add more or less jalapenos to suit your taste.
