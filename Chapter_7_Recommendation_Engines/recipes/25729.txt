Ingredients:
2 quarts chicken broth
4 heads broccoli, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2  carrots, chopped
1  bay leaf
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese, cubed
1 pint half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, combine broth, broccoli, onion, carrots and bay leaf.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender.  Remove bay leaf.  (At this point, you may remove the broccoli stalks, carrots and onion and puree in a food processor, then return them to the pot, if desired.)
Stir in the cheese until melted.  Adjust seasonings.  Stir in half-and-half and heat through.

Description: 
It's creamy, it's cheesy and it's good.  You can add chicken if you like.  I season the broth with garlic powder, pepper, sugar and salt.
