Ingredients:
1 serving cooking spray with flour
1 (18.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix (such as Duncan HinesÂ® Lemon Supreme)
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 (3 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix
1 tablespoon lemon extract
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
8 ounces candied red cherries, halved
8 ounces candied pineapple slices, cut into thirds
1 1/2 cups chopped pecans
1 cup sweetened dried cranberries

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch fluted tube pan, such as a Bundt(R), with cooking spray.
Mix the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, lemon pudding mix, lemon extract, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until smooth, and stir in candied cherries, pineapple, pecans, and dried cranberries. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 20 minutes before turning it out onto a cake plate to finish cooling. Store in a covered container to help retain moisture.

Description: 
This is a fruit cake for people who do not normally like fruit cake.  If you happen to already like fruit cake, you will love this.  Honestly, it is the best fruit cake I have ever tasted.  It was handed down to me by a dear old lady who has now gone home to be with the Lord.
