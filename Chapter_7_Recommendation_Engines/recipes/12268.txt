Ingredients:
1 cup golden raisins
4 egg yolks
1 egg
2 cups sour cream
1/2 cup real maple syrup
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 recipe pastry for a (10 inch) single crust pie
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F ( 190 degrees C).
Roll out the pastry for the shell, and fit into a 10 inch pan.  Sprinkle the raisins over the bottom of the crust.
Combine the egg yolks, egg, sour cream, syrup, sugar, nutmeg, vanilla, and flour in a bowl.  Mix just until blended, not too much.  Pour filling into the shell.  Sprinkle a little more nutmeg on top.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool, and then chill the pie.

Description: 
This is a very old pie commonly found in the Midwest. Although most recipes call for dark raisins, this one uses sultanas ( golden raisins).  Use real maple syrup for the right consistency ( Grade B if you can get it). Best to use sour cream that is not low fat or fat free.
