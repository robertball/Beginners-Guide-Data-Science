Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 link Spanish chorizo
1 onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup uncooked rice
4 cups chicken stock
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TELÂ®)
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Spanish paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook chorizo, stirring gently, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add rice. Cook, mixing occasionally, until coated in oil, 2 to 4 minutes.
Pour chicken stock into the rice mixture; bring to a boil. Add diced tomatoes with peppers, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Cover and reduce heat to medium. Cook until rice is tender, about 15 minutes, adding more water if needed. Add the cooked chorizo and black beans; cook and stir until heated through, 4 to 6 minutes more.

Description: 
This is a great one-pot dish. Don't know if it has a heritage, but I like it. I am a huge fan of Spanish chorizo and this is a great quick dish. I like it; if you don't, let me know how you change it!
