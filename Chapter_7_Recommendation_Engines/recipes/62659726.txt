**If you substitute the type of cheese, while I am sure it would still be good, I don't think you will get the WOW factor taste that the gruyere cheese offers this soup.**

Directions:
Chop and rinse broccoli florets, grate carrot and set aside.
Chop onion, garlic and celery and put in large pot, saute with 2 tbsp butter on medium heat until onions are starting to brown.
Add chicken broth, broccoli and carrots along with 1 tsp basil, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally for 25 minutes or until broccoli is soft
In a seperate pot, melt 1/4 cup butter and wisk in 1/4 cup flour making a roux.  Add milk and cream, and cook over med heat stirring frequently until thick and smooth.  Add salt and pepper, celery salt and cheese. Stir until all the cheese is melted and mixture is smooth.
Add cream and cheese mixture to broccoli mixture and blend.  Mix with a hand mixer, or blend to puree depending on your preferance.
Simmer on low for 30 minutes to allow the flavors to distribute, ENJOY!!
