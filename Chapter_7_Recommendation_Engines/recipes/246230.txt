Ingredients:
8 turkey wings, tips discarded
2 tablespoons salt-free seasoning blend (such as Bell'sÂ®)
2 teaspoons paprika
1 teaspoon celery salt
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 large onion, coarsely chopped
4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Pat turkey wings dry with paper towels; cut into 3 or 4 pieces. Mix seasoning blend, paprika, celery salt, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Coat wing pieces lightly with seasoning mixture. Place wing pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish; spread onion and garlic over wings. Cover with aluminum foil.
Place baking dish in center of preheated oven; bake until wings are easily pierced with a fork, about 2 1/2 hours. Raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); remove aluminum foil. Bake until wings are well-browned, 15 to 20 minutes more.
