Sourdough Oatmeal Bread Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups sourdough starter
3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups rolled oats (either old-fashioned or quick)
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp salt
3 Tbsp honey
1 - 1 1/4 cups lukewarm milk

Directions:
1. Combine until a soft, loose dough forms. Cover and let sit 30 minutes.
2. Knead dough 5 - 10 minutes or until dough is smooth. The dough will still be quite wet. That's ok if you are using a stand mixer. If you are kneading by hand you may need to add a little more flour to keep the dough from sticking. Just add as little as possible so the dough stays soft and loose.
3. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours. Sourdough mixtures don’t rise as high as traditional straight dough breads. The mixture will be a bit puffy, but you probably won’t see a doubling of the dough.
Shape dough into 2 loaves and place in greased loaf pans. Cover and let rise for an additional 1 - 1 1/2 hours.
4. If you are using a regular 9 x 5 inch loaf pans, bake the bread at 375º degrees for 50 - 55 minutes or until the interior reaches 200 degrees. (I use my trusty digital thermometer for this.) If you are using a single unglazed terra cotta pan (like I do, shown above) follow the manufacturer’s directions. For example, I soak my pan in water for 15 minutes and then place the bread in a cold oven, set the temperature to 475º degrees and bake for about 50 minutes.
5. When done, remove from pan and let cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before cutting. This resting period is important to let the crumb set and leads you slice the bread evenly.
