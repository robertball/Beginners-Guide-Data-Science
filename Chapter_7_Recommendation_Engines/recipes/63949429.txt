Ingredients:
1/2 pound prosciutto, sliced
1/2 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
12 spears fresh asparagus, trimmed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Put the prosciutto in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes to make it easier to spread the cheese.
Spread prosciutto slices with Neufchatel cheese. Wrap slices around 2 or 3 asparagus spears. Arrange wrapped spears in a single layer on a medium baking sheet.
Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until asparagus is tender.
