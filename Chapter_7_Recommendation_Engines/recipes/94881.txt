Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/4 cup butter, softened
12 slices ciabatta bread
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon paprika
24 slices roma (plum) tomatoes
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
For the hummus, place the drained garbanzos, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and olive oil in a food processor. Process until blended, about 1 minute. Refrigerate overnight. Bring to room temperature before making the bruschetta.
Spread a teaspoon of butter on each slice of ciabatta; sprinkle with a teaspoon of Parmesan cheese. Place under broiler until slices are golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from oven and spread with a generous tablespoon of hummus. Sprinkle with a dusting of paprika.
To serve, top with tomato slices, feta cheese, and a sprinkle of the oregano and garlic powder.
