Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
6 stalks chopped celery
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 onion, chopped
1/2 pound cubed cooked ham (not deli meat)
1/2 pound cubed chicken (uncooked)
1/2 pound cubed sausage (uncooked)
28 oz can crushed tomatoes, with liquid
2 cups beef broth
2 cups chicken broth
1 Teaspoon salt
1 Teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon dried thyme
2 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
2 cups uncooked white rice
1/2 pound of preferred size shrimp

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Add bacon, and cook until VERY crisp but not burned.
Remove bacon pieces with a slotted spoon, and set aside.
Throw in the chicken and sausage remaining on med-high heat and stir in the Salt, Pepper, Thyme and Cajun seasoning
Once meat has mostly browned adjust the heat to medium and toss in the celery, bell pepper, and onion into the mix and cook until tender.
Add the ham, and pour in the tomatoes, beef broth and chicken broth.  Bring to a boil, and add the rice. Bring to a boil again, then turn the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the rice is tender.
Side note: If you want to cook uncovered to concentrate the flavors (the way I do it) add 1 cup of beef or chicken broth. If you find your rice is not quite done and liquid seems to be lacking, add 1/2 a cup of broth at a time till tender rice is achieved.
Stir in the shrimp and bacon just before serving, and heat through. If you use uncooked shrimp, let it cook for about 5 minutes before serving.
