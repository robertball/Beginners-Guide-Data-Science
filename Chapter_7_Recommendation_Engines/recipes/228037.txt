Ingredients:
4 cups tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 whole head garlic, cloves separated and peeled
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix tomatoes, garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a large bowl; spread into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Roast tomatoes in the preheated oven until they are lightly flecked with brown spots and the garlic cloves are tender, about 45 minutes; remove from oven after 20 minutes and mash lightly with a spatula.
About 5 minutes before tomatoes are done, place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add green beans, cover, and steam until just tender, about 5 minutes. Place steamed green beans into a serving dish and combine with roasted tomatoes to serve.

Description: 
Soooooo good! This is not a difficult recipe, but you need an hour when you know you'll be in the house so that you can roast the tomatoes.
