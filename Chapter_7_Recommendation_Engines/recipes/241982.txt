Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
3/4 cup water
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) basket grape tomatoes, chopped
1 avocado, pitted and sliced
1/2 cup chopped carrots, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, or to taste
1/2 cup chopped celery, or to taste
1/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup lime juice
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3 cloves garlic, minced
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add water and taco seasoning mix; cook and stir until water is evaporated and beef is evenly coated in seasoning mix, about 5 minutes.
Mix romaine lettuce, kidney beans, tomatoes, avocado, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, and Cheddar cheese in a large bowl; top with ground beef.
Whisk lime juice, honey, vinegar, cilantro, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed; served alongside salad.

Description: 
This is a quick-to-throw-together taco salad that even picky family members will eat, as you can serve any of the ingredients on the side. I sometimes serve with taco shells and let my five-year-old make tacos out of the ingredients (minus the dressing for the salad). Serve salad with tortilla chips, avocado, cilantro, and Cheddar cheese to taste.  Yum!
