Description: 
Fresh whole blueberries sparkle like jewels in a crown amid pillowy mounds of vanilla-scented custard-drenched bread dough in this brand new delectable dessert recipe. Best of all, it looks and tastes like a lot more work than it really is.  Simply cut the French bread into squares, add to the custard ingredients and top with fresh blueberries. Fresh blueberries require no chopping, peeling or pitting. Just rinse and theyâ€™re good to go.
