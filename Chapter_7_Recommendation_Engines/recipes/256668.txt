Ingredients:
Traditional Irish Cream:
1 cup So Delicious® Dairy Free French Vanilla Coconutmilk Creamer
2 tablespoons So Delicious® Dairy Free Culinary Coconut Milk
1/2 cup organic brown cane sugar
1 tablespoon vegan chocolate chips
3/4 cup cold brew coffee (or drip coffee or espresso)
Vegan Irish Coffee with Whiskey:
1 cup Traditional Irish Cream (above)
1/2 cup Irish whiskey, or to taste
Cocoa powder
Mint sprig, for garnish

Directions:
Heat water in a double boiler to a low simmer. Add Coconutmilk Creamer, Culinary Coconutmilk and organic brown cane sugar to the double boiler bowl. Whisk occasionally until sugar is melted and mixture is very warm but not hot.
Drop in chocolate and whisk until fully incorporated. Remove bowl from double boiler and stir in coffee. Use immediately or refrigerate.
To make Vegan Irish Coffee, combine Vegan Irish Cream and whiskey in a jar and give it a shake. Pour 4 to 5 ounces into an ice filled glass (coffee cubes if you have them!). Dust with cocoa powder.
Smack a mint sprig to release its oil and lay on top of the drink.
