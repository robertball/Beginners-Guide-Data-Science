Description: 
This sounds like such a simple recipe that many people pass it up ...DON'T! Cooking new potatoes this way makes them taste wonderful, especially with gobs of fresh butter. You must have a cast iron pan to do this. The stove-top browning makes the skins crunchy and out of this world. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
