Ingredients:
12 wonton wrappers
1/2 cup Nutella
water, for sealing wontons
2 tbsp butter, melted
1 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Spoon a small amount of Nutella onto the centre of each wonton wrapper. Dip your finger in the water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold up into a triangle and press the edges closed. Repeat until wontons are filled and sealed. Lay them on the prepared baking sheet.
Brush the tops of the wontons with the melted butter. Combine the cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle over wontons.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before eating, the chocolate will be darn hot!

I was craving something sweet, didn't have many ingredients on hand and was feeling lazy. I also had some wonton wrappers to use up. So this yummy wonton treat using ingredients I always have in my pantry was born!
