Ingredients:
5 pounds chicken leg quarters
2 gallons water
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 cube chicken bouillon
4 large carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
4 zucchini, cut into large chunks
1 chayote, cut into large chunks
1 large white onion, cut into large chunks
1/2 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped

Directions:
Place chicken legs into a large stock pot and pour water over chicken; add garlic, salt, and garlic powder. Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until chicken meat falls off the bones, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in chicken bouillon cube and let dissolve.
Mix carrots, potatoes, zucchini, chayote, and white onion in the broth, turn heat to medium-low, and cook soup at a low boil until carrots and potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir chopped cilantro into soup, simmer for 5 minutes, and serve.

Description: 
This is my first attempt at making caldo de pollo. I think it turned out great. You might need to add salt to taste as my recipe doesn't have very much. I like to serve this with warm corn tortillas and a side of Spanish rice and refried beans. Please enjoy and let me know what you think.
