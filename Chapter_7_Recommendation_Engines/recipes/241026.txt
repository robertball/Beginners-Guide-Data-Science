Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chopped crystallized ginger
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening (such as CriscoÂ®)
1/2 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1 tablespoon cold water
1/2 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
Whisk flour, crystallized ginger, ground ginger, and salt together in a bowl.
Beat shortening and sugar together in a bowl until smooth and creamy. Add egg yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually beat flour mixture and cold water into egg mixture until dough is well-combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Press chilled dough into a 7x11-inch baking dish. Spread apricot preserves over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown around the edges, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool for 1 hour before cutting into bars.
