Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 cup cold butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans
FILLING:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
4 cups cold milk
3 (3.5 ounce) packages instant coconut cream pudding mix
1/2 cup flaked coconut, toasted

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the flour and sugar; cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in the pecans. Press into a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.
In a small mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth; fold in 1 cup whipped topping. Spread over the crust. In a bowl, whisk milk and pudding mixes for 2 minutes; let stand for 2 minutes or until soft-set. Spread over cream cheese mixture. Top with remaining whipped topping. Sprinkle with coconut. Refrigerate overnight.
