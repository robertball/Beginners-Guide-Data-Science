Ingredients:
4 chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
2 small carrots, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 cups medium egg noodles

Directions:
Season chicken with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil until browned on each side and no longer pink in the centers, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
Add remaining oil to the saucepan and saute celery, carrots, and garlic over medium heat until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with pepper.
Pour chicken broth into the cooked vegetables and deglaze by scraping up the bits of chicken and vegetables from the bottom of the hot pan. Bring to a boil. Add egg noodles, reduce heat medium-low, and simmer until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper if necessary.
Ladle soup into bowls and lay chicken on top.

Sauteed chicken and garlic imparts richness to this homemade soup. Feel free to add additional vegetables and herbs to suit your taste! I like to serve this with a green salad and warm rolls.
