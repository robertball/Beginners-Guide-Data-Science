Ingredients:
1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 clove garlic, minced
1/8 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
6 tomato and oregano tortillas
6 lettuce leaves - rinsed and dried
12 slices deli sliced roast beef
1 avocado, cubed
1 tomato, seeded and chopped
1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese

Directions:
Mix the cream cheese, cumin, garlic, and chili flakes in a bowl until well blended.
Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture over each tortilla, dividing evenly. Place a lettuce leaf on each tortilla, and top with two roast beef slices. Sprinkle evenly with avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. Starting at one end, gently roll up each tortilla into a tight tube. Slice in half diagonally and place two pieces on 6 serving plates.
