1 bunch of green onions, chopped
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
8oz jar of pesto

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Peel and cube sweet potatoes, chop green onions, and slice mushrooms.
In a small saucepan on high heat, heat 1 cup of water until hot but not boiling. Turn heat to medium low and add 1/2 cup flour, whisking until thick. Once mixture has thickened, add 1 cup of milk, whisking until thick.
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except the cheese, adding the heated flour mixture last. Stir until all ingredients are combined.
Transfer mixture to a 9x13 casserole dish. Add desired amount of cheese to the top.
Cook in preheated oven for 50 minutes or until mixture is bubbly and sweet potatoes are cooked through.

Description: 
An easy casserole that is also pretty healthy! We make this dish once a week so we have a handful of premade lunches for throughout the week as it reheats very nicely.
