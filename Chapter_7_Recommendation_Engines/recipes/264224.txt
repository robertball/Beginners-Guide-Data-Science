Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Smoked Sausage
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2/3 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons yellow mustard
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Unwrap and place sausage on a tray or baking sheet. Freeze, uncovered, 30 minutes.
Transfer sausage to a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to bias-slice the sausage into 1/4-inch pieces.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Arrange sausage slices in a single layer on the baking sheets. Sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake about 20 minutes or until just beginning to brown.
Meanwhile, for dip, in a small bowl combine mayonnaise, mustard, honey, and black pepper. Serve with warm sausage slices.
