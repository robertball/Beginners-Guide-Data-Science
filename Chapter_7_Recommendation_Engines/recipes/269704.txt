Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
1 large yellow bell pepper, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups boiling water
2 cubes chicken bouillon
1 1/2 cups dry black beans
1 (10 ounce) can roasted tomatoes with green chiles (such as Ro-Tel®)
1/3 cup frozen corn
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 bay leaf
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select the Saute function. Add oil and saute onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic until onion becomes translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Combine water and bouillon in a bowl, stir to dissolve, and add to the pot. Add beans, tomatoes, and corn and stir until well mixed. Bring to a simmer. Add salt, chili powder, cumin, bay leaf, and black pepper and stir well.
Close and lock the lid. Set valve to sealing and select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a super-easy 'dump' soup for cold evenings. Adjust seasonings based on your preferred flavor profile. We love garlic and cumin, but our children prefer mild heat. This recipe is for a 3-quart instant pot. Adjust if you have a larger pressure cooker. Really good served as-is, but exceptional with rice.
