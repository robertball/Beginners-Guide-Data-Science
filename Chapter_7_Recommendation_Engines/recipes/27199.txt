In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt evaporated milk and chocolate chips, stirring frequently until smooth.

Description: 
This is an excellent dessert to bring for the Holidays.  You can use either Brandy or Rum.  These do need some time to set up so it is best to make them the night before. If you don't care for walnuts, the balls can be rolled in confectioners' sugar or cocoa powder.
