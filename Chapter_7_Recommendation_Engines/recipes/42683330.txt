Ingredients:
1 cup butter, room temperature
½ cup white sugar
1 egg yolk
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1¾ cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup coarsely crushed potato chips
¾ cup coarsely crushed pretzels
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup white chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°
In a medium bowl using an electric mixer, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg yolk and vanilla. Gradually add the flour and mix well. Stir in crushed potato chips and pretzels. Shape level tablespoons of dough into 3-inch logs. Place on ungreased cookie sheets, 1½ inches apart. Bake 14 – 18 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned. Cool completely on baking sheets. Melt semisweet chocolate chips in microwave, 30 seconds at a time, stirring frequently, until completely melted, about 1 minute. Dip one end of each cookie into the chocolate and place on a sheet of waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes. Melt white chips in microwave, 30 seconds at a time, stirring frequently, until completely melted, about 1½ minutes. Dip the other end of each cookie into the melted chips and place on a sheet of waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.
Yield: about 2 dozen.
