While potatoes are boiling, combine cheese, sour cream and salsa in a bowl. Grease a 2 qt. baking dish.
Cover bottom of baking dish with half of the potatoes. Salt and pepper to taste and then top with half of the cheese mixture.  Repeat layers.  Pour milk over top.

Description: 
Cheesy potatoes with an extra layer of flavor that make them a big hit whenever I take them to a party. The better the salsa the better this dish is.  Although I love spicy food, I prefer this dish with a mild salsa so that it adds flavor and not heat.
