1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/2 cup Marsala wine

Directions:
In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the flour, salt, pepper and oregano. Coat chicken pieces in flour mixture.
In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons margarine and 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Place chicken in the pan, and lightly brown.  Turn over chicken and brown the other side.  Remove from pan and set aside.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of margarine and sliced mushrooms, cooked until softened and browned.  Pour in Marsala.  Add chicken back into the pan and cover skillet; simmer chicken 10 minutes, turning once, until no longer pink and juices run clear.
