Ingredients:
4 eggs
1 quart buttermilk
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup sugar
6 cups raisin bran cereal
1/2 cup raisins
5 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs, buttermilk, oil and sugar. Stir in cereal and raisins. Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; add to egg mixture. Stir just until all ingredients are moistened.  If desired, store batter, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. To bake, gently stir batter; fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm. (All of the batter does not need to be baked at once.)
