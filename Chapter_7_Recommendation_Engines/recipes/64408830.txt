Klunker's Cheesy Spicy Grits Recipe

Ingredients:
Make the "cheese" first:
1/2c cooked sweet potato, peeled and mashed
1 tsp. onion powder
1/8 tsp. turmeric powder
1 full tablespoon of nutritional yeast
1/4c cashew milk (or milk of choice)
several dashes of your favorite hot sauce
(blend everything in a blender until smooth, since sweet potatoes vary, you may need a little more milk)  Then set aside
For the grits:
1/2 medium yellow onion, peeled and chopped small
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
1-2 T chopped jalapenos (I used canned)
2c mushroom stock (you could use veggie stock)
1/2c uncooked grits

Directions:
After all your ingredients are prepared, place a medium sauce pan on the stove over medium heat.  Add the onions and saute for about 5 minutes.  If they stick, add a little water, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Add the garlic an jalapenos next.  Saute for another 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes, add the mushroom (or veggie) stock, stir well and bring to a simmer.  When it reaches a simmer, whisk in the grits slowly.  You don't want lumps.  Make sure to keep whisking to keep everything smooth.  You will cook for 5-7 minutes.  When the grits are nice and smooth and thickened, add the sweet potato mix, and whisk in.  If it is too thick for you, you can add some more milk to thin it out.  Heat until hot, and then serve right away.  Garnish with some more jalapeno on top
