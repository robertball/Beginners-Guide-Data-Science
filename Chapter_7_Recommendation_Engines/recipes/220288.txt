Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
4 green onions, chopped (optional)
3 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, undrained
2 (1.25 ounce) packages chili seasoning mix (such as French's Chili-O Original Seasoning Mix®)
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 cup water
1 (1 pound) package processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed

Directions:
Place ground beef into a large skillet and cook, stirring often, until the beef is browned and crumbled, about 10 minutes. Stir in green onions after 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Place ground beef mixture into a large soup pot over medium heat.
Stir in black beans, corn and its liquid, chili seasoning mix, crushed tomatoes, and water; stir to combine. If chili seems too thick, mix in a little more water.
Cover the chili and cook 1 hour; add processed cheese cubes, allow to melt, and stir into the chili until smooth just before serving.

Description: 
I LOVE to create new recipes. My son's love for beans and cheese is the inspiration for this very simple chili. It's perfect served with corn bread and salad.
