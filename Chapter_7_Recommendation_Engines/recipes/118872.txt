Description: 
Tender and moist, these grilled kabobs from Sheri Jean Waked are extra special when served with her garlic dipping sauce. 'This is a lighter version of a dish my Lebanese mother-in-law taught me to make,' she writes from Loveland, Ohio. 'I reduced the amount of oil and substituted yogurt for mayonnaise.'
