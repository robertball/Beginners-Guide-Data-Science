Ingredients:
4 cups cubed or shredded cooked chicken meat
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
2 (4.5 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers, drained
2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
4 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
2 cups regular or light sour cream

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Mix chicken, cumin, coriander, cilantro, black beans and chiles in a medium bowl; set aside.
Spread 1/2 can of the enchilada sauce over the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Make 3 layers in the following order: 4 tortillas, overlapping if necessary, 1/2 can of enchilada sauce, 1/3 of the chicken mixture, 1/3 of cheese, and 1/3 of sour cream.  Cover with aluminum foil coated with vegetable oil cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove foil, set oven to broil; cook until cheese is spotty brown, about 5 minutes longer. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
