Ingredients:
4 tablespoons paprika
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
dash garlic powder
dash chili powder
2 tilapia fillets (medium size)
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/3 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl.  Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon mixture evenly on each side of each fillet.  Keep reserve mixture for later use.  Place coated fillets in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat medium size non-stick pan using medium-low heat.  When warmed, add vegatable oil evenly in pan and wait until oil is warm.  Add fillets, cover pan.  Cook for approximately 4 minutes or until coating starts to turn darker brown on some areas of the fish.  Do not overcook and let the fish blacken.  Turn fish over and cook for approximately 3-4 more minutes covered.  Fish is done when firm and just starts to flake.  Serve fish with lemon wedges.
