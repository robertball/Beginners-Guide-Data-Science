Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup mayonnaise
15 fresh jalapeno peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 cups crushed corn flake cereal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, sharp Cheddar cheese and mayonnaise. Stuff jalapeno halves with the mixture.
Whisk together eggs and milk in a small bowl. Place crushed corn flake cereal in a separate small bowl.
Dip each stuffed jalapeno half into the egg and milk mixture, then roll in corn flake cereal to coat.
Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until filling is bubbly and lightly browned.

Description: 
Sharp Cheddar cheese is the rich, delicious filling for these spicy favorites! They are baked rather than deep fried. You'll want to pop them down one after another!
