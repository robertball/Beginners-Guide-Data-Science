Ingredients:
1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2 eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup margarine, melted
4 1/2 cups bread flour
1/2 cup white sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1 cup brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 (3 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Place milk, eggs, margarine, bread flour, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of bread machine in recommended order by manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface after it has doubled in size. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Roll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread dough with 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar mixture.  Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rest until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Beat together Neufchatel cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.

Description: 
Who doesn't love a Cinnabon? These taste so yummy but I always look for a way to make things a little healthier without changing the taste. I just spread a little less butter and use Neufchatel cheese and this recipe still tastes great.
