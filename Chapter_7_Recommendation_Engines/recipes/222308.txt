2 teaspoons chopped fresh oregano
2 cups cold water

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the ditalini and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain well and return to pot.

Description: 
Make this because it tastes awesome. What the hot oven does to the deep red San Marzano tomatoes is a wonder to behold, and produces a pasta sauce with some serious depth of flavor. The always entertaining ditalini are a perfect medium for the rich sauce, smoky oregano, and creamy goat cheese.
