Ingredients:
1 tablespoon McCormick® Mixed Pickling Spice
2 pounds beef stew meat, trimmed and cut into 1 to 1 1/2-inch cubes
1 medium yellow onion, cut into medium wedges

2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
8 slices day old Italian bread, toasted

Directions:
Place the pickling spice in the center of a piece of cheesecloth or a coffee filter. Tie tightly with a long piece of string.
Add beef cubes, onion, carrot, crushed rosemary, garlic powder, and bouillon cubes to a 4 - 6 quart slow cooker. Stir in tomatoes and wine. Add spice bundle. Cook on HIGH 4 hours or on LOW 7 - 8 hours. Remove spice bundle.
To thicken stew: mix flour with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl until smooth; stir in several tablespoons hot liquid from stew. Then stir flour mixture into stew. Continue to cook 2 - 3 minutes or until stew thickens slightly.
Toast bread and place 1 slice in the bottom of an individual bowl. Spoon stew over bread and serve.
