Ingredients:
2 and 1/2 cups Bread Flour-separate 2 cups and 1/2 cup
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 pkg. of  active dry yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup water
Toppings:
1 Roma tomato sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup mozzarella

Directions:
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt, sugar, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, basil and black pepper.
Proof the yeast by heating the 1 cup of water in the microwave for (40-50 seconds) Make sure water is 110 degrees. Then, add 1 pkg. of yeast and 1 tsp. of sugar in a large 8 cup measuring cup. Stir until dissolved. Place in a warm place for 10 minutes. I place mine in the microwave.
Add the yeast and water mixture and 1 T. of oil to a large mixing bowl. I use a Kitchen aid mixer.
Add half of the flour and mix until blended. Add rest of flour except for 1/2 cup. Knead on setting #2. Add 2 cups flour. Then add small amounts of flour until the dough pulls away from the bowl. The kneading should take approximately 5 minutes.
When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic for 2-3 minutes.
Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Punch dough down; place on greased baking stone. Pat into a 1/2 inch thick circle.
In a warm place, Let rise for 30 minutes covered with a cotton towel.
Use the handle of wooden spoon to make round wells all over the dough. Then spread 2 T. of olive oil on the dough.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese. Add slices of tomatoes. Loosely cover with heavy duty aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Then uncover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.
