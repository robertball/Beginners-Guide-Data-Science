Description: 
A quick recipe that can be adjusted to include whatever vegetables you have on hand.  It could probably be done well with shrimp also. You could easily try different vegetables.  The times and amounts are variable depending upon how thick you slice your chicken and veggies, as well as how crisp you prefer the zucchini.
