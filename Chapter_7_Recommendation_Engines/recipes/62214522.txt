Ingredients:
3/4 - 1 cup pumpkin seeds, washed, strings removed
1 tsp. oil
1/2 tsp. cinnamon
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
2 3/4 cup sugar
12 oz. bottle or can beer

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet, add pumpkin seeds. Constantly stir until seeds have browned, about 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, add cinnamon and cayenne pepper.
Combine sugar and beer in a 2 qt. saucepan. Stir over medium low heat, until mixture boils.  After it has boiled, never touch your spoon to the side of the pan again!  Continue stirring until candy thermometer reaches 300, the hard crack stage.  This takes about 40 minutes! A few drops of the beer brittle will form strings when dropped into ice water at the hard crack stage.
Remove from heat, add pumpkin seeds.  Immediately place in buttered jelly roll pan.  Let cool.
Break into bite sized pieces.  Store in air tight container at room temperature.
