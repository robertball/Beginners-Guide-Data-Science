Ingredients:
1 C Butter
1 C Sugar
1 C Dark Brown Sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp Vanilla
2 C Flour
2 1/2 C Oatmeal, processed to a flour consistancy
1 tsp Baking Soda
1/2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Baking Powder
12 oz Chocolate Chips
4 oz Toffee Chips, Skorr or Heath
1 C chopped pecans (optional)
4 oz Chocolate bar, grated (I use the food processor)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375
Cream butter, add sugar, eggs and vanilla.
Process the Oatmeal in a food processor until it looks like flour.
Mix dry ingredients together.
Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture until well combined.
Add toffee chips, chocolate chips, nut and stir to combine.
Roll cookies into balls about the size of golf balls.  Place on parchment lined baking sheets. Cover with plastic wrap and gently depress the balls.
Bake for 10 mins at 375.  Cookies will not look quite done.  Take them out anyway.  Let cool for a minute or two on the cookie sheet.  Transfer to cooling rack.
