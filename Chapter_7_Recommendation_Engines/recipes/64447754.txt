Ingredients:
2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
1/4 cup coconut oil
½ medium red onion, diced
3-4 garlic cloves minced
½ cup chicken broth
¼ cup coconut aminos
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
2-3 bay leaves
Lots of black pepper

Directions:
1. In a large skillet heat the coconut oil over medium to medium high heat.
2. Once the oil is nice and hot, place the chicken thighs into the oil and brown on both sides (about 3-4 minutes per side).
3. Remove the browned chicken from the pan and set aside.
4. Add to the same pan the onions and saute in the remaining oil until the onions are translucent.  Add the garlic and saute for another 30 seconds or just until fragrant.
5. Add the chicken broth, coconut aminos, bay leaf, and apple cider vinegar to the onions and garlic and whisk together well. Bring the sauce to a simmer.
6. Add the chicken back to the sauce, in the pan, turn the heat down to low and cover.  Simmer the chicken in the sauce for five minutes, turn the chicken over, cover and cook for another five minutes until done.  Season with plenty of black pepper and serve.
