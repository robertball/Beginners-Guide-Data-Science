1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup Greek Yogurt
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-3 tablespoons milk product (milk, cream, or half and half)
1 cup chopped peeled fresh or well-drained canned peaches

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour, pecans, sugar and baking powder. Combine egg, yogurt, butter and vanilla; mix well. Stir into dry ingredients just until  moistened. Add enough milk to give the batter a better consistency. Fold in peaches. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Bake at 400 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until muffins test done. Cool in pan 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.
