Description: 
Yummy, rich-tasting, filling, addictive texture. I WAY prefer this to a hamburger any day!! And I am no vegetarian, by any means. I took one bite of this, and said.. Oh My Gosh... this is incredible!!! I could easily swear off beef burgers for these! Place on lettuce, top with a slice of cheese, and serve with Thousand Island dressing, with or without a bun. OMG! So good!
