Ingredients:
For the chocolate wafers:
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch process cocoa
1 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 to 1 1/2 cups sugar*
1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 large egg
*If you want a wafer that isn’t as sweet like Nabisco’s version, cut out 1/2 cup of sugar. (I put in about 1 1/4 cups of sugar.)
For the filling:
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room-temperature
2 cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted*
2 tsp vanilla extract
*I didn’t sift it (lazy baker slash impatient appetite)

Directions:
How to make it:
1. Set two racks in the middle of the oven. Preheat to 375°F.
2. In a food processor or the bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, and sugar. While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.
3. Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.
4. To make the cream, place butter in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.
5. To assemble the cookies, put the cream in a pastry bag with a 1/2-inch round tip and pipe teaspoon-size blobs into the center of one cookie. I still don’t have a pastry bag or tips, so I use a Ziplock bag and cut off the corner.
