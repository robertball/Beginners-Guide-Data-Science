Ingredients:
4	Racks pork baby back rib (about 1 ½ lb/ 750g)
Salt
Pepper
1	small onion, sliced
2	knobs ginger root, divided (1 minced, 1 sliced)
4 tbsp	(60ml) minced garlic
1 cup	(250ml) kochujang
4 tbsp	white vinegar
3 tbsp	(50ml) toasted sesame oil
2 tbsp	(25ml) soy sauce
1	bottle of your favourite Pilsner-style lager
1 tbsp	(15ml) toasted white and black sesame seeds

Directions:
Remove membrane from back of ribs or score with a sharp knife. Season with salt and pepper.
Puree onion in a blender or food processor. Add minced ginger root, garlic, kochujang, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil and soy sauce and puree. Rub 1/3 of sauce generously over meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or for at least 5 hours.
Preheat oven to 325°F.
Scatter sliced ginger root in the bottom of a roasting pan, place ribs meats side down on top of ginger and pour lager over ribs. Cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil and place in the preheated oven for 2 to 2 ½ hours, or until you can wiggle ribs in the meat (meat shouldn’t fall off bone, but be almost ready to).
Cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
In the meantime, preheat barbeque or broiler to 400°F; oil BBQ grill or broiler pan well.
Place ribs on grill/broiler pan and cook about 6 minutes on each side; during last 2 minutes of cooking each side, liberally coat ribs with ½ of the remaining sauce on each side. (You are looking to caramelize the sauce a little and reheat ribs if they were cooled too long.)
When done, garnish with sesame seeds and serve with Asian Sesame Coleslaw.
