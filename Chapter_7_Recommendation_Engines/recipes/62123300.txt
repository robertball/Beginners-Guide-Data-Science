Ingredients:
8 cups broccoli
6 cups water
2 TBSP chicken base or bouillon
1 small onion chopped
olive oil flavored spray
6 oz blue cheese
1/4-1/2 c instant mashed potatoes

Directions:
Spray a soup pot with the olive oil spray. Saute onion for 1 to 2 minutes. Add broccoli, water and base.  Cook until broccoli is tender. Puree most of the mixture in a food processor. Return puree to pot and mix in cheese. Stir. If not thick enough for your taste, add 1/4 cup potatoes, stir and wait a couple of minutes for it to thicken. We like thick soups, so I usually use 1/2 c for this recipe.
