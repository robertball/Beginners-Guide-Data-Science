Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless beef chuck roast
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
3 cups Butermilk
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon celery seed
3/4 cup flour
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Coat the chuck roast with garlic salt, pepper and mustard powder. Heat the oil in a large oven-proof skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the roast and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.
In a medium bowl, stir together 3 cups of  buttermilk, soy sauce, honey, ginger and celery seed. Pour over the roast and then cover the roast tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until the roast is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
When the roast is done, remove it from the pan to a serving plate. Set the pan of drippings aside to cool slightly.
Blend together the milk and flour then add to drippings. While stirring, slowly add the milk and flour blend then return the drippings to high heat while stirring. When desired thickness is achieved, off burner.

Description: 
A tender, well flavored change up from your usual pot roast and the gravy is served over extra wide noodles. My granddaughters gave this their highest compliment- they asked for more and left clean plates when they finished.Modified from: Chinese Pot Roast
