Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
4 pork loin chops
10 cremini mushrooms, sliced
1 large shallot, thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons white wine
1 cube beef bouillon
2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork chops and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven chops are no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, shallot, and garlic and saute until mushrooms are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
Whisk 1/2 cup chicken broth and flour together in a small bowl until a smooth, thin paste forms. Slowly add flour paste to the mushroom mixture, stirring to combine. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups broth, wine, and bouillon cube. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until thickened and bubbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Add parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve over pork chops.
