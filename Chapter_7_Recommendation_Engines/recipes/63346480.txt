Ingredients:
1 Pita pocket bread
5 Thinly sliced pieces of roast beef
1 slice of American Cheese
3 teaspoons of sour cream

Directions:
Take one piece of American cheese and fold it in half length wise and place on either side of the pita. Take roast beef and place in between the cheese. Place in microwave for about one minute. Once cooked stir sour cream and put inside the pita. You can put as much as you like. I prefer quite a bit but you can put the amount you like.
