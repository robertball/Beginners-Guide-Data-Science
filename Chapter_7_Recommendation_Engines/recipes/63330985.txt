Ingredients:
10 lb. crabapples
7 cups white sugar
1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Wash the crabapples and remove the stems.  Cut off the blossom ends.
Place them in one extra large or two large dutch ovens.  Add enough water to cover, but not so much that the apples float, and cook for 45 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
Run the crabapples through a course strainer, and press down with the bottom of a bowl to force most of the liquid and some of the soft pulp through.  Return the strained liquid to the dutch oven and discard the rest.
Add the sugar and spices and cook over medium-low heat for two hours or until thickened.
Skim off any foam that has formed on the top.  Ladle into sterilized jars and seal.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is adapted from an Apple Butter recipe, and is a great way to keep all those decorative crabapples from going to waste. Crabapples are naturally high in pectin, so none is needed.
