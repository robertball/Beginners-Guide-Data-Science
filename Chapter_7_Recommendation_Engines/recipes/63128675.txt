Ingredients:
1 medium tomato?
2 avocados
?1 cup of sweet white corn (I get a frozen bag from Costco)
?1 Bushel of green onions?
1 can of black beans?, drained
Garlic Pepper (I never have this, so I leave it out)
?Garlic salt w/ parsley?
Tapatio Sauce

Directions:
Place drained black beans and corn into a large bowl. ?Dice up the tomato and green onions and add them in the bowl.? Season with the garlic pepper, garlic salt and tapatio sauce to taste. ?Mix everything around and then taste it to check seasoning.?? Add chopped avocado and mix it around one more time (I do the avocado last so the little diced pieces donâ€™t get all mushy in the initial mixing process).
