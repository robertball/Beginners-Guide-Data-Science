Ingredients:
cooking spray
8 ounces chopped dark chocolate
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 20 muffin cups with cooking spray and dust with flour, or line with paper liners.
Melt chopped dark chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes.
Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; beat in sugar gradually on high speed. Add cream and beat until batter has doubled in volume. Beat in butter until well combined. Beat in flour and salt on low speed until well combined. Beat in melted chocolate on medium speed until well combined. Stir in chocolate chips and pecans. Pour batter into muffin cups.
Bake in preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Dark, rich, and creamy souffle-like recipe. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. This is a modified brownie recipe, reducing the flour and egg amounts, creaming the sugar, and adding heavy cream to create a cross between a chocolate souffle and a brownie.
