Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
2 green onions, chopped
1 cup frozen green peas
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch garam masala
1 pinch turmeric powder
ground cayenne pepper to taste
1 cup uncooked basmati rice
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
10 large fresh mushrooms, chopped
5 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1 teaspoon garam masala
1 pinch turmeric powder
cayenne pepper to taste
1/2 cup dry red lentils
3/4 cup vegetable broth
1/2 cup almond slivers
1 bunch cilantro sprigs

Directions:
In a pot, bring 2 1/2 cups broth to a boil. Mix in green onions and peas. Season with salt, 1 pinch garam masala, 1 pinch turmeric, and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir the basmati rice into the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.
Melt the butter in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the mushrooms and garlic in the melted butter until lightly browned. Mix in green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Season with 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 pinch turmeric, and cayenne pepper to taste. Stir in the lentils and 3/4 cup broth. Reduce heat to low. Cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender.
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the almonds, stirring frequently, until lightly browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.
Increase wok heat to medium. Mix the rice into the wok with the vegetables and lentils. Cook and stir until all liquid has evaporated. Garnish with toasted almonds and cilantro sprigs to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is a family favourite. It has wonderful textures; the softness of the rice combined with the crunchy almonds ... it's heaven! The spices can be altered to your tastes... I generally add quite a lot.
