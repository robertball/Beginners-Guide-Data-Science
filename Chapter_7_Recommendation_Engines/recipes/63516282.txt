Ingredients:
8 ounces whole wheat elbow macaroni
1 (8 ounce) package shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
12 ounces low-fat cottage cheese
1 (8 ounce) container light sour cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
Stir together macaroni, shredded Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix together bread crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl; sprinkle topping over macaroni mixture.
Bake until top is golden in the preheated oven, 30 to 35 minutes.

Description: 
This version of macaroni and cheese keeps its tasty and unusual ingredients of cottage cheese and cheddar, but with a low-fat twist.  Combined with whole grain pasta and whole wheat breadcrumbs, this healthier dish is just as satisfying and delicious.Modified from: Healthier Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese
