Ingredients:
16 oz rotini pasta
1 lg cucumber-peeled and chopped
1 lg tomato - chopped
1/4 medium red onion - finely chopped
2 T fresh dill - finely chopped (or may use about 1t dried)
Creamy Cucumber Ranch (or regular ranch) Dressing - enough to make creamy

Directions:
Cook rotini according to package directions.  Drain and shock under cold water.  Combine all ingredients except dressing in a large bowl and mix well.  Add dressing to your liking.  Don't forget the S&P to taste.  I adjust ingredients in this recipe depending on what I have in the fridge.  Crumbled bacon adds a nice touch and so does diced red bell pepper when I have it on hand.
