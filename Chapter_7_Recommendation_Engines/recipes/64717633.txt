Ingredients:
2 tbsp olive oil
2 lbs ground turkey
1 onion, chopped (I used half a bag of frozen chopped onions)
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped (I used 3 cubes of frozen garlic)
8oz can tomato sauce
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1.5 cups ketchup
2 tbsp prepared yellow mustard
2-3 tbsp dark brown sugar
2-3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
Hamburger buns

Directions:
In a large pan over medium heat,  heat up olive oil.  Sautee turkey, garlic, and onions until turkey is cooked through and crumbling.  Pour off fat.
Stir in tomato sauce, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and cocoa powder.  Cook for a few minutes until thickened.  Try a bite - if it is too acidic, add a little more cocoa powder.  If it needs more acidity, add some more ketchup, mustard, and/or a touch of white vinegar.  If it needs more sweetness, add a little more brown sugar.
Serve on warmed buns.  Optional - add diced turkey hot dogs or shredded cheese.
