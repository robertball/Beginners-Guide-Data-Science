In a large bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt. Make a well in center. Add yeast mixture, eggs, buttermilk and vegetable oil; stir until smooth.
Spray preheated waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot waffle iron. Cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Serve hot.

Description: 
Brunches are a big hit in our family.  They think this recipe makes the best waffles of all and it is easily doubled or tripled.  I sprinkle blueberries or pecans on top of the batter for those who want them just before closing the waffle iron --- it's definitely my favorite way to have them. Plus, you can make the batter the night before!
