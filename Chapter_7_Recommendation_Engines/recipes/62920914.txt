Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter
3 eggs
2-1/3 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder or unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
1-1/2 cups buttermilk or sour milk*
Cocoa Mascarpone Frosting (see recipe below)
White and dark chocolate shavings (optional

Directions:
Allow butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease bottoms of three 8x1-1/2-inch round cake pans. Line bottoms of pans with waxed paper. Grease and lightly flour bottoms and sides of pans. Or, grease one 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Set pan(s) aside. Preheat oven to 350 degree F.
In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. In a small bowl, combine granulated and brown sugar. Gradually add sugar mixture, about 1/4 cup at a time, beating on medium speed until well combined (3 to 4 minutes). Scrape sides of bowl; continue beating on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla.
Add flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to beaten mixture, beating on low speed just until combined after each addition. Beat on medium to high speed for 20 seconds more. Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan(s).
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, or bake 45 to 50 minutes for the 13x9x2-inch pan. Cool cake layers in pans for 10 minutes on wire rack. Remove from pans. Peel off waxed paper. Cool thoroughly on wire racks. Or, place 13x9x2-inch cake in pan on a wire rack; cool thoroughly.
