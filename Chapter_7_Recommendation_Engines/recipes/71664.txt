Ingredients:
6 large poblano chiles*
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 jalapenos, seeded and chopped**
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon cumin
1 (28 ounce) can BUSH'S® Vegetarian Baked Beans, drained
1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce
12 ounces Pepper Jack or Monterey Jack, coarsely grated
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cut poblano chiles in half lengthwise to create a boat for filling; scrape out seeds.*
Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet.  Add onion, garlic, jalapenos, red bell pepper, cilantro and cumin and cook over medium heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and stir in BUSH'S Vegetarian Baked Beans, hot sauce and 8 ounces cheese.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon the mixture into the hollowed chiles and sprinkle with remaining cheese.
Preheat grill to medium.   Arrange chiles on grill away from heat.  Cook until chiles are tender and cheese is browned and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes.  Remove from grill and serve at once.
