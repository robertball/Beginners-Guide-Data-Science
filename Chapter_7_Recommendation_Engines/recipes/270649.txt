Ingredients:
1 1/4 teaspoons sweet paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground star anise
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 pound chicken tenders
1 pinch ground sea salt, to taste
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup sliced red onion

Directions:
Combine sweet paprika, pepper, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, star anise, and nutmeg in a small bowl and stir to combine.
Place chicken tenders on a plate and sprinkle one side with 2 teaspoons of the spice blend. Season with sea salt to taste. Turn tenders and sprinkle the other side with an additional 2 teaspoons of the spice blend; add salt to taste. Store remaining spice blend in an airtight container and reserve for another use.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Pour in olive oil once skillet is hot and heat until it shimmers. Carefully place chicken tenders into skillet one at a time, making sure they don't touch each other. Cook for 4 1/2 minutes, turn, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 1/2 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
Add onion to the same skillet and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Remove onion slices and drain on paper towel-lined plate. Serve onions with chicken.
