Ingredients:
2 8-oz packages of Tofu Shirataki noodles (any shape)
4 egg whites
2 carrots, grated
1/4 cup fresh chives, minced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried onion flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place the grated carrot in a paper towel in a bowl. Microwave for one minute. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much of the juice as possible. Set aside.
Rinse and dry the shirataki noodles thoroughly. In a food processor, grind the noodles until they have a consistency like couscous or small grains of rice. Transfer to a mixing bowl.
Add carrots, egg whites, chives, cilantro, curry powder, onion flakes, garlic powder and salt.
Mix until ingredients are well combined.
Coat a frying pan with nonstick cooking spray and heat over a high flame. Drop a heaping spoonful of the carrot mixture onto the hot pan and gently flatten with a metal spatula. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side. They will fall apart easily, but are delicious!

Description: 
If you're like me and hate the rubbery texture of Tofu Shirataki noodles, this recipe is for you! It's tasty, low-fat, low-calorie, high-fiber, and vegetarian. These croquettes are delicious when served with grilled chicken, over shredded lettuce or spinach, or doused with salsa.
