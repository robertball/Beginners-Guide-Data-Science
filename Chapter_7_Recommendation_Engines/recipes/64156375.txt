Ingredients:
1 pound tomatillos, husked (about 8 medium)
1 small onion, quartered
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
Kosher salt
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
1 poblano pepper, seeded and diced
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup rice vinegar
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon dried mustard powder
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems and leaves separated
2 tablespoons tequila

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Toss the tomatillos and onion pieces in a bowl with 1 teaspoon of the oil and a sprinkle of salt. Transfer the whole lot to a sheet pan, and roast in the oven until the vegetables blister and collapse, about 25 minutes.
Heat the remaining teaspoon of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and cook the jalapenos and poblanos until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the honey, vinegar, coriander, mustard, roasted vegetables and cilantro stems and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the sauce is slightly reduced and the roasted onions are very tender, about 20 minutes.
Transfer the sauce to a blender with the cilantro leaves and 2 teaspoons salt and blend until smooth. Stir in the tequila and season with more salt if desired. Use immediately, or refrigerate in a nonreactive container for up to 2 days.
