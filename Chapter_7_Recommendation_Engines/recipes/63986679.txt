Ingredients:
• One 15-ounce can chickpeas
• 1/4 Cup fresh lemon juice, about 1 large lemon
• 1/4 Cup Tahini
• Half of a large garlic clove, minced
• 2 Tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
• 1/2 to 1 teaspoon kosher salt
• 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
• 2 to 3 Tablespoons water
• Dash of ground paprika for serving

Directions:
In the bowl of a food processor, combine tahini and lemon juice. Process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl then turn on and process for 30 seconds. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making smooth and creamy hummus possible.
Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin and the salt to whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape sides and bottom of bowl then process another 30 seconds.Open can of chickpeas, drain liquid then rinse well with water. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor then process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl, add remaining chickpeas and process for 1 to 2 minutes or until thick and quite smooth.Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until the consistency is perfect.

Description: 
In the past, if we were in the grocery store you could almost bet that one of us would throw a tub of smooth hummus into our cart. That was until we figured out this simple hummus recipe that we honestly believe is better than anything we could have found at the store.
