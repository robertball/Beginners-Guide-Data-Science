Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup orzo pasta
1/2 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup white rice
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup chopped spinach
1/2 cup chopped Bulgarian feta cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir oro in the melted butter until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir onion into orzo and cook until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Cook and stir garlic into orzo-onion mixture until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Mix rice and chicken broth into orzo-onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover skillet, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in spinach and feta. Cover and let stand until spinach is wilted and feta is melted, about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

Description: 
Rice and orzo pasta merge with the flavors of onion and garlic to create this versatile side dish. Bulgarian feta gives the dish a decadent creaminess while spinach adds beautiful color. You can get Bulgarian feta cheese at most international grocery stores. Bulgarian feta is creamier than the Greek version which tends to be very dry.
