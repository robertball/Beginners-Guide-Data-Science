Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
1  red bell pepper, cored and sliced
1 cup vertically sliced onion
3 ounces snow peas, trimmed, cut in half
⅓ cup water
¼ cup hoisin sauce
¼ cup soy sauce
¼ cup sherry
2 ½ tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add chicken to the wok, and stir-fry until chicken is opaque on all sides, about 3 minutes.  Remove to a plate.
Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the wok. Add bell pepper, onion, and snow peas; stir-fry until vegetables start to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Whisk together water, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sherry, ginger, rice vinegar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and garlic in a bowl. Add sauce to the wok, stirring constantly until sauce starts to thicken. Add chicken back to the wok, stir, and reheat, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
Stir fries require very little cooking time and you can pretty much use any vegetables you like, but the star of this one is the ginger. This dish is quick and easy to make, but get all of your ingredients together (including mixing the sauce) before you start cooking because everything happens fast! Serve with rice, and garnish with sliced green onions.
