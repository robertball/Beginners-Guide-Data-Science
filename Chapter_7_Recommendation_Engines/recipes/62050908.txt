Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into 1/2 inch cubes
1 pkg (1.06 oz) Grill Mates Mesquite Marinade
1 lg can (140z)pineapple chunks
1 green pepper (cut in chunks)
1 sweet onion (cut in chunks)

Directions:
Following the directions on the package, mix chicken with mesquite marinade and marinate for 15 to 30 minutes (the longer you marinate, the spicier the chicken).  Add onion and pineapple and toss just to coat.  Thread chicken, pineapple, onion, and peppers on skews and grill on medium-high heat for about 15 minutes or until chicken juices run clear.  Serve with crisp tossed salad and grilled potatoes.

Description: 
Delicious grilled chicken kabobs and a great make ahead dish.  I always get rave reviews when I serve this.  Even my grandchildren love it!  As a side dish, I brush canned potatoes with the marinade and grill along with the kabobs.
