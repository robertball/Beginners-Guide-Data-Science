Description: 
These are the highest, fluffiest, tastiest potatoes I've ever had. They can be made a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to bake. This dish is Mom's specialty, and we all especially love the part along the edge of the casserole dish that gets golden brown. -Alyson Armstrong, Parkersburg, West Virginia
