Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 chicken thighs, skinned
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added stewed tomatoes
1/2 cup prune juice or orange juice
6 pitted dried plums (prunes), diced
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup plain tabbouleh dry mix
1 1/3 cups boiling water
1/2 cup chopped parsley

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown on one side. Turn and add the onion; continue cooking until the onion and chicken are browned. Drain the excess fat. Stir in the tomatoes, juice, dried plums, allspice, salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and cook 5 minutes over medium heat.
Uncover and simmer about 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens and the chicken is done; turning the chicken and stirring the sauce occasionally.
Meanwhile combine the boiling water and the tabbouleh. Cover and rest for 5 minutes. Add the parsley to the tabbouleh, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the chicken and sauce on a bed of the tabbouleh.
