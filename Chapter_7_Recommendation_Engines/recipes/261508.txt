Ingredients:
Eggplant Burgers:
1 pound Japanese eggplant, cut into 1-inch-thick rounds
1/2 pound ground pork
2 tablespoons tamari sauce
2 green onions, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
Dipping Sauce:
1/4 cup tamari sauce
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Lay eggplant rounds on a work surface. Cut a small slit horizontally through each round, making a pocket to form 'burger buns' that are still joined together.
Mix ground pork, 2 tablespoons tamari, green onions, ginger, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stuff mixture into the 'buns.'
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add the stuffed buns and cover. Steam until tender and pork is only slightly pink in the center, about 20 minutes.
Mix 1/4 cup tamari, garlic, sesame oil, and vinegar together in a small bowl to make the dipping sauce. Serve with the cooked eggplant burgers.
