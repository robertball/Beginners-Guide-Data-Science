Ingredients:
6 Tbsp. Splenda Baking Blend
1/3 cup flour
2 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 tsp. lemon zest
Juice from 1/2 a lemon
1/4 tsp. Cinnamon
5 cups Blueberries, fresh
**Topping**
1/3 Cup Splenda Brown Sugar
3/4 Cup quick cooking oats
1/2 cup flour
1 tsp. Cinnamon
6 Tbsp butter or margarine, cold

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 3 quart baking dish with vegetable spray.
Make the topping first.  In a medium bowl stir together the 1/3 cup Splenda Brown Sugar, 3/4 cup   oats, 1/2 cup of flour and the 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Cut the butter into small cubes and press into the mixture with a pastry blender or a fork until crumbly.  Place into the fridge to keep cold.
In a large bowl stir together well the 6 Tbsp.Splenda Baking Blend, 2 Tbsp.cornstarch, 1/3 cup of flour and the 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.
In another bowl gently toss the blueberries with the lemon zest and lemon juice.  Then gently add the blueberries into the large bowl and gently toss them until they are well coated.  Pour into the baking dish.  There will be some flour mixture left over; spread that evenly over the blueberries.
Spread the reserved crumbly topping over the berries.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes or until browned on the top. May be eaten warm or cold.

Coming from a diabetic household, I needed to adapt this recipe to make it lower in sugar.  Everyone raves over it -- particularly my non-diabetic friends!!
