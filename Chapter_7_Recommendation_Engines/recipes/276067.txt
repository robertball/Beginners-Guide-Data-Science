Ingredients:
1 cup white chocolate chips
8 ounces butterscotch-flavored hard candy, crushed
3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups vanilla wafers, crushed
3/4 cup sliced almonds, chopped

Directions:
Place white chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Pour butterscotch candy into chocolate and stir to combine. Add powdered sugar, sour cream, lemon zest, and salt; stir to combine. Stir in vanilla wafer crumbs. Let mixture chill in the refrigerator until firm, 15 to 20 minutes.
Shape mixture into balls using a teaspoon-sized scoop. Roll balls in chopped almonds.

Description: 
So little effort, for such a big reward. These delectable truffles of white chocolate, with a hint of lemon and crushed butterscotch for crunch, go down a treat. I made these as gifts for Christmas, and everyone moaned with delight and said they tasted just like a cheesecake. Store truffles in a tightly covered container in the refrigerator if not serving immediately. They can also be frozen.
