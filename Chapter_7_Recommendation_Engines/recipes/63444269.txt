Ingredients:
1 pound fresh brussel sprouts, cleaned and sliced thin
1 -2 T olive oil
1 clove minced garlic
1/4 small onion chopped fine
1 bag frozen gnocchi
salt, pepper to taste
1/4 to 1/2 c water
splash of lemon juice and red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Saute the sprouts and onion in olive oil.  When the onion starts to become translucent, add the garlic, salt and pepper.  Add about 1/4 c water to start (might need some more) and the gnocchi, cover and let simmer for 10 minutes.  Remove lid and check for gnocchi doneness.  I like to turn the heat up a bit and brown it.  I add a splash of lemon juice and a few red pepper flakes at the end for a little tang.
