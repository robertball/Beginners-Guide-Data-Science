Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved
1/2 cup quinoa
1/2 cup lentils
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 cup unsweetened dried coconut
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup finely diced red onion
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Pour the pineapple juice into a measuring pitcher, and add enough water to make 2 cups. Set the pineapple chunks aside. Pour the pineapple juice into a saucepan, and stir in the quinoa and lentils. Season with salt, black pepper, and curry powder. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils and quinoa have absorbed the water, about 30 minutes. Stir in the coconut, and simmer for 5 minutes more.
Stir in the pineapple chunks, pecans, and onion; cook briefly to reheat. Sprinkle with cilantro to serve.

Description: 
This recipe is very good. Serve warm for a main dish or cold for a side dish. In place of quinoa, you can also use the same amount of brown rice or bulghur wheat.
