1 pound cooked chicken, diced
1 pound seedless red grapes, halved
2 stalks celery, thinly sliced horizontally
2 (8 ounce) cans mandarin oranges, drained and liquid reserved

1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
Combine cooked pasta, chicken, grapes, celery, oranges, water chestnuts, cashews, mint leaves, and cinnamon in a large bowl.
Mix yogurt, mayonnaise, and chicken bouillon for dressing together in a bowl until well blended. Pour dressing over pasta salad and toss lightly until all ingredients are coated. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes.
