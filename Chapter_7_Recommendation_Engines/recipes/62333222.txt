Ingredients:
1 tablespoon instant yeast
1- 12 ounce warm beer
2 ounces warm water
3 tablespoons shortening or oil (olive is best)
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
4 - 5  cups bread flour
1 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
16 string cheese sticks** (depending on pan size)
cornmeal
**You can also use shredded cheese, about 2 cups, if you prefer.

Directions:
Place beer, water, shortening, salt, sugar, spices, yeast and 4 cups flour in the bowl of a mixer.  Attach the dough hook and begin mixing.
Add flour a little at a time until dough pulls together and no longer sticks to sides of the bowl and forms a pliable ball.  You might not need to add all of the recommended flour amount.
Mix for about 2 minutes.
Place dough in an oil coated bowl and cover with a towel until doubled in size. About 1 hour
TO FORM PIZZA:
Punch dough down.
Oil and dust pans with cornmeal.
Divide dough into two portions.
Place dough on pans and let rest 5 minutes, lightly covered. Spread dough out to edges with some of the dough extending past the rim just about an inch. * If dough shrinks back then cover and let rest 5 minutes then try again.
Peel cheese and place around the rim of the pan with ends touching.  About 8 pieces if your pan measures 16 inches.
Fold excess dough over the cheese sticks towards inside of pan and press to seal on bottom.
Fill with sauce and your favorite toppings.
Bake 400* until center is set and crust is crispy. About 30 minutes.
Enjoy!
