Ingredients:
1 egg
8 egg yolks
2 tsp (10 mL) vanilla extract
4 cups (1 L) whipping cream
1 cup (250 mL) granulated sugar
1/3 cup (75 mL) Tre Stelle® Mascarpone
1/2 cup (125 mL) granulated sugar for brulee
Roasted Blueberries
1 cup (250 mL) fresh blueberries
1/4 cup (125 mL) granulated sugar

Directions:
Custard
Preheat oven to 325ºF (160ºC)
In a medium bowl whisk together the egg, egg yolks, vanilla and half of the sugar; set aside. Meanwhile in a medium saucepan bring whipping cream and remaining sugar to a boil. Remove from heat and carefully pour approximately 1/4 cup of the hot mixture into the egg mixture, stir, and return the entire mixture back to the pan, add Mascarpone and stir until blended. Pour the custard into 8 ramekins and place in a large roasting pan half filled with hot water. Bake for 30 minutes or until set. Remove from pan, cool and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Prior to serving sprinkle 1/2 cup of sugar evenly over custards. Caramelize with a kitchen torch or carefully place under the broiler until sugar browns, being careful not to burn.
Top with roasted blueberries
Roasted Blueberries
Preheat oven to 285ºF (140C). Place blueberries on foil lined cookie sheet, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and place on brulee. (Also works well with strawberries)
