Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 cup frozen French-cut green beans, thawed
1/2 onion, roughly chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 egg, beaten
3 cups cold cooked rice
1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until  just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Drain all but 1 to 2 teaspoons of bacon grease from the skillet. Add green beans, onion, and garlic; saute until bacon is crisp and green beans and onions are softened, about 3 minutes.
Push bacon mixture to one side of the skillet; heat sesame oil on the empty side, about 30 seconds. Pour in egg; cook until just set, about 1 minute. Stir into bacon mixture to combine. Mix in rice. Stir in soy sauce, a tablespoon at a time, until rice is evenly coated. Cook until rice is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a fried rice recipe that I luckily created from practically threadbare cabinets one evening. It's the epitome of comfort food and is a breeze to make. The green beans really complement the flavors but feel free to use any veggie you have on hand. Enjoy!
