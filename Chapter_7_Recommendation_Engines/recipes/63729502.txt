Ingredients:
DOUGH:
4 cups flour
2 teaspoons salt
1 to 1 1/2 cups shortening (lard or Crisco-type)
10 tablespoons ice water
FILLING:
2 lbs. round steak, cut into 1/4" cubes
4 lbs. white potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4" cubes
1 small turnip OR 1/2 of a rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Directions:
CRUST:  Cut shortening into flour and salt until mixture is lumpy.  Rub flour mixture with fingers to produce a coarse crumb.
Add water and for into ball.
Divide into six equal rolled balls, dust with flour and seal in plastic wrap.  Chill 1 hour.
FILLING:  Mix steak with remaining ingredients.
Roll each chilled dough ball into a 9" circle on a lightly floured surface.
Place 1 - 1 1/2 cup filling on one side of circle and fold pastry over to create a half circle shape.
Seal the edges with fork tines and cut small slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Baste with beaten egg white or milk if desired.
Bake on cookie sheet at 400* for 45-50 minutes until golden brown.

Description: 
I didn't do any cooking while on vacation in Upper Michigan, but I did find this recipe I want to try!  The story goes that this dish was invented by wives who wanted their husbands and sons to have a hot meal while in the mines of Wales.  The pasty would be wrapped in a dish towel and placed in the metal lunch box.  The practice was continued here with the miners of the UP.  I would probably make 8 pasties from this recipe, as I am not feeding miners!
