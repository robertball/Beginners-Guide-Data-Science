Ingredients:
½ gallon pasteurized whole milk
½ cup unflavored yogurt with live active cultures

Directions:
Place the milk in a large, heavy saucepan and heat to 180 degrees F, stirring often.
Turn off the heat and let the milk cool to 115 degrees F, stirring often.
Remove about 1 cup of warm milk from the saucepan and whisk in the yogurt. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan and stir to combine.
Ladle the (still liquid) yogurt into clean glass jars and cover loosely with a lid or leave in the saucepan and cover.
Counter top and oven option: Place the yogurt in a warm spot in your kitchen (wrapped in a towel, if your kitchen is breezy), in a gas oven with just the pilot light on, or in an insulated cooler surrounded by warm water. Depending on your environment temperature, culture strength, and other factors, this could take 12 to 24 hours.
Slow Cooker or Instant Pot option: To speed up the process, place the yogurt jars in your slow cooker or Instant Pot and fill it with warm water. Set the device to “warm” and let the yogurt sit until set, around 4 to 6 hours.
Move the yogurt to the fridge to cool, and enjoy within two weeks.
Note: To make Greek yogurt, place yogurt in a strainer, lined with several layers of cheesecloth, over a bowl or in the sink. Let drip for 30 minutes to several hours, until it reaches the perfect consistency for your tastes.
