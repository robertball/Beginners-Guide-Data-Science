Description: 
A guilt-free way to satisfy those chocolate cravings (which, in my case, are constant). I know the ingredients may seem a little weird, but I swear this tastes just like chocolate pudding! Feel free to make substitutions with more common ingredients (ie. regular milk for the soy or honey for the agave nectar).
