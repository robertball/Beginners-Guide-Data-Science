Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar (you don't have to pack it down, a loose cup is enough)
2 tsp vanilla
2 eggs
2 cups whole wheat four
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 cup toffee bits
2 cups quick cooking oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 and line a cookie sheet or two with parchment or sil pat.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda then set aside.
In separate large bowl, combine butter and sugars until fluffy.  Mix in the vanilla and eggs.
Add the flour mixture in three batches, and stir to combined after each batch.  Add the toffee bits and oats until just mixed together.
Roll dough into 1 oz balls and place 12 on a prepared cookie sheet(s). Chill balls in fridge for 30 minutes then bake for 10-12 minutes, or until cookies set around the edges but still a little soft in the middle.  Allow to cool on wire rack.
