Ingredients:
12 shucked oysters
12 slices bacon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Set a wire rack into a small baking dish.
Wrap each oyster with a slice of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, paprika, and parsley; set onto wire rack.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately. They aren't as good once they get cold.
