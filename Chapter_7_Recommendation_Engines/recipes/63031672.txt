Ingredients:
The Shell:
3 cups flour
1 1/2 sticks butter (cold and cut into bits)
1 1/2 tsp salt
6 tbsp water
The Filling:
1 lb round steak, coarsely ground
1 lb boneless pork loin, coarsely ground
5 carrots, diced
2 large onions, diced
2 potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 cup rutabaga or turnip, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F
The Shell:
In a large bowl combine flour, butter and salt.  When the ingredients are well mixed add the water one tablespoon at a time to form a dough.  Knead the dough to distribute the butter evenly.  Form the dough into a ball, dust it with flour, wrap it in wax paper and chill for 30 minutes.
The Filling:
Combine and mix all filling ingredients in a large bowl.
Assembly and Baking:
Divide the dough into 6 roughly even pieces.  Roll one of the pieces into a 10" round on a lightly floured surface.  Put 1 1/2 cups of filling on half of the dough round.  Moisten the edges of the round and fold the unfilled half over the filling to enclose it.  Pinch the edges together to seal them and crimp them decoratively with a fork.  Transfer the pasty to a lightly buttered baking sheet and cut several slits in the top.
Repeat this process for each of the remaining pieces of dough.
Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for 30 minutes.
Pull them out momentarily and pour 1 tsp melted butter through a top slit in each pasty.
Continue baking for 30 minutes more.
Remove from oven and cover with a damp tea towel.  Allow to cool for 15 minutes.
