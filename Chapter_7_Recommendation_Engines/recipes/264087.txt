Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 cups dry bread crumbs
4  egg whites, beaten
12 small skinless, boneless chicken thighs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix flour, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Place bread crumbs and egg whites into 2 separate bowls.
Toss 1 chicken thigh in flour to lightly coat; shake off excess. Dip lightly into the egg whites. Let excess egg drip back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides evenly. Place the breaded chicken thigh onto a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken thighs.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
