Description: 
Yum! Yum! Give me some....JAGERBEERS! Try a small one and work your way up! Can be made in a glass of any size,  though I prefer a bucket! The mix is actually 50-50 in whatever size glass you are drinking from. Like I said, I prefer a bucket! Drink . . . ENJOY! WARNING . . . unless you play in a band, take er easy on these. Not for the faint of heart!
