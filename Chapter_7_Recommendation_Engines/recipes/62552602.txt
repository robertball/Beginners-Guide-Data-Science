Ingredients:
1 3/4 cup Dark Karo Corn Syrup
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter AND 1/2 cup lard, OR 1 cup shortening (butter flavored Crisco works well)
1/2 tsp salt
2 eggs, beaten slightly
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 lvl tsp baking soda, dissolved in the buttermilk above
1/2 tsp anise oil or extract
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp cloves
Shy 1/4 tsp ginger
1 cup nuts, finely chopped (pecans or walnuts)
5+ cups flour, or enough to make a stiff dough (I usually end up using about 7+ cups)

Directions:
Boil Karo syrup for 2 mins in a large pan.  Remove from heat and add sugar, butter, and salt, stirring until sugar and butter are melted.  Then cool.  After cooling, add the eggs, buttermilk/soda, and anise oil.  Stir remaining spices into flour prior to adding to mixture.  After a very stiff dough has formed, chill thoroughly.  Roll the dough into ropes about the width of a finger.  Cut each roll with a knife to make small 'pillows'.  Pat pillows slightly to flatten.  Bake in a moderate over (350 degrees) for 8 minutes.
NOTES:  Grease cookies sheets

Description: 
My Grandma made these little cookies every Christmas, and used to gift them out to each of us in reused Pringles cans decorated for the holidays.  We could always eat them like popcorn!  Time consuming to make, but a nice special occasion treat.
