Ingredients:
Secret Chili Spice Mix:
1/4 cup ancho chile powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons ground dried chipotle pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 1/2 pounds ground turkey
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup tomato puree
2 cups water
2 (12 ounce) cans pinquito or pinto beans, drained and rinsed

Directions:
Mix the ancho chile powder, paprika, cumin, salt, chipotle pepper, oregano, cocoa powder, black pepper, and cinnamon in a bowl; set aside.
Heat the olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the ground turkey and garlic. Cook and stir until turkey is no longer pink, breaking up any large chunks, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in the spice mixture. Cook until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir in the tomato puree and water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cook until the turkey meat is broken down, about 1 hour. Stir in the beans, and continue to simmer until flavors have blended, 20 to 30 more minutes.

Description: 
I served mine with some beautifully ripe slices of avocado that gives the final bowl another layer of silky richness. By the way, don't let the cocoa powder in our chili spice mixture throw you off!  My chili was garnished with sour cream, diced jalapeno, cilantro and avocado.Modified from: Chef John's Turkey Chili
