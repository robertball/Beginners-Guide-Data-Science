Ingredients:
3 tablespoons garlic powder
1 large skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks
8  thin slices bacon, cut into thirds

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Place garlic powder in a bowl. Dip each chicken piece into the garlic powder.
Wrap each piece of bacon around a chicken bite. Arrange on the baking sheet so they're not touching.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon turns crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn the pieces after 15 minutes.
