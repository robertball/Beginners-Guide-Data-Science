Dry Ingredients:
1 cup quick-cooking oats
1/4 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger

1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup raisins, optional
2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, optional
Wet Ingredients:
1 egg
1 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
1/2 cup applesauce (I use Motts)
1/3 cup honey

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Line a 7x7" square pan with greaseproof paper or coat with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients together.
In a medium bowl, combine the wet ingredients.
Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the wet ingredients. Stir the wet ingredients in, using two spoons.
Bake for 20 minutes in preheated oven, until firm. Remove and leave to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing into 12 pieces.

Description: 
A recipe I tiddled and tweaked to come up with. It has a distinct taste of honey, and the spices are allowed to shine through. Sometimes, I add some cocoa powder for that subtle taste.

Hope you like this, its one of the first recipes I managed to really tweak up nicely.
