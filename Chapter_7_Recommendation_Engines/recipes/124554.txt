Ingredients:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
6 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup butter
1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries
1 cup water
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 dash ground nutmeg

Directions:
In a shallow bowl, combine flour, salt and pepper; dredge the chicken. In a large skillet, cook chicken in butter until browned on both sides. Remove chicken and set aside.
In the same skillet, combine the cranberries, water, brown sugar, vinegar and nutmeg; cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Place chicken on top; cover and simmer for 30 minutes. To serve, spoon cranberry mixture over chicken.

Description: 
When cranberries are in season, I like to stock the freezer so I can serve this dish year-round. The sauce's tangy flavor complements the chicken very well.
