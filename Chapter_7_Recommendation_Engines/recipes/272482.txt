Ingredients:
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper
3 (1 1/4 pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed of fat
Blackberry Sauce:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 small cloves garlic, minced
3 large shallots, finely chopped
1 carrot, peeled and chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
2 cups Chateau Ste. Michelle Cabernet Sauvignon
4 cups beef stock
3 cups blackberries
2 tablespoons blackberry jam
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 teaspoon espresso powder
Kosher salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Mix vinegar, sugar, salt, paprika, mustard, and pepper together; marinate pork in the mixture for up to 4 hours.
Heat a medium saucepan over high heat and add olive oil. Stir in garlic, shallots, carrot, and celery; reduce heat to medium-high and saute until vegetables begin to brown and caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add Chateau Ste. Michelle Cabernet Sauvignon to deglaze the pan, stirring well.
Stir in stock, blackberries, jam, and balsamic vinegar. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking until the liquid is reduced by half, about 30 minutes.
Strain sauce and return to pan. Bring sauce to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium. Cook until sauce is reduced by half and thickened, about 5 minutes more. Season to taste with espresso, salt, and pepper.
Heat grill to medium heat. Brush the pork with 2 tablespoons olive oil and place on grill. Cook for about 15 minutes, turning each side 90 degrees to make a crosshatch pattern. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 150 to 155 degrees F.
Transfer pork to cutting board and let rest 8 to 10 minutes. Slice and serve with blackberry sauce.
