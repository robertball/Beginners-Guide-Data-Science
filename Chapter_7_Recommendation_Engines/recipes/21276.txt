Ingredients:
4 pounds crabmeat
1 egg
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/8 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM
2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
1 cup saltine crackers, crushed
1 cup mayonnaise
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 egg yolks
1/8 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning TM
3 ounces fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
1 3/4 cups vegetable oil

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, 1 egg, lemon zest, Old Bay Seasoning, chopped basil, crushed crackers and mayonnaise. Mix thoroughly.
Form 5 ounce patties out of the crab mixture (should make about 16 patties), and chill until cold before cooking.
In a skillet, heat 4 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Saute the crab cakes for 4 minutes on each side or until golden brown.
For the sauce, in a blender place the egg yolks, Old Bay Seasoning, lime juice, cilantro, salt and pepper. Blend for 10 seconds. Keeping the blender running, slowly drizzle the oil into the blender. Blend until sauce is creamy.
