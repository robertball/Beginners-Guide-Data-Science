Description: 
Homemade vegetable soup utilizing frozen veggies that is packed full of flavor and on your table in less than 45 minutes. I love a good homemade vegetable soup and find myself buying frozen veggies just so I can make this. Eliminate the celery and there is no chopping whatsoever. It doesn't get any easier than dumping it all, giving it a stir, and walking away.
