Ingredients:
1 T sugar
1 cup warm water
2 tsp yeast
1/2 sourdough starter
3 1/2 cups flour (AP or bread ... I used a mix) 15oz or so
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
2 T butter, room temp
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/8 tsp citric acid
cornmeal for dusting

Directions:
Put sugar, yeast, and 3 or 4 T of the warm water aside to bloom.
Add all other ingredients to mixing bowl (except cornmeal) and mix.
Add yeast mixture and, using dough hook, mix 5 to 10 minutes.
Turn dough out, kneed a few times, then place in a greased bowl to rise (1 to 1 1/2 hours).
Gently turn out dough (try not to deflate too much) and roll out to 1/2" thick.  Cut with 3 1/2" cutter (I used chicken can to shape and then cut with pastry knife).
Place on UNGREASED cookie sheet that has been liberally dusted with cornmeal.  Sprinkle additional cornmeal all over top.  Cover with wax paper and set aside to rise again (45 minutes or so).
Heat griddle to 325 and sprinkle liberally with cornmeal.  Gently transfer muffins to griddle and bake 10 minutes each side.  You might want to preheat oven to 350 while griddling ... can throw them in the oven to tighten up a bit if they've risen high and you're having difficulty getting internal temp to 190.  I only ha d to bake 3 or 4 of them for around 4 minutes or so.

Description: 
The lightest, fluffyiest, most delicious tasting muffins I've ever made.  Dough whips up in no time ... citric acid helps accentuate the sour dough flavor.  Probably the best muffins I've ever made.
