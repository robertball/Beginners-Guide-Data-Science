1/4 cup water
4 eggs
1 cup chopped pecans

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10-inch tube pan.
In large bowl, blend together cake mix, sour cream, oil, 1/4 cup white sugar, water, and eggs. Beat at high speed for 2 minutes. Pour 2/3 of the batter into prepared tube pan.
