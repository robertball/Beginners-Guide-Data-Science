Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
4 skinless chicken breasts
8 drops liquid smoke
pepper to taste
3/4 cup favorite barbeque sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9 x 13" baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Cook the bacon in a skillet, over medium heat, until the edges just begin to crisp but are still pliable, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels.
Rub chicken with liquid smoke and season with pepper. Wrap each chicken breast with 2 slices of bacon in an x-shaped pattern and place into the prepared baking sheet with bacon ends tucked underneath.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; spread barbeque sauce over chicken and bake until the juices run clear, and the chicken is no longer pink inside, about 15-20 minutes more.
Great served with your favorite potato salad and lots of napkins.

Description: 
Those same old chicken breasts get a hearty, smoky flavor when wrapped in bacon and baked with barbeque sauce. You can make them on the grill, too.Modified from: Barbeque Bacon Chicken Bake
