Ingredients:
3 carrots
2 large potatoes
2 hard-boiled eggs
1 can of sweet peas (15-16 oz)
3-4 medium dill pickles
1 medium onion
1/2 teaspoon salt
pepper to taste
2 tbs mayonnaise
2 tbs sour cream
A few slices of cooked meat (optional)-- pre-sliced sandwich meat works well

Directions:
Peel the carrots and potatoes; slice them lengthwise and boil in a large pot until soft, about 15 minutes.
You may add the eggs to the same pot, but take them out about halfway through since they don't take as long as the carrots and potatoes; otherwise, heat them in a separate pot until hard-boiled.
Drain the hot water and cool the vegetables by running cold water over them so they can be handled.
Finely chop the onion, and dice the carrots, potatoes, pickles, and meat.
In a large bowl, combine these ingredients with the can of peas. Add the mayonnaise and sour cream and season with salt and pepper. Stir gently until combined. Best served cold with some good bread!
