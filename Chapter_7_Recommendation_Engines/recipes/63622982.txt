Ingredients:
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 1/2 cups water
6 eggs
1 Tbsp ghee or butter
3 Tbsp ground golden flax seed
Salt to taste

Directions:
Bring rinsed quinoa and salted water to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until water is absorbed (about 15 minutes).
Meanwhile whisk together 6 eggs and add salt to taste.
When quinoa is finished, add eggs and ghee and stir to combine*
The eggs will scramble fairly quickly from the heat of the quinoa, so you only need to cook for 2-3 minutes more, stirring occasionally (overcooking the egg will ruin the end result).
Add golden flax seed to the quinoa and taste for salt.
