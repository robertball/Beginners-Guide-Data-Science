Ingredients:
1 cup salted butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Beat butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Sift flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; mix, 1 cup at a time, into creamed butter mixture until dough is just mixed. Form dough into 1-inch-thick disks and place on a plate; chill in refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll disks into desired thickness on a lightly floured work surface using a floured rolling pin. Arrange dough on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are just starting to turn golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe came from Great Gramma LaLonde's neighbor - Betty Brown. It is the only cut-out cookie I remember Grams Lorette ever making. 
I like them really thin and crispy. Dad prefers them thicker. 
Frosted is the best, using confectioners' sugar, flavoring, and milk.
