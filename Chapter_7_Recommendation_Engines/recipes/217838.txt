Directions:
Combine the pork, tomatoes, green chiles, yams, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, salt, black pepper, and hot pepper sauce in a slow cooker. Cover, and cook on Low until the pork is very tender, 6 to 7 hours.
Stir in the frozen corn, recover, and cook until the corn is hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with shredded Cheddar cheese to serve.

Description: 
After much trial and error, the best way I've found to make Green Chile Stew!  Easy to put together and delicious to eat.  I think the yams and corn give it a little something extra, plus it's a great way to get more veggies in.  All in all a very hearty meal. I like to serve with quartered tortillas for dipping!
