Ingredients:
cooking spray
1/2 (16 ounce) package cellentani (cavatappi) pasta
2 cups heavy whipping cream

Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in cellentani and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain.
Combine cream, egg white, and truffle salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Add mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, bacon, and Gorgonzola cheese. Toss to combine. Add shrimp and toss again. Mix in cellentani pasta with a wooden spoon until evenly distributed.
