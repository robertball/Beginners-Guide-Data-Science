Description: 
Here is a great homemade tomato sauce which is fairly simple to make. Although it tastes rich, you will be surprised to know that except for the olive oil, it is all vegetables. It truly tastes like one of those sauces you have always tried to make. Sometimes the answer is easier than the question.
