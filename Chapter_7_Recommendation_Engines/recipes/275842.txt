Ingredients:
8 ounces bulk Italian sausage
1/2 white onion, diced
1 (24 ounce) jar vodka marinara sauce (such as Safeway® Signature Select™)
4 ounces tomato juice, or as needed
2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup fresh spinach
17 1/2 ounces potato gnocchi (such as De Cecco® No. 401)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and onion in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in vodka sauce and enough tomato juice until you reached a desired consistency. Stir in mozzarella cheese and spinach.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.
Transfer gnocchi to a plate, cover with sauce, and serve.
