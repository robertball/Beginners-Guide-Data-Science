Ingredients:
4  shallots, halved
1  red bell pepper, chopped
3  fresh red chile peppers, or more to taste
1 stalk lemongrass, white part sliced
5  macadamia nuts
2 cloves garlic
1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
salt to taste
¼ cup vegetable oil
4  chicken legs
½ cup light coconut milk

Directions:
Place shallots, red bell pepper, chile peppers, lemongrass, macadamia nuts, garlic, ginger, sugar, turmeric, and salt in a food processor. Pulse into a smooth spice paste.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add spice paste; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken legs and coconut milk to the skillet; stir well to make sure chicken is coated with sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, until chicken is cooked through, about 40 minutes.
Remove chicken from skillet and let cool, about 15 minutes. Reserve sauce for serving.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Grill chicken until skin is dark and caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. Serve with reserved sauce.
