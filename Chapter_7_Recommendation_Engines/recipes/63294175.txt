Ingredients:
2 (9 oz.) packages refrigerated cheese tortellini
2 cups shredded red cabbage
3 bags washed baby spinach
1/2 lb. bacon
1 cup (or more, to taste) cherry tomatoes
1 package Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix, prepared as directed.

Directions:
Dice bacon into small (1/4 inch) squares, and fry until crispy. Drain well on paper towels and cool.
Meanwhile, make dressing as instructed on package. Place about half of spinach in layer on bottom of dish. Follow with layer of about a cup of the cabbage, then a layer of half the tortellini. Arrange tortellini so that it is evenly spaced over the veggies. Sprinkle half the bacon over the layers. Drizzle with half the dressing. Add rest of spinach in another layer, then repeat layers, ending with cherry tomatoes and drizzling rest of dressing across entire salad. End with a few bits of bacon to garnish. Add croutons or fresh parmesean cheese to top if desired. Store in refrigerator and serve chilled.

Description: 
Not your standard 7 layer salad-this is always a big hit at pitch-ins and my wonderful daughter even requests it for her birthday dinner and other family functions. It has that just right side dish flavor and lightness, while still being a special treat. If you use real bacon bits and bottled dressing, it's even faster to have ready for drop in guests !
