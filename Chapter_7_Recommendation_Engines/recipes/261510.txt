Ingredients:
4 large parsnips
6 carrots
8 eggs
8 dill pickles, finely chopped
1 (14 ounce) can peas, drained
1 onion, finely chopped
1 small apple, peeled and finely chopped
1 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup mustard
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Place parsnips, carrots, and eggs into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Cook until vegetables are tender and eggs are hard-boiled, about 6 minutes . Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel. Drain vegetables and let cool until safe to handle.
Place cooled eggs, parsnips, and carrots on a work surface. Chop into small pieces the size of peas, and transfer to a large bowl. Drain pickles of any excess juice and add to the bowl along with peas, onion, and apple. Add mayonnaise, mustard, pepper, and salt; stir thoroughly until everything is coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors sink in, about 24 hours.
