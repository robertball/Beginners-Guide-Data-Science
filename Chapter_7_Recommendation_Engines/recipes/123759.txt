Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1 1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F)
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 (15 ounce) can pizza sauce
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup diced fully cooked ham
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar and salt; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down; press onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan. Spread with pizza sauce; sprinkle with cheese, ham and pineapple. Bake at 400 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is browned and cheese is melted.

Description: 
When a friend ordered this pizza in a restaurant, I was skeptical. But after trying a slice. I was hooked! My family is thrilled that I serve this at least twice a month.
