Ingredients:
small flour tortillas, about 30
boneless skinless chicken breast, 1 package
enchilada sauce, 2 cans
diced tomatoes, 2 cans
sliced olives, 2 cans
cheddar cheese, 4 cups

Directions:
Parboil chicken for about 20 minutes.
While chicken is cooking, get enchilada sauce prepared in a bowl large enough to dip the tortillas in.
Drain chicken and shred when cooled.
Combine some of the enchilada sauce, the diced tomatoes, the olives, and about 2 cups of the cheese with the shredded chicken.
One by one, soak tortillas in remaining enchilada sauce and remove excess.
Put about a tablespoon of the chicken mixture in the middle of each tortilla and roll up. Place the enchilada in your baking dish seam side down.
Repeat this process with your remaining tortillas and chicken mixture.
Sprinkle with cheese and bake at 375 F for about 20 minutes.
Garnish with sour cream and extra cheese if desired.
