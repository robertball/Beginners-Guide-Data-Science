Ingredients:
10 chicken drumsticks and thighs
1 pinch ground black pepper
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
4 cloves garlic, crushed, or to taste
1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup water, or as needed
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Season chicken with black pepper.
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir garlic in hot oil until fragrant. Sear chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Stir vinegar, peppercorn, and bay leaves into pot and bring to a boil.
Pour water and soy sauce into mixture and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until chicken is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. Stir in more water if sauce is too salty.

Description: 
This is our favorite classic chicken adobo using common ingredients. You may use a whole chicken and cut it up in pieces. I prefer a thicker sauce like my dad would make but my family likes it brothy so they can pour it in their rice.
