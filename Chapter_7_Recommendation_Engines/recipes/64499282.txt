Ingredients:
12 ounces linguine pasta
1-1/2 cups diced tomatoes with liquid
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1 sweet onion, sliced
4 cloves garlic, thin slices
1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp salt
Fresh ground black pepper, to taste
2 tsp dried oregano leaves
2 tsp dried basil
large handful of fresh spinach
4-1/2 cups vegetable broth
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Place pasta, tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, in a large stock pot. Pour in vegetable broth.
Sprinkle the pepper flakes and oregano on top.
Drizzle with olive oil.
Add 1/2 tsp salt and some black pepper.
Cover pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a low simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes. Cook until almost all liquid has evaporated - until there is about one inch of liquid left in the bottom of the pot.
Add the spinach 7 - 8 minutes into cooking.
