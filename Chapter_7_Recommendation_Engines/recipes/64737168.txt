Ingredients:
2 tablespoons coconut oil or olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 cup (225g) finely chopped onion
810 medium mushrooms, finely chopped
1/2 cup (115g) finely chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup (115g) finely chopped red bell pepper
1/2 (115g) cup finely chopped carrots
1 jalapeño pepper or other hot pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
1 cup (225g) frozen corn kernels
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons sea salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 28-ounce can (900g) diced tomatoes
1 15-ounce can (425g) tomato purée
1 15-ounce can (425g) kidney beans, drained
1 15-ounce can (425g) black beans, drained
1 15-ounce can (425g) red beans, drained
2 1/2 cups (565ml) water
1/2 cup (115g) dry bulgur wheat
Hot sauce or cayenne pepper (optional)
1/4 cup (a small handful) minced fresh cilantro (coriander), for garnish
Non-dairy sour cream (for example, Tofutti), for garnish (optional)

Directions:
Add the oil to a large pot.
Sauté the vegetables and spices in the oil over medium to medium-low heat for 10 minutes or until tender. Add a few tablespoons of water if the veggies begin sticking to the pot.
Add the remaining ingredients except the cilantro and simmer over medium-low heat, covered, for 30 minutes.
Stir and simmer for an additional 20 to 30 minutes until the veggies are cooked through.
Season with salt and, if more spice is desired, hot sauce or cayenne pepper to taste. Serve sprinkled with the cilantro.
