Description: 
My aunt used to make this delicious side dish when I would visit, and I recently discovered just how easy it is to make. A great way to encourage kids to eat their broccoli! Blanching of broccoli or any form of cooking broccoli is not recommended for this recipe; it tastes best with raw, chilled broccoli.
