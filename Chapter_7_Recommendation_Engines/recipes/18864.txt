Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) package seasoned dry stuffing mix
1 teaspoon ground sage
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
2 boneless, skinless turkey breasts - cooked and shredded
1/4 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
In a large bowl, combine the stuffing crumbs, sage, celery and chicken broth, and then set aside. Place the celery soup and the chicken soup into two separate bowls and add 1/2 of a soup can of water to each. Stir these well and set aside.
Sprinkle 1/3 of the stuffing crumb mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Then layer with 1/2 of the shredded turkey meat and pour the celery soup mixture over this. Sprinkle another 1/3 of the crumb mixture over this, followed by the remaining turkey. Pour the chicken soup mixture over this and top off with the remaining stuffing mixture. Drizzle the melted butter over all and press the entire mixture down into the dish until firmly packed.
Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes.
