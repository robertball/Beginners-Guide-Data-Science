Directions:
Boil pasta in salted water until al dente 8- 10 minutes, drain.
Meanwhile, heat a heavy wide saucepan over medium heat.  Add the olive oil, garlic, sweet bell peppers, onion and chillies.  Saute for 3-5 minutes.
Add chicken broth, milk and bring to a slow simmer then add the raw shrimp, tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook until just pink.
Add the cooked pasta, parsley and stir well cooking until the sauce is thickened adding more milk if it becomes to thick. You want a nice medium thickness sauce. When the sauce has thickened sprinkle the lemon zest over the top, stir.

Description: 
You're going to love this! Being stumped with few ingredients until grocery day, I pulled this recipe together and was quite surprised at how well it came together and how delicious it became. I make it all the time now and the cream sauce does not require heavy cream although you could use it if you prefer.
