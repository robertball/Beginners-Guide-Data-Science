Ingredients:
Fresh, raw cauliflower
A wide mouth jar of leftover dill pickle juice

Directions:
Break or cut cauliflower into bite size pieces. Start with 1/2 head, depending on how much juice you have.
Microwave cauliflower pieces for 1-1 1/2 minutes (this is like parboiling the cauliflower).
Place enough pieces of cauliflower into the jar of pickle juice, so that they can all be submerged.
Take a smaller container (that will fit into the opening of the jar) and place it inside the jar to weight down the cauliflower. I use a small glass mushroom jar. You could also use a ZipLoc baggie filled with anything heavier than the cauliflower.
Refrigerate for at least 2 days before sampling. The longer they brine, the more pickled they will be. Once they are the way you like them, you may remove the small container and put the lid on the jar. Add more cauliflower as you get room in the jar.
When the brine becomes weak, start over with fresh pickle juice.
