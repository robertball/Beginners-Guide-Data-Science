Ingredients:
3 cups cubed French bread
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 cup walnut halves
Honey-Lime Dressing:
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
Salad:
3 cups cubed seeded watermelon
3 cups baby spinach-arugula mix
1/2 cup cubed feta cheese
6 leaves fresh basil, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Toss bread cubes, 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Spread onto a baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake in the preheated oven, tossing once halfway through baking, until golden, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Spread walnuts onto a baking sheet.
Toast walnuts in the preheated oven until golden brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes.
Whisk lime juice, honey, Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cumin, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour in 1/2 cup olive oil, whisking continuously, until dressing is blended.
Combine bread cubes, watermelon, spinach-arugula mix, and feta cheese in a large bowl. Add a few tablespoons of dressing; toss to mix. Sprinkle toasted walnuts and basil on top. Drizzle more dressing over the top.
