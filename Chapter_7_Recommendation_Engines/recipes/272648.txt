Ingredients:
2 eggs, room temperature
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pour eggs, olive oil, canola oil, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, dry mustard, and salt into a large mason jar.
Place the blade of an immersion blender near the bottom of the jar and blend, starting at high speed until combined, about 20 seconds. Raise the blender using an up and down motion and mix until mayonnaise is emulsified, about 1 minute.
Place a lid on the jar and refrigerate until use, for up to two weeks.
