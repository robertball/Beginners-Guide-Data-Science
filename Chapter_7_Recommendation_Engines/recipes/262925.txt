Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound beef stew meat
1 large onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/3 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large carrot, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
6 cups chicken bone broth (such as Kettle and Fire)
1 (28 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup gluten-free ditalini pasta
1 pinch kosher salt to taste
1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Heat oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) on Saute mode. Add beef and onion; cook until beef is no longer pink on the outside, about 4 minutes. Add celery, green beans, carrot, garlic, oregano, dried basil, and pepper. Stir to combine.
Pour broth, diced tomatoes, and crushed tomatoes into the pot with the beef. Stir well. Select Soup setting; close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in kidney beans and pasta. Turn on Slow Cook mode and cook until pasta and vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt. Ladle soup into bowls and top with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.

Description: 
So I feel like I am using my Instant Pot® at least 4 times a week. I have been having a great time experimenting and am amazed at the way the flavors are locked in and how quickly the meals are finished... not to say the super easy clean up. The main insert can go in the dishwasher and I hand-clean the top with very sudsy water.
