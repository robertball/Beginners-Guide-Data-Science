Ingredients:
5 large red potatoes, cubed
1 medium onion, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
salt to taste
1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Toss together the potato, onion, garlic, butter, pepper, oregano, salt, and Parmesan cheese in a large bowl, or a resealable bag.  Remove from bag, and wrap in several layers of aluminum foil, sealing the edges well.
Cook on a wire rack over the hot coals of a fire, flipping over midway through cooking, until the potatoes are tender; about 30 to 40 minutes.  Alternatively, the potato packet may be baked on a cookie sheet in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven.
