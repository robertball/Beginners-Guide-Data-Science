Ingredients:
1/2 pound salted cod fish
2 avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
1 large tomato, diced
1 large Spanish onion, cut into matchstick-size pieces
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 drop white vinegar
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Cook codfish in boiling water to reduce saltiness to your taste, 10 to 25 minutes; drain. Let codfish cool completely.
Mix avocado, tomato, and onion together in a bowl. Break cooled codfish into small pieces, discarding any bones, and add to the avocado mixture; stir gently. Drizzle olive oil over the mixture; add whine vinegar and stir gently. Season salad with black pepper; stir. Cover bowl with plastic wrap.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate salad at least 45 minutes.

This is my mother's Puerto Rican gazpacho salad recipe. I've been eating it since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. It's good and very easy to make.
