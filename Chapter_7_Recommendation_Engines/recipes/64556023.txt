Ingredients:
1 package refrigerated cinnamon roll dough, such as Immaculate brand.
Raisins

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.
Unroll an unbaked cinnamon roll and cut in half.
Roll up one half to form the body. Rotate the roll so the outer end of the roll is facing downward. This will form the bunny's front legs.
Cut off one third of the remaining dough, and roll it up to form the tail. Roll up the last 2/3 dough to about the halfway point to form the head. Slice through the remaining unrolled portion and fan out the pieces to form the ears. To attach the tail and head to the body, rub away any cinnamon coating, wet the dough, and press the pieces together.  Spread out the ears and pinch them at the tips to shape. Repeat with remaining rolls.
Lift carefully with a spatula or scraper, and transfer the bunnies to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Bake for 15 to 18 minutes until golden brown, or follow package directions.
Slide parchment paper with bunnies onto a rack to cool slightly.
Using the glaze that comes with the refrigerated rolls, spread it onto the warm cinnamon rolls, following the pattern of the swirls and ears. To form eyes, press a raisin into the center of the swirl on the head.
