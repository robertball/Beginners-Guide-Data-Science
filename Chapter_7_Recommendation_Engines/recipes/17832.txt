2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups white sugar
1 cup margarine
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon butter flavored extract
2 tablespoons water
4 apple - peeled, cored and diced
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup water
1/2 cup margarine
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together 2 cups flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream 2 cups sugar and 1 cup margarine until light and fluffy.

Finally, stir in chopped apples and pecans.
Pour batter into prepared 9x13 inch pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.
