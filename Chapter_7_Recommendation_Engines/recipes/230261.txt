Ingredients:
2 1/2 pounds beef brisket
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (6 ounce) cans water
2 onions, cut into 1-inch wedges
3 carrots, sliced
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon white sugar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown brisket on both sides and transfer it to a deep pot.
Stir in tomato paste, water, onions, carrots, mushrooms, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until meat is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Transfer to a baking dish, cool, and refrigerate overnight.
About 1 1/2 hours before serving, preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Skim off fat residue from sauce and slice brisket across the grain. Layer beef, vegetables, and sauce in a baking dish.
Cover pan with foil and bake in preheated oven until hot, about 1 hour.

Description: 
This is a different type of brisket recipe with an Eastern European Jewish influence. Unlike most briskets that are cooked in the oven, this brisket is simmered on the stove. Best prepared a day or so in advance. Freezes and reheats well.
