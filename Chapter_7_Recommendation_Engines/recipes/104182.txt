1 head roasted garlic (recipe link below)
2 pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed
2 tablespoons Morton® Nature's Seasons® Seasoning Blend

1 cup gourmet style BBQ sauce
2 tablespoons honey

Directions:
Prepare Roasted Garlic.
Season pork tenderloin with 2 tablespoons Morton(R) Nature's Seasons(R) Seasoning Blend, pressing spices into meat to adhere.
Preheat grill to medium-high (about 450 degrees -500 degrees F).
In a bowl combine roasted garlic, Tennessee whiskey, gourmet style BBQ sauce and honey. Mix well to combine and set aside for basting.
Place seasoned tenderloins onto grill over direct heat. Grill tenderloins for 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-well, basting liberally with roasted garlic BBQ sauce during the last quarter of grilling time, until fully cooked.
