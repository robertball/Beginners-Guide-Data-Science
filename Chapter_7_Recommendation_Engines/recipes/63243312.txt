Ingredients:
Dumplings from the above recipe, doubled
1 1/4 lb eggplant
1 lb slicing tomato
3/4 lb string beans
3 cloves garlic
1 shallot
olive oil
grape seed oil
2 T ricotta
To taste:
basil
thyme
savory
salt
pepper
red wine vinegar

Directions:
Cut the string beans into thirds.  Place them in a pot and pour water in until they are just covered.
Parboil for 15-20 minutes or until they turn color.  Then drain.
Meanwhile, peel the eggplant.  Cut it in half, long ways.  Then slice into thin (1/4") pieces.
Chop the shallot.
Place the eggplant, shallot, and string beans into a frying pan.  Add equal amounts of olive an grape seed oil, enough to just coat the bottom of the pan.  Stop when the eggplant no longer takes any oil.
Place on medium heat for about 20 minutes or until the eggplant is thoroughly soft.  While it cooks, add basil, thyme, savory, salt, pepper, and red wine vinegar to taste, as well as three cloves of garlic, sliced.
Cut the tomatoes in half, from top to bottom.  Slice into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces.
Place on a grill topper.  Add a drop of olive oil onto each.  Season with pepper.
Grill for 5-10 minutes or until hot, flipping them halfway through and re-seasoning.
Toss the all the vegetables with the dumplings and the ricotta.
