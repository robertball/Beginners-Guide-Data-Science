Ingredients:
3-4 small boneless skinless chicken breast halves
1 cup flour
1 cup water
2 eggs
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp paprika
Vegetable oil

Directions:
Mix flour, water, eggs and seasonings and allow to sit for 1/2 hour so batter will stick to chicken. Cut chicken into bite-size pieces. Heat 1/2 inch deep oil to 375 degrees in electric skillet. Dip half the chicken pieces in batter and fry in oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side (don't overcrowd pan). Drain on paper towels. Serve with dipping sauce if you like, but they are great plain!
