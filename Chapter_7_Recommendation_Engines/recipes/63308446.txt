Ingredients:
2 cups basil, packed
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup pecans
2 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
1 one pound package of potato gnocchi (DeLallo brand)
Grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese

Directions:
Combine basil, garlic and pecans in a blender and pulse until coarsely chopped. While running, slowly add olive oil and process until smooth. Add grated cheese and pulse to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Cook gnocchi according to package directions. Drain well. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat. Add gnocchi to the pan in a single layer. Cook without stirring, until golden and crisp, 3-4 minutes. Turn gnocchi and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 to 1/3 cup of pesto. Serve warm, garnished with shaved Parmesan cheese.
