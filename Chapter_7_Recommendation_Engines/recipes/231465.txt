Ingredients:
1 1/3 pounds ground beef
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 egg
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pinch kosher salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
6 slices pancetta
6 hamburger buns, split

Directions:
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, shallot, Dijon mustard, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Refrigerate mixture to incorporate flavors, 20 minutes to 2 hours.
Form ground beef mixture into 6 patties.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; lay pancetta slices in a single layer in the hot skillet. Cook until pancetta begins to sweat, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pancetta from skillet and keep warm.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Cook patties on the preheated grill until burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-well burgers. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Place 1 burger into each of the buns; top burger with a pancetta slice.

Description: 
I made burgers similar to these in my college training, and tweaked them a little to satisfy picky eaters at home! 
Moist and juicy burgers guaranteed every time. Garnish the burger with a slice of pancetta, ancient grainy mustard, red onion slices, iceberg lettuce, and Swiss or blue cheese.
