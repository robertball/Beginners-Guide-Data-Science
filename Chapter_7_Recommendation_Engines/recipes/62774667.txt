Ingredients:
2 lbs. steak (your choice, I used Sirloin, Flank would work well too)
¾ c Soy sauce
¼ c + 2 T Rice vinegar
¼ c Onion (use whatever kind you like), chopped
¼ c Water
2 T Brown sugar
1 T Ginger (powder or minced)
1 T Sesame oil
1 T Peanut oil
1 T Sriracha Asian chili sauce
1 T Lemon juice
1 tsp. ground black pepper
3-4 Garlic cloves (depending on your taste)

Directions:
Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.  Set about ¼ c aside to brush on while grilling.
Pour marinade over beef (I pounded the steak, with a meat hammer, to about ½” thick), and let marinate for at least 1-2 hours in the refrigerator.
Let beef sit out for about 20 minutes before grilling to desired doneness.
Slice thinly, across the grain, to serve.

Description: 
A little spicy, a litte sweet, a very good mix of Asain flavors goes great with big cuts of steak on the grill!   A great family meal.
