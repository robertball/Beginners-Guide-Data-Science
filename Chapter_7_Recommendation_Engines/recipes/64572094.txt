Ingredients:
1 15oz can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped dill pickle
1 teaspoon pickle juice
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
splash of hot sauce (optional)

Directions:
Put chickpeas in a medium-sized bowl and smoosh them with a fork. You don’t have to get every single one, but you want most of them to be broken up.
Add remaining ingredients and mix.
Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary (you might need a little more lemon juice, etc.)
Split between 2 sandwiches or use as a cracker topping (choose a sturdy type, like Triscuits).

Description: 
I love a  footlong tuna sub, that smooshy tuna saladscooped out with an ice-cream scoopthat was as much mayo as it was tuna. That lives on with Faux Tuna Salad Sandwiches. 

There are now a million variations of this around the interwebs, and I don’t remember where I first was introduced
