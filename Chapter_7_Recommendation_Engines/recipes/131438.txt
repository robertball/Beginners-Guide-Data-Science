Ingredients:
2 cups seasoned dry bread crumbs
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
salt and black pepper to taste
2 eggs
2 tablespoons milk
4 (6 ounce) venison loin steaks, pounded to 1/4 inch thick
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine the bread crumbs, flour, salt and pepper in a 1-gallon size plastic zipper bag. Beat the eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.
Dip each steak in the egg mixture, place it in the plastic bag, and shake to coat with crumbs.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat and fry the steaks, turning once, until both sides are golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.

Description: 
I was looking for something different to do with my man's fresh kill, so I just whipped this up from stuff I had in the cupboard. My husband and children loved it. Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy (I used brown gravy, but country gravy may be used for a milder taste).
