Ingredients:
4 slices bacon, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 medium chopped onion
1 (28 ounce) can green beans
2 teaspoons HerboxÂ® chicken bouillon seasoning

Directions:
Heat a saucepan over medium heat, and add the bacon pieces. Fry for a few minutes. Drain off excess grease, then add the onions. Cook and stir until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Drain the liquid from the can of beans and replace with water. Pour in the green beans, and stir in the bouillon seasoning.   Simmer for about 15 minutes. If you wish to simmer longer, add more water to keep the beans from scorching.
