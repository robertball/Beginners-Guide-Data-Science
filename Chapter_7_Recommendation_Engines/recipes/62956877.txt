Description: 
Growing Up In New Jersey One Of The Things We Teens Ate Was Pizza on the Boardwalk, And A Philly Cheese Steak. Since I can't reproduce a Philly Cheese steak here in North Carolina this is as close as I can get. It is best to use a high quality Hoagie roll, but you can substitute a french or Sub roll. Depending where you get your Steak Hoagie you can have a few cheese to choose to go with it. Some people use American Cheese Like (Kraft Singles), Velveeta, Cheez Whiz, Provolone And mozzarella.
