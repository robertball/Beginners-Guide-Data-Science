Ingredients:
3 cups turkey drippings
8 cups turkey stock, or as needed
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup dry sherry (optional)

Directions:
Pour drippings from the roasting pan into a heatproof glass bowl or large measuring cup. Let stand for 5 minutes, then skim off and reserve the fat that has risen to the top. Add enough turkey stock to the skimmed drippings to make 8 cups total. Measure 3/4 cup fat.
Heat the reserved fat in a large skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Whisk in the turkey stock mixture and sherry. Cook, whisking often, until gravy has thickened and no trace of raw flour taste remains, about 5 minutes. Transfer the gravy to a warmed gravy boat.

Description: 
The drippings from your roast turkey are the base for this gravy. If you do not have enough turkey fat after straining your drippings, add melted butter to make up the difference.
