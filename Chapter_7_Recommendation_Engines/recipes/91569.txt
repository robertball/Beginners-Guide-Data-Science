Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup orange juice
2 tablespoons lemon juice

Directions:
Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season tilapia with salt and pepper, and dredge in flour.
Increase heat to medium-high. When wisps of smoke start to rise from the pan, add fish. Cook until well browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn fish, and continue cooking until golden brown and cooked though, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer fish to plates or a platter.
Pour orange and lemon juices into the skillet. Boil until reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle sauce over each fillet, and serve.
