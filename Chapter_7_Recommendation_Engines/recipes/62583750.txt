Ingredients:
1 clove garlic, minced
canola oil for frying
6 corn tortillas
garlic salt to taste
1/2 small can of tomato sauce
1/2 small can of chile del pato (spicy tomato sauce with chiles and herbs--yellow can with picture of a duck in Mexican food section)
1/8 cup chopped onions
1/4 cup grated Monterey Jack, Mexican cheese blend, queso fresco, or feta cheese
1/4 cup onions, chopped
2 flour tortillas
dollop of sour cream per serving (optional)

Directions:
Tear up corn tortillas into tortilla-chip-sized triangles.
Heat about 6 tablespoons of oil. Add tortilla pieces, stirring constantly until crispy and golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Add more oil if necessary.
Add minced garlic and garlic salt. Stir to saute garlic, less than a minute.
Gently stir in tomato sauce and chile del pato until sauces have covered the tortilla pieces. Cook to warm sauces, about a minute. (Longer, and the tortillas get too soggy).
Remove from stove and serve immediately, topped with cheese, onions, and sour cream. Serve with warm flour tortilla.
