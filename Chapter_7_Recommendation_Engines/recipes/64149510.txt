No Churn salted Caramel Ice cream Recipe

Ingredients:
1 ? cups can carnation caramel or dulce de leche
1 ¼ cups heavy cream
1 - 2 teaspoons soft sea salt flakes
1 - 3 tablespoons bourbon (15-45ml)
pecan nuts (optional) for serving

Directions:
1. Scrape the caramel or dulce de leche into the bowl of a freestanding mixer or, if you’re using a hand-mixer, into  a large bowl, add the cream and 1 teaspoon of the salt and whisk until it thickens.
2. Taste to see if it’s salty enough for you, remembering that the saltiness will be much more muted (as will the sweetness) once it’s frozen. If you want more salt (and I always do) add more to taste and begin whisking slowly while adding half the bourbon. Taste again to see if you want to add the rest of the bourbon. If so, pour in whisking gently. I usually end up using 3 baker's tablespoons (which is 45ml).
3. Pour into two 500-ml tubs, or a 1-litre Tupperware if you prefer, and put into the freezer for at least 5 hours or until frozen. It really will depend on your freezer and how much you’ve already got in it.
This ice cream is fairly soft-serve, and will be softer the more bourbon you use, so no need to let it stand out of the freezer before serving.
