Ingredients:
1/4 cup boiling water
1/2 teaspoon lapsang souchong tea leaves
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3/4 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup tamari (dark soy sauce)
1/2 cup canola oil
1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons sherry
1 tablespoon honey

Directions:
Pour boiling water over tea leaves in a mug and steep for 3 minutes; strain and discard tea leaves. Dissolve brown sugar into the tea and set aside to cool.
Combine pineapple juice, tamari, canola oil, ginger, garlic, sherry, and honey in a jar; add tea mixture. Seal jar and shake until the oil emulsifies into the marinade.

Description: 
This marinade works well with beef, chicken, pork, and portobello mushrooms. I like to use sirloin tips or a flank steak sliced on the bias and cook it to medium-rare. The tea adds a touch of smoky flavor. I substitute orange juice if I don't have pineapple juice. I don't always add the sherry, but I use it when I have it.
