Ingredients:
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 lb)
3 Tbsp. grainy mustard
1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 Tbsp. rice vinegar
2 tsp. packed brown sugar
2 tsp. sesame oil
1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Trim any fat from pork.  Cut lengthwise almost but not all the way through; open like a book.
In large shallow dish, combine mustard, vegetable oil, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, salt, pepper and garlic; remove 2 Tbsp. of the marinade and set aside. Place pork in remaining marinade, turning to coat; let stand 10 minutes (Make ahead: Cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.)
Place on greased grill over medium high heat. Close lid and grill turning once and brushing with reserved marinade, until juices run clean when pork is pierced and just a hint of pink remains inside, about 10 minutes. Transfer to cutting board, tent with foil and let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
