Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Trim the bottom 1/4 inch off each Brussels sprout, discarding the small woody stems. Remove any damaged outer leaves and quarter each sprout lengthwise.
Combine Brussels sprouts, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; toss to coat. Spread on a rimmed baking sheet.
Roast in the preheated oven until the insides are tender and the outer leaves are slightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest.
