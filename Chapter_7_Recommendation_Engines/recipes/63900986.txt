Ingredients:
1 boneless, smoked sugardale ham (8-10 lbs)
1 cup honey
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tbl yellow mustard
4 tbl butter

Directions:
Unwrap ham and leave at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350.
Cover baking sheet with a couple sheets of aluminum foil. Wrap your ham in parchment paper, and then tightly wrap in aluminum foil.
Place on baking sheet, flat side down. Bake 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the remaining ingredients in a small saucepan on medium-low heat for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat and let sit until room temperature and the consistency of honey.
After the ham has been in the oven for 45 minutes, remove and discard foil and parchment, turn up the oven to 425.
Score the ham with a sharp knife diagonally, in 1 inch strips, not more than 1/4 inch deep (diamond pattern).
Glaze the ham with 1/4 of the glaze and put in the oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process until the glaze is gone and the top of the ham is a deep brown colour.
Remove ham from oven and let sit 30 minutes prior to serving.
