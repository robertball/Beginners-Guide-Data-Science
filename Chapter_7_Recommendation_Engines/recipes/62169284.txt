Ingredients:
2 to 3 eggs
8 pieces steamed broccoli
3 slices fresh tomato
1/4 cup whipped cream cheese
1 or 2 tablespoons real bacon bits
1 Packet Hollandaise sacue (you can use your own, but I'm lazy in the morning)

Directions:
Prepare the Hollandaise as directed & set to the side.
Spray your omelet pan libererally with non stick spray & let pan heat on stove at medium.
Whip your eggs together then add them to the pan.
While the eggs set/cook fold the bacon into the cream cheese.
When the eggs have set enough for them to flip easily, flip them & turn the heat down to low.
Smooth the cream cheese mixture over the cooked surface of the eggs.
Top half the omelet with the broccoli & tomato.
Fold the omelet & place on plate.
Drizzle the omelet with desired amount of hollandaise.
