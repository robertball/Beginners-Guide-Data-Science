Ingredients:
8 ounces rigatoni or other pasta
1 large or 2 medium zucchini, sliced in 1/4-inch half moons
1 large onion, chopped
1 bell pepper, seeded & chopped
1 small or 1/2 medium eggplant, cubed
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons water (more as needed)
2 14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes (fire roasted, if available)
3 teaspoons dried basil (divided)
2 teaspoons dried oregano (divided)
1 1/2 teaspoon salt (divided)
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
3 tablespoons tomato paste
12-14 ounces firm or extra-firm tofu, reduced fat, if available
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/4  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional or to taste)
1/4 cup pine nuts (omit to reduce fat, see below)

Directions:
Boil the pasta according to package directions, cooking until just barely tender (a little undercooked is better than overcooked). When it’s done, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water before draining the pasta.
While the pasta’s cooking, sauté the zucchini, onions, bell pepper, eggplant, and garlic in 2 tbsp. water in a nonstick pan over medium heat, adding more water if needed to prevent sticking. Cover and cook until onion is translucent and eggplant has begun to soften.
Place one of the cans of tomatoes, including juices, into the blender and puree. When the vegetables are tender, add all tomatoes, the reserved pasta cooking water, 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. salt, the rosemary, and tomato paste; stir, and keep warm.
Preheat the oven to 350F.
Mash the tofu in a large bowl and stir in the nutritional yeast and remaining basil, oregano, salt, and red pepper flakes. Stir in the cooked rigatoni.
Lightly oil a 4-quart casserole dish. Spread a thin layer of the vegetable mixture over the bottom (you just want a little sauce there to keep the pasta from sticking). Place a layer of half the pasta mixture, then cover with half the sautéed vegetables; repeat layers.
Cover the casserole and bake it for 30 minutes. Remove cover and sprinkle with pine nuts, if you’re using them. Bake another 15 minutes.

Description: 
This casserole is similar to lasagna, yet it uses less pasta and more vegetables than most lasagna recipes. However, unlike lasagna, it doesn’t stay layered when you dish it up, so you don’t have to be very careful when assembling it. It’s just as delicious as lasagna, though.
