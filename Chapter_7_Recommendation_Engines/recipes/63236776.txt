Ingredients:
Salad:
1 large bunch Romaine Lettuce
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, grilled.
8 ounce can mandarin oranges, drained
1 red bell pepper, diced or sliced
4-5 green onions, sliced
1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro
6-8 tablespoons dried cherries or cranberries
Black or regular sesame seeds

Vinaigrette
1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice (about 1/2 of a large navel orange)
3 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup canola oil

Directions:
To prepare dressing, combine orange juice, vinegar, dry mustard, sugar, sesame oil, and salt in the jar of a blender.  Blend until sugar is dissolved.  With blender running on low either remove stopper in blender lid, or crack the corner and slowly drizzle in oil, mixing until just combined.  Store dressing in fridge until ready to use, can prepare a day or two ahead of time.
To prepare salads, divide lettuce between 4 plates, top with grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, bell pepper, green onions, cilantro, and dried cherries or cranberries.   Drizzle with dressing and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Serves 4 main dish, or 6-8 sides.
