Description: 
I got this recipe from another 'blue ribbon junkie' friend of mine years ago. It is very firm and very fine textured. It is the only cake I use when doing cake sculpting, and works very well in the 2 piece cake molds. The lowest ribbon it has ever worn, when entered into baking competitions is a Blue Ribbon, and it has gotten as high as Best of Show at a State Fair.
