Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken pieces
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup prepared mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken pieces in a shallow baking pan, skin side up. Combine the honey, mustard, salt, garlic and curry powder and pour the mixture over the chicken.
Poke chicken with a fork and let it marinate in the sauce in the fridge for at least an hour.
Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Then remove foil and baste. Continue baking for another 30-45 minutes, basting every 15 minutes with pan drippings, until nicely browned and the juices run clear.
