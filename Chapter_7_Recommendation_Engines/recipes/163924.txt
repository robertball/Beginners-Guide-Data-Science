Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 pinch kosher salt
2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, packed in olive oil, drained
1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 pinches cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon Cajun style blackened seasoning (Old Bay® recommended)
1 pinch dried parsley
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™)
2 slices pepperjack cheese
4 slices Italian bread

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and celery and season with a little kosher salt. Cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes.
In a medium bowl, stir together the tuna, mustard, mayonnaise and the sauteed onion and celery. Season with cayenne, blackened seasoning, parsley, and hot pepper sauce. Spoon onto half of the bread slices. Top each one with a slice of pepperjack cheese and then the remaining slices of bread.
Spread butter onto the outsides of the sandwich. Fry in a skillet over medium heat until golden brown on the outside and cheese has melted, about 5 minutes total.
