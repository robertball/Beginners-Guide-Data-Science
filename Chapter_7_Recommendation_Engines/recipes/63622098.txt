Ingredients:
1¾ cup oatmeal
3 egg whites
¾ cup unsweetened cocoa
½ cup applesauce
1 tsp. vanilla extract
½ cup yogurt (plain or Greek)
½ tsp cream of tartar
1 ½ tsp. baking powder
1 ½ tsp. baking soda
¼ tsp. salt
1 cup hot water
scant 1 cup sugar
1/2 to 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line muffin tins with cupcake liners or spray muffin tin with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.
In a blender (or food processor) mix all of the ingredients together, except for the chocolate chips. Blend until oats are ground and mixture is smooth.  Pour into prepared muffin tins and bake for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove from the oven and sprinkle chocolate chips on top of each muffin.
Place the muffins back into the oven and bake for an additional 2-5 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
Variations:  Add all the chocolate chips to the batter and skip putting any on top.  Or add half the chocolate chips to the batter and only put a few on top.

Description: 
Yogurt and applesauce keep these butter-free muffins super moist.  When I’m hungry for something chocolate-y I often make these Flourless Chocolate Muffins.  They are incredibly moist, lightly sweet and oh so chocolate-y!  And if you are scared that you’ll eat them all at once, just throw some of them in the freezer for later.
