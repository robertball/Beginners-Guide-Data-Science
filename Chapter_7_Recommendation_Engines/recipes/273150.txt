Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups soy milk
1/2 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup non-dairy dark chocolate chips
1/4 cup soy milk
1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Add 2 cups soy milk, oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract and stir until just combined. Pour batter evenly into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven, watching closely, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving platter with a sheet of wax paper underneath the cake. Let cool completely, about 45 minutes, before glazing.
Combine jam and 1 tablespoon water in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat glaze in a microwave oven at 50% power for about 1 minute.
Combine chocolate chips and 1/4 cup soy milk in the top of a double boiler over medium heat. Stir until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Add coffee granules and stir until smooth. Remove ganache from heat and let sit to thicken slightly, about 8 minutes.
Spoon and spread raspberry glaze all over the top and sides of the cake. Follow with ganache. Allow cake to sit in a cool place until serving. Before serving, remove the wax paper from under the cake.
