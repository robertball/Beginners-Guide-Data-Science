2 (.25 ounce) packages quick-rise yeast
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons salt

1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar and salt.  Add milk, eggs and butter; beat for 2 minutes.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Pour batter by 1/2 cupfuls onto a lightly greased hot griddle; turn when bubbles form on top of pancakes.  Cook until second side is golden brown.
