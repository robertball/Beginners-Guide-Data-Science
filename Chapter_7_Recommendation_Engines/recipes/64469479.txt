Ingredients:
1/2 cup kale, chopped
1/4 cup basil, finely chopped
1/2-1 tsp. red chili flakes
1 oz. chevre goat cheese, softened
6 Tbsp. butter, softened
1 egg
1 3/4 c. flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup cream
Melted butter, for brushing

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300F.
Bake chopped kale on a large cookie sheet for about 10 minutes until lightly crispy. Allow kale to cool.
Combine kale, basil, chili flakes, butter, goat cheese, and egg in a large mixing bowl until well blended.
Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda into kale mixture with hands just until combined.  If dough is dry, add cream a little at a time, until dough comes together.
Chill dough for 1/2 hour.
Preheat oven to 375F.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/2 inch thick.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch rounds with a biscuit cutter or the rim of a small jar.  Handle dough as little as possible.
Bake biscuits for 10 minutes, brush with cream or melted butter, and bake for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until lightly golden.

Description: 
Dinomite's Fluffy Bites were created for GisHwHes 2015's team WastedStars, but you dont have to be a dinosaur-dust mite hybrid to enjoy them!  These delicate basil and kale biscuits are delicious with soups, stews, roasts, or on their own hot out of the oven.
