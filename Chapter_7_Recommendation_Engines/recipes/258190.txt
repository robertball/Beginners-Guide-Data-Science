Ingredients:
1 cup oat flour
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup milk
1/4 cup oil
1 (8 ounce) can pizza sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup sliced pepperoni
1/3 cup chopped onion
1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/3 cup sliced black olives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Combine oat flour, all-purpose flour, and baking powder in a bowl; stir in milk and oil until dough is smooth. Divide dough into 6 pieces and roll each into an 8-inch circle.
Spread some pizza sauce onto 1/2 of each dough circle; top with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, onion, green bell pepper, and olives. Add some more sauce. Fold dough over fillings and pinch to seal and fold over edges tightly. Place pockets on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
