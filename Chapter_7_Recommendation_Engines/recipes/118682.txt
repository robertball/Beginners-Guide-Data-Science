Description: 
Raspberries replace the traditional tomatoes in this unique barbecue sauce shared by Garnet Pirre of Helena, Montana. Red pepper flakes add a little kick to the thick ruby-red sauce. 'This is great over chicken breasts or pork tenderloin,' Garnet reports. 'Brush on the sauce near the end of the grilling time>'
