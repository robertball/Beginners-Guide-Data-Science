Healthy Granola Cups and granola Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
4 cups oats
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
2 Tablespoons honey
2 Tablespoons cinnamon
3 cups mixed anything (I usually use a handful of sunflower seeds, an handful of raisins, pumpkin seeds, flax seed, steel cut oats...)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan and a muffin tin pan.
In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients. Fill each muffin tin 1/2 full, and press firmly. Pour remaining granola mix into greased pan.
Bake tins for 15-20, depending on how crunchy you want them. Lightly browned just around the edges will give you moist, chewy bars. For extra crunchy granola bars, turn oven off but leave the granola inside the closed oven for 20+ minutes.

Description: 
Fantastic bars that have a lot of flexibility.  You can adapt the recipe to your liking.  Great for hikes, long road trips and camping as they store well and keep fairly long -  unless you eat them all! Use any combination of chocolate chips, dried fruit, coconut, pecans, almond slices, or any other tidbits you'd like in a granola bar.Modified from: Easy Granola Bars
