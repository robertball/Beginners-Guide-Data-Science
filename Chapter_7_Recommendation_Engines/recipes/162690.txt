Description: 
The basics of this recipe came from my mom, and it was passed down to her from her mother and Oma.  I changed it a little, and you can too.  You can braise in basically any liquid you want. The short ribs come out so delicious and tender, and there is not an overwhelming sauce to overpower them.
