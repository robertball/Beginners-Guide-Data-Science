Ingredients:
2 tablespoons oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, chopped fine
4 tomatoes, pureed
¼ kg paneer, cubed
½ teaspoon turmeric (haldi) powder
½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder (less if you want)
1 teaspoon cumin (jeera) powder
1 teaspoon coriander (dhania) powder
Salt to taste
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves
¼ cup cream

Directions:
Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add the onions and garlic. Cook till onions are soft and golden brown. Add the turmeric powder, red chilli powder, cumin, and coriander powder. Fry for 30 seconds till fragrant.
Add the tomato puree and cook over medium heat till excess liquid evaporates and the oil separates. Add ¼ cup water, salt, sugar and paneer. Stir gently so that the paneer does not break. Cook 10 minutes so that the paneer absorbs the gravy flavour. Add cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.

Description: 
When we were kids, whenever my parents went out to an adults only party, my mother used to ask us what we wanted for dinner at home. 99% of the time, our choice was pooris and shahi paneer. My mother was always nice enough to oblige. Here is the recipe. It is quite rich and hence a nice treat.
