Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 onion, chopped
1 large potato, peeled and diced
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups frozen corn kernels
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a large saucepan over medium high heat, melt the butter and stir in the onion, potato, bay leaf, cumin, and sage. Saute about 5 minutes, until the onion is tender. Mix in the flour, coating the onion and potato. Pour in the chicken stock and milk. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly until smooth. Reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring frequently, until the potato is tender.
Mix the corn, parsley, chives, and wine into the saucepan, and cook about 5 minutes, until heated through. Remove the bay leaf, and stir in the Cheddar cheese until melted and blended. Season with salt and pepper.
