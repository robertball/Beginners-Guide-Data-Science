Ingredients:
1 30 oz package frozen shredded hash browns -
1 c shredded mild cheddar cheese
1 c shredded jack cheese
1 4 1/2 oz can chopped green chiles
3 green onions, thinly sliced
6 eggs (or 12 egg whites)
1 12 oz can evaporated milk (I use non-fat)
1/2 t onion powder
1 t salt
1/4 t pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Spray 9x12 pan with nonstick spray.
Arrange potatoes evenly in bottom of pan. (It looks like the rest of the ingredients won't fit, but they will, I promise)
Sprinkle with cheese and green onions.
Combine remaining ingredients, mix well, and pour over potatoes and cheese.
Bake uncovered 55-60 minutes.
