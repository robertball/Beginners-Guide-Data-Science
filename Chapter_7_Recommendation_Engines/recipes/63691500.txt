Ingredients:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup whole blanched almonds
1/2 cup finely ground polenta
1/2 cup A/P flour
1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
12 Tbsp. + 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1 cup sugar + 2 Tbsp. white sugar
3 large eggs
3 Tbsp. fresh orange juice
1/4 tsp. almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spread sliced almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet; bake until golden brown, about 10-15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
In a food processor, finely grind the 1/2 cup whole blanched almonds to 6 Tbsp. ground powder. In a medium bowl, whisk together the ground almonds, polenta, flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a 8" round cake pan, brush to coat the bottom and sides. Sprinkle with 2 Tbsp. sugar and line with the toasted almonds.
Combine the remaining butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating to combine after each addition; beat in the orange juice and almond extract. Add the dry ingredients, slowly beating until just incorporated. Pour batter into the prepared pan, smooth top with an offset spatula.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45-50 minutes. Cool cake in pan on a wire rake for 15 minutes, remove from pan and cool completely.
