Ingredients:
10 4"x4" white bread slices, toasted and crusts trimmed
8 oz grated sharp cheddar cheese
5 tablespoons beer
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 cup soft fresh white breadcrumbs

Directions:
Arrange toast so that sides touch on large baking sheet. Combine cheese, beer, butter and mustard in medium saucepan. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; stir in breadcrumbs. Spoon over bread slices to cover. (Can be made 4 hours ahead. Chill.)
Preheat broiler. Broil until topping begins to brown, watching to avoid burning and turning baking sheet around, if necessary, for even broiling, about 2 minutes. Cool 2 minutes. Cut each slice into 5 strips. Transfer to platter; serve.

Description: 
This Welsh dish is also called rabbit. The name rabbit may be traceable to the fact that the Welsh, who live in prime dairy land, were as fond of melted cheese as they were of rabbit. Rarebit may have been a later gentrification of the word, or a reference to the texture of this rare (soft) dish. Either way, it is excellent served in bite-size pieces for a party.
