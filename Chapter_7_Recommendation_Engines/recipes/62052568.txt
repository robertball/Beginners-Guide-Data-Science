Ingredients:
2 pounds Velveeta cheese
8 ounces cream cheese
garlic to taste(I use garlic powder when in a real hurry)
paprika for rolling
chopped pecans(optional)

Directions:
Have velveeta and cream cheese at room temperature. Mix the two together well.  Add garlic, and mix well.  Roll into one large roll, or several smaller balls.  Roll in paprika for a pretty finish.  Also may roll in chopped nuts if desired. It is delicious either way.
