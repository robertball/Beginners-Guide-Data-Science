Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups bread flour
3/4 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp active dry yeast
1 1/2 cups cool water
Cornmeal, steel cut oats, or wheat bran for dusting

Directions:
Combine all dry ingredients in a large bowl and whisk together.
Add the water and stir until thoroughly mixed.  It will be very wet and stick and will not form a ball.  Do not overwork.
Place dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap.  Let sit out of direct sunlight for 12 to 18 hours.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface.  Dust lightly with flour and cover with a cotton kitchen towel.  Let rise an additional 1 to 2 hours.
About 30 minutes before the second rise is complete, put a cast iron dutch oven, lid included, in the oven and preheat to 475 degrees.
Carefully remove the dutch oven and sprinkle the bottom lightly with cornmeal, oats, or wheat bran.
Shape the dough into a ball by folding it over itself a few times.  Gently transfer the ball of dough to the dutch oven.
Dust the top of the loaf with wheat bran or oats, and cover the dutch oven.  Place back in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.  Remove the lid and bake an additional 10-15 minutes, until browned but not burnt.
Remove the pot from the oven and use a sturdy wooden spatula to pry out the loaf.  Allow loaf to cool at least 1 hour before slicing.
