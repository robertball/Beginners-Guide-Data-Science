Description: 
I have made spring rolls in Vietnamese style, Chinese style, Thai style, and even Southwestern style. I created this recipe one day with the kids when I had too much leftover spring roll wrappers. It is easy to prepare, and the kids love to help with the wrapping. Be creative and substitute the fillings!
