Ingredients:
1 (3 lbs) whole chicken
1 lemon
2-3 sprigs of fresh rosemary (or 1 heaped tablespoon of dried)
2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme (or 1 heaped tablespoon of dried)
6 cloves of garlic
Sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
1 teaspoon of olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Rinse the chicken and pat dry with a paper towel.  Carefully loosen skin by using your fingers to separate the skin from the breast meat - if you're really careful you can separate the skin around the legs as well.
Grate lemon peel. Chop thyme, rosemary and 2 cloves of garlic. Place all into a bowl and mix in salt, pepper and olive oil.
Use herb mixture and place under the skin of the chicken. If you were unable to separate the skin of the legs, use a knife to make 2-3 slashes on each of the chicken legs and rub mixture into the legs.
Cut the lemon in half. Squeeze the juice of one half on the skin of the chicken, place the other half inside the cavity with the remaining garlic cloves.
Place on a roasting pan with a tray. Place in oven for approximately 1 hour and 35 mintues.
