Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, or to taste
cooking spray
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup butter
1 pinch salt-free seasoning blend, or to taste
8 frozen hash browns, thawed, or more to taste
3/4 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1 tablespoon dried chives, or more to taste
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and break into small pieces.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x4-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
Mix sour cream, butter, and seasoning blend together in a bowl. Layer 2 1/2 hash browns in the prepared dish. Spread 1/3 of the sour cream mixture over hash browns. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and 1/3 of the bacon on top. Repeat layers twice more. Sprinkle chives and pepper over casserole. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown and casserole is heated through, about 1 hour.
