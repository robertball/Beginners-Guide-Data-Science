1 pound imitation crab meat, shredded (picked apart)
1/2-1 cup celery, finely chopped
1/2 cup Hidden Valley Lite Ranch dressing (preferred brand)

1 tbsp sugar

Directions:
Separate crabmeat by hand.
Mix all ingredients together, crabmeat, celery, ranch dressing, mayonnaise, parsley and sugar. Mix well.

Description: 
I tried for years to duplicate the crab salad that was made in the seafood market i used to work for, but never could. However, I came up with this one and prefer it a whole lot more. My daughter will hide with the batch I make and eat it all. She doesn't like to share.
