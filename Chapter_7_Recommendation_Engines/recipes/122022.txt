Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar

6 (1 ounce) squares white baking chocolate, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup coarsely chopped macadamia nuts, toasted
Additional sugar

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter, shortening and sugars. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in chocolate and nuts. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or until easy to handle. Roll into 1-in. balls. Dip each ball halfway in water, then in sugar. Place sugar side up 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets; flatten slightly. Bake at 400 degrees F for 8-10 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
An aunt and I baked a similar cookie often when I was growing up. Through the years, I added the macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips. My family and co-workers rave about these.
