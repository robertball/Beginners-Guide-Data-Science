Ingredients:
6 Cups Dinomite Cereal (or a rice crisp cereal alternative)
1 Package Chocolate Marshmallows
3 tsps. Mint Extract
Chocolate Syrup (you decide)
1/2 bag Frozen halved Strawberries
3 Tablespoons Butter
Kale Salad base (to change it up)

Directions:
Melt butter and the mint extract and mix in the chocolate marshmallows until you have a gooey paste, then add the cereal. Mix until all is a sticky mass, using your hands, make small rounds of the cereal mix wrapped around your strawberry pieces.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes and enjoy as a fun little treat. For a healthier alternative, spread the small cereal and fruit balls over a bed of kale for a delicious salad, drizzle with chocolate sauce for a desert salad treat!
