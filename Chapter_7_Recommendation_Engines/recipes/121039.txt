Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 eggs
1 cup buttermilk
2 cups diced fully cooked ham
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, mustard and cumin. In another bowl, beat eggs and buttermilk. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Fold in ham and 1-1/4 cups cheese. Fill greased muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. Serve warm.  Refrigerate leftovers.

Description: 
While living in Oregon, I frequented a local restaurant that served these muffins. They wouldn't share the recipe, so I came up with my own creation.
