Ingredients:
2 TBs Ghee
1 Onion finely chopped
4 cloves ,minced garlic
1 tsp ginger
1 TBs cumin
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp Cayenne pepper
1 1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp tumeric
1  (14oz) can tomato sauce
2 tsp paprika
8oz (half-pint) heavy whipping cream
1TBs + 1tsp sugar

Directions:
Heat the ghee up, sautee the onions until clear. Drop garlic in near
the end of the sautee.
Add in all dry ingredients except paprika, sautee for another 2 minutes.
Add tomato sauce, bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat, simmer 10 minutes.
Stir in paprika and cream, simmer until its nice and thick.
You may want to hold back 1/2tsp salt and 1tsp sugar until its hot and
mixed, and see if it's sweet/salty enough for you as-is.  I also added
much more cayenne pepper than 1tsp, but I give out the recipe like
this for people who dont like heat.
I make vast quantities of the sauce at one time, and it freezes very well.
For the chicken, I basically just chop it up raw, then toss it in a
little oil and some curry powder, then sear the outside in a pan for a
few minutes.  Then I throw the half-cooked chicken into the saucepan
with the sauce and let it simmer for a half hour

Description: 
A classic curry-stand recipe.  This is not haute cuisine, this is the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala that you crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2am.
