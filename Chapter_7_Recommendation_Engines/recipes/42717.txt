Ingredients:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
2 eggs, beaten
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chocolate chips, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)).
Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl. Mix sour cream and baking soda together in a separate bowl.
Beat flour, white sugar, butter, eggs, baking powder, and vanilla extract together using an electric mixer in third bowl. Beat in sour cream mixture until combined. Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan; top with 1/2 of the brown sugar-cinnamon mixture. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chocolate chips. Layer remaining batter, brown sugar-cinnamon mixture, and chocolate chips.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
My aunt Enid passed down this recipe to me. It's an incredible sour cream coffee cake with a twist; cinnamon and chocolate chips make a wonderful combination. It will be a big hit when you serve it! I brought it to a Navy wives' social and it was gone in minutes!
