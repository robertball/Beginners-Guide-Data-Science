Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound fresh okra
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Prepare a grill basket with cooking spray.
Trim stem ends of okra close to the top without piercing the pods; put into a large bowl.
Drizzle canola oil over okra pods. Season okra with garlic powder, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Spread okra into the prepared grill basket.
Cook on preheated grill, turning frequently, until tender and browned in spots, 4 to 6 minutes.

The best healthy alternative to breaded fried okra. So good with fresh purple hull or field peas on a vegetable plate, or so good served as an appetizer with my 'ComeBack My Way' sauce!
