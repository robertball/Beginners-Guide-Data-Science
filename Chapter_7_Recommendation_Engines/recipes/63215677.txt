Ingredients:
1 large English cucumber, with skin, finely diced
3 cups grape tomatoes cut in half
1/2 red onion finely diced
3/4 cup chopped Italian parsley or cilantro
3/4 cup chopped fresh mint
2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
Ground sumac, for garnish
Good quality sheep's milk feta
2 small pita bread fried until golden brown

Directions:
Within a few minutes of serving, so the pita doesn’t become soggy, combine the pita, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, cilantro (parsley), mint, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning; you may need more olive oil, lemon juice, salt, or pepper. Finally, using a small cheese grater, grate the cheese on top of the salad. Sprinkle with Sumac and serve. Enjoy!

Fattoush is one of the most well-known of Arabic salads and a standard dish on the Mezza table. It’s a colorful tossed salad with a lemony garlic dressing, and if you’ve never made a single Arabic dish, this is a delicious and healthy place to start.
