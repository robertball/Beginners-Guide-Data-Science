Ingredients:
1 boxed cake mix, 18.5 oz, spice or any flavor
2 eggs
2 tbsp water
1/4 cup canola oil
1 large can pie fillilng, apple or any type
1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream, or any preferred flavor
1 jar caramel sauce, or any ice cream topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.
Coat inside of 9x13 inch pan with cooking spray
In large bowl, combine cake mix, two eggs, 2 tbsp water, and 1/4 cup canola oil.  Mix thoroughly.  The batter will be extremely thick and sticky -- if it is crumbly, add water in 1 tbsp increments until desired consistency is reached (should remind you of moist bread dough).
Transfer batter to pan.  It is easiest to press this mixture into the pan with greased or buttered hands.
Bake for 12 minutes or until slightly firm to the touch.
Remove from oven.  Top with pie filling.
Return to the oven and bake for an additional 12 minutes.
Remove from oven.  Allow to cool for ten minutes, then serve with ice cream and caramel sauce or other topping.
