Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pour enough oil into a skillet to completely coat the bottom and heat over medium-high heat.
Blend flour, sugar, water, milk, egg, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt together in a blender until smooth. Add more flour if batter is too watery. Put your finger over the hole of a funnel and fill funnel with batter.
Hover filled funnel over the skillet, release finger, and swirl batter into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.
