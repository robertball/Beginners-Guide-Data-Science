2 slices bread
3 tablespoons applesauce

Directions:
Heat a skillet over low heat. Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Place bread slices, buttered side down, in skillet. Divide applesauce onto both slices of bread, and spread to the edges.
Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Fold slices together, and cool 5 minutes. Cut into quarters.

Description: 
This recipe is made just like a grilled cheese, except with applesauce. The applesauce kind of soaks into the bread as it cooks. This is a great snack that my Mom used to make for me as a child. My children love this as a 'late night' snack.
