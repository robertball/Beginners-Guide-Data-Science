Ingredients:
3 tbsp. olive oil
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 lb. medium shrimp, cooked*
1 can artichoke hearts, drained and cut in half
3 c. 1/2 & 1/2
1 tbsp. corn starch (optional)
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. white pepper
1 8 oz. pkg 7 grain fusilli pasta or pasta of your choice
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil and begin cooking pasta.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over med. heat.
Add garlic and saute until slightly brown.
Add shrimp and artichoke hearts.  Saute until heated through.
Stir cornstarch into 1/2 & 1/2.  Add to shrimp & artichokes, stir until sauce is thickened.
If you like a thinner sauce, omit the cornstarch.
Add salt and pepper.
Serve immediately over cooked & drained pasta.
Top with Parmesan cheese, as desired.
* I buy frozen, already cooked shrimp in 2 lb. resealable bags.  Just thaw the shrimp and remove the tails.  Store the remaining one pound in the freezer for another recipe or shrimp cocktail.
