Ingredients:
1 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons water
1/2 cup sugar
1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin
1 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1 cup frozen lingonberries, thawed

Directions:
Combine the cream, water, sugar, and gelatin in a saucepan over low heat.  Stir constantly until the gelatin has dissolved.  Remove from the heat and let cool slightly until thickened, about 10 minutes; it should be the consistency of beaten eggs. Fold in the sour cream, vanilla extract, and almond extract.  Pour into a mold, cover, and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
Loosen from mold by dipping into hot water.  Invert onto a serving plate to unmold.  Pour lingonberries over top.

Description: 
This is a dish my sister makes for special occasions. It is not too sweet and it's very rich and creamy. If you like a sweeter dish, double the sugar. This makes for a lovely presentation that looks like you went to a lot of effort but didn't.
