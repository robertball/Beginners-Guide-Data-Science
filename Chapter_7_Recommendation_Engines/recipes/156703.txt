Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 (16 ounce) package milk chocolate chips
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (16 ounce) package colored miniature marshmallows
2 cups flaked coconut

Directions:
Melt the butter and chocolate chips in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; mix until smooth and creamy; remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Fold in the marshmallows and walnuts.
Scatter about half of the coconut onto a large baking sheet. Form the chocolate mixture into two oblong logs and lay them onto the coconut. Use the remaining coconut to coat the logs. Refrigerate until the logs are firm, about 1 hour. Cut logs into 3/4-inch slices.

I see two other recipes for these, but this is our version we use every year. They are an absolute hit at cookie exchanges as they are different, not to mention very easy and tasty!
