Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package tofu, drained and cubed
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
8 ounces dry rice stick noodles
Sauce:
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup sriracha hot sauce
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon tamarind concentrate
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 onion, sliced
1 egg (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped spring onions
1 tablespoon crushed peanuts
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Coat tofu with cornstarch in a bowl. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat; fry tofu until lightly browned on all sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Place noodles in a bowl and pour in enough boiling water to cover; soak until softened, about 3 minutes. Drain.
Combine water, sriracha, soy sauce, sugar, tamarind concentrate, and red pepper flakes in a saucepan over low heat. Cook and stir sauce until flavors blend, about 5 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add tofu, noodles, and sliced onion; cook and stir until tofu is golden brown; about 3 minutes. Stir in sauce gradually until noodles are well-coated.
Push noodle mixture to one side of the wok. Crack egg onto opposite side of wok; stir until beginning to set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir egg into noodles gently. Garnish with green onions, peanuts, and lime wedges.
