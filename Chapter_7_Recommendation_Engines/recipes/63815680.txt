Ingredients:
1 stalk celery
1 clove garlic
1 onion, quartered
3 tbs olive oil
1 can 28 oz peeled tomatoes, drained and mashed
1 tsp sage
1 head cauliflower, cut into small florets
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Cooked pasta of your choice!
salt and pepper to taste
chicken broth as needed

Directions:
Put a small slice of celery in a deep skillet with a cover. Add the olive oil. Heat the olive oil over medium high heat until the celery slice is sizzling. Add the celery, garlic, and onion. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, sage, cauliflower florets, and salt and pepper, heat on medium high until bubbling, then cover and turn the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes, or until a knife slides easily into the cauliflower florets. Add chicken broth as needed if it looks like it's going to burn. Meanwhile, cook and drain the pasta. Pour the sauce over the pasta, add the cheese, mix and serve!

Description: 
The sauce was the star here--really deep flavor even though this was something I threw together just to use up some vegetables. You could sub practically any vegetable for the cauliflower, that's just what I happened to have in my veggie drawer!
