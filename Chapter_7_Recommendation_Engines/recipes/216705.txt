Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained
1/2 (14 ounce) bag flaked coconut, or more to taste
3 cups cooked mashed sweet potatoes
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup milk
1/2 cup butter, melted
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup finely chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Beat the pineapple, coconut, sweet potatoes, white sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, milk, and 1/2 cup melted butter together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Pour mixture into the prepared pan; set aside. Mix the flour, brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and pecans in a bowl. Sprinkle pecan mixture over the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbly and the topping is browned, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe was given to me in the late 1980s by Diane Thornton in Jackson Mississippi.  I have made it each year since, and when I bring it to gatherings people rave about it, so I bring it year after year.  Some people say it's more like a desert than a side dish. All I know is that it's a standby for me and always gets a nod.
