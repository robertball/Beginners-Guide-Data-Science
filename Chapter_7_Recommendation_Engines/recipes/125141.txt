Ingredients:
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 pounds boneless beef sirloin steak

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first eight ingredients. Trim fat from steak and slice across the grain into 1/2-in. strips; place in a large resealable plastic bag; add marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for 2-3 hours.
Drain, discarding marinade. Loosely thread meat strips onto six metal or soaked wooden skewers. Grill, uncovered, over medium-hot heat for 7-10 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness, turning often.
