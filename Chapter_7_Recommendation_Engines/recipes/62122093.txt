Ingredients:
2 lbs	ground pork, 80/20 or leaner
1 TBS	oil, olive or canola
1 tsp	black pepper, coarse ground
1 tsp	red pepper flakes (omit for mild Italian sausage)
1 tsp	fennel seed, coarse ground
1 tsp	paprika
1 tsp	onion, minced
1 tsp	garlic, chopped
1 tsp	basil
1 TBS	white wine

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, pour in oil. Add 1 pound of ground pork to bowl.
Sprinkle remaining ingredients across the meat. Add rest of meat to bowl.
Knead mixture to infuse spices into the meat evenly.
Roll about 4oz or 1/4 cup of mixture into a meatball, then into a sausage link of about 1 inch thick by 4 inches long. Or, roll into 1oz meatballs. Refrigerate for an hour; overnight is better.
Either bake in 325 degree, or pan fry on medium, until well done, about 160 degrees internal.
