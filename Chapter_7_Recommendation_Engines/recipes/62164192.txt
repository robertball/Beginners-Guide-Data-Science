Ingredients:
1 tbs. water
1 cup fresh or frozen berries (any kind, I like a combination of cranberries, strawberries, and blackberries best)
1/2 cup honey
1 cup butter, softened

Directions:
In a small saucepan, combine the berries, water, and honey. Cook over medium-low heat until berries form a thick sauce, stirring often. This should take about 15 minutes. Cool, and chill overnight. Whip butter until smooth and creamy, beat in enough berry mixture to suit your tastes. Whip for about 3 minutes, or until smooth and well combined.
