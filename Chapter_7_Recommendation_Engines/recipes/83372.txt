Ingredients:
1 (5 1/2 pound) corned beef brisket
2 tablespoons pickling spice
1/2 cup light corn syrup
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the corned beef brisket into a Dutch oven, and season with pickling spice. Fill with enough water to cover the roast, and place the lid on.
Bake for 2 1/2 hours in the preheated oven. Then, remove it from the Dutch oven and place on a broiler pan. Preheat the oven's broiler.
While the meat is roasting, mix together the corn syrup and mustard in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook over medium heat until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
Spread the mustard glaze over the roast, and broil for 5 to 7 minutes, until the glaze is shiny.

Description: 
This is a great tasting, tender corned beef that you simmer in seasonings then glaze and finish in the broiler.  Great tasting and a nice alternative to the traditional boiled corned beef.  So easy and only a few ingredients.
