•	3/4 tsp baking powder
•	1/2 white granulated sugar
•	1/2 cup cream cheese, at room temperature
•	1/2 cup full fat yogurt, at room temperature
•	3 eggs, at room temperature
•	1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste

If desired, create more swirls by using use a bamboo skewer in a circular motion taking care not to stir the mixture but simply creating a design.
7.	Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool before removing from the pan.
