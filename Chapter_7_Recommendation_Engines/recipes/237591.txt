Description: 
Delicious guacamole and crazy easy to make. If your avocados are large, you can use three. Don't skimp on the salt or over-do the lemon. Lime juice can be substituted for the lemon juice. Take the seeds out of the jalapeno pepper for less heat. Otherwise it's pretty fail-safe. We've created many new guacamole fans by this recipe!
