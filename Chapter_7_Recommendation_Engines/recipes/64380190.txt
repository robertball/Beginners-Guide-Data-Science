Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 lb macaroni
8 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup muenster cheese, shredded
1/2 cup mild cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
1/2 cup monterey jack cheese, shredded
2 cups half-and-half
8 ounces Velveeta cheese, cubed
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/8 teaspoon fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Lightly butter a deep 2 1/2 quart baking dish. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a rapid boil. Add macaroni and the 1 TB oil. Cook for 7 minutes, or until somewhat tender. Drain well, and return to the pot.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, melt 8 TB of the butter.
Stir into macaroni.
In a large bowl, combine all of the shredded cheeses.
To the macaroni, add 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheeses, half and half, the cubed cheese and the eggs, and the seasoned salt and pepper.
Transfer to the prepared casserole dish, and top with remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Dot with remaining 1 TB of the butter.
Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the edges are golden brown and bubbly.
Serve hot.
