Ingredients:
2 kiwis, peeled and diced
2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and diced
8 ounces raspberries
1 pound strawberries
3 teaspoons white sugar
2 teaspoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons apricot preserves
20 (10 inch) flour tortillas
butter flavored cooking spray
3 cups cinnamon sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, thoroughly mix kiwis, raspberries, strawberries, white sugar, brown sugar and fruit preserves. (Save apples in lemon water until just before serving.) Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Coat each side of 4 flour tortillas with butter flavored cooking spray.  Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon mixture. Stack and cut into wedges with pizza cutter.  Arrange in a single layer on a large baking sheet.  Spray again with cooking spray.
Bake in the preheated oven 8 to 10 minutes; chips will get crispier as they cool. Allow to cool approximately 15 minutes. Serve with chilled fruit mixture.
