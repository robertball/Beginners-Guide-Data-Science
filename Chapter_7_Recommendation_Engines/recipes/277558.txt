Description: 
My husband and I tried a ridiculous amount of guacamole over our decades together, but no recipe ever hit home for us. After much experimenting, I finally created a recipe we can't get enough of. It even beats every restaurant we've ever been to. The two of us can eat this whole bowl in one sitting, and enjoy every bite. I'm so happy to share it with you. Now Taco Tuesday can be any night of the week! Serve it with tortilla chips, or use it to top tacos, quesadillas, fajitas, burritos, and more.
