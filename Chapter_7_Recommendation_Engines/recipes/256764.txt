Ingredients:
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup flour
1 (1.12 ounce) package McCormick® Cheesy Taco Seasoning Mix
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup beer, such as an IPA from an Oregon Brewery or your favorite local IPA
2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Melt butter in large saucepan on medium heat. Sprinkle with flour and Seasoning Mix. Cook and stir 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk and beer until smooth. Stirring constantly, cook 5 minutes or until sauce starts to thicken. Gradually whisk in cheeses until melted and smooth.
Transfer cheese mixture to warm fondue pot or slow cooker to keep warm, if desired.

Description: 
Oregon has more breweries per capita than any other state. As a result, it's no surprise this Oregon-inspired dip includes beer in the recipe! Using your favorite brew (we recommend an IPA), mixed with McCormick® Cheesy Taco Seasoning Mix and Cheddar and Swiss cheeses, it's tailgate-ready in a half an hour. Pretzels make the perfect dippers, along with crusty bread or chips.
