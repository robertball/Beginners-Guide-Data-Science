Ingredients
2 cans (8 oz) Pillsbury™ refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1/2 cup well drained roasted red bell peppers (from a jar)
8 slices provolone cheese, halved
1/3 lb deli sliced hot salami
1/4 lb deli sliced ham
1/4 lb deli sliced capocollo
1/2 cup well drained hot pepper rings (from a jar)

Directions:
Steps
1 Heat oven to 375°F.
2 Unroll both cans of dough; separate into 8 rectangles. On ungreased 12-inch pizza pan, arrange rectangles in ring so short sides of rectangles form a circle in center. (Dough will overlap; half of each rectangle will hang over edge of pan. Dough ring should resemble a sun.)
3 Spread roasted red bell peppers towards center of ring on bottom halves of rectangles. Top with half of the cheese. Layer salami, ham and capocollo slices over cheese. Arrange pepper rings over top. Cover with remaining half of cheese.
4 Bring each dough rectangle hanging over side of pan up over stacked filling, tucking dough under bottom layer of dough to secure it. Repeat around sandwich until entire filling is enclosed (some filling might show a little but that is okay.) Sprinkle with black pepper.
5 Bake 18 to 22 minutes or until dough is golden brown and thoroughly baked. Remove from oven; cool 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into serving slices.
To drain the roasted red bell peppers thoroughly, use a fine mesh strainer, then set on a few paper towels to absorb any extra moisture.
