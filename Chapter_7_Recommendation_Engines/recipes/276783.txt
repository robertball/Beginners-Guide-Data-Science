Ingredients:
Noodles:
8 ounces Japanese udon noodles
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, drained
1 1/2 cups shredded cabbage, or more to taste
1 cup shredded carrot
1 small sweet red pepper, seeded and cut into thin strips
2 scallions, or more to taste, thinly sliced
Peanut Sauce:
1/2 cup vegetable broth
6 tablespoons natural peanut butter
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, pat tofu dry and cut into small cubes; set aside. Place cabbage, carrot, red pepper, and scallions in a large bowl.
Whisk together vegetable broth, peanut butter, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and cayenne pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring mixture to a simmer and whisk constantly until thickened, about 1 minutes. Set peanut sauce aside to cool.
Drain noodles in a colander and rinse with cool water to refresh. Add noodles to the cabbage mixture. Add peanut sauce and tofu; toss gently to mix. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
