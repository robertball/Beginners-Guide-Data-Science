Directions:
Line two 9×5 loaf pans or one 11×7 inch baking pan  with foil or parchment. Lightly butter or spray the foil.
Combine butter, honey and brown sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter is melted.
Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat to medium-low and simmer until the sugar is dissolved, ~2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat.
Add the granola, rice cereal, and dried fruit into the saucepan and fold them into the sauce until evenly coated.
Quickly mix in the chocolate chips (so they don't melt)then spread the mixture into the prepared pans and press firmly with a spatula to evenly fill. If the pan is too hot and melts your chocolate chips you can sprinkle the chocolate on top of the granola mixture before you press it into the pan.
Let sit for 15-20 minutes or until mostly cooled and set*; lift out of the pan and cut into bars.
