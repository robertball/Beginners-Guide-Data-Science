Ingredients:
1 pound spicy bulk pork sausage
1 pound lean ground beef
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 onion, chopped
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
10 cups shredded cabbage

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir diced tomatoes, onion, tomato paste, vinegar, chili powder, salt, and red pepper flakes into the sausage mixture; add cabbage and fold into the mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
This is a huge hit at potluck suppers. You can adjust the spiciness to your own palate. I also think it just gets better the next day!
