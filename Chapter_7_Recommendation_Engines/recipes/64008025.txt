Ingredients:
1 Box Pasta(about any dry pasta shape will work. I prefer corkscrews)
1 TBS Butter
1 TBS Flour
1 Package dry Ranch dressing seasoning mix
2 Cups Half and Half
1 Cup Shredded Cheese (any flavor will work but I recommend mozzarella or swiss)
2 Cups Meat from a Rotisserie chicken
4 Slices Bacon, Chopped for Garnish (more if you really like bacon)

Directions:
Cook the Pasta according to the directions on the box.
While that is cooking, Fry the bacon.
While that is frying, in a medium/large pot, heat the butter over medium high heat. Add the flour and stir for one minute.
Slowly add the Half and Half, and stir until heated.
Add the cheese... Again, Stir until melted.
Add the Dressing mix, and continue to stir.
By now, the pasta should be done, drain and add to the sauce.
Add the chicken, stir to combine!
Garnish with the bacon...
