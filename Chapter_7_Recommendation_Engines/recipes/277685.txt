Ingredients:
1/2 cup plant based butter (such as Country Crock速 Plant Butter)
1 cup erythritol confectioners' sweetener (such as Swerve速)
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup dark chocolate chips (such as Lily's速)
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

Directions:
Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper, extending the ends over the sides of the pan.
Microwave plant based butter for 45 seconds or until melted. Add confectioners' sugar, graham cracker crumbs, and 1/2 cup peanut butter; mix well. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan.
Microwave chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons peanut butter for 45 seconds. Stir and continue to microwave at 20 second intervals until melted. Pour over graham cracker-peanut butter mixture and spread with an offset spatula until smooth.
Refrigerate until semi-hardened, about 30 minutes. Score chocolate layer with a knife so that chocolate layer will not crack when cutting into bars. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 more minutes.
Remove dessert from pan by pulling on the extended parchment paper; cut into bars.
