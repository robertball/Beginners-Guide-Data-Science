Ingredients:
1 large Onion, cut into quarters
6 Tablespoons olive oil
2 large Aubergines (Egg plants), stalks and greenery removed, cut into quarters
1 small green bell pepper, deseeded
1 plump clove garlic, crushed
Salt
Freshly milled black pepper
Lemon juice

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pan, medium hot.
Using a food processor, chop the onion, then soften it in the oil for 5 minutes.
Briefly chop, in the same food processor, the Aubergines and Green pepper, then add the contents to the pan along with the garlic.
Cook over a gentle heat until the vegetables are just tender and the mixture is thick. Most of the juice should have evaporated.
Season to taste with s and p.
Add some lemon juice to bring out the flavours.
Chill thoroughly in the fridge before serving on hot toast.
