Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup ice water
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
1 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water a tablespoon at a time until mixture forms a ball. Divide dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Roll one ball out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate. Roll out top crust and set aside.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)
In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and cinnamon. Mix well and pour into pie shell. Dot with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until golden brown.
