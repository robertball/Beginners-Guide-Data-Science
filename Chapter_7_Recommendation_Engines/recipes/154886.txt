Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bulk pork breakfast sausage
4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
2 1/2 cups milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare a baking dish with cooking spray. Preheat the baking dish in the oven.
Brown the sausage in a skillet over medium heat; drain.
Mix the flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla to form a batter. Add the sausage and stir. Pour into the preheated baking dish.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the dish comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before cutting to serve.

Description: 
I wanted a pancake and sausage casserole for deer camp and at home, too, since we have a good-sized family. I wanted to have something that would be ready for everyone to sit and eat together. I couldn't find one, so I began experimenting. Finally, I am satisfied with this one. All of my tasters agreed it worked. Top it with butter, syrup, or your favorite topping.
