24 oz sour cream
32 oz shredded italian cheeses (mozz, prov, etc)
2 or 3 jars pasta sauce
fresh basil

Directions:
Mix ingredients well in crock pot. Cook on low 4 hours. Stir gently near end to not break up pasta. Check after 2 hours to see if it's too dry or overcooking. Pasta may stick to sides after cooking. Don't scrape sides. May need extra sauce.
