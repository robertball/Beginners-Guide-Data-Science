Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup light cream
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration
1/2 cup butter
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut 1 cup of the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the cream and form the dough into a ball.
Roll dough out 1/2 inch thick and cut with a small round cutter. Roll cut circles in granulated sugar and place on ungreased cookies sheets. Prick cookies a few times with a fork.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool before frosting.
To Assemble: Frost bottoms of half of the cookies and place the remaining cookies on top to make sandwich cookies.
To Make Buttercream Frosting: Beat 1/2 cup of the butter until fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar. Beat in the evaporated milk and the vanilla. Adjust milk and confectioners' sugar amounts to get buttercream to a good spreading consistency.
