1 tbs avocado oil
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbs crumpled bacon, optional

In a medium bowl add the oil, salt and pepper. Mix well
Trim the ends off the sprouts and remove any discoloured leaves.
Cut each sprout in half and add to the bowl, turn to coat.
Air fry for 5 minutes, shake the sprouts and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
Turn out into a serving dish and sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar, turn to coat
If using the bacon, add it now.

Description: 
Sweet/tart balsamic pairs well with the bitterness of Brussels Sprouts and the bacon adds a smokey flavour. After 10 minutes there's still some bite to the sprouts, add a few more minutes for a softer texture if  desired.
