Description: 
They have a yummy crusty top and sides, while the middle is squishy, chocolately goodness. I like to cut two, put ice cream in the middle and freeze for a short while. They tend to get a little chewy around the edges while the middle is still soft, so the recipe isn't perfect, but still yummy
