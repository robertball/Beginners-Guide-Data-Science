Ingredients:
4 medium apples - peeled, cored and sliced
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup sour milk*
1 egg
TOPPING:
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Divide apples evenly between two greased 9-in. pie plates; set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, sour milk and egg; mix well. Divide batter and pour over apples. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until pies are lightly browned and test done. Invert onto serving plates (so apples are on the top). Combine all topping ingredients; sprinkle over apples. Serve warm.

Description: 
When we were kids, our favorite dessert at Grandma's house was Bird's Nest Pie. Maybe we were fascinated by the name of the treat, but that can't be the only reason we liked it--there were never any leftovers! This family recipe was handed down from my great-grandmother.
