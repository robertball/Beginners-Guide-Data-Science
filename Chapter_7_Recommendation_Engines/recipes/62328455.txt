Ingredients:
*  3/4 pound green beans, trimmed
* 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
* 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives, quartered
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* kosher salt and black pepper
* 4 thin turkey cutlets (about 1 pound total)
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs, beaten
* 2/3 cup bread crumbs

Directions:
1.  In a large saucepan fitted with a steamer basket, bring 1 inch of water to a boil. Place the beans in the basket, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Run under cold water to cool.
2. In a large bowl, toss the beans with the tomatoes, olives, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of the oil, and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper.
3. Season the turkey with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Coat with the flour, then dip in the eggs (letting any excess drip off), and then coat with the bread crumbs, pressing gently to help them adhere.
4. Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the turkey until golden and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve with the salad and lemon wedges.
