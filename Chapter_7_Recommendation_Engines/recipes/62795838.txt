3 c gluten-free pancake mix
1 1/2 tsp chili powder
salt
2 c cold seltzer water
3 lg onions, cur crosswise into 1/2-inch slices and separated into rings
1/2 c frying oil (refined coconut and avocado oil have good fats and high smoke points, making these oils ideal for high temperature frying)

Directions:
Heat 3-inches of oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until it registers 380 degrees on a deep-fat thermometer.  **No need for special equipment or a ton of oil when making these!**
Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the pancake mix, chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp of salt.
Whisk in the seltzer until smooth.
Working in batches, coat the onion rings with the batter, letting the excess drop off; add tot he oil and fry, turning once until golden and crisp. (around 2 minutes).
