Ingredients:
3 large apples - peeled, cored, and chopped
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
2 tablespoons brandy (such as CalvadosÂ®)
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine apples, sugar, vinegar, thyme, and bay leaf in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook until the apples are soft and start breaking apart, about 10 minutes, stirring often.
Transfer to the slow cooker and cover with lid. Cook on high heat until it thickens, about 1 to 2 hours, stirring regularly.
Stir in brandy and season with salt. Transfer to a sterilized jar and let cool, then refrigerate or freeze.

Description: 
This is my favorite side for turkey or any type of roast and a staple on our Thanksgiving table. Making it in the slow cooker prevents splattering. I usually make it the day before, store in the fridge, and then heat over low heat the day of. You can also freeze or can it. For canning, I usually make a double batch, which makes 2 1-pint jars.
