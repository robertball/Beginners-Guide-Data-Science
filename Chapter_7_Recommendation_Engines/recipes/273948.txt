Description: 
Yellow squash and zucchini are sauteed with potatoes, onion, and bacon. This is a side dish so good I tend to make it for lunch and eat it as a meal. Almost every summer my mother would have a bumper crop of zucchini and yellow squash in her garden and this was her preferred way of cooking it up.
