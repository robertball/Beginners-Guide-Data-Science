Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 egg
1/2 cup vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
zest of one medium orange
3 tablespoons orange juice concentrate
1/2 cup chopped pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, yogurt, oil, extract, zest and concentrate. Add in the pecans then stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until moistened.
Fill paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Place in preheated oven and reduce temperature to 375 degrees. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove to wire rack to cool completely.
