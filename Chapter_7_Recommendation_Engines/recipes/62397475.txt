Ingredients:
2 Cups uncooked elbow macaroni
2 1/2 Cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
3/4 Cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups milk
1/4 cup butter
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Dried chopped onion (to taste)
Pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to the package directions.  Drain.
In a saucepan, melt butter or margarine over medium heat.  Stir in enough flour to make a roux.  Add milk to roux slowly, stirring constantly.  Stir in cheeses, and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and the sauce is a little thick. Add onion and pepper to taste.  Put macaroni in large casserole dish, and pour sauce over macaroni.  Stir well.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
Finally an excellant homemade mac and cheese not tainted by a bad crust topping. I also add a little garlic sometimes for flavor.Modified from: Homemade Mac and Cheese
