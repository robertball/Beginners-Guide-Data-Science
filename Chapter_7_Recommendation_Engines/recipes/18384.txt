Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
3 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup sherry

Directions:
Rinse berries in cold water; drain.
In a saucepan, stir together water and sugar until the sugar has dissolved and come to a boil.  Stir in the cranberries, jalapeno peppers and lemon juice;  return the mixture to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes; stirring occasionally.
Stir lemon juice and sherry into the mixture until blended.  Remove the pan from heat and allow the mixture to cool completely at room temperature.  Refrigerate the cooled mixture in a glass container with lid until you are ready to serve.

Description: 
A fantastic recipe with a touch of HOT for chicken or turkey. Use caution when handling the jalapeno peppers. Uncle Bill's Tips:  Wear plastic gloves or wash hands thoroughly after handling, using white vinegar or a mixture of water and bleach to remove the pepper's heat.
