Ingredients:
1 gallon apple cider
1 gallon apple juice
6 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
1 1/2 cups white sugar, or to taste
1 (1 liter) bottle 190 proof grain alcohol (such as Everclearâ„¢)

Directions:
Place the apple cider, apple juice, cinnamon sticks, and sugar into a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat, and discard the cinnamon sticks. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then stir in the grain alcohol. Pour into quart-size canning jars, seal with the lids and rings, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

Description: 
This tastes just like apple pie!  Great in the Autumn around a campfire or on a hay-ride.  Put it in canning jars with rings and lids for that down home country appeal.Modified from: Apple Pie in a Jar Drink
