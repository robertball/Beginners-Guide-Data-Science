Ingredients:
2-3 lbs yellow squash
9" cornbread - cooked & cooled
2 cans Cream of chicken soup
2Tb butter (or oleo)
1 large onion - chopped
1 large bell pepper - chopped
3-4 stalks celery - chopped
4 eggs
1 lb Velveeta (Mexican if you can find it)

Directions:
Cut yellow squash into chunks and boil until soft.
While the squash is cooking, put the cornbread in a bowl and cut into crumbs with a butter knife (dull bladed dinner knife) until crumbly. I know there are other ways to crumble it, but there really is a difference in the final texture.
Melt butter in saute pan, saute veggies until soft. Remove from heat and let cool.
Mix soup with eggs, salt & pepper.
Add cooled veggies, stirring well.
Stir into cornbread.
Add squash and "enough" of the water. Should be the consistancy of oatmeal. (lumpy & soupy at the same time)
Cut cheese into 1" cubes and stir in. Note: I vary how much cheese to use between 1/2lb and 1 lb depending on who I am making this for and how well they like cheese. I use the mild Mexican, but others will prefer the hot.
Pour/slide into baking dish allowing at least 1-2" growing room.
Bake at 350f until done, lightly brown, and not runny (from the eggs).
Allow to settle for 10-15 minutes.
