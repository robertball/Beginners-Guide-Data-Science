Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
3/4 cup white chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat shortening, butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in another bowl until smooth. Beat eggs into butter mixture one at a time, adding coconut extract and vanilla extract with the last egg. Stir flour mixture into butter mixture and fold in coconut, pecans, semisweet chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips.
Scoop up dough by spoonfuls and roll into 1-inch balls. Place balls 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten dough balls slightly.
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
