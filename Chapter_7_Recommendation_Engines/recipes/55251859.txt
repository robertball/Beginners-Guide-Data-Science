Ingredients:
--Milk & eggs at room temp.
4 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
Salt

Directions:
--Milk & eggs at room temp.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well blended.
Whisk in the flour one cup at a time until frothy and well blended.   Set aside.
Distribute the oil equally among 12 muffin cups, a little over a teaspoon per cup.
Place in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes, until smoking.  (Doesn't have to smoke.)
Remove from the oven and quickly ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into each cup.
Keep a close eye on these.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven. Serve immediately. ........I turn my oven off and leave the door partially open with the yorkies inside to keep them from deflating while waiting for everyone to ask for seconds.
