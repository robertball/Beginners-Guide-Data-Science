3/4 cup sugar
1 large egg (at room temp)
1 Tbs vanilla
1/2 (rounded)tsp baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, mix together butter, egg, vanilla  and sugar until creamy.
Add baking soda, and mix until evenly dispersed.  Then add flour and coconut and mix until it forms a smooth dough.
Roll into small balls, about the size of walnut and place on an un-greased cookie sheet.
Bake in oven for 10 - 12 minutes or until edges are golden brown.
Transfer cookies to a cooling rack and enjoy with coffee or tea!

Description: 
I came up with recipe while in pursuit of something similar to a Danish Butter Cookie sold in those fancy little tins.  This surprisingly similar, but chewier counterpart is delightful served with afternoon tea.  For a fragrant spin, add some fresh lemon zest!  Enjoy!
