1 tablespoon butter
1 large sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), cut into chunks

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Description: 
What started as an easy, delicious way to use the Swiss chard we got in our farm share quickly became a reason to go out and buy it at the farmer's market! Sophisticated enough to serve at brunch, this quiche also fits right in as finger food at summer picnics. We especially love it when most of the ingredients come from our farm share and we use fresh eggs from our neighbor's chickens. Friends who initially raised their eyebrows at Swiss chard not only request I make it, they ask for the recipe. Serve warm or at room temperature.
