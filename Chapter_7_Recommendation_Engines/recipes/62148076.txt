Ingredients:
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
4 tbsp butter
4 tbsp water
2/3 + 1/4 cup all purpose flour
3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp vanilla
1 box instant pudding (white chocolate or cheesecake is recommended)
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tbsp ground flaxseed + 6 tbsp water, mixed
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325*F. Oil, butter, or line muffin tin. Beat flaxseed and water, and let sit several minutes until it has an egg-like consistency.
In a medium saucepan, combine the brown and white sugar, butter, and water. Cook over medium heat until boiling. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips until melted and smooth. Stir in flaxseed mixture, egg, and vanilla.
Combine flour, pudding, baking soda, and salt. Stir into chocolate mixture. Mix in any extras you want (nuts, chips, coconut, etc). Spread evenly into pan.
Bake for 20-25 minutes or until brownies look set. Be careful not to overbake. The center inside should still be pretty gooey. Once they cool they should firm up just enough. These are very moist, dense, somewhat gooey brownies.

Description: 
These brownies are gooey, moist, fudgey... Absolutely perfect. I always bake these in a muffin tin, but you can use a 13x9 pan too, just know that the they'll probably take longer.
