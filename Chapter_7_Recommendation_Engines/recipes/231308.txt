Ingredients:
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
3/4 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
3/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 pound chow mein noodles
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon minced garlic
2 heads bok choy, chopped
1/2 zucchini, diced
10 sugar snap peas
1 carrot, cut into thin strips
2 tablespoons chopped green onion

Directions:
Whisk soy sauce, corn starch, and sesame oil together in a large bowl until smooth; add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
Combine chicken broth, oyster sauce, and sugar in a small bowl and set aside.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite,  4 to 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet. Cook and garlic in hot oil for 30 seconds; add marinated chicken. Cook and stir until browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove chicken mixture to a plate. Cook and stir bok choy, zucchini, snap peas, and carrot in the hot skillet until softened, about 2 minutes. Return noodles and chicken mixture to the skillet. Pour broth mixture into noodle mixture; cook and stir until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Serve garnished with green onions.
