Ingredients:
Crust:
1 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon coconut flour
1/4 cup coconut sugar
3 tablespoons salted grass-fed butter
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Paleo Cookie Butter Topping:
1 cup raw cashews
1/4 cup salted butter, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon coconut flour
1/4 cup coconut sugar
3 teaspoons blackstrap molasses
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
Filling:
1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup coconut oil
2/3 cup cream from the top of full-fat canned coconut milk
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon coconut flour
1 teaspoon vanilla bean powder
1 pinch sea salt

Directions:
Heat almond flour and coconut flour in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Be careful not to burn flours. Transfer to a high-speed blender. Add coconut sugar, butter, and cinnamon; blend to combine.
Press about 1 heaping teaspoon of crust mixture into the bottoms of 8 silicone muffin molds. Freeze for 10 minutes while preparing filling.
Combine cashews, butter, coconut flour, coconut sugar, molasses, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla extract, sea salt, and pepper in a high-speed blender; blend cookie butter topping until well combined.
Drain soaked cashews. Combine cashews, lemon juice, coconut oil, coconut cream, honey, coconut flour, vanilla bean powder, and sea salt in a high-speed blender; blend until filling is creamy and fully combined.
Remove frozen crusts from the freezer. Pour filling over the crust and freeze for 10 minutes.
Top each 'cheesecake' with about 1 teaspoon of cookie butter and swirl using the tip of a butter knife. Return to the freezer for 30 minutes, or up to overnight.

Description: 
These mini 'cheesecakes' are paleo, grain free, and gluten free. They're naturally sweetened and they have the tart creaminess of a cheesecake thanks to cashews, and the spicy sweetness of speculoos cookie butter.
