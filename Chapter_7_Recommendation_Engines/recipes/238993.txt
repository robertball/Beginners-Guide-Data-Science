Description: 
This recipe came about when I had pork chops and mushrooms on hand and wanted something different. The richness of the mushrooms and the tang of the wine make these chops an easy and tasty weeknight main course!  Serve on hot buttered bowtie pasta or rice with a tossed green salad for a complete meal.
