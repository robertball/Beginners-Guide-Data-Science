Ingredients:
1 (6.8 ounce) package Spanish rice mix
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
¾ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon paprika
¼ teaspoon black pepper
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons margarine
3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
1 cup mixed nuts

Directions:
Prepare Spanish rice mix according to package directions.  Keep warm.
Meanwhile, combine the flour, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl.  Toss the chicken pieces in the seasoned flour to coat.
Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken, and cook until lightly browned and almost cooked through.  Stir the nuts into the chicken; cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle.  Serve chicken on top of prepared Spanish rice.
