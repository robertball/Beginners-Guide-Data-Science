Ingredients:
46oz. can Dole Pinapple Juice
15.5 oz. can Lopez Cream of Coconut
3 oz. Frozen Lemonade (not prepared)
24 oz. Prepared Orange Juice
1 cup light rum
1 cup dark rum
10 oz. jar Maraschino cherries
1 can Dole Pinapple Slices

Directions:
On a large cookie sheet, lay out all the pinapple slices and place a cherry in the center of each one.
Add a little water to the center of each pinapple/cherry and place in the freezer overnight.
Then when you're ready to serve/put in punch bowl there are two ways of making this:
One is to mix all of the other ingredients in a blender, adding them one by one in the order above. You will need to divide this recipe if you go this route b/c it all won't fit in one blender at one time.
The second way would be to clean out an old milk jug (one gallon size), all all the ingredients and shake to mix.
Pour in punch bowl and garnish with pinapple cherries which will work as ice to keep this cocktail chilled.
