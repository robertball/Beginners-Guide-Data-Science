Ingredients:
4lb - 5 lb - Pork Roast
1- 2 Bay Leaf(s)
2 - 3 Teaspoons Garlic
2 - 3 Teaspoons Oregano
1/4 Bunch chopped Cilantro
1/2 onion, finely chopped
2 - Jalapenos chopped
2 Teaspoons Cumin
2 Tablespoons Black Pepper
1 Cup Water

Directions:
Throw everything in the crock pot for about 7 hours; then shredd the meat.
It goes really good with Pico de galo if you want to make it up;  or serve with chopped onions, cilantro, tomatoes, avacado, guacamole, sour cream, salsa; anything you like.
Some folks perfer corn tortillas; others flour so have both on hand.
If you want to make into chimi - just put meat in the middle of a flour tortilla; roll like burritto and fry till warm in middle and crispy. - You sometimes have to warm the tortilla just a little before rolling.

Description: 
This is a really good Carnita (which means made with Pork) recipe.  But I have used chicken and beef; depending on my mood.  ALSO; you can use this recipe and make up chimichangaes too.  They really are great.  I don't really measure things; just eyeball it.
