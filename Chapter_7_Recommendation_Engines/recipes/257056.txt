Ingredients:
2 cups dried fruit
1 1/4 cups brewed black tea, cold
cooking spray
2 3/4 cups self-rising flour, sifted
3/4 cup light brown sugar, or to taste
1 egg

Directions:
Place dried fruit in a bowl and pour in tea; let soak for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
Beat flour, brown sugar, and egg into fruit mixture until batter is well mixed; pour into the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.

Description: 
A delicious tea bread, also known as barmbrack, nice straight from the oven and buttered. For an egg-free option, it works fine with a tablespoon of applesauce instead of the egg. Enjoy warm or allow to cool before slicing and serving.
