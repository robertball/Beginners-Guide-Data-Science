Ingredients:
1/3 cup cold water
3 packets unflavored gelatin
1/2 packet Koolaid, any flavor
2 tsp stevia (more or less to taste)

Directions:
Start off by bringing a medium sauce pan slightly less than half full of water to a boil.
Place molds on a cookie sheet for easy transfer later.
In a glass measuring cup, pour 1/3 cup cold water.
Gradually stir in unflavored gelatin, stirring constantly as to prevent lumps.
Stir in Koolaid and stevia until incorporated. mixture will be "gloppy".
Place measuring cup inside boiling water (careful that water does not breach the top of the cup)
Slowly stir the gelatin mixture until everything dissolves and the mixture becomes a syrupy liquid.
Remove mixture from boiling water and immediately pour into molds. A small syringe is perfect for this.
Place molds in refrigerator for at least 1 hour, then gummies can be removed from molds.
Gummies can be eaten once set, but I prefer the texture after letting them firm up for about 2 days. They can be stored at room temperature, but they retain a better "gummy" texture when stored in the fridge.

Description: 
A great alternative for anyone watching their sugar intake but craving some chewy gummy candies! The best part is the flavor possibilities are limitless! This recipe calls for using Koolaid and stevia, but you can also use sugar free jello or any kind of sugar free drink mix. If you're not as worried about the sugar, you can substitute the water for real fruit juice! Yum! I make these in gummy bear molds, but they can be made using any kind of candy mold.
