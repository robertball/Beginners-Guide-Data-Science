Ingredients:
2 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 pinch seasoned salt
1/2 (16 ounce) jar dill pickle slices
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the beer, 1 1/2 cups flour, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and seasoned salt in a large bowl. Dip the pickle slices into the beer batter, then coat them in the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour.
Fry the pickles in the preheated oil until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.
