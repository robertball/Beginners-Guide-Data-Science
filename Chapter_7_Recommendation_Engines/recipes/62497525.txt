Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1/3 cup finely chopped onion
3/4 cup diced cooked ham
1 10oz package frozen corn kernels
1 cup chicken stock
1 1/2 cups water
2 chicken bouillon cubes
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste
5 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups 2% milk

Directions:
Combine the potatoes, corn kernels, onion, ham, chicken stock, water chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.
In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with a fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all of the milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.
Stir the milk mixture into the slow cooker, and cook soup on low 8-10 hours. Serve immediately.

Description: 
This is a very easy recipe that I have taken to throwing in the crock pot the morning after a having a big Sunday night ham dinner with my family. The great thing about it is that you can add additional ingredients, more ham, potatoes, corn etc and it still turns out great.Modified from: Delicious Ham and Potato Soup
