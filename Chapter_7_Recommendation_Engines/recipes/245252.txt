Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 teaspoons dried parsley
6 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch casserole dish.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and parsley until mushrooms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Place remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until melted, about 10 seconds. Whisk melted butter, eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; stir in mushroom mixture, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and black beans. Pour egg mixture into the prepared baking dish and top with remaining Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are puffed and cheese is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
