Description: 
This is my favorite comfort dish which was the signature dish of my Aunt Anna ibn Mass City, MI. Ingredients are as for those in most any Upper Peninsula Finnish style pasty, but cooked without a crust. When I make it, I just can't stop eating it, either hot or cold! Somehow the ingredients meld together for a wonderfully tasty, one-dish meal which is considerably more healthy than pasty with a crust. When serving, pass the ketchup, along with a side of your favorite coleslaw.
