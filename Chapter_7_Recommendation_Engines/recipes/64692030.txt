Ingredients:
3 Tbsp Coconut Oil
3/4 Cup Popping Corn
1 Tbsp Sugar
2.5 Tbsp Margarine
1/4 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp Cajun Seasoning ('Slap Ya Mama' Hot Cajun Seasoning)
Light Sprinkle of Garlic Powder

Directions:
1.  Melt coconut oil in a 4 quart sauce-pan over 2/3 (Medium-High) heat
2.  Place one popcorn kernel into the pan, replace the lid, and wait for the kernel to pop
3.  Then add enough popping corn to cover the bottom of the pan (enough so you cannot see the bottom of the pan, but the corn does not stand out of the oil)
4.  Then, gently swirl the pan to coat the popcorn in the hot oil, and place back on heat
5.  Prepare the sugar on a measuring spoon or use two pinches with your fingers
6.  Wait until you hear a new kernel pop; then quickly remove the lid, toss in the sugar, replace the lid, and swirl the pan once again to mix the sugar into the oil (this is important to avoid the sugar burning in the bottom of the pan)
7.  Wait for the corn to finish popping (no pops for about 4-5 seconds)
8.  Have a big bowl on stand-by, and immediately transfer the popped corn from the pan to the bowl
9.  In the hot, empty pan, melt the margarine, being sure to seal in all the flavors of the bottom of the pan by swirling the butter
10.  Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the corn
11.  Add the salt, Cajun seasoning, and garlic powder
12.  Using a spoon, stir/toss the corn thoroughly for about 60 seconds to ensure the butter and seasonings are evenly dispersed
13. And most importantly, enjoy!
