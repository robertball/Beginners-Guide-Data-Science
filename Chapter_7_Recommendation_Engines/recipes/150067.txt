Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) boneless pork loin, cut into 1/2 inch strips
1 cup soy sauce
Â¾ cup water
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 bunches watercress - rinsed, dried, cut into 1/2 inch lengths, thick stems discarded
8 ounces bean sprouts
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu, drained and cubed

Directions:
Place pork in a wok or skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until pork is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, water, ginger, and black pepper; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until meat is tender, about 40 minutes.
Stir in the watercress and bean sprouts, and continue to simmer until tender yet still crisp, about 10 minutes more. Mix in the tofu, cover, and simmer 5 minutes more.

Description: 
Tofu and watercress are a great, flavorful combination, and a wholesome one, too! My teenage boys who don't like greens actually love this dish. Red chile garlic paste can be substituted for the ground black pepper.
