Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1 tablespoon grated lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans.
Stir lemon cake mix, orange juice, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a bowl to moisten; beat with an electric mixer on low for 30 seconds. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat for 2 more minutes. Gently fold in blueberries, orange zest, and lemon zest. Divide batter into prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until cakes spring back when lightly pressed with a finger and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool thoroughly before frosting.

Description: 
My aunt has been making this for years and I finally got the nerve to make it today for Labor Day. It would be a great picnic/summer party dessert. Ice with your favorite lemon frosting. Enjoy!
