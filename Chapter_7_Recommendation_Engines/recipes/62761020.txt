Description: 
I got this recipe from a booth at my local supermarket. At first I was skeptical about using Lady's Choice mayonnaise (yes, mayonnaise) as an ingredient for cooking but to my surprise, it actually makes a big difference to the eggs! They come out much creamier and it definitely adds a twist to ordinary scrambled eggs. Make sure to use REAL mayonnaise like Lady's Choice Mayonnaise for this recipe and not a cheap version.
