Description: 
This is a very simple treat that can be used with your favorite fruit juices to make many different variations.  My favorite variation has banana in it.  It brings a bit of creaminess to the icy treat.  
The small bottles of prepackaged juice in the produce section are the perfect amount of juice  for this recipe- pick a flavor!  Don’t let the mixture freeze completely before you scrape.  The secret is to scrape as it freezes.
