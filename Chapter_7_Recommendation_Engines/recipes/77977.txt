Ingredients:
2 cups hot water
4 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled
1 (6 ounce) package wild rice, uncooked
1/2 cup butter
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 (5.5 ounce) package seasoned croutons
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning

Directions:
Dissolve 3 cubes bouillon in 1 cup hot water. In a medium saucepan, combine wild rice with bouillon water, then fill with just enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Mix remaining 1 cube bouillon in 1 cup hot water. Heat butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in celery and green pepper; cook until tender. Mix in remaining bouillon water. Pour skillet contents into a large bowl. Stir together cooked rice, croutons, and poultry seasoning.
Stuff turkey loosely, and cook turkey as directed. Or put stuffing into a well greased baking dish, cover, and bake 30 minutes in a preheated oven at 325 degrees F (165 degree C).
