1 pound cherries, pitted
1 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1 large onion, chopped

1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Place the cherries, cider vinegar, rice vinegar, onion, apple, white sugar, brown sugar, ginger, five-spice powder, salt, and nutmeg into a large pot. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Remove the lid, and continue simmering until the desired consistency has been reached. Chill before serving.

Description: 
I live in the Columbia River Gorge.  So many cherries are produced in a very short period, that during cherry harvest, farmers sell pounds of the stuff.  I created a savory recipe because there's only so much cherry pie and ice cream one man can eat!
