Ingredients:
1/2 gal. whole milk (not ultra-pasteurized). Reduced fat or skim milk can be used, but yogurt will not be as rich.
1/2 cup store-bought plain yogurt, with active cultures
1/2 cup powdered milk

Directions:
Pour milk into a 2-3 quart crock pot. Set on low and heat until milk reaches 180 degrees (2-3 hrs.)
Turn off crock pot and remove lid. Cool down milk to 110-115 degrees.
Stir in powdered milk. Place 1/2 cup plain yogurt onto a bowl and whisk in 1 cup warm milk to eliminate lumps.  Whisk milk/yogurt mixture back into crock pot to fully incorporate.
Wrap crock completely in a bath/beach towel and set aside 8-12 hours to cool down slowly.  Overnight in  a cold oven with the light on works well, and is out of the way.
Carefully unwrap crock and remove lid.  Yogurt should be set with some whey.  Although yogurt will thicken more if placed in the refrigerator at this point, it will not be as thick as store-bought.
For thicker Greek-style yogurt: place a clean, damp cotton dish towel (or 4  layers of cheesecloth) into a large colander set into a large bowl. Pour yogurt into colander. Place yogurt and colander/bowl into refrigerator for 1-2 hours to drain off additional whey.
Spoon cooled yogurt in jars or bowl with air-tight lid. Store in refrigerator up to 1 week.
