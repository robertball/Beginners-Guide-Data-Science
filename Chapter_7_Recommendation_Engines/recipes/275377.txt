Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package CAULIPOWERÂ® Cauliflower Pizza Crusts
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 large onion, sliced
1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 cup water
1 large tomato, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package shredded pepper Jack cheese
1 avocado, sliced
1 lime, cut into wedges

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, yellow pepper, and green pepper to the skillet; cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
Mix chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, paprika, salt, pepper, flour, coriander, and cumin together until combined. Add to chicken in the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in water, stir, and cook until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
Place pizza crusts on the prepared baking sheets. Divide chicken mixture evenly between the 2 crusts. Top each with tomato slices and pepper Jack cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crusts are lightly browned around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes.
Top with avocado slices and a squeeze of fresh lime juice just before serving.
