Ingredients:
12 egg yolks
12 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/8 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
3 cups ground pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 10 inch tube pan with parchment paper (do not grease the paper).  Separate eggs while cold, but let them come to room temperature before making the cake.
In a large mixing bowl, beat egg yolks until very thick and lemon colored. In another bowl, beat egg whites and salt until foamy. Gradually add sifted powdered sugar to egg whites and continue to beat until stiff, but not dry. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the yolks, then fold in the remaining whites. Gently fold ground pecans into egg mixture.
Pour batter into pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean and the top of the cake is light brown. Remove from oven and invert pan to cool. Cool cake completely before removing from pan.
