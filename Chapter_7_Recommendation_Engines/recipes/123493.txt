Ingredients:
3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
FILLING/GLAZE:
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon shortening
2/3 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 teaspoon water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in vanilla and salt. Add flour; mix well. Cover and refrigerate.
For filling, melt the chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave until smooth. Remove from the heat; set aside 1/4 cup for glaze. To remaining chocolate, add pecans, milk, vanilla and salt; blend well. Cover and refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes.
Place a 16-in. x 12-in. piece of foil in a greased baking sheet; lightly sprinkle with flour. Divide dough in half; place one portion on foil.  Roll into a 14-in. x 5-in. rectangle. Spread half of the filling lengthwise on half of the dough to within 1/2 in. of edges.  Using foil, fold dough over filling; seal edges. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
For glaze, warm reserved chocolate; stir in corn syrup and water.  Spread over cookies. Cool completely. Cut widthwise into 3/4-in. strips.
