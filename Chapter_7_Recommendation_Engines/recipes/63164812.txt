Ingredients:
4 ounces orzo
1 whole zucchini, sliced into thin rounds
1/2 pound halibut filets
6 ounces grape tomatoes, halved
1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 ounce goat cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
fresh ground black pepper, to taste
For Dill Pesto:
1/2 tablespoon pine nuts
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup fresh dill
1/4 ounce parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

Directions:
Combine ingredients for Dill Pesto in a blender or mini food processor and blend until smooth.  Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and place a large oven-proof skillet inside.
Boil orzo according to package directions.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and saute zucchini in a little oil, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper, until cooked but not mushy.
Take the hot pan out of the oven, spray lightly with oil, place the halibut inside and return to the oven.  Bake fish for 5 minutes, then turn over and bake for another 5 minutes or until done.
Strain the pasta and return it to the pan.  Add the tomatoes, pine nuts, goat cheese, dill pesto, salt and pepper.  Stir until the goat cheese is melted and the dill pesto is well blended.
To serve hot: Divide orzo among serving plates, top with fish fillets and zucchini.
To serve cold:  Flake fish and fold into orzo.  Chill in refrigerator.  Divide orzo among serving plates and top with zucchini.
