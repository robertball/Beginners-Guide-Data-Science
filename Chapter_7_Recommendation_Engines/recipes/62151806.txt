Ingredients:
2 Cups water
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 Cup quick cooking grits
2 tablespoons butter
2 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled into large pieces
1/4 cup cheddar cheese, grated or cubed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring water and salt to a boil in a heavy saucepan. Stir grits and butter into briskly boiling water with a whisk to prevent clumping.  Cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, or until grits are thickened and no longer watery, but not stiff.  Cooked grits should have a slight al dente firmness, in an overall creaminess.
Divide cheese and bacon between serving bowls or plates, reserving some for garnish, and spoon grits atop.  Garnish with bacon, cheese, salt and pepper, and extra butter, to taste.

Description: 
Creamy, cheesy, buttery & meaty... My Texas-by-way-of-Georgia Grandmother's simple grits dish is a one dish breakfast for those that don't like grits! Try sausage, ham or all three instead of just bacon!
