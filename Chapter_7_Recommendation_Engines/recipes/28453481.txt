Ingredients:
2 TBS. unsalted butter, plus more for the pan
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 cup half and half
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
salt and pepper
1/2 cup strawberry or peach jam
1/2 cup nutella

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225.  In a 8" nonstick skillet, brown the 2 TBS. of butter over moderately high heat, about 4 minutes.  Transfer to bowl and let cool.
In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and egg yolk with the half and half.  Whisk in the flour and browned butter.  Season the batter with salt and pepper.
Set the skillet over high heat.  When it is hot, add a scant 1/4 cup batter, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.  Cook until the crepe is browned around the edges and the top is set, about 45 seconds.  Flip the crepe and cook until the underside is lightly browned, about 30 seconds longer.  Transfer the crepe to a plate.  Repeat with the remaining batter, buttering the pan as needed.  You should have about 8 crepes.
Spread each crepe with 1 TBS. of jam and fold into quarters.  Transfer the crepes to a small baking dish, overlapping slightly.  Bake for 10 minutes, until the crepes are just heated through.
Meanwhile, in a small microwave safe bowl, heat the nutella on high power in 20 second bursts just until runny.  Drizzle the nutella over the warm crepes and serve.
