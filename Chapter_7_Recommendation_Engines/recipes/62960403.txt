Description: 
This is my interpretation of one of our favorite dishes from a local thai restaurant.  Typically this dish is made with chicken.  However, when we requested the dish with beef it was so much more flavorful.  The sauce really brings out the flavor of the beef.  Serve over rice with spring rolls and you have an outstanding meal.
