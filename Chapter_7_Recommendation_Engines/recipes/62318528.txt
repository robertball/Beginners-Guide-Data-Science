Ingredients:
* Preserved Artichokes; 6, around 250 gms (8.8 ounces actually so say 9)
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* Capers; 2 Tablespoons, well rinsed
* Shallot; 1, small, finely chopped
* Lemon Juice; from half a good-sized lemon.
* Black Pepper; a few twists of freshly ground
* Anchovy Filets; 6, rinsed well and chopped
* Parsley; a handful, chopped
* Ribbon pasta (Fettuccine or Pappadelle); enough for 2, around 250 gms (which is just under 9 ounces)

Directions:
Rinse the artichokes of their bottling fluids then cut into quarters and place in a bowl.
Use enough EVOO to just cover them.
Add the Capers, Shallot and Lemon Juice. Twist the pepper grinder a few times over the top. Then set aside for a minimum of 30 minutes, longer if you want.
On a small plate/bowl mix the Anchovies and the Parsley.
Cook the Pasta until firm and tender, then drain it. Use either the cooking pan or a separate bowl and put the drained pasta in it, then mix thoroughly with the Anchovy/Parsley mixture.
Then pour over the contents of the Artcichoke bowl, oil as well.
Serve warm or cool.
