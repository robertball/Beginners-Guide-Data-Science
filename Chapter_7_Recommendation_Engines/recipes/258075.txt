Ingredients:
1/2 napa cabbage, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon Korean red pepper powder
5 cups water
1 tablespoon sweet rice flour (glutinous rice flour)
1/2 yellow onion, cut into chunks
1/2 Asian pear - peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
3 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
6 cloves garlic, sliced
3 slices fresh ginger
1 (1 gram) packet granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)

Directions:
Place cabbage in a large bowl; sprinkle salt and red pepper powder on top. Toss well and let stand until cabbage looks wilted, about 1 hour.
Bring water and rice flour to a boil in a large pot. Simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine onion, Asian pear, and green onions in a half-gallon jar. Add wilted cabbage, garlic, ginger, and sweetener. Pour water mixture on top. Seal jar and keep at room temperature to ferment for 1 to 2 days. Place in the refrigerator.
