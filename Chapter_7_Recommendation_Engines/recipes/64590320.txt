Ingredients:
1 package of Maruchan Ramen noodles (or alike noodles)
2 cups water
1 table spoon olive oil
1 garlic clove
Half a teaspoon of celery salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves or basil
1 drop Oregano oil (using more can have an overbearing flavour)
1  sprig green onion
1 sprig chives (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
Dash of tumeric and paprika

Directions:
Finely mince the garlic then add to the 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small pot. Add some salt if desired. Heat over medium heat for one minute (don't let garlic get brown or it will become bitter).  Add water to stop garlic from cooking  then turn heat up to high and bring to a boil
Add noodles, stirring constantly. When they start to become soft, add the onion, oregano leaves, oregano oil and optional chives. Stir for two minutes or until noodles are tender.
Turn heat off and mix in remaining ingredients. Stir until ingredients are well incorporated and then serve hot.

Description: 
For the average college student on a budget, or for someone who doesn't feel like paying a pretty penny for soup that you can make at home. Not only is it better tasting, it's healthier than using the flavour packets you find in the ramen noodle packages. Use your imagination, search your spice cupboard, add some salt, and you have a great tasting soup for on-the-go.
