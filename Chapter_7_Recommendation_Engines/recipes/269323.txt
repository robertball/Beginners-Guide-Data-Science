Description: 
Delicious cookies that have the same basic flavor as peanut butter cookies, but can be eaten by people with peanut and milk allergies! I love to make these with my friend because she has a peanut allergy and I have a dairy allergy. They taste great and no one can tell that they are dairy free!
