Ingredients:
*  8 ounces turkey breakfast sausage, removed from casing and crumbled into small pieces
* 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
* 1/4 cup sliced scallions
* 1/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
* 5 eggs
* 3 egg whites
* 1 cup 1% milk

Directions:
1.  Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 325Â°F. Coat a nonstick muffin tin generously with cooking spray (see Tip).
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to cool. Add oil to the pan. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to the bowl with the sausage. Let cool for 5 minutes. Stir in scallions, cheese and pepper.
3. Whisk eggs, egg whites and milk in a medium bowl. Divide the egg mixture evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Sprinkle a heaping tablespoon of the sausage mixture into each cup.
4. Bake until the tops are just beginning to brown, 25 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Place a rack on top of the pan, flip it over and turn the quiches out onto the rack. Turn upright and let cool completely.

Description: 
These crustless mini quiches are like portable omelets. Turkey sausage and sauteed mushrooms keep them light and savory. Small and satisfying, they're also a good finger food for your next cocktail party.~ copied from Eating Well
