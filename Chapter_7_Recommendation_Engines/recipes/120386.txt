Ingredients:
4 cups tart apples - peeled, cored and chopped
3 cups sliced almonds
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons poultry seasoning
12 cups cubed whole wheat bread
2 cups raisins
1 cup apple cider or apple juice
1/2 cup egg substitute
1 (16 pound) turkey
1 1/2 cups water
GRAVY:
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute apples, almonds, onion and celery in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in salt, cinnamon and poultry seasoning. In a large bowl, combine bread cubes, raisins and apple mixture. Add cider and egg substitute; toss to mix.
Just before baking, loosely stuff turkey with half of the stuffing. Place remaining stuffing in a greased 2-qt. baking dish; refrigerate until ready to bake. Skewer turkey opening; tie drumsticks together. Place breast side up on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour water into pan.
Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees F for 4-1/2 to 5 hours or until a meat thermometer reads 180 degrees F for the turkey and 165 degrees F for the stuffing, basting occasionally with pan drippings. (Cover loosely with foil if turkey browns too quickly.)
Bake additional stuffing, covered, for 30-40 minutes. Uncover; bake 10 minutes longer or until lightly browned. Cover turkey and let stand for 20 minutes before removing stuffing and carving.
For gravy, pour pan drippings into a 4-cup measuring cup; skim off fat. Add enough water to measure 4 cups. Pour into a saucepan. Stir in bouillon, poultry seasoning and pepper. Bring to a boil. In a bowl, combine flour and milk until smooth; whisk into boiling broth. Cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Serve with turkey and stuffing.
