Ingredients:
½  pound kale, chopped
1 medium onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
4 carrots, halved lengthwise and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices
14  oz. canned white kidney beans (or ½ pound dried white  beans)
2  chicken sausages, sliced 1/3-inch-thick (optional)
6 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock or water
1 bay leaf
½ tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 tsp. olive oil
Sea salt, black pepper

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes.
Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add carrots, stock or water, bay leaf, salt, pepper, rosemary, bring to a boil and cook for 8 minutes.
Add sausages, if using, and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in kale, bring to simmer, and simmer until kale is tender, 12-15 minutes.
Add canned white beans and cook for  the final 2 minutes. Discard bay leaf.
This soup is best if made 1 day ahead.
If you use dried beans, soak them in water to cover by 2 inches for at least 8 hours, cook them for about 50 minutes and add beans to the soup right after the garlic.
