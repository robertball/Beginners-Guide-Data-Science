Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) salmon fillet, bones removed
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/3 cup light mayonnaise
1 tablespoon light cream cheese
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika, ground
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs) or regular dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly oil. Place salmon onto foil and set aside.
Mix together feta cheese, mayonnaise, cream cheese, Dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl until smooth. Spread mixture over salmon, then sprinkle panko over top, covering completely.
Bake in preheated oven until easily flaked with a fork, about 35 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
I first created this dish when my family suggested I try something other than the same tired (yet still yummy) Asian salmon dish. I whipped this up out of ingredients I had on hand. They thanked me profusely. Now I have a new dish to use. It's pretty rich in flavor, but not so high in fat (depending on what kind of ingredients you use). Enjoy!
