Ingredients:
2 tablespoons orange juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup honey
1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
1 (8 pound) fully cooked whole ham

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Stir the orange juice, cinnamon, clove, and honey together in a small bowl; set aside. Stir in almond extract if desired.
Place the ham in a shallow roasting pan. Bake in the preheated oven 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove the ham from the oven, and baste with the honey glaze. Return to the oven; continue cooking until the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees F (60 degrees C), about 45 minutes longer. Baste occasionally as the ham finishes baking.
