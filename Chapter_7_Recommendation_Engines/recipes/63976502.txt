Ingredients:
1 tbsp of olive or canola oil
1 large onion
1 large bell pepper
2 jalapeno peppers (optional, but adds spice)
2 freshly minced garlic cloves
1/4 cup chili powder
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes
1 can beans (DO NOT HALVE, even if halving entire recipe. DOUBLE if desired.)
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup rinsed, uncooked white or brown rice
1 15 oz. can corn
1/2 tsp black pepper
Daiya cheese, to serve

Directions:
Heat the oil in a pan and saute the diced onion and peppers until tender. Then add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, and salt. Stir occasonally for around 10 minutes, making sure the chili powder does not burn.
Stir in the tomatoes, beans, water, and rice. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover until the rice is fully cooked. You may need to check on the pan every 10-15 minutes to check when extra water is needed (which it will be). Add in 1/4 cup at a time.
Add in the corn and black pepper last. If using frozen corn, wait for it to heat through before serving, around 5 minutes. Serve with cheese if desired.
