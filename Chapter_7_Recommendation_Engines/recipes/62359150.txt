Ingredients:
10 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 cup milk
1 cup butter, melted
1/2 pound bacon, diced
1 1/2 onion, chopped
1/2 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the potatoes in a large pot with water to cover over high heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender.
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the bacon, onion and garlic in the butter for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bacon is fully cooked.
Remove potatoes from heat, drain, then combine with the milk and 6 tablespoons of butter, mash. Mix in the cheese and bacon mixture.
Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions and cool under running water.
Place 1/3 of the mashed potatoes into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top this with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles. Repeat twice. Top with 1 onion sauteed in 1/2 cup butter and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Remove foil/cover and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with sour cream and chopped fresh chives.
