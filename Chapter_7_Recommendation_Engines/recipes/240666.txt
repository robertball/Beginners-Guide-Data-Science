Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder (such as MAGIC®)
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cold butter, cut into cubes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (such as Kraft® Double Cheddar)
1/3 cup milk
2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1 tablespoon parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, sugar, and salt together in a bowl; cut in butter using a pastry blender or 2 knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir Cheddar cheese into flour mixture; add 1/3 plus 2 tablespoons milk, mayonnaise, parsley, and garlic powder and mix until a soft dough forms.
Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 8 to 10 times. Pat dough into a 6-inch square and cut into 9 smaller squares. Arrange squares 2-inches apart on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
