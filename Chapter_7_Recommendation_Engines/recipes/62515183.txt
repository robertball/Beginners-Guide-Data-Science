Ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1 cup dried figs, chopped (cut off the hard stem part)
3 very ripe bananas
1/3 cup of Grape Seed Oil (or any vegetable oil)
3 TBS flour (optional, omit for gluten-free)
1 TSP Vanilla Extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients together, beat well.  Let mixture set for 5-10 minutes so oats can absorb the moisture. Line cooking sheets with parchment paper. Using two teaspoons to form a nice shape (or your hand and 1 spoon), drop teaspoonfuls on ungreased parchment.  Do not flatten.
Bake at 350 degrees for 14 to 20 minutes.  Let stand for 1 minute.  Remove to wire racks or kitchen towels to cool.
