Ingredients:
16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni
4 carrots, shredded
1 large onion, diced
approx. 1 pepper size -- green, yellow, red & orange bell pepper, seeded and chopped
4 sticks, diced celery
2 cups mayonnaise
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup white vinegar
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Rinse under cold water, and drain.
In a large bowl, stir together the carrots, onion, green, red, yellow & orange peppers, and celery. Mix in the mayonnaise, condensed milk, vinegar, salt and pepper. Add the macaroni, toss gently, cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. I usually make this a day ahead of time, and stir it occasionally to blend the flavors. The macaroni will absorb some of the liquid.

Description: 
This is, by far, the best macaroni salad I've ever put into my mouth. It has a perfect blend of sweetness and tartness, and it is so pretty with all of the multi-colored veggies. Be ready for this to disappear before you put it on the table! I have six children, and it is all I can do to keep them from nibbling on it while I'm mixing it up!Modified from: Mom's Best Macaroni Salad
