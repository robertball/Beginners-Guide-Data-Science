Ingredients:
Filling:
4 cups fresh raspberries
1/3 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Topping:
1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup shredded coconut
1/4 cup cold butter, cubed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Gently toss raspberries with sugar and flour in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
Combine oats, flour, brown sugar, and coconut in another large bowl. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Lightly sprinkle the crumb mixture over the berries.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool.
