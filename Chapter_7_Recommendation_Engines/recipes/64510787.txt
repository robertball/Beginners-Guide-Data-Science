Ingredients:
5 - 6 cups fruit (ie. 5 or 6 apples) chopped
OR
4 cups rhubarb + 2 apples, chopped
OR
any combination you like or have on hand
1 cup flour (can sub other types for wheat flour ie coconut)
1 cup oats
1 cup brown sugar (increase sugar in proportion to rhubarb as it's more tart)

Place fruit in 8" x 8" glass pan.
Combine remaining ingredients. Spread evenly over fruit, poking some of it down into the fruit for a nice mix.
Cook, uncovered, in microwave on high x 10 min.

Can also add butterscotch ice cream topping.
