Ingredients:
1/2 cup water (70 to 80 degrees F)
1 cup warm milk (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 tablespoons butter, softened
2 tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
4 cups all-purpose flour
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 egg white, beaten
VEGETABLE CHOWDER:
1 large onion, chopped
3 celery ribs, chopped
6 tablespoons butter
3 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 1/2 cups milk
4 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
3/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first seven ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water or flour if needed).
When the cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into six portions; shape into balls. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. Brush with egg white. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on wire racks.
To make bowl, cut the top fourth off of bread; carefully hollow out bottom of each, leaving a 1/4-in. shell (discard removed bread or save for another use).
For chowder, in a large saucepan, saute onion and celery in butter until tender. Add mixed vegetables. Stir in flour until blended. Gradually stir in milk until combined. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in bacon, bouillon is dissolved. Serve in bread bowls.
