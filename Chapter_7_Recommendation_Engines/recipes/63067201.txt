Ingredients:
1 small onion, chopped
1 shallot, chopped
2 stalks celery, coarsely chopped
1 Tbsp olive oil
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 cup water
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper
1 tsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp ground thyme
2 lbs yukon gold potatoes, diced in approx 1 cm (1/2") squares
1/4 lb bacon
3/4 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
2 Tbsp chopped chives
3 Tbsp low-fat sour cream

Directions:
Saute the onion and shallot with the olive oil in a pot on medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent.
Add the celery and stir occasionally until the celery is soft.
Pour the chicken broth and water into the pot, and add the paprika, salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce, and thyme.
Add the potatoes and bring to a boil, then reduce the temperature to just below boiling and simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, chop the bacon into small pieces and cook in a small skillet until they are brown and crispy.
When the potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes, remove approx 1 cup of the potatoes. Reduce the temperature to low.
Puree the contents of the pot until smooth with an immersion blender or carefully in batches in a blender, and put the reserved potatoes back in the pot.
Stir in the cheddar cheese and chives and let the cheese melt.
Just before serving, stir in the sour cream, and top with the bacon bits.
