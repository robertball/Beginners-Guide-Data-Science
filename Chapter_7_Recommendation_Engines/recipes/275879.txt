Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 cups warm water
1 1/2 cups rice flour
1 1/2 cups gluten-free oat flour
3/4 cup tapioca starch
3/4 cup cornstarch
1 tablespoon xanthan gum
1 teaspoon salt
5 eggs
1/2 cup canola oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
Combine rice flour, oat flour, tapioca starch, cornstarch, xanthan gum, and salt in a mixing bowl; mix to combine. Add yeast mixture, eggs, and oil; mix using an electric mixer on high speed for 3 minutes.
Distribute batter evenly between between eighteen 5-inch pie tins. Place onto 2 large cookie sheets. Sprinkle buns with sesame seeds.
Allow to rise in the preheated warm oven, 30 to 40 minutes.
Set the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) without removing the buns.
Bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes. Switch baking sheets on oven racks and continue to bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes more.

Description: 
After being gluten-free for 4 years and really missing out on eating burgers with buns, I experimented with a handful of bread recipes to come up with a good gluten-free, milk-free bun that the whole family enjoys.
