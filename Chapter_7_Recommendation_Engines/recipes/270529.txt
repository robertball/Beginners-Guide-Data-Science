Ingredients:
8 pickle spears
2 ounces cream cheese, chilled
8 slices bacon
1/4 cup ranch dressing

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pat pickles dry with a paper towel. Cut cream cheese into 8 strips. Place 1 strip onto each pickle, and wrap with a strip of bacon, securing ends with toothpicks if necessary. Place pickles on the baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly, then serve with ranch dressing.

Description: 
You can pretty much wrap anything in bacon, including pickles! These are perfect for game day or any time of year. Thick-cut bacon doesn't work as well for these, so use the thinner slices. Serve with ranch or blue cheese dressing. These are also tasty dipped in Buffalo sauce.
