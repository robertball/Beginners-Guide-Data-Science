1 bag(8 or 9 ounces) Puff Corn
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup light Karo syrup
1 teaspoon baking soda

Melt butter in a large saucepan. Stir in brown sugar and Karo syrup. Cook and stir until mixture comes to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly for two minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda and vanilla. Mixture will foam. Carefully pour over the Puff Corn and toss gently to mix.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.
Pour onto foil lined baking sheet, sprayed with cooking spray. Allow to cool at least 30 minutes. Break into bite sized pieces and store in an airtight container.
