Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen lemonade concentrate
1 (12 fluid ounce) can passion fruit frozen concentrate
6 fluid ounces light rum
2 limes
4 cups crushed ice
1 orange, sliced into rounds
4 maraschino cherries

Directions:
Chill 4 glasses in the freezer for several hours until outsides of glasses are frosty.  Meanwhile, prepare both frozen concentrate juices in separate pitchers, using only 1 1/2 cans of water to fill instead of 2.  Refrigerate both juices.
Before serving, fill each glass with crushed ice. Divide rum evenly between the glasses, then add passion fruit juice and lemonade in equal amounts.  Finally, squeeze half of a lime into each glass to top. Stir.  Garnish with fresh orange slices and cherries if desired.

Description: 
One summer afternoon, my sister and I felt creative, and we decided simplicity was best. What we came up with was a refreshing combination of passion fruit and citrus flavors with a bit (or more!) of rum. Perfect for sipping while relaxing on a warm summer afternoon! Garnish with fresh citrus slices and cherries if desired.
