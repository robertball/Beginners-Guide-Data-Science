Ingredients:
12 large baking potatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted
6 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
6 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
With a sharp knife, slice potatoes thinly but not all the way through, leaving slices attached at the bottom. Place potatoes in a greased shallow baking dish. Sprinkle with salt; brush with 1/4 cup butter. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 30 minutes.
Brush potatoes with remaining butter and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake 20 minutes longer. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake 5-10 minutes more or until potatoes are tender and golden brown.

Description: 
These wonderful oven-roasted potatoes are very pretty to serve--the partially cut slices spread out in the shape of a fan. Folks at a potluck can easily take as many slices as they want. I especially like these potatoes with ham, roast pork or beef.                                                               --Eunice Stoen                                                                    Decorah, Iowa
