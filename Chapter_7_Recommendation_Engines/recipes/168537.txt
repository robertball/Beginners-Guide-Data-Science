Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup diced white onion
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 tablespoon canned diced jalapeno peppers (adjust to your taste preference)
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 cups pre-shredded California Mozzarella or California Oaxaca
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup crumbled California Cotija (or substitute crumbled California cowâ€™s milk Feta)

Directions:
In a medium skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and jalapeno peppers; saute until onions are soft, about 5 minutes.
Add the beans and smash with the back of a ladle or large spoon until softened and heated through, another 2-3 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in pre-shredded Mozzarella or Oaxaca, sour cream, cumin and cayenne pepper, stirring until cheese is melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle Cotija cheese on top. Serve warm or at room temperature with chips and vegetables.
