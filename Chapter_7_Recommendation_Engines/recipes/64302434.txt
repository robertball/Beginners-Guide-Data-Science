Ingredients:
4 slices wholemeal bread, crusts removed
butter, softened for spreading
veggies/meat of your choice (I used bacon, tomato and fresh basil)
some coarsely grated cheddar
3 eggs, lightly whisked

Directions:
Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Brush muffin holes (not mini muffins) with melted butter to lightly grease.
Use a rolling pin to gently roll out bread slices to 3mm thick. Use a 12cm-diameter pastry cutter (I used a small round bowl) to cut bread into discs.
Spread each slice lightly with butter. Line the prepared muffin holes with bread slices.
Arrange your filling and cheese evenly among muffin holes, then top each up with egg.
Bake in oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown and just set (In my oven and for how full I filled each cup it took about 22 minutes). Place in the fridge to chill. Place in airtight containers to store.
