Description: 
Everyone knows just how much I love baking, especially in the fall and winter. To me, nothing says autumn quite like pumpkins. So my pumpkin bread, muffins, butter, pies, cookies, and even pumpkin-shaped cakes are always looked forward to by my friends, family, and co-workers. This apple cider-pumpkin bread is great for snacks, dessert, or breakfast. Toast it, warm it, spread on some butter, cream cheese, apple butter, or just slice some off to eat as is.
