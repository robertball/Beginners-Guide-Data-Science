Chicken Gnocchi Creamy Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 cups mirepoix (just a simple mixture of chopped onions, celery, and carrots)
1-2 teaspoons dried basil
1-2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups chicken broth
3 tablespoons cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
2 12 ounce cans evaporated milk
2 1lb. packages DeLallo mini potato gnocchi (about 4 cups)
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
5 ounces fresh baby spinach

Directions:
Place the chicken, mirepoix, basil, Italian seasoning, poultry seasoning, salt, and broth in a crockpot or slow cooker. Cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours or low for 6-8 hours. Shred the chicken directly in the crockpot.
Add the cornstarch mixture, evaporated milk, and gnocchi. Stir and replace cover. Cook another 45 minutes â€“ 1 hour until the soup has thickened and the gnocchi has softened.
While the soup is thickening, cut the bacon into small pieces and fry until crispy. Drain on paper towels and wipe most of the bacon grease out of the pan, leaving just a little bit for the spinach/garlic. Add the garlic and saute for one minute. Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Remove from heat. Add the bacon and spinach to the crockpot. Stir to combine.
Add any additional liquid as needed (I added about a cup of water once it started to thicken) and season again with salt and pepper as needed.
