Ingredients:
One (1) bag butterscotch chips
1/2 to 1 cup peanut butter
1/4 tsp vanilla
6 to 8 cups flake cereal (or any nonsweetened cereal)

Directions:
Pour bag of butterscotch chips into a heavy sauce pan with low heat setting.
Stir until chips are melted.
Add the peanut butter and stir until melted and blended with the butterscotch chips.
Stir in vanilla.
Pour cereal in a large mixing bowl and crush (this holds the cookies together better) and stir until blended.
Place heaping teaspoons of the mixture onto a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper and refrigerate (or place in cool place) until cookies set.  Store in cool place.
