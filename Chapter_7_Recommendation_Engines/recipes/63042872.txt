Ingredients:
1 small can of tomato paste
1 large can of tomatoes
1 jar of Spaghetti sauce any kind - I get any Italian herb jar on sale
2 tablespoon olive oil
6 cloves of garlic chopped (can use jar of garlic)
2 medium yellow onions (or 1 large)
1 lb hot Italian sausage
1 lb sweet Italian sausage
1 tsp basil
2 bay leaves
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp rosemary
1 cup of red wine (cooking, Chianti, anything on hand)
1 tsp sugar

Directions:
In large pot - Brown Sausage & drain oil from pot and put sausage on paper towel
Add 2 TBS of olive oil and brown garilc & onion
Add in remaining ingredients and sausage
Simmer for 2 hours
Serve over angel hair or regular spaghetti that has been boiled and coated with 1 TBS of olive oil.
Freeze remaining sauce in individual size Food Saver Bags - close bag (I use black paper clips) and put in freezer.
When solid - seal bags with FoodSaver - Put bag opening into slot - Close and lock Foodsaver - press "Vacuum and seal" to get air out and permanently close. Laying bag flat on counter in front of FoodSaver helps get the air out. Label Contents and Date and return to freezer.
