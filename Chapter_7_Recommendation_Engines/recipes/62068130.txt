Ingredients:
1 lb. Ground Beef
1 16 oz. Canned Chili w/beans
1 8 oz. can Veg-All mixed veggies
1/2 cup Sweet and Tangy Ketchup
1 cup shredded lettuce

Directions:
In a pan, brown the ground beef and drain fat. Stir in the ketchup until the meat has a nice red coating. Add the Hormel chili and Veg-all. Cook over medium/low heat 10 minutes or until fully heated through. Spoon onto you choice of taco shells and top with shredded lettuce. You can also add more of the ketchup on the top as a sauce.
This is exactly how the recipe was given to me. Personally I also add tomato, cheese, mild salsa & taco sauce like the traditional tacos. Typically I like hot & spicy but these are a little something different. These are very filling and can be easily made with a low budget. Not to mention that since they aren't spicy the kids can eat them too! Enjoy!
