Ingredients:
2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pat green beans dry with paper towels if necessary; spread onto a jellyroll pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Use your fingers to coat beans evenly with olive oil and spread them out so they don't overlap.
Roast in the preheated oven until beans are slightly shriveled and have brown spots, 20 to 25 minutes.

A great alternative to fast-food French fries. My family and friends love these as a snack or hors d'oeuvre. No matter how many I make, it's never enough!
