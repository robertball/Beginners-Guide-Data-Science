Ingredients:
2 c. spiral veggie pasta
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and chopped
1/2 c. sliced black olives
1/4 c. chopped red onion
1/2 c. mayonnaise
1/4 c. sour cream
1-1/4 tsp. dill weed
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. ground mustard
1/4 tsp. garlic salt

Directions:
Cook pasta; drain and rinse with cold water.  Place pasta in a large bowl and add cucumber, olives and onion.  Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl; pour over salad and toss to coat.  Cover and chill for 2 hours before serving.  **If you make this the night before, add a little water and toss again to "rejuvenate" before serving the next day.
