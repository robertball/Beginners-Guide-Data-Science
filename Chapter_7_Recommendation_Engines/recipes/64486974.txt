Nana's Potato Salad Recipe

Ingredients:
5 pounds potatoes of your choice, I usually use a bag of red organics from TJ’s
1 medium onion, diced
6 dill pickles, chopped
½ cup whole grain mustard
1 cup mayo (preferably homemade)
6 hard cooked eggs, chopped
¼ cup pickle juice
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Cook the potatoes whole, in their jackets, over medium heat, for about 20 minutes, until knife tender. Don’t overcook. Cool and chop into chunks. I pull away about half the peels during this process, and leave half on. After chopping the onion, sprinkle it with salt, which helps mellow its raw onion-y-ness.
Combine all ingredients and season to taste. It’s even better if you make it a day ahead. Like any and every recipe, taste and make adjustments before serving. If you make it in advance, it’s always a good idea to add more mayo and pickle juice.
This goes so well with fried chicken.
