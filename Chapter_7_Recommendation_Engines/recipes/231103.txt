Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bow tie pasta
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground red chile pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

2 green onions, sliced
2 avocados - peeled, pitted, and diced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Whisk olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, garlic powder, cumin, ground chile pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir corn, black beans, diced tomatoes and green chiles, and green onions into the dressing to coat. Gently mix avocados into bean mixture; fold bow tie pasta into the salad. Cover salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes before serving.
