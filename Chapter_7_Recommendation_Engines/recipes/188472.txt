Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 head garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
3 large onions, chopped
4 large carrots, cubed
4 large potatoes, cubed
1/4 head cabbage, chopped
2 cups tomato puree
2 cups water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Stir in the ginger, turmeric, black pepper, cloves, fenugreek, garlic, and one teaspoon salt.  Continue to stir until the spices and garlic are well coated in oil, about 30 seconds.  Stir in the onions; cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the carrots, potatoes, and cabbage; cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the tomato puree and the water. Continue to cook over very low heat, until vegetables are soft and the tomato sauce thickens, about 30 to 40 minutes. Taste for seasoning and add additional salt and pepper, if needed.
