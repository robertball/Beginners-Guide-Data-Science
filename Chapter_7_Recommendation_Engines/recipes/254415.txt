Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 spaghetti squash
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chopped tomatoes
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1/4 cup chopped fresh oregano
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Pierce spaghetti squash in several places with a knife. Microwave on medium-high, rotating every 5 minutes, until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from microwave. Let cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes.
Cut squash in half and scoop out seeds. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to the greased baking dish.
Pour tomatoes, 3/4 cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, garlic, and salt over spaghetti squash; mix well. Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 45 to 60 minutes.

Description: 
A healthy low-carb dish every one likes. I have taken it to pot-lucks and people love it. Ground beef or Italian sausage can be added. I have even used leftover spaghetti sauce in this.
