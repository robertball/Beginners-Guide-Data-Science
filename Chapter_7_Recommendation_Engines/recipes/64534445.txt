Spaghetti Squash Noodles Recipe

Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash
up to 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
sauce of your choice (marinara, alfredo, etc.)
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F. Optional: Line a baking sheet with foil for easy clean up.
Slice the top inch and bottom inch off the spaghetti squash. Some people leave the top on, but at least slice off the bottom to make it stable when you cut it lengthwise. Next, slice the squash in half lengthwise. Use the largest knife you have and go slow; it might take a few minutes.
Using a spoon, scrape out all of the seeds and stringy flesh. Brush the cut flesh of the spaghetti squash with a little extra virgin olive oil and place cut side down on the foil lined baking sheet. Tip: In very dry climates you can add one or more tablespoons to the baking sheet if needed to retain moisture. I typically don’t do this because I find it can make the noodles too wet, but in a very dry climate this might help if your noodles seems too dry.
Roast 30-40 minutes until the flesh is fork tender and completely cooked through. Let rest at least 15 minutes or until it’s cool enough to handle. Using a fork, start at one end and scape the “noodles” out lengthwise. Voila! Noodles.
Toss with any sauce (marinara is delicious!) or just a dash of extra virgin olive oil and salt and pepper. Serve hot or warm. Store in an airtight glass container in the refrigerator up to two days.
