Description: 
I have been making these meatballs for years and every time I make them someone wants to know the recipe.  You won't want to share either- IT IS SO EASY, IT IS EMBARRASING! I make them for every picnic, party and game day celebration.  We serve them two ways- as is, as an appetizer or on Italian rolls with fresh grated mozzarella as a main course.
