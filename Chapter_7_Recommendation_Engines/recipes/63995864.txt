Ingredients:
2 cups canned black beans, rinsed and drained
2 cups canned white beans, rinsed and drained
2 (14.5 ounce) cans rotel tomatoes
1 1/2 cups frozen cooked kale
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup diced onion
2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
4 cups chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
Place black beans, white beans, tomatoes, and kale in a slow cooker.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Transfer the onion to the slow cooker.
Sprinkle with chili powder, garlic and herb seasoning, and salt.
Place the chicken breast halves on top, then pour the chicken broth into the slow cooker.
Cook on Low for 6 hours. Remove the chicken breasts, and shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Stir the shredded chicken back into the chili.
Stir in the heavy cream, allow to heat for a few minutes, and serve.
