Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds hot turkey sausage
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
3 cloves garlic, pressed
1 (14.5 ounce) can Italian-style diced tomatoes, undrained
2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice
1 bay leaf
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning

Directions:
Grill or fry sausage until almost cooked through. Drain and set aside. When cooled, cut into bite-size pieces.
In a large skillet combine the celery, onion, bell pepper, garlic, tomatoes, broth, rice, bay leaf and seasoning. Mix well and bring to a boil over medium high heat.
Reduce heat to medium low and add sausage. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 40 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a low-fat version of the classic Cajun dish.  You can use any kind of meat...sausage, chicken, shrimp, or, as I do, lowfat turkey sausage.  This is a snap to prepare. You'll love it!
