Ingredients:
1 large onion, cut into rings
3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup corn starch
2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 egg
1 cup soy milk (or regular milk if non-vegan)
1 cup bread crumbs
A few dashes of garlic powder and paprika

Directions:
Separate the onion slices into rings and set aside.
In a small bowl, stir together the flour, corn starch, baking powder, and salt.
Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until coated; set aside.
Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork.
Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping.
Place the bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.
Place the rings side by side in the frying basket. Spray lightly with cooking oil, flip and place in the air fryer.
Fry the rings for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Flip once during the cooking. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.

Description: 
Battered, breaded, and then fried to crispy perfection. What's best- because they are air fried, they are healthier than their deep fried counterparts!
