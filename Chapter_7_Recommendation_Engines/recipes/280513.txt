Description: 
I love zucchini boats, and I'm always looking for new ways to experience them. This is a very hearty dish with ground beef, and my family loves it! This is the perfect use for all those jumbo zucchinis growing in your garden! Sprinkle each slice with additional dried oregano and dried basil as desired.
