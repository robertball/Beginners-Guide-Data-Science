Ingredients:
1 medium head bok choy, shredded
1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
4 green onions, chopped
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon Dijon-style prepared mustard
3/4 cup cider vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Combine bok choy, red bell pepper, and scallions in a large bowl.
In a smaller bowl, whisk together red pepper flakes (or chile paste), mustard, apple cider vinegar, garlic, ginger, sugar, salt, and oil.
Pour this spicy dressing over the chopped vegetables, and toss well.  Refrigerate for 1 hour, then toss again. Taste salad, and add more chile paste, salt, or sugar to taste before serving.

Description: 
Bok choy is in the cabbage family, and is very popular in China. In this recipe, it is shredded to resemble a coleslaw, but that is where the resemblance to that creamy classic ends.  This dish is very spicy and full of flavor.  It not only tastes great, but is strangely fun to eat.  If you have chile paste, use 2 teaspoons of that instead of the red pepper flakes.
