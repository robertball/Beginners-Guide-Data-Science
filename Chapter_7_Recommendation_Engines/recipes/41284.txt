Ingredients:
1 egg
2 green onions with tops, sliced
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 (12 ounce) jar beef gravy
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons prepared horseradish
1/2 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced

Directions:
In a bowl, beat the egg; stir in onions, bread crumbs and mustard. Add beef and mix well. Shape into four 1/2-in.-thick patties.
In an ungreased skillet, cook patties for 4-5 minutes on each side or until meat is no longer pink; drain.
In a small bowl, combine gravy, water and horseradish; add mushrooms. Pour over patties. Cook, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and heated through.
