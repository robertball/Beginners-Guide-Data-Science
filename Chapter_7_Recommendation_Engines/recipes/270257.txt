Ingredients:
3 large zucchini, finely grated
1/2 teaspoon salt
Batter:
1 egg
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
oil for frying
Toppings:
1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste
1 pinch salt
1/4 cup sour cream, for topping

Directions:
Combine zucchini and salt in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside for 10 minutes. Pour mixture onto a clean dish towel or cheesecloth and squeeze to drain completely.
Whisk egg in a bowl and add flour, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir in drained zucchini and mix well.
Heat oil in a medium-sized pan over medium-high heat. Add batter by the tablespoon. Cook fritters until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per batch. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and salt. Serve immediately with sour cream.
