Ingredients:
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds lean ground beef
4 onions, chopped
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon (optional)
1/8 cup crushed walnuts
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups warm water

Directions:
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat and add beef, onions, salt and pepper to taste, cinnamon, and nuts; cook until beef is no longer pink. Remove from heat and let cool.
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, eggs, and water; mix until dough is smooth. Roll the dough into a ball and cut into 10 pieces.
On a floured board, roll flat each piece of dough; cut out 5 circles, about 3 inches in diameter. Place about 1 teaspoon of meat filling in the middle of each circle; fold the dough over and seal the edges with a small amount of water.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; drop in kreplach a few at a time. Cook for 4 minutes or until kreplach float to the top. Remove with a slotted spoon; serve.
