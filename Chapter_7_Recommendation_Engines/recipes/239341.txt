Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature
4 large whole-wheat sandwich wrap
1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as CraisinsÂ®), or to taste
12 slices turkey lunch meat
1 cup fresh spinach, or to taste

Directions:
Spread 1/4 of the cream cheese onto the middle of one side of each sandwich wrap. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cranberries onto the cheese on each wrap. Arrange 3 slices turkey atop each wrap to cover most of the wrap. Spread 1/4 cup spinach atop the turkey.
Starting with one edge of a wrap, tightly roll the wrap around the fillings into a cylinder; cut into 1 1/4-inch slices and arrange onto a serving platter.
