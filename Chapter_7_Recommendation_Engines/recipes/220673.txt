Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup finely diced onion
1 bay leaf
1 cup uncooked basmati rice
salt to taste
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

Directions:
Heat chicken stock in a saucepan until boiling; keep hot until ready to use.
Heat vegetable oil in a 2 quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and bay leaf in the hot oil until onion is tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir basmati rice into onion mixture until rice is coated with oil.
Pour hot chicken stock into the rice mixture. Season with salt; stir.
Bring rice mixture to a boil; cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue simmering until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.
Remove saucepan from heat and discard bay leaf. Add butter and fluff the rice with a fork.
