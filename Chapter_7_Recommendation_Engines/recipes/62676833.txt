Ingredients:
1 cup creamy rice cereal
3 cups water
pinch of salt
1 cup whole wheat flour, sifted
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 cup milk
2 eggs, beaten
1 tbsp melted butter or margarine
1 tbsp honey
1 tbsp vanilla
1 tbsp brown sugar
Olive Oil spray

Directions:
First make the rice cereal according to package directions.  I use Bob's Red Mill Brown Rice Farina.  Boil the water, add the salt and then the rice.  Turn heat to low and stir often.  Allow the rice to cool a little, you want it warm but not steaming.
Next combine your dry ingredients in a large bowl and liquid ingredients in a medium bowl.  All at once combine the solids and liquids and stir until there are no lumps
Add the cooked rice.  If lumps appear squish the lumps with the back of your spoon.  (if your rice is cool enough this should not happen).
Preheat your griddle on medium heat and coat it with olive oil.  Spoon the batter onto the griddle like you would for pancakes.
Cook the cakes until the top looks dry and is covered with small bubbles - about 7-9 minutes.  Flip the cakes and flatten with the spatula.
Flip the cakes and flatten few times until cooked evenly.  Cakes will puff a little when cooked through.

Description: 
These are very versatile - I give the sweet version here, but you could also omit the sweet ingredients and add lemon juice and zest and poppy seeds, or scallions.  Serve for breakfast with fruit and syrup, or savory with fish or chicken.  Also makes a good snack cold!
