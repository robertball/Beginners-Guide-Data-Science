Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup canola oil
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 cup plain yogurt
3 beaten eggs
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup crumbled feta cheese
1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons paprika
2 egg yolks
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix the flour with baking soda in a bowl; set aside.
Mix the canola oil, butter, yogurt, eggs, sour cream, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients to form a soft dough. Knead and squeeze the dough in the bowl until it is no longer sticky, about 5 minutes. Stir the feta cheese, parsley, olive oil, and paprika together in a bowl with a fork to make a filling.
Make each dumpling by pinching off about 2 1/2 tablespoons of dough; roll into a ball about 1 3/4 inches across between your hands, and press it into a flat circle 3 inches across on your palm. Spoon 1 scant tablespoon of filling into the center of the circle. Bring the edges of the circle together over the filling, and pinch them together to make a fat, round little stuffed dumpling. Set the dumplings onto the parchment paper-lined baking sheet, seam sides down. Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl, and brush the pogaca tops with the egg yolk. Sprinkle each with about 1/4 teaspoon of sesame seeds.
Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are shiny, brown, and crackled, 20 to 30 minutes.
