Description: 
These are very creamy and delicious. You may even forget that this is a healthy alternative to traditional fudge! I received this recipe from a friend. She does not remember where she got it from. I thought this was worth keeping and sharing so it doesn't get lost. These are primal and paleo diet-friendly. Substitute pure maple syrup for the honey to make these vegan-friendly.
