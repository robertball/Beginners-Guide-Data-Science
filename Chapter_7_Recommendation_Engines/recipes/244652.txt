Ingredients:
1/2 red bell pepper
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
3/4 cup water
3/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons dried basil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons dried minced onion
3/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and add red bell pepper.
Roast red bell pepper under the broiler until slightly blackened, about 12 minutes. Transfer bell pepper to a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap for about 10 minutes. Carefully remove plastic wrap and peel skin from bell pepper.
Blend roasted red pepper, oil, water, vinegar, sugar, basil, lemon juice, minced onion, and salt in a blender until smooth.

Description: 
My family prefers the store brand of Italian dressing to any of the name brands. They all pretty much taste the same and have the same ingredients. This is a copycat of their dressing using mostly ingredients from the cabinet most people keep on hand or can find easily.  The water makes it stretch a little further for those on a tight budget, but you might also like it without.
