Ingredients:
2 heads, Cauliflower (riced)
1 Egg
1/3 c Goat Cheese
1/2 c Parmesan Cheese (shredded)
1/4 c Mozzarella Cheese (shredded)
1 Tbsp Oregano
1 Tbsp Thyme
1 tsp Sea Salt
1 tsp Garlic Powder

Directions:
Place pizza stone in oven and preheat to 450 degrees.
Dice cauliflower into small pieces, discarding most of the stem and process in a food processor into a very fine texture. Microwave for six minutes. Working in batches, transfer the cooked cauliflower to cheesecloth and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Add the squeezed cauliflower to a bowl and mix well with remaining ingredients.
Place a piece of parchment paper over a pizza peel, and shape the dough like a pizza crust, being careful to maintain a consistent thickness. The "dough" will be fairly wet, but that is okay.
Slide the parchment paper and pizza crust onto the pizza stone and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove from oven (keeping it on the parchment) and top with your favorite sauce, toppings, and cheese. Return the assembled pizza (still in top of the parchment paper) to the pizza stone and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and enjoy. Note: allowing the crust to cool slightly makes it a little more rigid and easier to hold in your hand.
