Title:
The Perfect Picnic Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 pound box strawberries
1 (approx. 8 oz.) wedge brie cheese, well wrapped in plastic
1 box multigrain water crackers
1 16 oz. bag pistacchio nuts (or "Thai Lime and Chili Cashews," if you have a Trader Joe's)
1 pack Italian dry salami
1 bag multigrain pita chips
1 8 oz. tub garlic hummus (or you could make your own)
6 hard-boiled eggs
chocolate covered almonds (Again, we buy milk chocolate and cocoa covered almonds from Trader Joe's)
1 bottle chardonnay, chilled
Four cans soda (if you have kids... we usually take diet Coke or Pepsi), chilled

Directions:
Put everything in a picnic bag along with a knife for the cheese, a bottle opener for the wine, napkins, and paper or plastic plates and cups.  Don't worry about keeping everything too cold; the beverages will stay cold on their own and the cheese needs to soften.
Go sailing, hiking, or whatever it is you are doing.  Tote your bag with you.
Open the bag and eat it all up!
