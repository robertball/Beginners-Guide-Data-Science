Ingredients:
PAM® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray
1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup water
1 (6 ounce) can Hunt's® Tomato Paste
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
1 (16 ounce) package frozen P. F. Chang's® Steamed White Rice
1 cup shredded carrot
1 cup chopped kimchi
Chopped green onion and cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Spray inside of 4.5-quart slow cooker and large skillet with cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper; cook 8 to 10 minutes, until browned on all sides. Transfer meat to slow cooker.
Add water, tomato paste, brown sugar and gochujang to skillet, stirring to loosen the brown bits from bottom of skillet. Pour sauce over pork in slow cooker.
Cover and cook on LOW 8 to 10 hours or on HIGH 4 to 6 hours. Microwave rice according to package directions. Remove pork from slow cooker and shred with two forks; return to sauce in slow cooker. Divide rice evenly into 6 servings, top each with pork, carrot, kimchi, green onion and cilantro.
