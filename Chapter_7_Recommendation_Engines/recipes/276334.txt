Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package bow-tie pasta (farfalle)
1 bunch broccoli, cut into florets
5 ounces Muenster cheese
5 ounces Colby-Jack cheese
5 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese
2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, sliced
1/2 cup pepperoni, cut into quarters
1 (8 ounce) bottle creamy Italian salad dressing (such as Wish-BoneÂ®)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Meanwhile, place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain and let cool.
Cut cheeses into small cubes and combine in a large bowl with pasta, broccoli, ham, cherry tomatoes, olives, and pepperoni. Mix in the dressing. Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and paprika. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
