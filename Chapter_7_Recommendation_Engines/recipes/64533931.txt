Ingredients:
6 Green Bell Peppers
3 lbs Ground Beef (93% lean preferred)
1 Yellow Onion
1 tablespoon N'Orleans Weber Seasoning (any seasoning you like works too)
1 tablespoon Garlic Salt
1 jar Super Chunky Mushroom Ragu Spaghetti Sauce
1 cup Rice
4 handfuls Shredded Cheese (a typical "Mexican Blend" store-bought works great)

Directions:
Cut bell peppers' tops off and clear out the insides so that the peppers resemble a bowl
Place them in a pot and boil for about 15 minutes
Remove the peppers from the water and let them cool while continuing the rest of the steps
While boiling the peppers, simultaneously start cooking the meat
Cook ground beef and diced yellow onion, seasoning with preferred seasoning and garlic salt
Once the beef is fully cooked, pour in the jar of spaghetti sauce
Pour in the rice (minute rice makes it much easier)
If you choose to use regular rice, you'll want to add in some water and cover until rice is cooked
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F
Once rice is fully cooked, put 2 handfuls of cheese into the mix
Oil a casserole dish and place the peppers into it
Put the meat mixture from pan into the peppers and casserole dish
Sprinkle 2 handfuls of cheese over the whole thing
Put the casserole in oven for about 15 minutes (or until cheese is slightly browned)
