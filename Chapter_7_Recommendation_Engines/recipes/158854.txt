Description: 
Every time my family and I go to a Chinese buffet we make a bee line for the green beans!  This is a simple and tasty re-creation of that much loved side dish, goes well with any Asian meal.  Make sure to slice the garlic, don't use a garlic press.  Oyster sauce can be found in the Asian section of your grocery store, at an Asian grocery store, and online.
