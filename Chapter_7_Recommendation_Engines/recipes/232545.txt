Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup raw sugar
1 egg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
2 pinches ground nutmeg, or to taste
3 cups finely shredded zucchini
1 cup chopped pecans
Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups confectioners' sugar
60 raisins, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat 1/2 cup butter with raw sugar in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in egg.
Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Stir flour mixture, alternating with zucchini and pecans, into creamed butter mixture until just incorporated. Drop batter by the heaping tablespoonful onto the prepared baking sheet, keeping cookies 2 inches apart.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
Beat cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and vanilla extract together using an electric mixer in a bowl until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until incorporated.
Frost the cooled cookies; top each cookie with 2 raisins.

Description: 
Shredded zucchini is the secret ingredient in these nicely spiced cookies topped with cream cheese frosting and a few raisins. I prefer the Mexican vanilla.
