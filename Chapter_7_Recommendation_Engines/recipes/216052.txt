Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved
6 ounces pitted kalamata olives, halved
2 English cucumbers - peeled, seeded, and sliced
1 small red onion, sliced thin
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1/4 cup olive oil, or more if needed
1 tablespoon garlic salt
ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the squash halves into a large baking dish with the cut-sides facing down.
Bake in the preheated oven until you can easily cut into the skin side with a knife, about 30 minutes; remove from oven and set aside to cool.
Toss the cooled spaghetti squash, the tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, red onion, and garlic together in a large bowl until evenly mixed.
Stir the lemon juice and lemon zest together in a small bowl; slowly pour the olive oil into the lemon juice mixture while whisking vigorously. Season with garlic salt and pepper; drizzle over the spaghetti squash mixture and toss to coat. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.
