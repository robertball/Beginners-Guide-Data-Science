Ingredients:
2 large size tubes of chocolate chip cookie dough
2 8 oz packages softened cream cheese
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350
Press 1 package of chocolate chip cookie dough into a greased 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium sized bowl mix cream cheese, sugar and vanilla and spread over the pressed cookie dough.
Open second package of cookie dough scoop out a cookie size amount of dough and flatten it between the palm of your hand. Wet your hand with water throughout this process so the dough doesn't stick to your hands.
Layer the flattened dough on top of the cream cheese mixture.   This layer of dough will spread to form the top crust so don't worry if the cream cheese isn't totally covered.
Bake in preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.
Let cool and refrigerate at least one hour before cutting into bars.
