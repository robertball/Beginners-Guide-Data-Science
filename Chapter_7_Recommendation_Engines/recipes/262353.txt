Description: 
These make delicious appetizers or a great sandwich filling. They won't fool anyone but they are satisfying and delicious! When feeding to young children, simply omit the hot sauce at the end. They make yummy 'chicken' fingers. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Serve with a vegan dressing.
