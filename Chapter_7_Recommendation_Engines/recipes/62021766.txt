Ingredients:
1 cup oatmeal
1 cup cornmeal
1/2 cup natural bran
1/2 wheat germ
1/2 soy flour
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tsp. salt
2 envelopes dry yeast
6 T. vegetable oil (or 1/2 cup applesauce)
1/2 honey (or 1/4 c. honey and 1/4 c. brown sugar)
4 cups very warm water (110-115 degrees)
4 cups bread flour
sesame seeds

Directions:
Combine first 8 ingredients in a bowl and add liquids.  Beat with electric mixer for 5 min.  Stir in bread flour, one cup at a time, until dough is kneadable (takes 4, but this is variable).  Turn out on a floured surface and knead about 5 minutes - adding "dusting" of flour as necessary.  Return to slightly greased bowl and let rise until doubled, in draft-free place.  Punch down- divide and shape into 2 loaves and place in greased 9X5X3" pans.  Brush with milk and sprinkle generously with sesame seeds.  Let rise 'til doubled.  Preheat oven for 10 minutes @ 350 degrees.  Bake loaves 45-50 minutes.  Cool on racks.
Pleated tall storage bags (1 1/2 gallon size) holds 1 loaf perfectly!
