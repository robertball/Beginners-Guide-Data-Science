Ingredients:
18 ounces good-quality milk chocolate, chopped
egg-shaped plastic mold(s)

Directions:
Place 3/4 of the milk chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted and has a temperature of 113 degrees F (46 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir in the remaining 1/4 of the milk chocolate. Stir well until smooth and chocolate has a temperature of 86 degrees F (30 degrees C).
Spread 1 layer of chocolate evenly in the Easter egg mold halves using a pastry brush and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and add another layer of chocolate to each egg half. Chill for 10 minutes. Brush a third time with chocolate and chill for a final 10 minutes.
Unmold egg halves carefully and trim the edges with a sharp knife. Brush the edges with a little melted chocolate, then carefully bring two halves together to form a single egg. Set back in the mold carefully and chill until set, 10 to 15 minutes.
