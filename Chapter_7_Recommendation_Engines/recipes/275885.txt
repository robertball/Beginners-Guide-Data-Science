Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups dry kidney beans

Directions:
Pour beans into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)). Cover with a few inches of cool water. Close and lock the lid. Select Manual; set timer for 28 minutes on high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain beans and let cool.

Description: 
I don't buy canned beans anymore; I use my pressure cooker to cook them from dry every time. I don't even have to think about soaking them ahead of time, since that's not needed. If you do decide to soak, check your appliance manual because cooking time will be shorter.
