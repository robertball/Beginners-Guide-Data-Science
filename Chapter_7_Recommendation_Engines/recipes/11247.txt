Ingredients:
4 1/4 cups cornstarch
1 1/4 cups butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon almond extract
2 cups shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.
Cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, vanilla and almond extracts.
Add the cornstarch, flour and finely grated coconut. Mix until blended and smooth.
Make small balls about 1inch in diameter, then roll on floured board into a 7 inch long strip. Twist into a figure eight. Place cookies on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Remove from cookie sheets and let cool. May be drizzled with melted chocolate, if desired.
