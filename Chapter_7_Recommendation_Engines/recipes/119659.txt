Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter (no substitutes), softened
1 cup sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
4 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin
3 cups biscuit/baking mix
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup milk
GLAZE:
1/3 cup butter
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 tablespoons water

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter and sugars. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add pumpkin; mix well. Combine the biscuit mix, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk. Pour into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to wire rack.
For glaze, in a saucepan, cook and stir butter over medium heat for 6-7 minutes or until golden brown. Pour into a mixing bowl; beat in confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough water to achieve drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cooled bread.

Description: 
I've been making this moist bread for years. It looks pretty on the table and provides a nice taste of pumpkin on your menu when you're not planning pumpkin pie for dessert. -Theresa Stewart, New Oxford, Pennsylvania
