Ingredients:
10 ounces ground turkey
3 turkey Italian sausages, casings removed
1 cup chopped green bell pepper

Stir tomatoes, zucchini, chicken broth, Italian seasoning, sea salt, tarragon, garlic powder, and black pepper into turkey mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 1 hour. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese.
