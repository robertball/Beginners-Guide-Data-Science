Title:
Baked Spaghetti Squash Lasagna Style (II) Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 onion, chopped
2 small green, red, yellow or orange peppers
1-27oz can Hunt's Roasted Garlic & Onion Spaghetti Sauce
pinch of red pepper flakes
small pinch of fennel seeds
black pepper to taste
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
8 oz low-fat ricotta cheese
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Drizzle olive oil on squash and place squash halves cut side down in a pyrex baking dish.
Bake squash 45 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife can be easily inserted. Remove from oven, and cool.
Saute any kind of bell peppers & 1/2 onion in olive oil. Add a can of Hunt's Roasted Garlic & Onion Spaghetti Sauce (seasoned with red pepper flakes and a few fennel seeds, which remind me of my Italian grandpa's homemade sausage w/o adding meat. Be careful, though, only a few seeds  -- they are strong-flavored, and can be over-powering.)
Scoop pulp into the pan you used to roast the squash, smear the spaghetti sauce over the pulp and dollop one 8 oz. container of low-fat ricotta over the sauce. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese on top. Lastly, top with Parmesan cheese.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese melts.

Description: 
I wanted this to really taste like lasagna, and I wanted it to be EZ! So I adapted Brisak's Baked Spaghetti Squash, Lasagna Style, by using a commercially made spaghetti sauce base,reducing mozzarelly and parm cheeses, and adding a ricotta layer. Enjoy.Modified from: Baked Spaghetti Squash Lasagna Style
