Ingredients:
2 tablespoons grapeseed oil
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 (10 ounce) packages frozen butternut squash
1 cup coconut milk
3 tablespoons peanut butter
1/8 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a deep pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add oil to the hot pot. Add onion to the hot oil and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add curry, ginger, and cayenne. Cook until onion just starts to brown, about 2 minutes.
Add squash and coconut milk to the pot with the onion. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring once or twice, until squash is tender, about 20 minutes. Remove lid; if soup is not thick enough, turn heat to medium-high and cook until thickened, about 20 minutes more. Adjust seasoning and garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
A simple and spicy curry that tastes great with steamed sticky rice, wide noodles, or naan bread. Serve with a dollop of mozzarella (burrata, if you have it) to cut the spicy. Or serve plain. Very easy to make ahead and makes a great lunch! Trust your gut with seasonings; you can always add more as you go on and cooking will deepen the flavors. Curry will thicken as it cools.
