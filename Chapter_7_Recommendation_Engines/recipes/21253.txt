Ingredients:
5 large potatoes, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup milk
1 cup chopped green onions
1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas
1 cup Ranch-style salad dressing

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add potatoes and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain potatoes and transfer to a large bowl.  Pour in milk and mash until smooth.  Stir in onions and cheese; mix well.  Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons of potato mixture into the center of each tortilla and fold in half; secure with a toothpick.
In a large skillet add enough oil to reach 1 inch in depth and heat over medium-high heat.  Fry tortillas until crispy.  Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.
