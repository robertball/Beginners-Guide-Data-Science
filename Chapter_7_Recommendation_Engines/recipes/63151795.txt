6 oz thin pretzel sticks
6 oz pretzel twists
2 cups salad oil
2 Tbsp Worchestershire sauce
1 Tbsp garlic salt
1 Tbsp seasoned salt

Directions:
Mix cereals and pretzels in a large roaster pan (the insert to a roaster oven works well).
Mix oil, Worch. sauce, and salts together.
Pour oil mixture over cereals and mix well but gently to moisten cereal.

Turn out onto newspaper or paper towels to cool.
Store in airtight container(s).

Description: 
I've never seen this recipe online but it is better, I think, than the traditional Chex mix made with butter.
