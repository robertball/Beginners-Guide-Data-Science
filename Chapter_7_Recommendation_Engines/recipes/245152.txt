Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 onions, minced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons agave nectar
2 tablespoons water, or as needed
3 carrots, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 (14 ounce) cans chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
4 lemon wedges
4 sprigs fresh cilantro, or as desired

Directions:
Heat oil in a tagine or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir onions and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add turmeric, cumin, agave nectar, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and black pepper and stir until onion mixture is evenly coated. Add just enough water to cover the bottom of the tagine; add carrots and salt. Cook over medium-low for 12 minutes.
Mix chickpeas into carrot mixture, adding more water if needed to cover the bottom but keeping the sauce thick. Cook mixture for 7 minutes.
Serve tagine with lemon wedges and cilantro.

Description: 
This tagine is a deliciously spicy meal that is my go-to dinner for guests, because everyone loves it and it's vegan! I usually pair it with some cumin roasted cauliflower.
