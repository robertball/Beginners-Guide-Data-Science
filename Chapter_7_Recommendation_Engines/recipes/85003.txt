3 (6 ounce) packages garlic and herb couscous mix (or any flavor you prefer)
1 pint cherry tomatoes, cut in half

1 cup mixed bell peppers (green, red, yellow, orange), diced
1 cucumber, sliced and then halved
1/2 cup parsley, finely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
1/2 cup Greek vinaigrette salad dressing

Directions:
Cook couscous according to package directions. Transfer to a large serving bowl to cool. Stir to break up clusters of couscous.
