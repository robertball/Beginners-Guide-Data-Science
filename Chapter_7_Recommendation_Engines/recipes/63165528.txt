You want some fries with that shake! Ha! Hey ya'll, thank y'all sooo much for your feed back on my dark chocolate granola and giving me 4.5 stars! 

I am a huge fan of Chick-Fil-A's Seasonal Peppermint shake, so I decided, why not make my own at home! Saves me gas, time and money! I decided to keep it as simple as possible, and family friendly, so you can make it with the kids, nieces, nephews, baby cousins or who else wants to help!  I hope y'all enjoy it, let me know! I'd love your feedback also!
