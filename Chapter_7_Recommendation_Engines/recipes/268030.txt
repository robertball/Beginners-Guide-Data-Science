Ingredients:
1 spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
2 teaspoons garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red chile flakes
kosher salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place spaghetti squash in a baking dish, cut-side up. Combine butter, olive oil, honey, ginger, garlic, and chile flakes in a small bowl. Spread mixture evenly on the cut side of the spaghetti squash; pour any extra mixture in the center of each squash. Lightly sprinkle with kosher salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until soft, about 1 hour.
Scrape the squash into strands with 2 forks and mix with the seasoned butter in each squash. Serve warm.

Description: 
Garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes come together to kick spaghetti squash up a notch. 
We like this as an alternate to rice or noodles when making Chinese stir-fry. It is also good served with grilled pork or chicken.
