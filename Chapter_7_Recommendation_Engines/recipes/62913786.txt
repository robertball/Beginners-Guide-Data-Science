Ingredients:
1 Pound Ground Beef
1 Package (1.25 oz.) Taco Seasoning Mix
1 Cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Water (as called for on seasoning packet)
2 8-oz tubes of refrigerated crescent rolls
Optional Center Ingredients
1 medium green bell pepper
1 Cup Salsa
3 Cups lettuce, shredded
1 medium tomato, diced
¼ Cup onion, chopped
½ cup pitted black olives
Sour Cream

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°.  Brown ground beef according to taco seasoning package. Add cheese.
Unroll the crescent dough; separate into triangles. Spray pizza pan with cooking spray.  Arrange triangles in a circle on a pizza pan with the wide ends toward the center of the pan, overlapping each other. It should look like a sun, with a large opening in the center.  Spoon the meat mixture evenly onto widest end of each triangle.  Bring points of triangles up over filling and tuck under wide ends of dough.  (There should be gaps where filling is showing).  Bake 18-22 minutes or until golden brown.
Fill center with the optional toppings or, leave empty. A cute idea is to cut off the top of the pepper and hollow it out, then use the pepper as a salsa bowl.
