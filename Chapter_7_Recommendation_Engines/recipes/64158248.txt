Ingredients:
6 ounces uncooked soba (buckwheat noodles)
Cooking spray
1 (1-pound) sushi-grade tuna steak
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup finely chopped English cucumber
1 cup shredded carrot
1/2 cup julienne-cut radishes
1/3 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 1/2 teaspoons dark sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted

Directions:
Cook noodles according to package directions; drain and rinse under cold water. Drain; set aside.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle both sides of tuna with 1/4 teaspoon salt and black pepper. Place tuna in pan, and cook for 3 minutes on each side or until desired degree of doneness. Transfer to a platter; cool slightly. Cut tuna into 6 equal pieces.
Combine noodles, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, cucumber, and remaining ingredients except sesame seeds in a large bowl; toss well to combine. Arrange 1 cup noodle mixture onto each of 6 plates. Top each serving with 1 teaspoon sesame seeds and 1 tuna piece.
