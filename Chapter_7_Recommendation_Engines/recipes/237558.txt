Ingredients:
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 quart chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup water
1 cup enchilada sauce
1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 cup masa
2/3 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil; cook chicken in boiling water until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken from water, let cool, and shred.
Combine chicken broth, black beans, 1 cup water, and enchilada sauce in a large pot; bring to a boil.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion mixture, chili powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and cumin to the broth mixture.
Mix masa, 2/3 cup water, and 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until evenly combined; form into small balls. Add masa balls and shredded chicken to the broth mixture.
Cook until heated through and masa balls are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir Cheddar cheese into soup until melted, about 5 minutes. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with cilantro and sour cream.
