1 14.5 ounce can of black beans
1 14.5 ounce of red kidney beans
1 10 ounce can of corn
2  10 ounce cans of diced tomatoes
2 tsp brown sugar
1 Tbs cinnamon

1 lb ground beef
1 Tbs crushed red pepper
1 lb of okra
2 cups of all purpose flower
2 large eggs
2 cups of frying oil

Directions:
Ground the beef in a large stalk pot and drain.
While the beef is browning cut the okra and coat with egg bath and toss in flower. Set aside.
Heat 2 cup of frying oil and fry the okra. Set fried pieces on paper towel and let rest.
After draining the beef add black beans, kidney beans, corn, diced tomatoes, brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin, chili powder, salt, and crushed red pepper. Heat until boiling for 30 min. Then reduce heat, cover and let simmer for 2 hours. Grab a bowel and add the fried okra to the top for a nice added crunch.

Description: 
While away from home my husband learned how to cook. The one thing that he prides himself the most on is his chili. I do have to say that even the mention of it makes my mouth water. There isn't a special ingredient or really anything unusual about the dish. It's just good.
