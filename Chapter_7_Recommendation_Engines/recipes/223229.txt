Ingredients:
16 slices bacon, cooked lightly - divided
4 walleye fillets
1 onion, halved and thinly sliced - divided
1/4 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with foil.
Place four pieces of bacon in the baking dish and top with walleye fillets. Arrange about 1/4 of the onion slices over the fish. Drizzle with melted butter and honey; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and bake in the preheated oven for until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes.
While the fish is baking, chop up the remaining bacon slices and place them in a skillet with the rest of the onion. Cook and stir over medium heat until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and golden brown and the bacon is crisp, about 15 minutes more.
Serve each walleye fillet with bacon and onions.
