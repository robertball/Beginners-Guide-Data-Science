Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups cubed red potatoes (1/4 inch pieces)
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup diced carrots
1 cup dry lentils, rinsed
1/2 cup medium pearl barley
8 cups water
2 teaspoons beef bouillon granules
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning
2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes

Directions:
In a nonstick skillet, cook beef and onion over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. Transfer to a 5-qt. slow cooker. Layer with the potatoes, celery, carrots, lentils and barley. Combine the water, bouillon, salt and lemon-pepper; pour over vegetables. Cover and cook on low for 6 hours or until vegetables and barley are tender. Add the tomatoes; cook 2 hours longer.

Description: 
It's easy for Judy Metzentine to fill her slow cooker and forget about supper...until the kitchen is filled with wonderful aroma, that is! 'I've served this soup often to family and friends on cold nights, along with homemade rolls and a green salad,' she writes from The Dalles, Oregon. For variety, she suggests substituting jicama (a starchy root vegetable found in the produce department of many grocery stores) for the potatoes.
