Ingredients:
3 sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped; 1 small shallot, finely chopped; 2 cups organic beef broth; 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk; 2 tablespoons Grade B maple syrup, 1 teaspoon sea salt; 1 teaspoon chili powder; 1 teaspoon Spanish smoked paprika; 2 teaspoons curry powder

Directions:
Peel and chop your sweet potatoes.  I chopped mine up pretty small to speed up the cooking time of the potatoes.
Place your sweet potatoes in a medium pot with the beef broth and cook over medium-high heat.
Once mushy enough (5-10 minutes if your potato pieces were small enough), mash them up with a potato masher.
Add the coconut milk, shallots,  curry, salt, chili powder, paprika, and syrup. Stir and allow to simmer for another 5-10 minutes.
Place on low heat and blend smooth with a hand blender.
Enjoy!!

Description: 
I only eat paleo these days and sometimes it's hard to find recipes that are fast and easy to make.  One beautiful arizona day, I realized I was really hungry, but also totally unwilling to head to the store. So, I scraped together what ingredients I had and was pretty pleased with the end result.  This is the first recipe I've ever shared here, so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!

Garnish with some Thai basil and avocado pieces (maybe even a little bacon...?) and enjoy the heck out of this thing!
