Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup garlic, minced
1 small red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 pound uncooked shrimp, peeled and cut into pieces
1 1/2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 cup pecans, chopped
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup pecans, chopped

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Stir in the garlic, onion, Cajun seasoning, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Stir in the shrimp.  Cook the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
Drain and discard any excess grease. Set aside.
Mix cream cheese, liquid smoke, and lemon juice in a large bowl.
Stir in the shrimp and 1/2 cup of pecans, mixing until evenly distributed. Roll the mixture into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 30 minutes.
Mix the parsley with the remaining 1/2 cup of pecans in a bowl. Roll the cheese ball in the parsley/pecans mixture until the ball is covered.
Cover and refrigerate the cheese ball until completely firm, about 2 hours.
