Ingredients:
3 lb. Bulk Hot Italian Sausage
3 c. Soft Fresh Bread Crumbs
1 T Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
1 tsp. jarred Italian Seasoning
3 T Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 BULB Garlic crushed
1/2 c. Grated Parmasian Cheese
8 oz. Mozzerella cut into 20 sticks
20 Fresh Hot Italian Banana Peppers

Directions:
1.If you could not find bulk sausage squeeze sausage out of links.
2. Brown sausage and crumble as you go.  I use a potato masher in a large frying pan to crumble to meat. Drain
3. Put cooked sausage into a large mixing bowl.  To the meat add the rest of the ingredients except mozzerella and peppers.  Mix well.
4. Slice each pepper lenght wise leaving the stem in tack.  If you like very hot peppers leave membrane and seeds in.  I remove them. First stuff a stick of mozzerella cheese into pepper then stuff with filling.
5. Bake at 350degrees  for approximately 20 min.
6. Check for doneness.  You want the pepper to me soft but not falling apart.
7.  If eating immediately add some grated mozzerella cheese the last 5 minutes to tops of peppers.  If freezing add final cheese when reheating.
