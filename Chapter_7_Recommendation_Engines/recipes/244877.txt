Ingredients:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 small boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks
3 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide strips
1 cup water
2 (10 ounce) cans tomato sauce
¾ cup green olives with pimientos
5 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons vermouth
2 tablespoons lemon juice
½ tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a Dutch oven. Add chicken and bacon; cook and stir until chicken is deep golden brown and bacon is crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain oil, leaving chicken and bacon in Dutch oven.
Pour water into Dutch oven and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom with a wooden spoon.
Stir tomato sauce, green olives, garlic, vermouth, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes into chicken mixture. Reduce heat to medium and, stirring occasionally, simmer until liquid reduces to a thick sauce, about 1 hour.
