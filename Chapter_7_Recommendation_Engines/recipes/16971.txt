Description: 
The bacon and dates in this simple yet elegant appetizer are wonderful together! My cousin whose husband was stationed in Portugal served these to rave reviews and so have I for 40 years! They are as easy as pie with only 2 ingredients and quick preparation time using round toothpicks.
