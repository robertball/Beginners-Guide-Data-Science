2 lb fresh asparagus, ends trimmed
12 slice bacon, uncooked
1/2 c light brown sugar

3. Combine brown sugar and remaining ingredients in a medium saucepan; heat mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Pour mixture over asparagus bundles.
4. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until spears have begun to wilt and bacon looks fully cooked. Enjoy!
