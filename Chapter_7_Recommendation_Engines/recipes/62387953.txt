Ingredients:
3 pounds salmon fillets
1/8 to 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
2/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2/3 cup dark brown sugar
2/3 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1/3 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Place salmon fillets in a gallon-size zippered freezer bag.  Mix remainder of ingredients until well blended then pour into bag with fillets.  Seal bag & manipulate contents until fillets are thoroughly coated with marinade.  Refrigerate for 6 hours, turning midway for more even seasoning.
Spray grill basket with cooking spray.  Preheat grill.  Pour off marinade & place salmon in basket.  Place basket on grill & cook, covered, for approximately 6 minutes per side or until fish flakes easily.
