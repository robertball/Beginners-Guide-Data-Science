Ingredients:
CAKE
1 (18 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 cup sour cream
3/4 cup vegetable oil
4 large eggs
FILLING
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup nuts, finely chopped
SUGAR GLAZE
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Combine all the cake ingredients and set aside.
Thoroughly combine the filling ingredients.
Pour half of the cake mix batter into baking pan and top with the filling ingredients. Pour the rest of the cake batter on top.
(I like to split it further and do batter, filling, batter, filling and then batter. If I really want something sweet I drizzle a little honey on top before baking.).
Bake at 350 degrees F. for 38-40 minutes in a 13x9" greased baking pan or Bundt cake pan. Meanwhile prepare the sugar glaze.
Cool cake on wire rack. Make sure you have something under the rack to catch the glaze though.
While still warm, poke holes in the cake and pour the glaze over it.
Enjoy!
