Ingredients:
1lb. lamb, cubed (shoulder, leg, or whatever you like)
2cup carrots diced (I like baby carrots)
4-6 large potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 a sweet yellow onion diced
1cup (frozen) peas
2-4 cloves garlic minced
2cup beef stock (1 can)
To taste: Lawry's seasoning salt, black pepper, paprika, thyme
***The secret ingredient is a shot or two of Jameson's Irish Whiskey!

Directions:
Throw everything in the crockpot for 6-7 hours, except the peas - put them in for the last 15 minutes before serving. The starch from the potatoes should make the stew thick enough, but add a little cornstarch & water mix if not.

Description: 
This Irish stew serves 4-6. It is our family recipe and I am sharing it with you because it's the best I've ever had. Make some soda bread with it, and have a cold Guinness. Slainte!
