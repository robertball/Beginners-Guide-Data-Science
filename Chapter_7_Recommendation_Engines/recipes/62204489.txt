Ingredients:
2 cups of soy milk
4 TBSP flour
2 TBSP sugar
2 TBSP nutritional yeast
cinnamon as needed (I use lots)
1 loaf of italian bread (sliced in 1 inch slices)
Agave nectar
powdered sugar

Directions:
Whisk together the first five ingredients. Dip bread on both sides. Place the slices on a non-stick griddle or frying pan. You may need to add more cinnamon to the mix as you dip the bread.
Flip the toast when it is lightly toasted. Toast both sides. Drizzle agave nectar over the tops of the toast and dust a little powdered sugar.
Cappuccino's also taste great with this dish!

Description: 
We had a similar non-vegan dish years ago at a little mediterranean cafe. This is our version of the dish made vegan. Yum Yum Yum.

*Agave nectar is the vegan substitution for honey, and has a sweeter yummier taste.
