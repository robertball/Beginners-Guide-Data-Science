Ingredients:
1- 3lb. Pork Loin trimmed, rinsed and patted dry
16 oz apple juice
3 tbsp honey
3 tbsp Coarse ground mustard (Dijon style)
6-8 sliced thick cut bacon
1 large yellow onion medium diced
2 Granny Smith Apples, cored, peeled, cut into 1 inch cubes
1/2 tsp granulated garlic
1 tbsp cornstarch
1  tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp thyme
1 tsp marjoram
1 Tbsp red pepper flake
1/4 cup olive oil

Directions:
Into a large plastic bag, combine half cup of apple juice, honey, mustard, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flake, thyme and marjoram. Add tenderloin and refrigerate for 6-8 hours or overnight.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In a large roasting pan add olive oil, apples and onions. Create a bed for the loin to rest on in the center of the pan.  Remove loin from bag and place on the bed of apples and onions. Pours the remaining liquid on top of the loin. Using the bacon, lay each slices over the loin wrapping it carefully; with one edge against the other. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake covered in the oven for 20- 30 minutes; baste the loin with the remaining apple juice after 20 minutes in the oven, then uncover continue to cook for another 25 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loin reads 150 degrees F.
Remove from oven and let loin rest for at least 5 minutes before carving to allow juices to redistribute.
Remove the apples and onion from pan and thicken the sauce with the cornstarch. Pour the sauce over the loin for a glossy and savory finish at service. The cooked apples and onion can be served as a side if desired.
