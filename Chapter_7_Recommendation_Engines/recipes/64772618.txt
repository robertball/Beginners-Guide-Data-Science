Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, I like to use dark, but a combo is also good (milk, semi-sweet, etc.)
1 cup whipping cream

Directions:
Combine ingredients in a glass bowl and microwave on 50% power, stirring every 30 seconds, until chips are melted and sauce is smooth.
Transfer to fondue pot.
Serve with assorted fruit (strawberries, bananas, pineapples, mandarin oranges, apples, etc.) and angel food cake or pound cake, cookies
