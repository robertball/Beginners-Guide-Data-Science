1 white onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped

8 cups water
1 pound dried red beans
1 smoked ham hock
1 pound smoked sausage, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 stalks celery, chopped

1 tablespoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®)
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried sage
1 dash hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste (optional)
3 cups cooked white rice

Directions:
Soak beans overnight, drain and refill.
Add red beans, and ham hock to large pot; bring to a boil.
Add celery, thyme, sage, creole seasoning (1/2 T for my family)
Cook beans for several hours.
Melt shortening in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and bell pepper in
hot shortening until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Add approx 2 large spoons of beans and mash into the sautéing veggies.
Stir onion mixture into the cooking beans;
Pan fry the sausage and drain.
Add the sausage to beans, bring up to boil.
Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the pot, and simmer until the beans are tender, about 3 additional hours.
If beans aren't thick enough, remove cover and cook on medium for the last 1/2 hour.
Remove and discard ham hock and pick off any edible meat.  Remove bay leaves;
Put hot sauce on the table for guests to add.
