Ingredients:
Turkey
28 oz. chicken broth
1 onion, chopped
1 stick of butter
Few celery stalks
2 lemon slices
Poultry seasoning rub

Directions:
Cut the legs off at the thighs and leave the breast whole.  Separate the back from the breast and place the back at the bottom of the can, along with the giblets and tail piece to use as a bridge.  If desired, inject the bird with your favorite flavorings.  Otherwise, season the bird with poultry spice rub.  The breast and wins fit through the top opening a little tight, but once inside keep centered and off the bottom by placing it on the back piece. The leg pieces fit snugly along each side.  Add chicken broth, chopped onion, butter, lemon and celery.  Close and latch the lid.  Cook for approximately 1 - 1 1/2 hours depending on size of the turkey.
