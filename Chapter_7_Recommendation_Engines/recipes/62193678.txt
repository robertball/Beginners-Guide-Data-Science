Ingredients:
2 CUPS Green Beans, Washed, Trimmed
1/2 CUP Onion, Thinly Sliced
1/2 CUP All-Purpose Flour
2 TBSP Butter
1 CUP White Mushrooms, Sliced
TT Salt
TT Pepper

Directions:
Cook the green beans in boiling, salted water until tender.  Shock the green beans in an ice water bath and reserve.
Soak the onion in ice water for about 1 hour.
Drain and dry the onion thoroughly.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 375º (or in a sauce pan, if a deep fryer is not available).
Season the flour with salt and pepper.  Toss the onion in the seasoned flour until coated.  Shake off any excess.
Melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium high heat and sauté the mushrooms until tender.  Add the reserved green beans to the mushrooms and reheat.  Reduce heat to lowest setting.
Deep fry the onion until golden brown and crisp.
Season the green beans with salt and pepper to taste.  Top the green beans with the fried onion just before serving.
