Dry mix:
1 1/2 T salt
2 tsp dried parsley flakes or dried dill
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp garlic powder

For dressing:
1/2 cup Hellmans mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup milk or buttermilk
1 T dry mix

Directions:
Pre-mix the dry ingredients and store in an airtight container at room temperature indefinitely.
To make the dressing, thoroughly mix the wet ingredients.
Dressing will firm up in about an hour.
Add more milk/buttermilk if too thick.
