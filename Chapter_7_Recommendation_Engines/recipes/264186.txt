Description: 
This colorful, flavorful broccoli-apple salad doesn't take long to prepare. It's amazing freshly prepared and it just gets even better-tasting every day in the fridge as the vegetables pickle themselves a bit in the dressing. I feel super healthy eating this, and it takes less time to grab a bowl than put together a fresh salad each day. It's a great side with any meal, and I even eat it for breakfast!
