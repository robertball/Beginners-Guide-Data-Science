Ingredients:
3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (small)
4 no bake lasagna noodles
1/2 tsp chicken paste
1/4 cup hot water
1 (8 ounce) package lite chive and onion cream cheese, softened
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
2 cups Barilla baking sauce

Directions:
Meanwhile, place the chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, or until no longer pink and juices run clear. Remove from saucepan,  and shred.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dissolve the chicken paste in hot water. In a large bowl, mix the chicken with the bouillon, cream cheese, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.
Spread 1/3 of baking sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with the chicken mixture, and top with 2 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce, and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella cheese.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.
