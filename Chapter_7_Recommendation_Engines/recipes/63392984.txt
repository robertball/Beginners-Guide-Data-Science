Ingredients:
32 oz butternut squash, fresh, peeled and cubed (look for time-saving peeled, cubed packages)
4-5 medium Fuji apples, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch chunks
6 tbsp. apple cider
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
3/4 tsp salt
Note: This recipe is sweet enough with the cider alone. However you may add sugar or sugar substitute to suit your taste.  The need for additional sweetener depends on tartness of apples. Amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg and salt are suggestions for where to start.  If you are a "dumper" like me, the amounts vary depending on taste almost every time I make this.

Directions:
Stir squash, apples and stir in cider to coat.
Place mixture in shallow microwave-safe dish.
Cover and microwave until tender - about 10 to 15 minutes, stirring once half way through.
Mash leaving some chunks in it.
Stir in cinnamon and nutmeg.
Opt:  Add about 1/2c. dried cranberries after cinnamon and nutmeg.
Serve hot.
