Ingredients:
2 quarts water
1 teaspoon salt
1 (16 ounce) package dry tortellini
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
1 cup whole milk
1/2 stick butter
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 cups fresh spinach
1 tomato, diced
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with 2 quarts water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, 10 to 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat cream cheese, milk, butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir until cheeses have melted and sauce is smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add spinach, and stir occasionally until spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes.
Drain tortellini, add to the sauce, and stir to combine. Garnish with tomato and remaining Parmesan cheese.
