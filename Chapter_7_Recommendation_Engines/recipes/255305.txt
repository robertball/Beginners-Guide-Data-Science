Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
2 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or more to taste
2 tablespoons bread crumbs, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons herbes de Provence

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a baking pan.
Mix Parmesan cheese and mayonnaise in a bowl; spread evenly over chicken breasts. Coat with bread crumbs; sprinkle with herbes de Provence.
Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a tried-and-tested recipe! I remember seeing an ad on TV about cooking with mayonnaise and decided to give it a shot. I've made it with just the mayonnaise on top and it really locks the moisture into the chicken. The bread crumbs and cheese are a must for me; they complement each other very well.
