Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/2 pound turkey sausage
108 ounce Costco can chili beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in spicy sauce, or pinto beans
3 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with juice
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 x-large yellow onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 tablespoon bacon bits
6 TBS beef bouillon
1 cup beer
1/4 cup chili powder
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoon dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoon dried basil
2 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 (10.5 ounce) bag corn chips such as FritosÂ®
1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground turkey and sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.
Pour in the chili beans, spicy chili beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the onion, celery, green and red bell peppers, chile peppers, bacon bits, bouillon, and beer. Season with chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, oregano, cumin, hot pepper sauce, basil, salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and sugar. Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.
To serve, ladle into bowls, and top with corn chips and shredded Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
I always prep and cook the chili the night before and then reheat the next day.  This is a combination of many different tomato-based chili recipes. Serve with beer cheese bread!Modified from: Boilermaker Tailgate Chili
