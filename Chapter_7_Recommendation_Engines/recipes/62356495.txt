Ingredients:
4 C Flour
6 Eggs (always 2 more eggs than cups of flour)
3/4 C Milk
1/2 tsp Salt
1/4 C Butter (for dumplings after boiling)

Directions:
Mix flour, eggs, salt, and milk. Start milk with 1/2 cup and add as needed to make dumplings midway between cake batter and cookie batter. Fill large pot 3/4 full of water and bring to a boil. Fill bowl of dumpling(spaetzle)maker and slide over pot of boiling water. If you don't have a dumpling maker, use a colander and let the batter run out the bottom, or drop off a teaspoon. Stir while boiling to keep dumplings separated. Boil about 5 minutes until dumplings float. Remove with a slotted spoon to a colander and rinse with cold water. Repeat if you have more dough. Put dumplings in ovenproof pan or dish, add cut up pieces of butter and put in 325F oven to stay warm. Serve with Chicken Paprikas and gravy. These are also good with other meals.
