Ingredients:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
All purpose flour
1 (17.3 ounce) package Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets, thawed
9 full-size milk chocolate peanut butter cup candies

Directions:
Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.
Sprinkle the flour on the work surface. Unfold 1 pastry sheet on the work surface. Roll the pastry sheet into an 11-inch square. Cut into9 (3 1/2-inch) circles. Repeat with the remaining pastry sheet. Reserve the pastry scraps to decorate the tops of the pastries, if desired.
Brush 9 pastry circles with the egg mixture. Top each with 1 candy. Place the remaining pastry circles over the candies and press the edges to seal. Crimp the edges with a fork. Decorate the tops of the pastries with the reserved pastry scraps, if desired. Brush the pastries with the egg mixture. Place the pastries onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 20 minutes.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown. Remove the pastries from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes.
