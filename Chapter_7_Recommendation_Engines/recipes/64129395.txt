Ingredients:
5-6 large yams
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 stick butter, melted (not margarine)
1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon allspice
1/8 teaspoon cloves
2 teaspoons honey
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake yams for about an hour or until soft. When yams are cool enough to handle, peel them and put them in a mixing bowl. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.
Add in all the rest of the ingredients to the yams, beat with a mixer on slow speed to break up large lumps, then beat on medium to high speed until all ingredients are incorporated.
Pour filling into two pie shells, and cover the edges of the pies with strips of folded aluminum to prevent burning the crust. Bake pies for 45 minutes, removing the aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes of baking.
