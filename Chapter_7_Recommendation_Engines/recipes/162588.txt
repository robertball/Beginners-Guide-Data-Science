Ingredients:
1 pound boneless beef sirloin steak
1/2 cup KRAFT Classic Caesar Dressing
1/4 cup A.1. Original Steak Sauce
1 (10 ounce) bag torn romaine lettuce
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 medium cucumber, peeled, sliced
1/2 cup DI GIORNO Shaved Parmesan Cheese

Directions:
Place steak in nonmetal dish or resealable plastic bag; set aside. Beat dressing and steak sauce with wire whisk until well blended. Pour 1/2 cup of the steak sauce mixture over steak; toss to coat. Cover. Refrigerate 30 min. to marinate, turning occasionally. Reserve remaining steak sauce mixture for later use.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade. Grill steak 6 min. on each side or until medium doneness (160 degrees F).
Heat reserved dressing mixture just until warmed. Meanwhile, cover large serving platter with the lettuce; top with the tomatoes and cucumbers. Cut steak into thin slices; arrange over salad. Drizzle with the warm dressing mixture just before serving; sprinkle with the cheese.
