Ingredients:
2 lbs. chuck roast
3 cups dry white wine
1 1/2 cups beef stock
2 sprigs parsley
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper
2 cups celery cut into 1" lengths
3 cups carrots cut into 1" lengths
6 - 8 small red potatoes, whole
1 - 1.5 small white onions chopped roughly
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Place dutch oven on stove on medium-high heat.  Add oil and heat.  Place roast in the dutch oven and sear both sides until well-browned (about 15 minutes).
Add white wine and boil until reduced 1/2 to 3/4.
Add beef stock.  Sprinkle roast with salt, pepper, and thyme.  Place bay leaf on top.
Cover and place back in oven at 325 degrees for 3 hours.  After 2 hours, begin basting the roast about every 15 minutes.  Remove bay leaf to bottom of dutch oven with juices.  Mix.
About 2 hours into cooking, place celery and carrots in large saute pan with butter and lightly brown (about 10 to 15 minutes).  When browned, spread around roast.
About 30 minutes before end of cooking, slice potatoes in halves, then place around the roast.  Add fresh-chopped parsley to top of roast.  Baste the roast again and cover.
At the 3 hour mark, check the temp. of the roast with meat thermometer.  It should be about 145 degrees for medium-rare.  Do not let it get above 150 degrees.
At 145 degrees, remove roast from dutch oven and place on cutting board, let rest for 5 minutes.
Remove vegetables and place in serving bowl or casserole dish.  Pour stock into juice bowl or gravy bowl for serving.
Slice roast into lengths about 1/4 inch thick.  Serve.

Description: 
This came from my grandmother's recipe box.  While she may not have been a Cordon Bleu chef, she sure could cook!  The flavor infused roast, perfectly cooked vegetables, seasoning, right down to the basting juices made a great Sunday meal.  Unbuckle that belt, because this meal is worthy of seconds!
