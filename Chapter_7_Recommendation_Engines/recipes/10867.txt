Description: 
This is a special cookie. I decided to whip up a batch in variation and the winner was with the added ingredient of 1 cup of raisins. As of today, I see daily as I walk into my kitchen a decorated jar with 3 of my winning cookies along with my Red Ribbon attached displayed since the year of 1991. You may use , raisins, chocolate chips, M & M candies or coconut instead of the walnuts if you wish.
