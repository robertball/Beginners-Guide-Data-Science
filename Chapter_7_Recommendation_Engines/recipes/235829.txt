Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon applesauce, or as needed
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
2 drops vanilla extract, or to taste
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a microwave-safe mug until softened, about 10 seconds. Stir white sugar into butter until dissolved. Mix 1/4 cup flour, applesauce, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt into butter-sugar mixture until batter is smooth.
Mix 2 teaspoons flour, 1 teaspoon butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl using your hands until the texture of lumpy sand is reached; sprinkle over batter.
Cook in the microwave until coffeecake appears to be barely set, 50 to 80 seconds. Cool before eating.
