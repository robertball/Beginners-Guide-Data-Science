Ingredients:
1/2 lg onion, very finely sliced
8oz baby portabella mushrooms
8oz white button mushrooms
oliv eoil
dried savory
dried thyme
salt
garlic mill

Directions:
Remove the stems of the mushrooms.  Then, slice them about 1/8"-1/4" thick.
Place the onions in a medium frying pan and add enough olive oil to coat the onions and pan but not enough to leave excess.
Place the onions on medium heat.  When they start to become transparent, add the mushrooms and some more oil.  Do not cover.
Add savory, thyme, and garlic to taste.  Leave on heat until the mushrooms have darkened and thoroughly cooked.  Continue to leave on the heat until most of the excess liquid evaporates.  Then remove from heat and serve.

Description: 
My father loves mushrooms with onions and butter.  I made this healthier version for him, and he loved it: the spices added more than enough flavor to make up for the lack of butter!
