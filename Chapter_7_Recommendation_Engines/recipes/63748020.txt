Ingredients:
4 medium zucchini
1 pound ground beef
1 pound turkey
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 cup dried bread crumbs
1 egg, beaten
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed tomato soup
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees (175 degrees C). Grease or spray a 13x9 inch baking dish.
Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise. With a spoon, scoop out the seeds. Chop and reserve about 3/4 of the seeds for the stuffing. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, sausage, chopped onion, bread crumbs, egg and the reserved zucchini seeds. Place the meat mixture equally into all of the zucchini halves; mixture should be piled up over the top. Place the filled zucchini halves into the prepared baking dish.
In a bowl, stir together the crushed tomatoes, tomato soup, and water. Spoon the tomato mixture over the filled zucchini, liberally. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 45 minutes. You may want to place foil or a cookie sheet underneath the baking dish because it tends to bubble over and splash.
