Ingredients:
2 pounds clean, scrubbed new red potatoes, cubed
1/2 cup Italian salad dressing
6 eggs
1 pound bacon (optional)
1/4 cup finely chopped green onions
1 cup chopped celery
1 1/ 2 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup fresh parsley
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp sugar

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add cubed potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain thoroughly.  Place in a bowl & cool slightly.  Pour salad dressing over warm potatoes: toss to coat and set in the refrigerator to cool for about an hour.
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.
If using bacon, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside.
Add eggs, radishes, green onions and celery to potatoes and toss gently.
Combine mayo, sour cream, mustard, salt (don't add salt if using bacon) pepper & sugar;  pour over potato mixture and toss gently to coat.  Cover & chill for at least an hour or preferably over night.   If using bacon, add to potato salad right before serving & toss gently.
