Ingredients:
2 eggs plus water to equal 1 1/2 c
1 t lemon juice
1/4 c fresh celery leaves, minced (optional)
1/2 t salt
1/2 t celery salt
2 1/2 T butter - no substitutions
1 T sugar
1 1/2 T dried parsley flakes
2 t poultry seasoning
1/2 t ground black pepper
1/2 t ground sage - scant
3 1/4 c all-purpose flour
2 T dry milk
1/3 c dried potato flakes
1/3 c dried onion flakes
1 packet regular yeast

Directions:
Grease one 9" x 5" bread pan.
Add ingredients to bread machine in order given. Run on Dough cycle. When cycle is completely finished, reset to Dough and allow to run through the initial kneading cycle (until the machine reaches its first long pause).
Set oven to 200F and allow to heat for 2 minutes ONLY.
While oven is heating, quickly remove dough from machine and place on floured board or counter. Knead, incorporating extra flour if necessary, until dough is silky-smooth and elastic (2-3 minutes). Be careful not to dry out with too much flour.
Form into a rough loaf and place in greased pan. Set pan in warm oven and cover loosely with a clean dishtowel. Let set for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until bread has doubled in size.
Remove bread and keep covered.
Heat oven to 375F.
Bake 35-42 minutes, or until bread has a nice, hollow sound and feel when thumped. Cool in pan 10-15 minutes. Turn out and finish cooling on wire rack.
