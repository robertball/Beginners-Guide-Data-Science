Ingredients:
9 eggs
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons wasabi paste
2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
4 tablespoons panko bread crumbs

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.
Place sesame seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove to cool on a plate lined with a paper towel.
Cut each egg in half lengthwise; place egg yolks into a food processor with mayonnaise, soy sauce, wasabi paste, and rice vinegar. Process until smooth; place green onion and panko bread crumbs into yolk mixture and pulse just enough to mix evenly.
Arrange egg white halves on a serving platter; spoon yolk mixture into whites. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
