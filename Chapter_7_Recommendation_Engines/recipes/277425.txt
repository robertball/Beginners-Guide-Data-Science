Description: 
This recipe came from the Burrows side of our family and nothing gives you better satisfaction than knowing you made your own breakfast rounds.  It's quick and easy, the mixture can be made in advance, and the cooked patties can be thrown in the freezer and then microwaved for a quick minute. This recipe easily doubles.
