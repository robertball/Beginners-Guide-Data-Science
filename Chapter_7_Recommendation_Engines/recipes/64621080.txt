Description: 
Recipe from the Gastroparesis-Friendly Kitchen. Unlike the original Green Monster smoothie, this one doesn’t require a juicer. It still provides a good amount of vitamins and phytonutrients, though. The Greek yogurt is optional but will add about 6 grams of protein. The fish oil, which you can’t taste at all, adds 4.5 grams of healthy Omega-3 fat. This recipe yields about 2 cups, so you may want to freeze half for
another day.
