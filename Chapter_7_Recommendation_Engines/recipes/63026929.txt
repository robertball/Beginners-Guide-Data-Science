Ingredients:
2 cups whole milk
Â½ cup Nutella
2 cups half-and-half
Gourmet marshmallows, toasted if desired
10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped (Valrhona recommended)

Directions:
Combine the milk and half-and-half in a saucepan and bring to a low boil. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate and Nutella. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Cover to keep hot.
If using marshmallows (and you should!), toast them, one at a time over a gas flame, turning until all sides are golden brown.
Pour the hot chocolate into small espresso cups, top with the marshmallows, and serve hot.
