Ingredients:
1 pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries, coarsely chopped
2 medium tart apples, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the pastry into a 13-in. circle. Press onto the bottom and up the sides of an ungreased 11-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom; trim pastry even with edge.
In a bowl, combine the cranberries, apples, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon. Pour into crust. Dot with butter. Roll out remaining pastry to 1/4-in. thickness. Cut out with a floured 1-in. apple cookie cutter. Place over filling.
Place tart pan on a warm baking sheet. Bake at 425 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until filling is hot and bubbly and crust is golden. Serve warm.
