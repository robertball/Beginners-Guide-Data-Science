Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped, or more to taste
1 green chile pepper, seeded and chopped (optional)
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 bay leaves, or more to taste
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon garam masala
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 pinch salt to taste
water as needed
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas
1 teaspoon fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish, or more to taste

Directions:
Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, powder, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
Indian food is not just curried sauces. It's not too exotic either. Unless 'exotic' is code for 'yummy and full of flavor.' This dish features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices. Both carnivores and vegetarians will enjoy this meal. My kids love it. Leave out the green chile if the kiddies will be eating. Serve over basmati or jasmine rice and enjoy. Namaste y'all!
