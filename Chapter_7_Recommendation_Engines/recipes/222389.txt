Description: 
Yes, the color in this salt will fade within a few weeks, but the herby flavor and aroma will remain intact for much longer. 
I described this as a finishing salt, meaning it's used to season cooked food at the table; however, it can also be used in place of regular salt in any recipe preparation.
