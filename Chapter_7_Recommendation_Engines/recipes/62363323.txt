Ingredients:
2 cups canola oil
3/4-1 cup fresh lemon juice
1 bunch scallion
5-6 celery ribs
1 cucumber
1 bunch fresh Italian parsley
1 cup fresh dill
1 teaspoon salt
1-1 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

Directions:
Rough-chop the scallions, cucumber and celery (neatness doesn't add points; it's all going into a blender). Chop the parsley and dill.
Combine the oil and lemon juice in a blender, emulsify it.
Feed in the vegetables and herbs. Then the seasonings.
Blend throughly.

Description: 
A wonderful Russian lemony-herby sauce served over hot boiled potatoes and served with grilled or sauteed smoked sausage. I got it from the woman in charge of the Piroshky wagon at the annual Seattle Folk Life Festival three years ago. Predominant flavors are lemon and dill.
