Ingredients:
1/2 cup raw quinoa, rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, minced
1/2 medium green bell pepper, finely diced
1 16 ounce can pinto or red beans, drained & mashed
1 cup tomato sauce
1 meium tomato, finely diced
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari
1 teaspoon agave nectar or natural sugar
1 teaspoon chili powder, or more, to taste
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
shredded lettuce or baby spinach leaves
6 whole grain rolls, english muffins, or mini-pitas

Directions:
Combine the quinoa with 1 cup water in a small saucepan.  Bring to a slow boil, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet.  Add the onion and saute until translucent.  Add the bell pepper and saute until both are golden.
Add the remaining ingredients except the garnish and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cook over medium-low heat, loosely covered, for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Let the skillet stand off the heat for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to mingle further and the quinoa to absorb tomato flavor.
For each serving, spoon some of the filling onto the bottoms of whole grain rolls and garnish.
