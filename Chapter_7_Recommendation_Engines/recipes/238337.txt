Ingredients:
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup quinoa
4 leaves kale, chopped, or more to taste
1/2 avocado - peeled, pitted, and cut into cubes
1/2 tomato, cut into cubes
1/4 cucumber, peeled and cut into cubes
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 tablespoons Italian-style salad dressing

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain water and run quinoa under cold water to cool.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add kale, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Place chopped kale in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled, 3 to 5 minutes.
Mix avocado, tomato, and cucumber together in a bowl; add quinoa and kale. Sprinkle feta cheese over quinoa mixture; add Italian dressing and stir.

Description: 
This recipe was born of my desire to incorporate quinoa into my diet. I absolutely love the taste of it. This yields a large salad and could be halved if necessary.
