Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all purpose flour,  1 1/2 cups sugar,  1 tsp baking soda,  1 tsp salt,  1 tsp cocoa powder (unsweetened),  1 1/2 cups vegetable oil, 1 cup buttermilk at room temperature,  2 eggs at room temperature, 1 tsp distilled white vinegar,  1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract,  2+ tbs liquid red food coloring (my bottle was just slightly more than 2 tbs, so I dumped the whole thing in).

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  In a large mixing bowl, sift together all the powder ingredients, and mix well until consistent color.  In separate bowl, add all liquid ingredients, and eggs and mix on low with hand mixer until smooth.  Add to powder bowl and continue mixing with hand mixer for several minutes until smooth.  The deeper the bowl, the better, as red splattered batter all over the newly painted walls is not a good look for your kitchen.
Place cupcake liners in pan and carefully fill with batter to 3/4 full.  bake for 20-23 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees at the half way point.  Test with toothpick, and remove to cooling rack.  This recipe made 20 cupcakes as in my photo.

Description: 
After reading countless reviews claiming that the recipes didn't produce red cupcakes, I kicked my research into high gear and found this version.  They are red as red can be, and very tasty.  No overbearing cocoa flavor as some complained about.  If you are messy like me, wear latex gloves in the mixing stage...  (enough said)
