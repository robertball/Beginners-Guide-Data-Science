Ingredients:
Samosa Quesadillas:
1/2 (10 ounce) package frozen peas
5 red potatoes, scrubbed and cubed
1/4 cup soy milk, or more as needed
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 tablespoon vegan margarine
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
Curried Cabbage and Chickpeas:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small head cabbage, outer leaves discarded - quartered, cored, and thinly sliced
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 teaspoons dehydrated onion flakes
2 teaspoons curry powder, or more to taste
1 teaspoon bottled minced ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon garam masala
1/8 teaspoon ground coriander

Directions:
Place peas in a small saucepan and pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and cook until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain.
Place cubed potatoes in a large pot and pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes; return to the pot. Cook over medium-high heat until dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mash potatoes with a potato masher or whisk until mostly smooth. Mix in soy milk, green onion, 2 tablespoons curry powder, vegan margarine, 2 teaspoons turmeric, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/8 teaspoon coriander, and black pepper. Stir in cilantro. Gently fold peas into filling mixture.
Place 1 tortilla on a flat work surface; spoon potato filling over one half. Fold over into a half-moon shape. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.
Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Toast quesadillas one at a time until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Heat a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and turn the skillet to coat. Add cabbage, chickpeas, and onion flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage starts to wilt, about 4 minutes.
Stir 2 teaspoons curry powder, ginger, 1 teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, garam masala, and 1/8 teaspoon coriander into the cabbage mixture. Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Serve alongside quesadillas.

Description: 
This may sound like a lot of ingredients, but I usually have these spices on hand. The main ingredients make this a cheap dish. Who wants to make samosas by hand when you can make these? Serve hot or warm with your favorite chutney, if you like.
