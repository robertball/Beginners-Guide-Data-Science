Description: 
I love the outdoors and I would rather spend the majority of my time hunting and fishing than doing school work.  I searched all over the internet trying to find a recipe for pheasant that would be easy enough to make in my dorm room.  My personal kitchen consists of a mini fridge and a shared sink.  This one is for you pheasant loving college guys.
