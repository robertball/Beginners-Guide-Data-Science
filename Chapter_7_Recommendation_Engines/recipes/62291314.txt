Ingredients:
1 cup cooked pasta (I used thin spaghetti)
1 to 2 tbsp butter
1 cup broccoli, steamed
2 slices pepperjack cheese (I used weight watchers brand
Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook pasta according to package; when pasta is nearly done (1 to 2 minutes to go) submerge a small head of broccoli into the boiling water. Remove when bright green.  Drain pasta.
Add butter to pasta, and stir.
Chop broccoli into bite sized pieces.
Place pasta in microwave safe bowl/serving dish.  Add broccoli and cover with sliced cheese.  Cover to let cheese melt or pop in the microwave for ten seconds.
Sprinkle with parmesan cheese before serving.

Quickie dinner I made that was so good I'm going to use it as inspiration!  This isn't a real recipe yet, but I'm thinking of using it as a base for baked pasta.  The following is for one quick serving.
