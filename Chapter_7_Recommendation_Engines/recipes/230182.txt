Arrange sliced corned beef and Swiss cheese on bottom half of each roll and cover with top portion of roll. Wrap each sandwich in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake rolls 8 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and sandwich is warm. While sandwiches are baking, combine cabbage and dressing together in a small bowl.
Remove sandwiches from aluminum foil, gently open sandwich and spoon some cabbage salad atop meat. Gently press sandwiches back together again. Serve with extra dressing if desired.
