Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix
1 pkg chocolate jello instant pudding
FILLING:  (different from original recipe, which I haven't tried)
1 cup solid shortening (try butter flavored)
2 cups Marshmallow Fluff
1.5 cups powdered sugar
1.5 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
CAKES: Prepare mix as directed on package except using only 3/4 cup of water. Drop batter onto greased cookie sheet (or use parchment paper to line pan) with a cookie scooper (they don't spread out that much) . Bake until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 14 min. Let cool.
FILLING:  In a medium bowl, beat sugar and shortening until fluffy. Add vanilla.
Turn the little cakes over on their backs. Spoon a dollop of filling onto half of the little cakes. Place the other half of the cakes on top of the filling to form sandwiches.  Can dust top with powered sugar.
