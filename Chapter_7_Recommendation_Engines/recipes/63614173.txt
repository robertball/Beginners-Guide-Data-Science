Ingredients:
1 12 oz pkg al fresco Sundried Tomato Chicken Sausage, sliced 1/4" thick
12 oz Dried orecchiette pasta
1 tbsp Canola Oil
1 (8 oz) Onion
2 Large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1/4 teaspoon Hot chili flakes
1 lb Firm-ripe tomatoes, rinsed, cored and chopped
8 oz (about 3 packed cups) Baby spinach leaves, rinsed
2 oz Crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
In 5 to 6 quart pan over high heat, bring 4 quarts water to a boil.
Add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain.
Meanwhile, in a 12 inch frying pan or a 4 to 5 quart pan over medium-high heat, add canola oil
Add onion and stir often until lightly browned around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes
Lower heat to medium and add garlic, chili flakes and chicken sausages
Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up sausage if necessary, until meat is beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes; if garlic begins to scorch lower heat.
Add tomatoes and spinach; stir until spinach is wilted, about 2 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix pasta and sauce to coat; top with feta cheese
