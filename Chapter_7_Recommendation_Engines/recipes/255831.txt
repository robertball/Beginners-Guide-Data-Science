Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup long-grain rice
1 tablespoon minced onion
1 tablespoon minced tomato
2 cups water
2 tablespoons chopped carrot
1 tablespoon chopped celery
2 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add rice, onion, and tomato; cook and stir until rice turns light golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
Stir water, carrot, celery, and chicken bouillon into the skillet. Simmer until most of the water is absorbed, about 8 minutes. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, 5 to 8 minutes more.
