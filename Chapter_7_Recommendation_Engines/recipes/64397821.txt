Ingredients:
2 tsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced in strips
Juice of 1 lemon
1 lemon sliced thinly
¾ cup chicken broth
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
1 small onion, chopped
2 Tbl capers with the juice
1 14 oz can quartered artichoke hearts, drained
1 Tsp Salt and pepper
1 Cup Quinoa
2 Cups Spinach

Directions:
Quinoa: Cook per package directions
Heat olive oil in a skillet pan and sauté the onions and mushrooms. Remove and set aside.
Add a little more olive oil and brown the chicken strips on both sides.  Remove and set chicken aside.
Add lemon juice to the pan to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits.  Add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Add the lemon slices to the pan and reduce to medium heat.
Place chicken breasts on top of the lemon slices. Put onion/mushroom mixture on top of the chicken. Add the capers and cook covered for 10 minutes.
Add the drained artichoke hearts. Cover and cook for 5 more minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
Adjust the sauce with salt, if too acidic for your taste. Serve with Quinoa and spinach salad.
