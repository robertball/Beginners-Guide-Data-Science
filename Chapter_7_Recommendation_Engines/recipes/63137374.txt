Ingredients:
2 tbs butter
2 tbs all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper
1 1/4 cup milk
2/3 cup cheese; shredded (pick your favorites)
4 medium potatoes; (yukon gold is my favorite)

Directions:
Wash potatoes and leave skin on. Place in a microwave and oven safe casserole dish. Cook in microwave on high for 3 minutes. Let cool.
Preheat oven to 350F. For sauce, heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Melt butter, stir in flour, salt and pepper. Add milk and stir until the sauce has thickened and is bubbling. Stir in cheese until melted. Remove from heat.
Slice the potatoes. Place a single layer back into casserole dish and cover with sauce. Repeat until finished and top with remaining sauce. Sprinkle with a little more of your mixed cheese.
Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Let stand to cool about 5 - 10 minutes before serving.
