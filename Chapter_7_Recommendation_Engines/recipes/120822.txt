Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons sugar
1 (.25 ounce) package quick-rise yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 cup water
4 tablespoons canola oil, divided
1/2 medium green bell pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour, sugar, yeast and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a saucepan, heat water and 2 tablespoons oil to 120 degrees F-130 degrees F. Add to dry ingredients; beat on low speed just until moistened. Beat on medium until batter is elastic and pulls away from sides of bowl. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (do not knead). Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
Divide dough in half. Press each portion into a 12-in. pizza pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Brush with remaining oil; top with peppers and cheese. Sprinkle with pepper flakes if desired, basil, oregano, garlic powder, pepper and remaining salt. Let rest for 10 minutes. Bake at 425 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.

Description: 
A busy college student, Sarah McClanahan of Raleigh, North Carolina makes this lightened-up version of flat Italian bread often because it's so easy to prepare. 'Focaccia goes great with soup or pasta,' she says. 'And by adding tomatoes and onions, I can turn it into a light supper.'
