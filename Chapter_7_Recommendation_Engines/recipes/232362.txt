3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
2 1/4 cups white sugar
1 1/8 cups vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/4 cup orange juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a large loaf pan.
