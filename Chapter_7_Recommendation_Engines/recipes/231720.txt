Ingredients:
6 large potatoes, cubed
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1 yellow onion, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, minced
2 quarts half-and-half
5 (6 ounce) cans clams in clam juice, undrained
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell's®)
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and add potatoes, mushrooms, onion, and green pepper. Reduce heat to low; cook vegetables at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Drain. Place boiled vegetables back into the pot and raise heat to medium.
Stir half-and-half, clams with their juice, cream of mushroom soup, butter, and parsley into vegetables; bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thickened, about 30 minutes; stir often. Season with salt, black pepper, and seafood seasoning.
