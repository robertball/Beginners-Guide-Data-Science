Ingredients:
2 cups matzo meal
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup canola oil
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
3 cups onion, chopped
2 bunches green onions, chopped
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped celery
4 extra large eggs
1 1/2 cups chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir together the matzo meal, sugar, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning in a large mixing bowl; set aside.
Bring 2 cups of chicken broth to a boil in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup of canola oil. Stir into the matzo mixture until evenly moistened, then set aside to cool. Heat the remaining canola oil and the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chopped onion and green onion, and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 7 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and celery, and cook until the celery begins to soften, about 10 minutes more.
Whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock with the eggs, and stir into the cooled matzo mixture. Fold in the cooked vegetables until evenly mixed, then pour the mixture back into the cast-iron skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes until browned. Stir once during this time to ensure even cooking.

Description: 
Southern dressing for Pesach made with matzo meal.  Recipe can be tweaked to suit your taste.  My family likes browned dressing with lots of pepper, but you can cook for less time at a lower temp to get dressing that is more moist with no 'crunch'. Also use any combination of mushrooms; you can also add more if you really like mushrooms.
