Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons paprika
2 eggs
1 teaspoon minced parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup dry bread crumbs
3 tablespoons oil
4 slices  lemon

Directions:
Place each veal cutlet between two pieces of plastic wrap, and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. Dip in flour, paprika and salt to coat.
In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, parsley,  and pepper. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture, then press in the bread crumbs to coat. Place coated cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. (or don't if you're in a rush)
Oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded cutlets until browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a serving platter, and pour the pan juices over them. Garnish with lemon slices.

Description: 
This easy German recipe is one of our favorites. Can even use other meats - I've used thin turkey breasts and thin beef cutlets.Modified from: Wienerschnitzel
