Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Mayonnaise
2 Tablespoons Grey Poupon type mustard
2 Tablespoons Honey
Freshly ground pepper (to taste)
Salt (to taste)
2 chopped green onions
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts

Directions:
Combine all ingredients except chicken in a medium bowl.
After mixing, set aside 1/3 of the mixture in a separate bowl.
Lay the chicken in a shallow baking dish or a large zip lock bag and pour the honey mustard mixture over top. Let set for at least 20 minuets to marinate.
After marinating, place the chicken on the grill (can use foreman grill also).  While grilling, baste with remaining honey mustard mixture as needed. Cook until juices run clear and the honey mustard has started to glaze.
