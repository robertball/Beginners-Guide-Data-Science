Ingredients:
1 tablespoon garlic-flavored olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoons butter
16 sea scallops, dried well
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste
1/3 cup dry vermouth
2 tablespoons capers, drained
1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; melt butter in the hot oil. Arrange scallops in the skillet, leaving space between each, and season with onion powder, sea salt, and black pepper. Cook scallops until lightly browned, about 4 minutes per side.
Turn heat up to high and add vermouth, capers, and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Shake the pan to flip scallops and distribute capers and red pepper flakes. Cook until scallops are golden brown, glazed, and the vermouth has nearly evaporated, 5 to 8 minutes.

Description: 
Large, creamy white sea scallops are cooked at high heat with vermouth and capers. Delicious alone or over pasta! The degree of spiciness can be adjusted with the pepper flakes. Recipe 'as is' is pretty hot!
