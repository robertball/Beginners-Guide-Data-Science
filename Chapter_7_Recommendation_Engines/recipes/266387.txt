Ingredients:
1 cup heavy whipping cream
11 ounces chocolate wafer cookies (such as Nabisco® Famous Chocolate Wafers)
1/2 cup brandy

Directions:
Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl using an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Dip a wafer cookie quickly into the brandy and place on a serving plate. Repeat and lay soaked cookies next to each other to create a cake-sized base layer.
Top the cookie layer with a layer of whipped cream. Alternate layering cookies and cream until all the cookies are used. Cover the top and sides with remaining cream and smooth the top.
Refrigerate for a few hours or, better, 8 hours to overnight. The cookies will soften and the cream firms up, making the cake easy to slice.

Description: 
Ripple cake is a popular Australian dessert, the equivalent of an American icebox cake. In Australia, chocolate ripple biscuits are used, hence the name. In the US, you need to substitute Nabisco® chocolate wafers. No baking required, and it includes a generous serving of brandy.
