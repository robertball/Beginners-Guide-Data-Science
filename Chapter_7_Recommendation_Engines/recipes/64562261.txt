Ingredients:
3 cups of milk chocolate morsels
14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup salted butter (unsalted butter will work, just add 1 TBS salt)
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup sweetened coconut flakes

Directions:
Combine condensed milk, chocolate morsels, and butter in a double boiler and heat on medium until chocolate is melted, stirring constantly.
When the chocolate has melted, turn off your burner and mix in the almonds and coconut.
Pour the fudge into a 9x9 pan and smoothe evenly. Pat down the fudge for aesthetic purposes.
Sprinkle a pinch of almond and coconut over fudge (optional)
Put the pan in your refrigerator and leave to set for an hour or until firm.
Cut into squares and enjoy!
