Ingredients:
1 quart cold milk
2 (3.4 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix
6 leftover cake donuts, or more to taste
2 bananas, sliced
1 cup sliced fresh strawberries
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Whisk cold milk and vanilla pudding mix together in a large bowl until completely smooth, about 2 minutes. Let stand until pudding thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.
Break up donuts into smaller pieces; spread half in the bottom of a trifle bowl. Layer half of the pudding, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and whipped topping over donuts. Repeat layers. Garnish with whipped topping and a few pieces of fruit. Chill until serving.

Description: 
I created this when I had donuts starting to go stale and knew no one would eat them. But, they did devour this dessert. Use the fresh fruit of your choice.
