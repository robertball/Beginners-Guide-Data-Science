Description: 
A light, but very flavorful quesadilla. California style sweet and savory with dried cranberries and avocado. Serve this with a spinach salad or baby greens for a healthy lunch or dinner. You could turn this into a wrap by not pan frying them and pack for lunches on the go, enjoy it warm or cold. This is also great with leftover turkey as well! Enjoy!
