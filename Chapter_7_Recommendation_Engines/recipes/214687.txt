Ingredients:
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 stalks celery, with leaves, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 small sweet onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic
1/2 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
2 cups water
2 cups red wine
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Stir the diced tomatoes, celery, carrots, sweet onion, garlic, tomato paste, water, red wine, sage, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook the sauce at a simmer until the carrots are tender, about 1 hour.
Pour the sauce into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway. Hold the lid of the blender in place with a towel and carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean container. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the sauce in the pot.
