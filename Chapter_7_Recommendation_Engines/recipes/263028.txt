Ingredients:
1 pound pork belly, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
For Marinade:
2 teaspoons Chinese cooking wine
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
For Pork and Shrimp Stew:
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 tablespoon fried shallots (optional)
3 cups water
1 tablespoon light soy sauce, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1/4 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons frozen peas
For Garlic Fried Rice:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 cups cooked jasmine rice, cooled, or more to taste
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
3 drops sesame oil, or to taste

Directions:
Mix pork belly with cooking wine, oyster sauce, cornstarch, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 20 minutes.
Heat vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and shallots; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the pork pieces; fry until browned, about 6 minutes. Pour in water, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Cover with a lid and bring stew to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until pork becomes tender and water is reduced by half, about 30 minutes.
Cut shrimp into 3/4-inch pieces. Mix cornstarch and water together in a bowl.
Bring stew to a boil. Add the shrimp and peas; cook until shrimp changes color, about 2 minutes. Quickly stir in the cornstarch mixture. Cook and stir until gravy is thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high. Add rice; cook, breaking up the rice with a spatula, until loosened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add oyster sauce and soy sauce. Cook and stir until rice is fluffy and heated through, about 3 minutes. Add remaining sesame oil.
Divide fried rice between 3 or 4 bowls. Portion the pork and shrimp stew equally over the rice.

Description: 
One of my childhood favorites from my hometown, Cebu City, in the Phillipines. When finished, you can steam this dish on a steamer for 10 minutes to mimic the effect of a steamed dish like what they do in dim sum restaurants. I personally think it tastes just fine without steaming.
