Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix
1 cup orange juice
1/2 cup sour cream
2 cups sliced fresh strawberries
2 bananas, sliced
1 cup fresh blueberries
1 cup whipped cream

Directions:
To make the crepes, whisk together the milk, flour, eggs, oil, almond extract, and sugar in a bowl until you have a smooth batter. Lightly grease a small skillet and place over medium heat. Spoon in 2 tablespoons of batter and gently tilt the skillet to spread the batter to the edges of the pan. Cook until brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the crepe and cook the other side until brown.  Remove to a plate.  Repeat with remaining batter until it is all used.
To make the filling, whisk together the pudding mix, orange juice, and sour cream in a bowl. Gently fold the strawberries, bananas and blueberries into the sour cream mixture.
Lightly grease the bottom of a baking dish. Cover the bottom of the dish with 1/3 of the crepes. Spoon 1/2 of the fruit mixture over the crepes. Repeat with remaining fruit and crepes, finishing with the crepes as the top layer. Garnish with whipped cream. Allow to sit 30 minutes before serving.
