Ingredients:
4 large Poblano peppers
1/2 cup EACH Mozzarella, Jack & med. Cheddar cheese shredded
flour for dredging
5 egg whites, room temperature
1 egg yolk
1/3 c. flour
1/2 tsp. salt
oil for frying
Sauce:
1/2 onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 14.5oz. can mexican style stewed tomatoes
1 Tbsp oil
1 1/2 C. chicken broth
2 Tbsp vinegar
1/8 tsp. cinnamon
1 tsp. mexican oregano, crushed
1/2 tsp. cumino
1/2 tsp. Cholula hot sauce
1/2 tsp. black pepper

Directions:
Place oven rack directly under broiler & preheat to a high broil.  Place washed & dried peppers under broiler for 8-10 min. per side. Watch carefully & turn often to consitently blister/charr skin.  When peppers are 80% blackened, place back into plastic produce bag, wrap up & let steam for 15 min. to loosen skin.  When cool, peel charred skin from peppers.  Cut one slit lengthwise into each pepper and carefully remove seeds & veins.  To reduce spiciness, lightly rinse any remaining seeds out with water.  Pat dry.
Mix all shredded cheeses together & make 4 piles relative to the size of each pepper.  Squeeze & form cheese piles into 4, cone shaped bullets.  Gently place cheese into each pepper, fold pepper closed & secure carefully with 3 toothpicks.  Dredge peppers lightly with flour & freeze.
Sauce:
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in med. sauce pot.  Add onions & saute 5 min. then add garlic for 30 seconds, stirring often.  Puree tomatoes and pour into onions along with vinegar, broth, spices & hot sauce.  Reduce to med/low & simmer for 20 min. or until reduced by half & thickened.
Batter:
Preheat oven to 450*  Heat 1/2" of oil in cast iron skillet over high-med/high heat.  Mix flour & salt together.  In med. bowl with electric mixer, whip room temperature egg whites until stiff, fold in beaten egg yolk & then flour.  Dredge frozen peppers in plain flour again and then dip into batter, using spoon to help spread on an even coating.  Gently lay peppers directly into hot oil & fry 10 min. turning to brown each side.  Keep cooked peppers in hot oven for up to 5 or 10 min. while plating sides.  Ladle sauce onto plate, place Relleno on sauce & garnish with sour cream.  Serve immediately.
