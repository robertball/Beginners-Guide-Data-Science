Ingredients:
1Tbsp Soy Sauce
1 Thawed Chicken Breast (1/3 Lb)
1/4 Cup Finely Chopped Red Onions
1/4 Cup Finely Chopped Carrots
1/2 Cup Finely Chopped Red Cabbage
1 Tsp Minced Garlic
1/4 Cup Light Mayo
2 Tbsp Soy Sauce
1 Tbsp Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste
3 Tbsp Curry Powder
1 Tsp Red Chili powder (optional)
1/2 Package of Nasoya Egg Roll Wraps
1/4 Olive oil

Directions:
Preheat Oven to 400 degrees
Finely chop the chicken breast
Cook the chicken breast in a large saucepan in about a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of soy sauce
After the chicken is cooked, add the carrots, onions, and cabbage
While the chicken mixture is cooking, mix 2 Tbsp of soy sauce, the mayo, garlic, red curry paste, curry powder, and red chili pepper in a small bowl until it makes a paste.
Lightly brush a cooking sheet with the olive oil
Place about 1/4 cup of chicken mixture on an egg roll wrap diagonally. Fold the bottom half over the chicken mixture. Then fold both sides over and roll from the bottom to top to create a roll. (Like a burrito)
Repeat until all the chicken mixture and wraps have been used.
Lightly brush the tops and sides of the rolls with olive oil
Bake at 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes or until brown
