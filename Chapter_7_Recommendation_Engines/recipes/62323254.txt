Ingredients:
Cooked leftover chicken
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust
1/2 cup Ranch-style salad dressing
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/2 sliced red onion
Chopped bacon (pre cooked from grocery is ideal)
1 small can chopped pineapple

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan or medium baking sheet.
Chop chicken into bite size pieces. Saute sliced onions in a small amount of vegetable oil until slightly browned.
Unroll dough, and press into the prepared pizza pan or baking sheet. Bake crust for 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until it begins to turn golden brown. Remove from oven.
Spread ranch dressing over partially baked crust. Sprinkle on mozzarella cheese. Place mushrooms, onion, bacon, pineapple and chicken on top of mozzarella cheese, then top with Cheddar cheese. Return to the oven for 14 to 18 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly.
