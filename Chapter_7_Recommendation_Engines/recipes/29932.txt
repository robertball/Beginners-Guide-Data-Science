Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 (12 ounce) container small curd cottage cheese
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/2 cup chopped onion
2 sheets frozen phyllo pastry, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
In a large bowl, mix spinach, cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, egg, and onion. Spread half the mixture over each phyllo pastry sheet. Roll pastry sheets jelly-roll fashion, pinch ends to seal, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
Make a few small slits in the top of each rolled pastry sheet. Bake 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.

My most requested dish when people come over. Even my teenagers will eat this. It's not your typical phyllo pie.
