Ingredients:
9 x 9 pan of cornbread, a few days old and crumbled
1/2 loaf of Toasted Onion bread crumbs (see breadcrumb recipe)
1/2 loaf of Wheat bread crumbs (see breadcrumb recipe)
1 can vegetable broth
4 cans chicken broth
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 can cream of celery soup
1 cup chopped yellow onion
1 cup chopped celery
1 stick butter
sage
poultry seasoning
black pepper
2 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Prepare cornbread and breadcrumbs a few days before.  Crumble and add to a large mixing bowl.
Saute onions and celery in butter until tender.  Add to crumb mixture.
Add broth and soups to crumb and vegetable mixture until moist and a little soupy.
Stir in seasonings 1tsp at a time to taste.  I think I used 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp sage, 3 tsp poultry seasoning.
After it is seasoned to your liking, add the eggs.
Pour into a buttered 9x13 pan.
Bake for 45 min, or until set.  Bake for an additional 20 min at 400 if you like a brown crusty top.
