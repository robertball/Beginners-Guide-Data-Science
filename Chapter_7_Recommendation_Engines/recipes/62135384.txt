Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage
1 cup chopped onion
2 cups chopped celery
2 cups chopped mushrooms
1 15 oz can chopped Black olives pitted
3/4 cup Butter or margarine, melted
1 beaten egg
10 cups wheat bread that has been toasted & cubed
3 teaspoons poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons garlic

Directions:
Cook sausage, When sausage is almost brown add butter/ margarine then begin sauteing onions and celery until onion is tender. DO NOT BROWN. Stir in about 1/4 toasted bread cubes. Then fold in Chopped Mushrooms & chopped olives and another 1/4 toasted bread cubes. Transfer to a Large mixing bowl and add remaining bread cubes, garlic, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and 1 beaten egg (The egg is used to hold everything together & make stuffing turkey easier)
When Stuffing  turkey, I like to over stuff and have it over flowing & when I baste the turkey I baste the stuffing as well to insure not drying out about 1 hour before finished I stick the baster in the center of the stuffing and squeeze giving the stuffing some of the turkey flavors as well. When cooking extra in the oven, place the stuffing in a buttered casserole dish, and place in a pan of hot water. Cover, and baste with turkey drippings occasionally. It comes out really good.
On a substitute you could also use Italian Olive bread instead of wheat bread or try sour dough it comes out very delicious
