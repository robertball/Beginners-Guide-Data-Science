Ingredients:
5 Very large (like an orange) Red Potatoes or other waxy potato
2 heads roasted garlic (roasted in olive oil, blk pepper and pink salt) see ***
1 T Rosemary
1/8 tsp each:
White pepper
Smoked Paprika
Ground Mustard
1/4 c. Olive Oil
***or 4 large garlic cloves, mashed with salt and pepper***

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 F.
Halve potatoes down the middle for 2 round, fat halves each. (not for long flat pieces)
Barely cut bottom round tips off to lay potatoes flat.
Spray lined baking sheet with non-stick.
Smash up all ingredients with 1/4 cup olive oil and rub into potatoes, laying them flat, cut side up onto sheet, spaced apart.
Bake, uncovered, 35 - 38 minutes.
It is not necessary to turn potatoes or stir around while baking.  Just pop em' in, and wait for the timer!  If you have an oven light, these are wonderful to watch browning, and kids love to see it, too!
Bottoms will be caramel brown, and any garlic mash will darken up, so remove from bottom of potatoes before baking, but leave on tops!
