Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2 tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt
4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 cup cold milk
Note: if subbing buttermilk, it's suggested to reduce baking powder to 2 tsp. & add 1/2 tsp. baking soda.

Directions:
Mix first 4 ingredients in bowl. Stir thoroughly.
Cut in butter until crumbly.
Pour in milk. Stir quickly to combine, but don't overmix. Dough will be very soft.
Turn out onto floured surface. Knead gently about 8 times till it's not sticky.
Roll or pat 1/2 to 3/4" thick.
Cut with glass or small round cookie cutter.
Place on cookie sheet.
Bake @ 450 x 12 - 15 min. until golden brown.

Description: 
Warm out of the oven, smothered in butter along with a bowl of soup or chili is the perfect place for these light textured biscuits. I've also used this recipe for a quick tasty alternative to a yeast based pizza crust!
 I've made them with buttermilk or regular milk. Both versions are yummy. I've even substituted whole wheat flour - go ahead and experiment ;)
