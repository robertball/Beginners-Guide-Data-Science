Ingredients:
4 large baking potatoes (about 3-1/4 pounds)
1 Tbsp olive oil
3/4 tsp salt, divided
3/4 tsp pepper, divided
1/4 cup butter, cubed
1 24 oz container  cup sour cream
2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese, divided
12 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled, divided
2 green onions, sliced, divided
Additional sour cream, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°. Scrub potatoes; pierce several times with a fork. Brush with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place in a foil-lined 15x10x1-in. baking pan; bake 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until tender. Cool slightly.
In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in sour cream. Add 1-1/2 cups cheese; stir until melted. Remove from heat; cover to keep warm.
When potatoes are cool enough to handle, chunk them into edible size pieces.  Stir in cheese mixture, half of the bacon and 2 tablespoons green onion. Transfer to a greased 1-1/2-qt. baking dish. Top with the cut-up potato skins. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and bacon.
Bake 30-35 minutes or until heated through and lightly browned. Sprinkle with remaining green onion. If desired, serve with additional sour cream.
