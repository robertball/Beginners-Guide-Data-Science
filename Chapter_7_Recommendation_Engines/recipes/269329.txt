Ingredients:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
2 medium potatoes, halved lengthwise and sliced, or more to taste
1/2 large red onion, chopped
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound leftover turkey breast meat, cut into chunks
1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a cast-iron skillet. Add potatoes, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until potatoes are tender but still resistant to a fork, 8 to 10 minutes.
Add turkey to the potato mixture and continue to cook over medium-high heat until potatoes and onion are cooked through and potatoes are crispy, 8 to 10 minutes more. Plate and top with Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
Shopping sucks. Stay home and have breakfast instead made with leftover turkey. If you must go out into the madness, this will provide the fuel to keep you going while standing in those lines.
