Ingredients:
4 cups masa harina flour (Mexican corn masa mix)
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
2 1/2 cups warm water
1 (7 ounce) can ORTEGA® Diced Green Chiles
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
warmed ORTEGA® Refried Beans
SARGENTO® Fancy Shredded Mild Cheddar Cheese
ORTEGA® Thick & Chunky Salsa
sour cream
ORTEGA® Pickled Jalapeno Slices

Directions:
PLACE flour in large bowl; cut in vegetable shortening with pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Gradually add water, kneading until smooth.  Add chiles; mix well.  Form dough into 35 small balls.  Pat each ball into 3-inch patty; place on waxed paper.
HEAT 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  Cook patties for 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown, adding additional oil as needed to prevent sticking.
TOP with beans, cheese, salsa, dollop of sour cream and jalapenos.
