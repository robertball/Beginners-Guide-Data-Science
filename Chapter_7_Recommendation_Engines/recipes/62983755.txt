Ingredients:
3 pounds chicken wings
Oil for deep-fat frying
1/2 cup butter, cubed
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup Louisiana-style hot sauce
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 tablespoons water
1-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch

Directions:
Cut chicken wings into three sections; discard wing tip sections.
In an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375Â°. Fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, for 8 minutes or until golden brown and juices run clear, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels.
In a small saucepan, melt butter. Stir in the syrup, hot sauce, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Combine water and cornstarch; stir into sauce. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickened.
Place wings in a large bowl; pour sauce over and toss to coat. Yield: about 2 dozen.
Editor's Note: Uncooked chicken wing sections (wingettes) may be substituted for whole chicken wings.
