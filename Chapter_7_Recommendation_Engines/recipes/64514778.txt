Ingredients:
1 lb lean ground beef
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 14oz can red kidney beans, rinsed
3 smokies or sausages (farmer type), cooked and thinly sliced
2/3 cup frozen corn
2 medium carrots, sliced
1 10oz can tomato soup
1 cup spaghetti sauce, as spicy as you like
1 19 oz canned diced tomatoes (optional, but I often use them)
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 tsp. chili powder
cayenne, to taste

Directions:
In dutch oven, brown beef.
Add remaining ingredients.
Stir and bring to boil.
Then:
Let simmer, covered for an hour or until carrots are cooked.
Add water if it appears too dry or thick.
OR
Store in fridge until ready to start in slow cooker.
Cook in slow cooker on low for several hours, or until carrots are cooked. This is very forgiving as the moisture isn't lost (unless you lift the lid a few times!). It is usually ready in about 4 or 5 hours on low (or about 2 on high), depending how chilled it is when you start.

Description: 
I prefer to prep this ahead of time (even a day ahead) and then cook in slow cooker. Feel free to spice it up to your own taste :) Freezes well.
