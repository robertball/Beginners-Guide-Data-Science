Ingredients:
For Chops:
1 tbsp. chopped fresh sage or 1 tsp. dried
1 large clove of garlic, minced - about 1 tsp.
1/2 tsp. salt
Freshly ground pepper
4 3/4" bone-in pork chops
2 tsp. olive oil
For the Slaw:
2 tsp. olive oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 large Granny Smith apple, coarsely shredded
1 tsp. chopped fresh sage, or 1/2 tsp. dried
1/2 head green cabbage, coarsely shredded
2 tbsp. cider vinegar
1/2 tsp. salt
3/4 chicken broth

Directions:
Combine sage, garlic, salt and pepper and rub over pork.
Let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes.
Heat oil in a skillet, add chops and brown on both sides.
Remove chops from pan.
Wipe out pan and heat olive oil.
Add onion, apple and sage.
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until softened and golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.
Add carrots, vinegar and salt, and continue cooking until cabbage and carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Add broth and return chops to pan, burying them in the vegetable mixture.
Cover and cook until pork chops are done through - about 10 minutes.
Serve with pork chop over slaw and topped with pan juices.
