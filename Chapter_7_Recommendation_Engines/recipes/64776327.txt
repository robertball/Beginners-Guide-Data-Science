Ingredients:
1 cup ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon chopped parsley (or basil, sage, tarragon)
Grated Parmesan cheese or mozzarella
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Fresh wonton wrappers (15+)
Olive oil
Tomato sauce, for serving
Parsley leaves, for serving
Shaved cheese, for serving

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a small bowl, combine ricotta cheese, chopped parsley, a pinch or two of salt, several turns of freshly ground black pepper and grated Parmesan cheese (I added a small handful of cheese). Taste and season with additional salt, pepper and cheese if needed.
Using a small spoon, scoop 1 teaspoon of the ricotta mixture on to the center of a wonton wrapper. Roll into a tube then place on the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down. Repeat with remaining filling and wonton wrappers.
Lightly brush each roll with olive oil then bake for 10 - 12 minutes. The edges will turn crispy and the center will puff up.
To serve, top with tomato sauce, parsley leaves, shaved cheese and freshly ground black pepper.
