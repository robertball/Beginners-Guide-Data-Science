Ingredients:
2 (16 ounce) bags frozen white pearl onions, left frozen, excess ice removed
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons sugar
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup balsamic vinegar
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 425 degrees.
Toss onions with oil, sugar, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Transfer to a  cookie sheet with rim in a single layer. Roast onions until golden brown, about 30 minutes, stirring at 20 minutes and again at 25 minutes, adding garlic at this point.
Meanwhile, bring vinegar to boil; simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes, until reduced to 1/3 cup - it should be a thin syrup. Put onions into a bowl, add reduced vinegar and parsley; toss to coat. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

Description: 
Make sure the frozen pearl onions go straight from the freezer into the roasting pan. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position - closest to the heating element. And don't forget that sprinkling of sugar to help the browning.
