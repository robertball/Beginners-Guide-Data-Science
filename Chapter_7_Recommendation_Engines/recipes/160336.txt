Ingredients:
2 pounds flat iron steaks
2 tablespoons vegetarian Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons fresh-ground black pepper
1 pound sliced bacon
1/2 head shredded iceberg lettuce
1/2 head red leaf lettuce, torn
1 (10 ounce) bag baby salad greens
1 cup blue cheese salad dressing
1/2 pound crumbled blue cheese
1/2 pound shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Rub the flat iron steaks with Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper; set aside. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown and crispy. Remove bacon to cool on a paper towel lined plate, while leaving the grease in the skillet.
Heat the bacon grease over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Place the flat iron steaks in the hot grease, and cook until done to desired degree of doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium. Once done, remove the steaks and keep warm.
Place the iceberg lettuce, red leaf lettuce, and baby greens into a large salad bowl. Toss with the blue cheese dressing, then sprinkle with the blue cheese and cheddar cheese. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle overtop. Thinly slice the flat iron steak, and arrange over the salad.

Description: 
A wonderfully tasty main dish salad made with flat iron steak, bacon and fresh blue cheese.  My family loves it.  I make my lettuce mix in a large storage container and have left over salad for other things.
