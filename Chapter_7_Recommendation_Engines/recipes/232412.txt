Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
5 apples - peeled, cored, and sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Whisk sugar into vegetable oil in a mixing bowl. Beat eggs, vanilla extract, salt, flour, and baking soda into the sugar mixture, one ingredient at a time, in that order. Fold apple slices into the batter; pour into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
My husband introduced me to this rich, moist apple cake. It makes a delightful fall treat, especially with vanilla ice cream! I like to use a combination of Granny Smith and Braeburn apples. Refrigerate any leftovers.
