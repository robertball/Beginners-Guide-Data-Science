Description: 
Every year 18 of us get together for our annual 'Heart Party' in honor of Valentine's Day.  Besides sharing a favorite craft, we bring 18 cookies and share a favorite recipe.  This was mine from last year.  The recipe is written using white chocolate, but you can use dark chocolate instead, or use half white and half dark. I like to decorate mine with candy sprinkles too.
