Ingredients:
2 tablespoons mustard oil
1 pound okra, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
5 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 large red onion, thinly sliced
1 1/2 teaspoons diced ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon garam masala
2 tomatoes, diced
1/2 teaspoon amchoor (dried mango powder)
salt to taste
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Heat mustard oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add okra, garlic, and cumin seeds; cook and stir until okra is no longer sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onions and ginger; cook until onions soften slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in turmeric powder; cook for about 30 seconds. Stir in garam masala; cook for about 30 seconds.
Stir tomatoes and amchoor powder into the skillet. Cook until tomatoes start to soften, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and cover. Let rest until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
Bhindi Subzi is okra cooked with onions and tomatoes. Simple to cook but often misunderstood. 
My husband was not a big fan of okra but devoured and raved about this dish! Mission accomplished! Serve with roti, naan, or a wrap.
