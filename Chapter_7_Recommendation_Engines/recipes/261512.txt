Ingredients:
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 leeks, thinly sliced
1 cup chopped red potatoes
1 cup peeled and sliced parsnips
1 cup peeled and chopped turnip
1 cup sliced celery
1 cup sliced carrots
4 cups garbanzo beans, drained
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
2 cups vegan stout beer (such as Samuel Smith's)
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/4 cup water (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute leeks until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add potatoes, parsnips, turnip, celery, and carrots. Cook and stir until slightly tender and coated in oil, about 4 minutes. Add garbanzo beans, vegetable broth, beer, and parsley. Bring stew to a boil.
Reduce heat to low; cook until vegetables are tender and stew thickens slightly, about 1 hour more. Add a little water if necessary. Season with salt and pepper.
