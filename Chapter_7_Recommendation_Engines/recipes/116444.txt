Ingredients:
1 (1 1/4 pound) beef flank steak
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons molasses
2 teaspoons ground mustard
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups cooked long-grain rice
1 medium carrot, shredded
1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts
1/4 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
Starting along one long side, cut a horizontal slit through the steak to within 1/2 in. of the opposite side. Place in a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Combine the soy sauce, oil, molasses, mustard, ginger and garlic; set aside 1/4 cup. Pour remaining marinade over meat. Let stand for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the rice, carrot, water chestnuts, onions and reserved marinade. Stuff into steak. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45 minutes. Uncover; baste with pan drippings. Bake 15-20 minutes longer or until meat is tender. Brush again with pan drippings if desired.

Description: 
This is one of my favorite beef recipes. Tasty, tender and tucked full of vegetables, it warms up often on cold winter nights.
