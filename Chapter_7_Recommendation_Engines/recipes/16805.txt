Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
½ teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 ½ cups mayonnaise
3 cups cornflakes cereal, crushed
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Slice chicken breasts in half, lengthwise. Combine seasoning and mayonnaise in a shallow dish or bowl and mix together. Place cereal crumbs in a separate shallow dish or bowl.
Coat each piece of chicken with mayonnaise mixture, then roll in crumbs. Place coated chicken pieces in a 9x13 inch baking dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour. Remove foil cover and bake for 15 to 20 more minutes (this is optional; it will make the chicken crispier).

Description: 
My dad used to make this every Sunday for our family's weekly feast. Now, we have to beg in order for him to make it! It's great. It's also a lot easier than it sounds.
