Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 cloves crushed garlic
2 tablespoons brown sugar
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 eggs

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover completely with cold water.  Bring water to a boil for one minute.  Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes.  Remove from hot water, and cool.  Peel.  Score spirals into the white of the eggs, from the tops to the bottoms, using a sharp knife.
In a small saucepan, heat oil.  Add garlic, and cook over medium heat until it begins to brown.  Stir in sugar and soy sauce. Remove pan from heat.
Place eggs in sauce, and turn to coat.  When eggs are nice and dark, and the sauce is thick and syrupy, remove from sauce.  Serve.
