Ingredients:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 cup butter, softened
2 tsp vanilla
2 cups flour
1 cup finely chopped pecans (or ground almonds)
1/4 tsp salt
Additional powder sugar for rolling (about 1 cup)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degree F.
In a large, bowl, bea powdered sugar and butter until light and fluffy; beat in vanilla.
Stir in flour, pecans and salt; mix until a dough forms.  (Can be refrigerated for an hour for easier handling)
Shape dough into 1" balls, and place 1" apart on ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until set but not browned.  Immediately remove from baking sheets and roll in powdered sugar. (You can let cool for a minute or two if too hot to handle).
Cool completely on wire racks, then roll in powdered sugar again.
Store in an airtight container.

Description: 
Our dear family friend, Hilda, made these buttery, melt-in-your mouth treats for us.  She always used pecans, but her written recipe stated that ground almonds could also be substituted.  They are also known as Mexican Wedding Cakes, Russian Tea Cakes and a host of other names, but we call them Swedish Tea Cakes in honor of Hilda's Swedish heritage.
