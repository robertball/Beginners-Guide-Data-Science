Ingredients:
2 large red onions, each cut into 8 wedges
2 large carrots, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 1/2 large sweet potatoes, cut into 3/4-inch slices, then into thirds
1/2 large rutabaga, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1/2 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, melted, or more to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Combine red onions, carrots, sweet potatoes, and rutabaga in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil and butter. Add curry powder, turmeric, salt, and cumin; toss until thoroughly coated. Transfer to a large baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until almost tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Toss. Continue baking until vegetables are fork-tender, 20 to 30 minutes more.

Description: 
If you want an Indian twist on the classic root vegetable bake, then this is a scrumptious alternative. I found that leaving it overnight to cool and then slow cooking it the next day blended the flavors beautifully.
