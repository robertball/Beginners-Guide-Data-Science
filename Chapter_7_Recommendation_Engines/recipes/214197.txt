Ingredients:
1 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and minced
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
salt to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup tomato-based chili sauce
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 pounds swordfish steaks, cut 1 1/2-inches thick
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 lemon, thinly sliced

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
Stir the cucumber, sour cream, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a small bowl until combined. Season to taste with salt, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chili sauce, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with black pepper, and remove from the heat.
Brush the swordfish steaks on all sides with the 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Cook on the preheated grill until the fish is no longer translucent in the center, and easily flakes with a fork, about 3 minutes per side. Baste with the chili sauce while grilling. Serve the swordfish with lemon slices and the cucumber sauce.

Description: 
This wonderful, tangy sauce really compliments the flavor of grilled swordfish steaks. Serve with the cucumber sauce, and the combination of flavors are wonderful. This is my favorite way to have swordfish. You may add some diced hot peppers or spices if you would prefer some heat. Enjoy!
