Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1/4 pound thick-sliced bacon, chopped
2 cups thinly sliced red onions
1 (8 ounce) package sliced button mushrooms
1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup ricotta cheese, drained
1 large egg yolk
1 cup grated Gruyere cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Unroll puff pastry onto a baking sheet. Score edges at 1/4-inch intervals using a paring knife or press edges using a fork. Return pastry to the freezer until you're ready to use it.
Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add bacon and cook until crisp around the edges but stiff soft in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add onions, mushrooms, and thyme. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt to help vegetables release water. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to wilt and most of the water has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper to taste. Remove from heat and transfer mixture to a platter.
Place ricotta cheese in a bowl. Beat in egg yolk and remaining oil until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper. Spread ricotta mixture to within 1/2-inch of the edges of the puff pastry. Sprinkle Gruyere cheese on top, then cover with mushroom mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.
