Ingredients:
2	pounds  red potatoes , scrubbed and halved (quartered if large)
2	garlic cloves , peeled and smashed, plus 2 cloves, minced
1 1/2	teaspoons  grated zest  and 2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon
1	cup  low-sodium chicken broth
Salt and pepper
2	tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
2	tablespoons  finely chopped fresh parsle

Directions:
1. RINSE POTATOES Place potatoes in colander set over large bowl. Rinse under running water, tossing with hands until water runs clear. Drain potatoes well.
2. COOK POTATOES Bring potatoes, smashed garlic, lemon juice, chicken broth, and Â½ teaspoon salt to boil in large nonstick skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until potatoes are just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove lid and increase heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes.
3. CRISP POTATOES Discard garlic cloves and add oil to pan. Turn all potatoes cut-side down and continue to cook until deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in parsley, lemon zest, and minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.
