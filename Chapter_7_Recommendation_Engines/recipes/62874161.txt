Ingredients:
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon each salt and pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1-15 oz. can black beans, rinsed and drained
1-15 oz. can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1-15 oz. can whole kernel corn, drained
2/3 cup diced red bell pepper
2/3 cup diced orange bell pepper
2 stalks celery, diced
1/3 cup diced red onion
1 jalapeno pepper, finely diced, seeds and membrane discarded
tortilla chips or scoops

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine the oil, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is dissolved, 2-3 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.  In a large bowl combine the black and pinto beans, corn, bell peppers, celery, onion and jalapeno.  Pour cooled dressing over mixture and stir until well coated.  Cover and allow to sit at room temperature for at least an hour, stirring occasionally.  To serve, stir, and using a slotted spoon, transfer to a serving bowl.  Serve with tortilla chips.  Refrigerate leftovers; bring to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
There are lots of caviar recipes out there, but this one is a little different.  Most call for Italian salad dressing, but mine has a slightly sweet dressing that really compliments the other ingredients.  This is served at room temperature, so it's perfect for any large gathering.  Leftovers are great over salad greens with grilled chicken or serve it by itself as a side salad.
