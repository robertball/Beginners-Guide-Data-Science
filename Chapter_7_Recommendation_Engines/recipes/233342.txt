Ingredients:
2 cups fresh blueberries
2 teaspoons lemon juice
3/4 cup white sugar
3 tablespoons butter, softened
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
Topping:
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup boiling water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place blueberries in a deep 8-inch pie pan; drizzle lemon juice over blueberries.
Beat 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Sift flour, baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Mix milk, alternating with flour mixture, into creamed butter mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter over blueberries.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed; sprinkle over batter. Pour boiling water over sugar mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is a childhood favorite that my grandma passed to my mom and now I am passing to my own kids! It is quick and easy, and great for summer picnics. Plus, the little ones are fascinated when I tell them the boiling water is the 'mystery' behind the cake. Also great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!
