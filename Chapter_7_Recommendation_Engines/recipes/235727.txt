Ingredients:
8 ounces bacon
4 stalks celery, minced
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup minced yellow onion

1 1/2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
2 teaspoons chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®)
1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 hard boiled eggs, shells removed

Directions:
Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels and crumble once cooled.
Mix bacon, celery, mayonnaise, onion, relish, mustard, chile-garlic sauce, dill, Worcestershire, black pepper, paprika, and salt together in a large bowl; add eggs. Break egg whites and yolks with a potato masher into the bacon mixture. Stir broken egg pieces into the salad.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
