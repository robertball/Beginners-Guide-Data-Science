Ingredients:
1 cup skim milk
1 egg
2 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick)
8 oz. sliced deli turkey (or your choice)
8 oz. sliced deli pepper jack (or your choice)
8 oz. turkey bacon, cooked and drained (optional)
4 oz. hot pepper jelly (or your choice)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Prepare an 8x8 metal pan with cooking spray or butter. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk and egg, then mix in baking mix until well incorporated. Spread half of mixture in metal pan. Layer meat, cheese, and bacon evenly in pan, then cover with remaining mixture. Bake 27-32 minutes or until golden browned. Let rest, then serve with 1 oz. per person of dipping sauce on the side. Note: Sandwich slices will not be firm enough to pick up, you'll need to offer a fork and knife!
