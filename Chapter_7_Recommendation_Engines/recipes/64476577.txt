Ingredients:
1 envelope instant Yeast
1- 12 ounce warm beer
2 ounces warm water
1/4 cup oil
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons salt
4 - 5 cups bread flour
1 egg white
1 tablespoon baking soda
2 tablespoons *pretzel salt*
Parchment paper
Spray oil

Directions:
Combine 3 cups of flour, yeast, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached.  Add the warm beer, water and oil.  Combine well.
Slowly add enough remaining flour to make a soft dough and dough pulls away from sides of the bowl. You may not need all of the flour. Knead about 5 minutes.
Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth and allow to double in size.  About 30 minutes.
Punch dough down and remove to a lightly oiled surface. Divide dough into two portions.
Place parchment paper over the full surface of two, 16 inch, pizza pans.  Lightly spray with oil.  Place dough in center of each pan.  Let rest 5 minutes.
With floured hands pat the dough to fill the pan forming a 1 inch rim all the way around.
In a small bowl mix the egg white with the baking soda combining well.  Using a pastry brush generously baste the 1 inch rim of the dough with the egg wash. Sprinkle the wet dough with pretzel salt to taste.
Fill the dough with desired toppings and bake in a 425 degree pre heated oven for approximately 20 to 30 minutes until crust is very brown.  Let cool 2 minutes then slide parchment paper out from under the pie.  You may need to lift the edges with a knife a little bit to  release it.  Enjoy!
