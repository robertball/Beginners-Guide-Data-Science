Ingredients:
5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 1/2 pounds top round steak, cut into thin strips
1 large onion, thinly sliced
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 clove garlic, smashed
1/4 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup tomato paste
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 bay leaf, crumbled
1/2 cup beef broth
1/2 cup sour cream

Directions:
Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Coat bottom with 3 tablespoons oil; add steak and cook, turning as needed, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer steak to a 3-quart baking dish.
Add remaining oil to the frying pan. Saute onion, mushrooms, and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; add red wine, tomato paste, flour, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Blend in beef broth until well combined. Pour mixture over beef. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until beef is tender, about 1 hour. Gently stir in sour cream and serve.
