Description: 
Japanese creamy coleslaw with a sweet sesame seed dressing. Great as a starter with miso soup, before sushi, or as a side. Just like at a Japanese restaurant. Sprinkle some toasted white or black sesame seeds on top before serving. You can eat it right away, but it does taste so much better the next day when the flavors meld and the veggies soften a bit from the vinegar. It will last for a week in the refrigerator.
