Description: 
We have a tradition of hosting a game night during the holidays with nine other couples. Our guests come for the camaraderie, but they sure love washing down delicious buffet items with this sweet slush. Even non-coffee drinkers enjoy it.                                                --Iola Egle, McCook, Nebraska
