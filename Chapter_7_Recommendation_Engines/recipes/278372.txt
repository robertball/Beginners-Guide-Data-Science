Description: 
All the deliciousness of a jalapeno popper in a risotto made with Greek yogurt to keep it wholesome and creamy. Toasting the rice without oil gives it a lovely flavor and texture, keeping it more wholesome than other risotti that contain butter. This has become a favorite at our house. Leftovers make wonderful arancini.
