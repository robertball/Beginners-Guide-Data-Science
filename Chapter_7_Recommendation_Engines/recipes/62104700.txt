Ingredients:
1 lb. fresh sea scallops
1/2 cup buttery cracker crumbs
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
2/3 cup milk
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375.  Generously spray a 4-cup shallow casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray.
Rinse scallops and pat dry.  In a small bowl, combine cracker crumbs, bread crumbs and butter.  Sprinkle just less than half the crumbs in bottom of prepared casserole dish.  Cover with scallops.  Pour half of the milk over.  Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste.  Top with remaining crumbs.  Pour remaining milk over crumbs.  Bake in 375 oven until crumbs are browned, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
This easy yet scrumptious baked scallop recipe was given to me by a Nova Scotian cousin.  Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the ingredients.  If you like scallops, you will love this dish! I don't add salt as I find the cracker crumbs add enough salt.
