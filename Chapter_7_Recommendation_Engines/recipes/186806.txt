Description: 
Eating local in the winter can be hard in the North, but this will cure cravings for raw fresh food. Aside from the salt, pepper, and olive oil, most ingredients can still be found in the dead of winter from local farmers at the market. It makes a great alternative to coleslaw with burgers, or to serve with eastern European fare like pieroge or latkes.
