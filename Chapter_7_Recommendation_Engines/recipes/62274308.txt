Ingredients:
4 to 5 Large Ripe Roma Tomatoes
1 Pkg Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix
1 Pkg Mozzarella Cheese (use good quality cheese, not cheap brick cheese, they are NOT the same)

Directions:
Mix the Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix in a Good Seasons carafe. I change my dressing by using more water than the carafe indicates. I cut back on the oil, but I use only olive oil as well.
In a medium salad bowl, add cubed tomatoes and cubed mozzarella; pour the Italian dressing to about halfway over tomatoes and cheese. Mix well. Let stand for 20 minutes or refridgerate until ready to serve, mix again before serving.
