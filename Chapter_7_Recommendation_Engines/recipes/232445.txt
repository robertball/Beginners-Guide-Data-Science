Ingredients:
6 center-cut pork chops
6 Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered
2 onions, quartered
1 pound baby carrots
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Put pork chops into a roasting pan. Arrange potatoes, onions, and carrots around the chops. Sprinkle onion soup mix over the chops and vegetables; season with salt and black pepper. Pour beef broth over the entire mixture.
Place a cover on the roasting pan and bake in the preheated oven until the pork chops are no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
