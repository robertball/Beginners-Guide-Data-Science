Ingredients:
1/2 pound carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
1/2 pound purple daikon radish, peeled and cut into matchsticks
1/2 pound English cucumber, sliced into thin rounds
2 jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings
2 cups water
1 1/2 cups rice vinegar
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Inspect 2 mason jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until vegetables are ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
Divide carrots, radishes, cucumbers, and jalapeno peppers evenly into the 2 clean jars.
Combine water, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool for 2 minutes. Pour mixture over the vegetables in the jars and let come to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
Screw on lids and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
These quick pickled vegetables are traditionally served as a condiment for banh mi sandwiches, but they make a nice side for anything you'd normally pair with coleslaw, like fish and chips, BBQ, fish tacos, etc.
