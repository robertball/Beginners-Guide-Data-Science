Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup chopped pepperoncini (optional)
1/2 pound Genoa salami, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 pound Cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/3 pound provolone cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1/2 cup 1/2-inch pieces pitted green olives
1/2 cup 1/2-inch pieces Kalamata olives
1/2 cup 1/2-inch pieces pepperoni
1/2 cup 1/2-inch pieces celery
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 (8 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the rotini in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Rinse pasta with cold water until chilled; drain.
Mix carrots, pepperoncini, Genoa salami, Cheddar cheese, provolone cheese, sweet onion, green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoni, celery, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and artichoke hearts together in a large mixing bowl. Pour Italian-style salad dressing over the salad and toss to coat; add pasta and stir.
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. Stir salad and add more Italian-style dressing as needed if you find the salad too dry.

Description: 
This salad has everything in the filling of a muffaletta sandwich but in pasta salad form! It is a great salad to take on a picnic and it has a nice variation of tastes on the tongue in each bite! It is one of our summer picnic staples!
