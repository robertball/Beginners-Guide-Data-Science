Ingredients:
To ferment fruit:
3/4 c drained, canned peaches, cut in pieces, in heavy syrup
3/4 c drained pineapple tidbits, in heavy syrup
6 maraschino cherries
1 1/2 c sugar
1 pkg. yeast

Directions:
Combine ingredients and place in a glass jar with a loose cover.  Let it sit out on the kitchen counter.  Stir several times the first day, then stir once a day.  At the end of two weeks the starter has fermented enough to make the Sauce.
Sauce:
1 c fermented fruit
1/2 c drained, canned peaches, cut in pieces, in heavy syrup
1/2 c drained, canned pineapple chunks, in heavy syrup
6 maraschino cherries
1 c sugar
Combine all ingredients in a glass jar with a loose cover; stir well.  Set in a warm place on the kitchen counter.  Continue to stir once a day.  Sauce can be served after one week.  Fruit and sugar must be repeated every two weeks.  No need to refrigated.  Sauce will keep many months if directions are carefully followed.
