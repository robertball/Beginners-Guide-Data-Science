Ingredients:
25 fresh figs, chopped
4 packages of Splenda (or any other zero calorie sweetener)

Directions:
Fill one cup of water in a pot. Set fire to low.
Once at a boil, place chopped figs in pot.
Stir frequently. (Try to break fig into smaller pieces while stirring)
After about 5-10 minutes, sprinkle in Spendla packages. Stir.
Keep the figs cooking for about 45 minutes at a low fire.
Once all the water has evaporated, and fig mixture looks somewhat firm, your jelly will be done!
