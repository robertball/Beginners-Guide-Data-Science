Description: 
When challenged to develope a recipe using SPAM™ as a main ingredient for a campout, this is what I came up with.  Tasty bite sized pillows filled with SPAM™ and Pineapple, served with Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping.  These are super easy to prepare, but do take a bit of time to fill and shape the pillows.
