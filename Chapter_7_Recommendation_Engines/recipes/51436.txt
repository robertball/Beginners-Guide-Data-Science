In a medium bowl, mix together the ground turkey, mushrooms, onion, and soy sauce. Season with kosher salt and pepper. Form into 4 burger patties.

Description: 
These are delicious turkey burgers that my kids even love. I make them more than I make beef patties. You would never know that you are using turkey instead of beef. Fabulous and very easy. Serve on toasted buns.
