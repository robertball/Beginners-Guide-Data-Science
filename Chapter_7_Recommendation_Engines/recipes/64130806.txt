Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Line 9x5" loaf pan with parchment paper (or grease and flour). Mix topping ingredients and set aside.
Whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cocoa powder in a small bowl until combined. Set aside.
Mix together sugars, oil, and eggs for about 1-2 minutes until slightly fluffy. Add vanilla and sour cream.
Fold in the grated zucchini, then add the remaining dry flour ingredients. Stir to combine and lastly fold in the chocolate chips.
Pour into prepared 9? bread pan. Sprinkle the topping on the top. Bake for 50-60 minutes. I set a time for 45 minutes and mine was done at that time.
