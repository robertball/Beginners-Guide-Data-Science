Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/3 cup butter
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Vegetable oil for deep-fat frying
1/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, combine water, butter, brown sugar, and salt. Bring to boiling over medium heat Add flour all at once, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove from heat. Cool for 10 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating well with a wooden spoon.
Transfer mixture to a decorating bag fitted with a large star tip. Line a baking sheet waxed paper. Pipe 4x1-inch logs onto prepared baking sheet.
Heat 3 inches of oil in a deep saucepan to 375 degrees F. Fry a few logs at a time in deep hot oil about 2 minutes or until golden brown on both sides, turning once. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 300 degree F oven while cooking remaining churros.
In a medium bowl, combine granulated sugar and cinnamon. Roll warm churros in cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat. Serve warm. Makes about 20 churros.
