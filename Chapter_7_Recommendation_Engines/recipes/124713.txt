Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
1/2 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dill weed
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add the milk, butter, sugar, rosemary, salt, dill, garlic powder, onion and 1 cup of flour. Beat until smooth. Add the remaining flour and stir for about 1 minute.
Transfer to a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes.
Stir the batter down, about 25 strokes. Spread into a greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pan. Cover and let rise until almost doubled, about 15 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees F for 40-45 minutes. Remove from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.
