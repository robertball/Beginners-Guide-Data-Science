Description: 
This is my own invention and so good, healthy and easy that I wanted to share it with someone! It consists of cooked bow tie pasta shapes covered in a creamy mushroom and vegetable sauce. A complete vegetarian meal in one dish.  You can use milk or skim milk instead of cream depending on how rich you want the dish to be.
