Ingredients:
1 pound pork (thinly sliced)
1/2 cup gochujang

1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sugar
2 green onions (chopped)
1 Carrot Shaved Slices.
1/4 teaspoon pepper
teaspoon Cayenne pepper (To Taste, Optional)

Directions:
I normally will take a pork loin and slice it very thin, then I will use my pounder to pound it out to make sure it is thin, and this will also make the meat tender.
Mix everything in a freezer bag and marinate over night.
Cook the meat on a barbecue or in a pan on the stove.
serve over rice
