Ingredients:
3 tbsp. butter
3/4 c. flour
3 eggs
2 c. milk
3 tbsp. white sugar
1/4 tsp. salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Beat eggs then add in flour, milk, sugar, and salt.
Melt all of the butter in a 9x13 inch baking pan, by placing butter in pan then heating in the preheated oven.
Take out pan once butter is melted (should only take a minute or so).
Coat pan with butter, making sure you get the sides as well.
Now pour the rest of the melted butter straight into the batter.
Mix the butter into the batter and then pour it all into the pan.
Put pan back into oven and bake for 35 minutes.
It will puff up and turn golden brown on the edges.
Take it out of the oven and let settle for a couple minutes.
Serve and enjoy!
