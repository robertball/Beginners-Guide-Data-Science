Ingredients:
2 large eggs
55g palm sugar
1 1/2 cups coconut cream
3 pandan leaves, cut into 3 cm lengths
1 tablespoon agar agar powder
1 1/2 cups water
100g granulated sugar

Directions:
To make the custard, beat the eggs with the palm sugar, coconut cream and pandan leaves so the pandan aroma is imparted to the eggs. Strain the mixture and set aside.
Place the agar agar powder and water in a small wok or pot and heat until agar agar is completely dissolved. Add the granulated sugar and cook until dissolved. Do not boil.
Add the custard to the agar agar and lightly cook for 2 minutes and remove from the heat. Do not boil.
Pour the mixture into 250 ml molds and let set completely, about 2 hours. Remove the jellies from the molds and serve.
