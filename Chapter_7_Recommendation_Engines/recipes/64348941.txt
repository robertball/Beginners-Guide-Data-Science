2 tablespoons molasses
3 cups veggie stock

Add remaining stock, and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and let simmer for 18 to 20 minutes, or until quinoa is cooked.
Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, cook shiitake mushrooms dry or in broth or water until softened; set aside.
Puree soup in a food processor or blender, and return to saucepan.  Stir in  cream, and heat (DO NOT BOIL). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with tofu sour creme, shiitake mushrooms, and chives.
