Ingredients:
1 cup white distilled vinegar
1 1/4 cups water
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 pound sugar snap peas, both ends trimmed
4 garlic cloves, sliced
2 strips of lemon zest
2 sprigs tarragon
1 teaspoon dill seed
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Dissolve salt and sugar in vinegar over low heat in a non-reactive saucepan. Remove from heat and add water.
When your brine is cool, fill a 1-qt Mason jar with the sugar snap peas, garlic, lemon zest, tarragon, dill seed and red pepper flakes and pour the brine over everything.
Cover and store in refrigerator for a day to enjoy lightly pickled peas, though a week or two will really bring the pickling flavors forward. Pickled peas will keep for several months.
Cook's note: Be sure to trim the pea pod ends to allow a full immersion of the brine.
