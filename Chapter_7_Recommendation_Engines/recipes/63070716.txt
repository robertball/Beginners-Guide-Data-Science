Ingredients:
2 (6 oz each) boneless skinless chicken breasts
Salt to taste
Black pepper to taste
2 T crumbled blue cheese
2 T Frank’s Red Hot (or similar hot sauce)
1 T fat free sour cream
¾ c corn flakes cereal, crushed

Directions:
1.    Preheat the oven to 400. Lightly mist a baking dish (I used a 9 x13 but a smaller one would work) with cooking spray and set aside.
2.    Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and cover them with parchment paper. Using a meat mallet, pound the breasts to a ¼ inch thickness. Season breasts with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle a tablespoon of blue cheese evenly across the surface each breast. Starting with a short side, roll each breast up and seal shut using toothpicks.
3.    In a small bowl, mix the hot sauce and sour cream until thoroughly combined. Pour the crushed corn flakes into a shallow dish. Brush the surface of each chicken roll with a liberal amount of the hot sauce mixture and then roll in the corn flakes to coat. Place the rolls seam side down in the prepared baking dish.
4.    Bake for 30-35 minutes. Don’t forget to remove the toothpicks before serving!
