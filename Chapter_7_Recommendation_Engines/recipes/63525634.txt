Ingredients:
20-24 mini frozen bread dough balls (to make dinner rolls)
1/4  c. INSTANT vanilla pudding
1 c. dark brown sugar
1-2 T. cinnamon
1/4-1/2 c. melted butter
3/4 c. raisins (optional)

Directions:
Moments before you head off to bed on Christmas Eve, grease a 10 in. bundt pan.  Put the frozen bread dough balls in the pan.
In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar, the instant pudding powder, the cinnamon and the raisins.
Sprinkle the mixture over the frozen rolls then pour the melted butter evenly over the rolls.
Cover with a clean, damp cloth and leave it on the kitchen counter at room temperature.  Go to bed.
The next morning, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Bake rolls for 25-30 minutes.
Remove pan from oven, let sit for 5 minutes and turn it out on a serving platter.
Pull off rolls with your fingers and enjoy!
