Ingredients:
3/4 cup dark molasses
3/4 cup margarine or butter
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend
4 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 large egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Heat molasses, margarine or butter, brown sugar, and SPLENDA(R) Sugar Blend, in a saucepan until it boils, stirring to blend well. Remove from heat and allow cooling.
Combine flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and nutmeg in a large bowl.
Add egg to molasses mixture and stir this into the flour mixture until smooth. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Roll dough out between two pieces of floured plastic wrap, from 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness, and cut out gingerbread man shapes with floured 4x6 shaped cookie cutter. Re-roll dough as little as possible for consistent texture.
Lift cookies with thin spatula onto a greased cookie sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes. Remove from sheet and allow to cool.
Decorate gingerbread cookies as desired.
