Description: 
You're not going to believe how awesome this chili tastes and how easy it is to make. I make batches and take it to work for lunch for the week. It's really filling and very healthy. You can substitute the chili beans with kidney beans if you wish, but be sure to drain them if you do. It's even better the next day, and if you omit the optional cheese, it's vegan-friendly!
