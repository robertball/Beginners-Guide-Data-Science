Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package double crust ready-to-use pie crusts (such as PillsburyÂ®)
1/2 cup marinara sauce
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll pie crusts onto a work surface. Spread marinara onto 1 crust and top with mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.
Brush the second pie crust with olive oil and sprinkle oregano over the oil. Lay crust, oil-side up, on top of the pepperoni layer. Cut pizza into 1x3-inch strips. Place strips on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Pizza fries for dipping, snacking, and sharing. The cheese melts out a little, that is perfect. Cool, then dip into marinara and enjoy.
