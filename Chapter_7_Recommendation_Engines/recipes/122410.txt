Description: 
If you asked my husband to name his favorite foods, he'd likely mention these chops. I've also served this appealing skillet supper to company. Ever since I clipped the recipe out of the paper many years ago, it's become a standard in my kitchen. We live in a semi-rural area with two horses and six cats!
