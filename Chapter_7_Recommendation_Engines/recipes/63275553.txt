Ingredients:
1 large low-fat, high-fiber, burrito-size tortilla with about 100 calories (like this kind by La Tortilla
Factory)
1/3 cup fat-free ricotta cheese
1 tbsp. shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup thinly sliced onion
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
1/8 tsp. salt, or more to taste
Dash black pepper
4 thin slices plum tomato
4 fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Put tortilla on a baking sheet sprayed lightly with nonstick spray. Bake in the oven until slightly
crispy, 3 - 5 minutes per side. Leave oven on.
In a small bowl, mix ricotta cheese with mozzarella cheese. Set aside.
Bring a skillet sprayed with nonstick spray to medium heat on the stove. Add onion and, stirring
occasionally, cook until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Immediately stir onion
into cheese mixture. Add garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and mix well.
Spread cheese-onion mixture evenly on top of the tortilla. Top with tomato slices and basil
leaves. If you like, sprinkle with a dash of salt.
Return pizza to the oven and bake until hot, about 5 minutes. Slice and enjoy. Pizza for one!
