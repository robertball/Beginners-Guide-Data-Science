Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup canola oil
1 Tbsp minced fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 red pepper flakes
1/8 tsp pepper
3 cups shredded zucchini
1 tsp salt
1 cup biscuit/baking mix
1 medium onion, chopped

Directions:
take shredded my zucchini and tossed it with salt to draw out moisture then let it sit draining in a colander.  Give a squeeze to help drain more liquid out.
In a large bowl, whisk the first seven ingredients. In a frying pan over medium heat, sweat the onions until limp, about 5 minutes. Stir in the zucchini, baking mix and onion. Pour into a greased 9-in. deep-dish pie plate. Bake at 350Â° for 25-35 minutes or until lightly browned.
Note: If you don't have a deep dish pie plate, feel free to use a small baking dish (8-in. square) or a souffle dish (1-1/2 to 2 quarts). Reduce oven time as needed, baking until lightly browned and eggs have reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees.
