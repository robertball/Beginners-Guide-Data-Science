Ingredients:
3 tablespoons peanut oil, divided, or more as needed
1/2 onion, chopped
2 large eggs
1 cup diced fully cooked ham
2 tablespoons butter
3 cups cooked brown rice
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat a wok or skillet on high heat for 1 minute.
Coat wok thoroughly with 2 tablespoons peanut oil; reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes.
Crack eggs directly into the wok. Stir quickly to scramble until eggs begin to set but are still fluid, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Stir ham into the wok and cook just until warmed through, about 1 minute.
Stir butter and remaining 1 tablespoon of peanut oil into the wok; let warm for 10 seconds. Add rice and stir constantly for 3 to 4 minutes, adding more oil if rice begins to stick.
Season fried rice with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese.
