Ingredients:
1/2 pound cleaned, cooked crawfish tail meat
1/2 pound jumbo lump crabmeat
1/2 pound cooked small shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons hot sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/3 cup chopped cilantro
1/2 cup diced red onion (1/4-inch pieces)
1 cup peeled, seeded, and diced cucumber
1 cup diced jicama
1 jalapeno chile pepper, seeded and minced
salt to taste
1 large avocado, diced

Directions:
Place the crawfish, crab, and shrimp in a large glass or ceramic bowl; pick any shells from the meat.  Pour in the lime juice, and gently mix, being careful not to break up the crab meat.  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.
In a separate bowl, mix together the ketchup, hot sauce, and olive oil.  Stir in the cilantro, onion, cucumber, jicama, and jalapeno; add salt to taste.  Gently fold this mixture into the seafood.  Refrigerate until ready to serve.  Add the avocado just before serving.

Description: 
This three seafood ceviche is worth trying!  Serve it in martini or margarita glasses and garnish with cilantro leaves and slices of lime.  Serve with chips.  I make everything ahead and marinate, but don't put the avocado in until close to serving.
