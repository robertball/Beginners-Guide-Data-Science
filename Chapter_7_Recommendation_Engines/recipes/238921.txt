Ingredients:
Crumbs:
1/4 cup garlic olive oil
3/4 cup bread crumbs, or more to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
Beans:
1 (15.5 ounce) can white beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
salt to taste
1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley

Directions:
Heat garlic olive oil, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until mixture resembles wet sand and is fragrant, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in remaining Parmesan cheese; cook and stir until golden brown and crunchy, about 1 minute more. Transfer bread crumbs to a plate.
Return skillet to heat; cook and stir white beans, olive oil, vinegar, cayenne pepper, and salt in hot skillet until beans are heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir parsley and breadcrumbs to taste into beans; toss to coat.

Description: 
One quest that never ends for a cook is the search for ways to make common side dishes seem a little more special. Here we're coating the beans with a crispy, cheesy, pleasantly-gritty bread crumb mixture. This was inspired by a similar trick I like to use for finishing pastas, and if there's one thing I know about people, it's they like crispy and crunchy toppings.
