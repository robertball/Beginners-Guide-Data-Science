Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1 zucchini
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp salt
2 tsp fresh ground pepper
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 bunch of kale
1 cup water
6 large mushrooms
2 cans pasta sauce
1 package oven ready lasagna noodles
1 carton bocconcini cheese, thinly sliced.
1 Kg grated mozzarella

Directions:
Preheat oven at 450 degF.
Thinly slice bell peppers, zucchini and mushrooms. Toss sliced vegetables in a large bowl with 4 tbsp olive oil, salt and pepper. Place vegetables on a foil covered cookie sheet with minimal overlapping. Roast in preheated oven for 25 minutes, turning vegetables after 10-12 minutes.
Adjust oven temperature to 375 degF.
While vegetables are roasting, tear kale into 1-2 inch pieces. Steam in water for 1 minute, or until kale just darkens in color and becomes less rigid. Remove from heat and drain. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan at medium heat. Add garlic, saute for one minute. Add steamed kale, saute for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Layer pasta sauce, noodles, roasted vegetables and mozzarella. Then layer noodles, pasta sauce, kale and bocconcini. Continue layers of your choice until ingredients are used up. Make sure that each noodle layer is adjacent to a layer of pasta sauce so that noodles do not become overly dry.
Bake at 375 degF for 45 minutes.
Let cool for 20-30 minutes before serving.
