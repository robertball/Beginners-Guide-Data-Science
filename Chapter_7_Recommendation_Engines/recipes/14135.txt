Ingredients:
4 cups blackberry juice
4 cups white sugar
1/3 (2 ounce) package powdered pectin (optional)

Directions:
Mix the blackberry juice and sugar, bring to a boil.  Boil rapidly for 2 minutes.  Skim off foam.  Pour into HOT sterile jars or bottles.
This makes a thin syrup (like true maple syrup).  If you want it slightly thicker, you can add a small amount of powdered pectin (less than half a 2 ounce box) to the cold syrup and sugar mixture.
