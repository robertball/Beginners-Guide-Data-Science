Microwave on high for 30-60 seconds or until the preserves melt stirring once halfway through the cooking time.
Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry.
Place the chicken in a ziplock bag and pour the cooled marinade over the chicken.
Seal the bag and refrigerate for 6-24 hours, yarning occasionally.
Place the chicken on preheated grill, indirect heat, cover and grill until chicken is browned or cooked through, about 30 minutes. Can be done in the oven as well at 400 degrees.

Description: 
Ginger and Peach form a great flavour combination.  Especially here, where the ginger and peach flavours are enhanced by the element of smoke flavouring on the grill.
