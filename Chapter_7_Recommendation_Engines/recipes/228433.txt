Ingredients:
1 green bell pepper, coarsely chopped - or more to taste (optional)
1/4 cup coarsely chopped carrot
6 cloves garlic, peeled
1 (29 ounce) can tomato puree
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 tablespoon dried Italian herb seasoning
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Place green bell pepper, carrot, and garlic cloves into a food processor and pulse a few times until the vegetables are very finely chopped.
Transfer chopped vegetables into a large saucepan. Stir in tomato puree, crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning, basil, and red pepper flakes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes. Stir in olive oil and simmer 1 to 2 more minutes. Sauce may be refrigerated up to 1 week.

Description: 
I say replace sugar with carrots in any tomato recipe. Additional veggies are a sneaky way to get them into the kids. Add olive oil near end of cooking to preserve its flavor.
