Ingredients:
12 small campari tomatoes, quartered
2 cucumbers, peeled & sliced
1 large red onion, sliced into strings
1 large green bell pepper, bite size slices
1 block feta cheese, hand crumbled
Kalamata olives, with pits
1/4 cup olive oil
salt
pepper
dried oregano
1 loaf French bread, sliced

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together (excluding bread), making sure no pieces are larger than bite size. Season with salt, pepper and oregano (to your taste), but since feta is salty, don't add too much extra salt. Add as many Kalamata olives as you like.
Serve with sliced French bread, for sauce dipping, and enjoy.
