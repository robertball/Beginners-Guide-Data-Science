Description: 
I fixed this dish for 70 people (4th of July party) and it was a HUGE, HUGE hit!! I made the topping the day before and added the panko crumbs just before I baked it. I only used a little panko though. Just enough to give it a crunch. The flavor was amazing!!! So simple! The non-fish eaters came back for seconds!!
