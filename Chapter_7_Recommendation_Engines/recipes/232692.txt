Ingredients:
1 (9 inch) angel food cake, cut into bite-sized pieces
4 cups cold fat-free milk
2 (1 ounce) packages fat-free, sugar-free vanilla pudding mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 cup sliced strawberries, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
1 (8 ounce) container light whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®)
1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Directions:
Layer angel food cake in the bottom of a trifle bowl or large glass serving bowl.
Whisk fat-free milk and vanilla pudding mix together in a bowl; pour over angel food layer. Sprinkle strawberries and pineapple over pudding layer; spoon whipped topping over fruit layer. Top with walnuts.

Description: 
A low-fat, low-sugar trifle that the whole family will love! I find that the pudding is usually set by the time I am done adding the other layers so it can be eaten right away. If not, chill in the fridge until the pudding is set. Keep refrigerated (especially if it is warm.)
