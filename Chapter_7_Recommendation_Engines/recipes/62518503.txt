Ingredients:
6 each large eggs (hard-boiled)
3 tablespoons  mayonnaise
1 teaspoon  mustard
1 teaspoon  vinegar
salt & pepper to taste
paprika

Directions:
To boil eggs, place eggs in enough cold water to cover completely, bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
Reduce heat to a lower Medium Boil and cook an additional 12 minutes. Promptly chill eggs so yolks stay bright yellow.
Remove shells from eggs, and halve lengthwise with a knife.
Carefully remove the yolks, and place in a medium bowl.
Mash yolks with a fork, and add remaining ingredients.
Very carefully spoon mixture back into the egg white halves. Garnish with a light sprinkling of paprika.
