1 cup pistachios, shelled and crushed
1/3 cup red wine

Description: 
I'm allergic to apples and walnuts, so it was difficult for me to participate during the Passover Seder, until my mother whipped this up for me one year. The entire family wanted to try it. After fifteen people had some, there wasn't much left, so now we have to double or even triple the recipe every year!
