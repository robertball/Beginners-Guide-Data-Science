Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 2/3 cups white sugar
2/3 cup butter-flavored shortening
4 large eggs
1 3/4 cups applesauce
2/3 cup water
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 1/2 cups raisins
2/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a fluted cake pan with cooking spray.
Beat sugar and shortening together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs until incorporated.
Combine applesauce, water, and baking soda in a saucepan over medium heat; stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir applesauce mixture into shortening mixture; add vanilla extract.
Whisk flour, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and ground cloves together in a bowl. Gradually stir applesauce mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Fold in raisins and walnuts. Pour into prepared cake pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes and transfer cake to a plate.

Description: 
This recipe has been handed down through the Westfall family for years. My grandfather, James Westfall, made this cake frequently, especially during the holidays. It is a great cake for family get-togethers.
