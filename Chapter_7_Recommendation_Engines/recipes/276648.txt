Ingredients:
2 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Cup4Cup™)
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 tablespoon gluten-free baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 stick butter, frozen
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
1/3 cup heavy cream
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 tablespoon turbinado sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw®)
Glaze:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves in a large bowl. Grate frozen butter into flour mixture and blend with a pastry blender until flour is crumbly with pea-sized crumbs.
Combine pumpkin puree, 1/3 cup heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add to the crumb mixture and mix into a soft dough.
Lightly sprinkle counter and hands with flour and turn out dough onto the counter. Shape into a small, 1-inch thick rectangle, slightly smaller than a sheet of paper. Cut rectangle in half using a knife or a pizza cutter, then cut each half into 6 triangles. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with 2 tablespoons heavy cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Remove and allow to cool on a wire rack.
While scones are cooling, combine confectioners' sugar, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice for glaze in a bowl and whip until smooth. Add glaze to a small resealable plastic bag, snip off one corner, and drizzle on top of cooled scones.
