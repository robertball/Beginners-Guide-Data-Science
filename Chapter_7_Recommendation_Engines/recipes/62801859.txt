Ingredients:
3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon olive oil
3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
5 large sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Stir together olive oil, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Brush the sweet potato slices with the maple mixture and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
Bake in preheated oven for 8 minutes, then turn the potato slices over, brush with any remaining maple mixture, and continue baking until tender in the middle, and crispy on the edges, about 7 minutes more.
