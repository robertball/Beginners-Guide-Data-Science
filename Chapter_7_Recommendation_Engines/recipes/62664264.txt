Ingredients:
18.5 oz yellow cake mix
3.5 oz instant lemon pudding mix
4 large eggs
3/4 c. veg oil
4 c. confectioner's sugar
1/3 c. fresh lemon juice
1 lemon, zest of
3 T. veg oil
3 T. water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray miniature muffin tins with veg oil cooking spray.
Combine cake mix, pudding mix, eggs and oil and blend well for 2 minutes.
Pour a small amount of batter, filling each tin half way.  A small cookie scoop is good for a uniform size.
Bake for 12 minutes or a minute or two more- a little past golden brown.
Make the glaze with the last 5 ingredients.
Using your fingers, dip the cupcakes into the glaze while still warm, covering as much of the cake as possible.
Place on wire racks to dry, with waxed paper underneath to catch drips.
Allow glaze to set thoroughly (about an hour) before storing in containers with tightly fitted lids.
