Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon coriander
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups quartered baby portabella mushrooms (Slice instead if they have the circumference of a golf ball or wider)
1 lb raw shrimp (tails off and de-veined, substitute 1/2 for crawfish (if available)
1/2 cup chopped green onion (about 2-3)
16 ounces fettuccine pasta
shredded fresh parmesan cheese

Directions:
Cook fettuccine as directed.
Melt butter in a large skillet. Add cream, ketchup and spices. Whisk together and bring to a boil. Continue to simmer and reduce while you continue with the rest of the recipe, stirring occasionally with a wire whisk. (most of the cream will boil away, leaving you with a dark orange sauce).
In a separate small skillet, saut√© mushrooms in olive oil until soft. Add mushrooms to simmering sauce.
Cook shrimp (and crawfish if available) in the small skillet in olive oil just until pink and add to sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes adding green onions for the last 2 minutes or so.
Toss with cooked fettuccine and serve immediately lightly topped with finely shredded fresh parmesan (or romano) cheese.
