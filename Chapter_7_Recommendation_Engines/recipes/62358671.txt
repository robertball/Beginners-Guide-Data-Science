Saute onions, celery, carrot, and butter in a large soup pot. Add flour and curry, and cook 3-5 more minutes. Add chicken stock, mix well, and bring to a boil then lower to simmer.
Add apple, rice, chicken, salt, pepper, and thyme. Simmer an hour or longer, until rice is done. If the soup is too thick, add chicken broth.

Description: 
This is my revision to the Mullagatwany 1 recipe. In effect, I added more curry, less butter, and 150% the amount of rice (I use basmati). I also double the recipe and freeze half for a later time. The initial result is more like a stew, but depending on the eaters in your family, you'll be fine, or just add more chicken broth.Modified from: Mulligatawny Soup I
