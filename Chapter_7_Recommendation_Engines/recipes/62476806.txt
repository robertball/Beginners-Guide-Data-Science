Directions:
Pour 4 oz. of the coconut milk into a pan.  Cook on medium for about 3 minutes.  Add the red curry paste, soy sauce and agave to the coconut milk.  Add mushrooms, stir and cook for 1 minute.  Stir in the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil.  Turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes.
