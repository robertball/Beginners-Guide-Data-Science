Ingredients:
1 CAULIPOWERÂ® Cauliflower Pizza Crust
4 teaspoons olive oil, divided
1 large carrot, thinly sliced on the diagonal
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 medium red onion, thinly sliced
4 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature
1 egg yolk
1 clove garlic, minced
1 lemon, zested and juiced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons honey
1 cup baby arugula

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with foil.
Toss carrot slices with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss red onion with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Put the carrots and onions on their own baking sheets.
Roast in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
While carrot and onion are roasting, combine goat cheese, egg yolk, garlic, and lemon zest in a bowl. Mix until smooth and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Remove vegetables from the oven. Toss carrots with honey and set aside. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spread the goat cheese mixture all over the crust, leaving about 1/4 inch from edge. Arrange carrot on the pizza and sprinkle with red onion.
Bake pizza until cheese is melted and starting to brown, 13 to 15 minutes.
While the pizza bakes, toss arugula with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Cut pizza into slices and top with the salad, or serve it on the side.
