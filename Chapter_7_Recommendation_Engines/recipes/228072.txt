Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) whole fryer chicken
2 lemons, quartered
2 limes, quartered
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
3/4 (12 ounce) can beer
4 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer
1 cup vinegar
6 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 red onion, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Rinse chicken and pat dry with paper towels. Squeeze lemon and lime quarters over the chicken. Mix garlic salt and allspice with salt and black pepper to taste in a bowl and rub the spices over the chicken skin; place squeezed lemon and lime quarters inside the chicken cavity. Place 3 tablespoons minced garlic into cavity. Wrap chicken in plastic wrap and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours.
Preheat grill for medium-low heat; a grill thermometer should read 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) with the lid closed.
Place remaining 3 tablespoons garlic into the partially full can of beer and sit chicken upright on the beer can, taking care not to lose any lemon and lime quarters and garlic.
Pour water, 1 12-ounce can of beer, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into a saucepan over medium heat; stir in red onion, red bell pepper, 3 tablespoons minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mopping sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Set sauce aside.
Place chicken upright with beer can onto the preheated grill and cook until the skin is browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 2 hours. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Use a brush to spread mopping sauce on the chicken every 30 minutes as it cooks. Discard leftover sauce.

Description: 
A great way to cook whole fryer chickens. I added my mopping sauce to keep the birds from drying out.
