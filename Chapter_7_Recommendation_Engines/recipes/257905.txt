Ingredients:
Cake:
1 cup white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups gluten-free all-purpose baking flour (such as Cup4Cupâ„¢)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups grated carrots
Cream Cheese Icing:
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/4 cup butter, softened
2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat white sugar and vegetable oil together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; beat in eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix.
Combine baking flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; mix into sugar-vegetable oil until batter is smooth. Fold carrots into the batter; pour into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Allow cake to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
Beat cream cheese and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer; beat in confectioners' sugar, a little at a time, until icing is smooth and creamy. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and beat well. Spread icing onto cake.
