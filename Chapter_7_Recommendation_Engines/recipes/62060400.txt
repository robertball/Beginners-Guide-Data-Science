Description: 
This is something quick and tasty that my mom made up and I love it.  The hardest part is cutting up the potatoes.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to use diced tomatoes that are garlic flavored or flavored to your liking.  You may want to adjust the amount of each ingredient to your preference.
