Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted and cooled
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Add eggs, sugar, salt, butter and 2 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch the dough down. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 13-in. x 9-in. rectangle. Transfer dough to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Using a sharp knife, cut dough into 14 even squares. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake at 375 degrees F for 20 minutes or until golden brown. To serve, separate into rolls.

Description: 
This recipe for 'melt in your mouth' rolls was given to me over 40 years ago when we lived in the South. My family has been known to devour them as soon as they come out of the oven! Dividing the dough into rolls in the pan is a time-saver.
