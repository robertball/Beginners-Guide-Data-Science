4 large, ripe beefsteak tomatoes, peeled (if desired) and cored
4 very large cloves of garlic, peeled
6 large basil leaves, slivered
6 grindings of fresh black pepper
1 t salt
2/3 C fruity, EVOO
1 # pasta
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (if desired), for serving

Directions:
Chop tomatoes coarsely, about 1/2 inch. Place tomatoes and all juices in a large bowl.
Smash garlic with side of knife if you intend to remove it from the sauce before serving. (For a more intense garlic flavor, leave the garlic in the sauce, but mince 2 of the 4 cloves.) Add all the garlic, half of the basil and the salt and pepper to the chopped tomatoes. Stir in the oil. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 8-10 hrs., stirring occ.
Before serving, cook the pasta in a large pot of salted water until al dente, 10-12 min. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/3 cup of cooking water. Return the pasta to the pot and toss with the reserved water. Divide the pasta among 6 shallow bowls. Remove garlic from the tomato sauce, if desired, and ladle sauce over the pasta. Sprinkle with the remaining slivered basil. Serve immed. w/grated Parm., if desired

Description: 
Use only the ripest tomatoes. Serve over bucatini or perciatelli (both are thick, hollow noodles). Never heard of these noodle, so I'll try spaghetti or penne pasta.
