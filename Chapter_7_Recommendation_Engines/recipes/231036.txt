Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 1/2 teaspoons margarine
1/4 cup chopped onion
3 cups chopped cooked chicken
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 teaspoon celery salt
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Transfer to a large bowl.
Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted margarine until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes; add to the spaghetti along with chicken, evaporated milk, cream of chicken soup, 4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, celery salt, salt, and black pepper. Toss mixture to evenly mix; transfer to prepared dish. Sprinkle 4 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese over spaghetti mixture.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and mixture is bubbling, about 45 minutes.
