Description: 
The reason I'm calling this salsa verde and not pesto is because whenever you say pesto, people instantly think of the traditional version with the pine nuts and basil. I'm using the term salsa verde the way it's used around northern California. It's a very generic term for any fresh green sauce, usually starring some type of herb, but also can be made with spinach, arugula, etc.
