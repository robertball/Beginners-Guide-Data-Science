Ingredients:
2 pounds ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food, cut into thin slices
2 (26 ounce) cans marinara sauce
2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce
3/4 cup water
20 (10 inch) flour tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until beef is evenly brown and onion is tender. Drain grease. Mix in soup, and continue cooking until heated through.
In a bowl, mix the marinara sauce, tomato sauce, and water. Spread 1/3 of the mixture across the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan. Fill each tortilla with about 2 tablespoons beef mixture and 2 slices cheese food (reserving enough cheese food slices for topping). Tightly roll each tortilla. Arrange tortillas in the pan in 2 layers, and cover completely with the remaining sauce mixture. Top with remaining cheese food.
Cover with aluminum foil, and bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly.
