1 pound fettuccine pasta
2 tablespoon butter
1 pound cooked shrimp - peeled and deveined
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups half-and-half
12 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
In a large skillet, saute shrimp and garlic in the butter for about one minute. Pour in half and half; stir.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese in one tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly.  After all Parmesan is added, mix in parsley and salt.  Stir frequently making sure it does not boil.  Sauce will take a while to thicken.
When sauce has thickened, combine with cooked pasta noodles; serve hot.
