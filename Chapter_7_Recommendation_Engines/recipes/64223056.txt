Ingredients:
1cup white whole wheat flour
1/2 cup old fashioned oats, whirred in a food processor till they're the consistency of flour
1/4cup wheat germ
1/4cup toasted walnuts or pecans, chopped fine
1tablespoon baking powder
1/2teaspoon kosher salt
1tablespoon sugar
1 ripe banana, pureed into liquid
2 large eggs
1 1/2cups milk
1teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Heat your oven to 200 (for holding the pancakes). In a large bowl, mix together the flour, oats, wheat germ, nuts, baking powder, salt and sugar.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the liquified banana, milk and vanilla extract, and beat the eggs into the mixture till fully blended. Pour into the dry ingredients and fold gently till just blended. Add a little more milk if the batter seems thick. Let the batter sit while you and heat a griddle or large frying pan (I use a non-stick pan) over medium low heat.
3. Melt about a teaspoon of butter in the pan. When the foam subsides, ladle in the batter, making the pancakes any size you like. Adjust the heat so that the bottom browns in 2-4 minutes. Flip when they're cooked on the bottom and cook the other side.
4. Serve immediately or hold in the warm oven till all pancakes are cooked. Harry likes his with maple syrup. I prefer mine with piles of confectioner's sugar. The kids like strawberry jam. Your choice.
