Ingredients:
19 ice cream sandwiches
1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping
1 cup salted peanuts

Directions:
Cut one ice cream sandwich in half. Place one whole and one half sandwich along a short side of an ungreased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. Arrange eight sandwiches in opposite direction in the pan.  Spread with half of the whipped topping.  Spoon fudge topping by teaspoonfuls onto whipped topping. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup peanuts.  Repeat layers with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping and peanuts (pan will be full).
Cover and freeze for up to 2 months. Remove from the freezer 20 minutes before serving. Cut into squares.

Description: 
No one will believe this awesome dessert is just dressed-up ice cream sandwiches. 'For my son's birthday party, I decorated it with race cars and checkered flags because he's a big racing fan,' recalls Jody Koerber of Caledonia, Wisconsin. 'It was a huge success!'
