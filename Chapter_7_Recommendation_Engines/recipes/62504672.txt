• 3 cloves garlic, minced
• 4 Tbsp lime and/or lemon juice (see footnotes)
• 1 tsp Salt
• 1 tsp Freshly ground black pepper
• 2 Tbsp dendê oil (palm oil)
• 1 medium yellow onion, sliced & separated
• 1 tsp crushed red pepper
• 1 small yellow bell pepper, seeded, de-stemmed, & sliced (discard ends)
• 1 small orange bell pepper, seeded, de-stemmed, & sliced (discard ends)
• 4 medium-large roma tomatoes, 1 chopped, 3 sliced
• 1/2 cup green onion/scallions, chopped
• 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped, with some set aside for garnish
• 1 14-ounce can coconut milk
RICE:
• 2 1/2 cups long grain white rice
• 1 medium-large yellow onion coarsely chopped
• 1 clove garlic
• 2 1/2 Tbsp butter
• 3 1/8 cups water
• 2 tsp salt

Directions:
Place fish or other seafood in a dish & coat with lemon and/or lime juice, garlic, half of the salt, & half of the black pepper. Mix to coat completely. Cover & chill while preparing the moqueca.
Start the rice. Simply mix all ingredients in a large sauce pan or rice cooker & simmer covered for about 15 minutes until water is absorbed.
In a large coverable pan or Dutch oven, heat the dendê oil over medium heat & add the onion. Sauté until onion just begins to soften.  Add bell pepper and crushed red pepper. Continue to sauté until peppers are heated through. Add tomatoes & green onions. Reduce heat to low & let simmer for 5 minutes. Add cilantro & remaining halves of salt & black pepper.
Gently remove half of the veggies to a dish & spread those remaining in the pan to evenly cover the bottom. Spread the fish or other seafood over the bed of veggies. Top with the rest of the veggies & pour on the coconut milk.
Bring to a simmer, reduce to low and cook for 15 minutes without stirring. Adjust seasonings to taste, garnish with cilantro & serve over rice.

Description: 
Moqueca baiana is a rich seafood stew from Brazil, reminiscent of a mild curry but not made from a spice paste base. This recipe is for the Afro-Brazilian version of moqueca from the state of Bahia. There’s also moqueca capixaba from Espírito Santo which uses tomato purée & annotto, lacking the African influence by omitting the coconut milk & dendê oil (palm oil). Dendê oil is the key ingredient in this recipe. If you can't find it locally any red palm oil will suffice or you can order it online.
