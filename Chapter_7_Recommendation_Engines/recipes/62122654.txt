Description: 
I love this site's recipe for bacon wrapped smokies / brown sugar smokies.  One of the recipe reviewers suggests a dipping sauce that consists of mayo, brown sugar and chili sauce, I didn't have any chili sauce on hand, so I substituted with regular BBQ sauce, with this as the result.  Amount of ingredients is approximate, measure to your own taste.
