Ingredients:
8 ounces spaghetti, uncooked
1 whole zucchini, sliced
1 whole red bell pepper, sliced
1 1/2 cups sliced carrots
1 lb. raw shrimp, peeled & deveined
2 tbsps. reduced fat peanut butter
1 tbsp. honey
2 tbsps. soy sauce
1 tsp. chili oil
1 tsp. sesame oil
1 tsp. fresh ginger, grated
1 tsp. minced garlic
1 green onion, chopped
2 tbsps. sesame seeds

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.  Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil.  Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.  Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
Heat a frypan over medium heat.  Spray with cooking spray and saut√© zucchini and bell pepper until slightly softened.  Add shrimp and continue cooking until all is cooked/heated through.
Melt the peanut butter in a large microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl, 15-20 seconds.  Whisk the honey, tamari and chili sauce into the peanut butter, then stir in the sesame oil and ginger. Mix in the garlic and green onions and toss with the spaghetti, shrimp and vegetables.  Top with the sesame seeds.
Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
