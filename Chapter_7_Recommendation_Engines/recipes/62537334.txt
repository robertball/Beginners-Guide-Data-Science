Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 - 2 lbs blade steak or cheap roast  cubed
1/4 cup of Flour
1 - 2 envelopes or cubes of Beef boullion
6 cups of water
2 medium onions - quartered (set one aside)
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tsp Worchestershire Sauce
2 tsp ground sage
1 tbsp fresh cracked black pepper
2 tsp salt (optional)
1/2 to 1 can of beer (optional, but delicious)
1 medium sized turnip - diced
3 large carrots - thickly sliced
3 - 4 large potatoes, cubed
Sauce thickener

Directions:
Heat oil in a large stock pot, meanwhile dredge beef cubes in the flour.  Shake excess flour and cook in oil until evenly browned on the outside (don't need to cook all the way through)
Add 6 cups of water (or more to cover beef by an inch), boullion, one quartered onion, garlic, Worchestershire sauce, sage, black pepper, salt and beer.
Bring to a boil.  Then cover, and simmer at minimum heat for 2 - 3 hours until meat is fork tender.
Add extra water to make up what was lost.
Add Carrots and Turnip and cook until tender crisp, then add the last quartered onion and potatoes.  Cook completely until potatoes are cooked through.
Add sauce thickener to desired thickness.
