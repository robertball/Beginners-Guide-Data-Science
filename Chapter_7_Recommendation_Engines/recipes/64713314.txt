Ingredients:
1 pound split green peas (or navy beans)
3 pork hocks (or leftover ham bone with meat)
1 pound kielbasa (smoked sausage)
2 ribs celery sliced thin
2 medium onions sliced thin
4 scallions sliced thin
2 parsley sprigs (or parsley flakes)
1/4 pound salt pork chopped fine (or thick-cut bacon)
2 teaspoons salt
1 bay leaf

Directions:
1. Rinse peas (beans) in a colander, drain. In 8-quart kettle, combine ham hocks (ham bone) with 3 quarts water. Pour peas (beans) over top and bring to a boil. Simmer, covered for 45 minutes.
2. Wash celery then slice diagonally 1/4-inch thick. Slice onions and scallions. In a skillet over medium heat, saute salt pork (thick-cut bacon) until crisp. Add celery, onions, and scallions to salt pork (bacon) and saute until onions are golden.
3. Add sauteed mixture to peas (beans). Add parsley, salt, and bay leaf. Bring to boil, then simmer, covered, for 2 hours.
4. Remove meat and allow to cool. Remove skin and excess fat. Cut up meat. Cut kielbasa (smoked sausage) at 1-inch intervals about half of the way through. Add kielbasa and meat. Simmer, covered, for 30-40 minutes.
5. Remove kielbasa and cut into 1/8-inch slices. Remove bay leaf and stir in kielbasa slices.  If soup is too thick, add water to preferred consistency.

Description: 
This recipe has long been a staple of autumn and winter days in my family. Also works well as a bean soup by substituting navy beans.
