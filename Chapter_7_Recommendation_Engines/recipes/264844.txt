Ingredients:
2 slices fresh peach, plus more for garnish
4 sprigs fresh mint, plus more for garnish
2 teaspoons turbinado sugar
1 1/2 fluid ounces rye whiskey
2 dashes bitters (such as AngosturaÂ®)
1 1/2 cups crushed ice

Directions:
In a silver julep cup or old-fashioned glass, muddle peach, mint, and sugar until peach is well smashed and sugar is dissolved. Add rye whiskey, bitters, and 1 cup crushed ice. Stir until well chilled. Mound glass with remaining 1/2 cup ice. Garnish with additional mint and a peach slice.

Description: 
Crushed ice, and plenty of it, is key to the julep and other smashes. It's what, in pre-freezer days, made this 
cocktail style seem so very indulgent.
