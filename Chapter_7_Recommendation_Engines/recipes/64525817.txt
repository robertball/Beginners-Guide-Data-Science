Description: 
My mom gets credit for making this recipe up a few years ago. It's been a favorite ever since! Quick and easy to make, hearty and actually pretty healthy, you can make it as a soup or use less broth and it has more of a chili consistency.  You can also make it in one big pot for less cleanup!
