Ingredients:
FOR THE CHEESECAKE
8 oz Cream cheese (room Temperature)
1/2 cup sugar
3 Large Eggs (room temperature)
4 Ounces sour cream (1/2 Cup)
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice
salt
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon fruit preserves or jam
FOR THE GRAHAM TOPPING
1/2 cup of freshly ground graham crackers (approx 4 Crackers)
1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted.

Directions:
preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Make the cheesecakes. Beat cream cheese with a mixer on medium speed until smooth.  Add sugar.  Beat on medium speed for 3 more minutes.  Reduce speed to low.  Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition.  Raise speed to medium.  Add sour cream, lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Beat for 3 minutes.
Divide better among six 6-ounce jars, filling each two thirds full.  Transfer jars to a deep baking dish, add enough boiling water to the dish to reach halfway up the sides of the jars.  Cover dish with foil, cut 8 slits in the top to vent.  Bake until set in the center about 25 minutes.  Let cool.  Refrigerate overnight to set.
Meanwhile make the graham topping, stir together graham cracker crumbs and butter.  Bake on a parchment lined baking sheet for 10 minutes.  Let cool.
Top each cheese with jam or preserve.  Followed by graham topping.
