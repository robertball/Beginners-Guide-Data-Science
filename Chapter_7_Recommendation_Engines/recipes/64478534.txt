Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 green pepper, sliced
1 onion, cut into rings
1 head of broccoli, chopped into florets
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup water
2 summer squash, quartered and sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
Salt and pepper to taste.

Directions:
Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
When the oil shimmers, add the green peppers and a pinch of salt. Saute until slightly soft, about 5 minutes.
Add the onion and a pinch of salt. Turn heat to medium-low. Saute until translucent and brown, 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour water in a large microwave-safe bowl, and add broccoli and mushrooms. Microwave on high for 2:30, drain, put into a bowl, and add the squash and garlic on top.
When the onion is done, turn heat back up to medium, add the rest of the vegetables. Saute until the zucchini is crisp-tender, 3-5 minutes. Taste for seasoning, add salt, pepper, and fresh herbs if you've got 'em.

Description: 
The key to a good skillet medley is to accept that every vegetable cooks to the beat of a different timer. You'll feel a bit like a one-armed paperhanger with this recipe, but the veggie perfection is worth it.
