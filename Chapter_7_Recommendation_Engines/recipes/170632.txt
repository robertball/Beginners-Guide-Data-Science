Ingredients:
1 cup fresh, fragrant rose petals
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 1/2 cups white sugar
1 (1.75 ounce) package dry pectin
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
In food processor or blender, process rose petals, lemon juice and 3/4 cup water. Slowly add sugar until thoroughly blended. Pour mixture into large bowl (a large mixing bowl with pouring spout is ideal). Set aside.
Combine pectin and 3/4 cup water in small saucepan. Stir to dissolve and bring to a boil. Allow pectin to boil hard for one minute.
Pour pectin over the rose petal mixture and stir. This will start to set very quickly. Spoon or pour mixture into clean containers and refrigerate. It will continue to set as it cools.

Description: 
Rose petal jam can be made with any organically grown unsprayed fragrant roses. I used the Cecile Brunner which made a pale pink jam. My neighbor spiced things up, so to speak, by adding a few Mr. Lincoln petals for a richer, dark pink color.
