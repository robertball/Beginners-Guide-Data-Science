Ingredients:
6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
6 ounces tomato basil feta cheese, crumbled
1-1/2 oz. Sun Dried Tomatoes chopped
1/4 cup Italian-style dry bread crumbs, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
Place chicken breasts between 2 pieces of  waxed paper. Gently pound chicken with flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4 inch thick; remove wax paper. Mix the feta and sun dried tomatoes together. Place 2 ounce of feta cheese mixture in the center of each chicken breast, and fold in half.
Spread 2 tablespoons bread crumbs in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange chicken in the dish, and top with remaining bread crumbs.
Bake 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.
