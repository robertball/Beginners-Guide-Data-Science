Description: 
Rice tossed with dried fruit, nuts, orange zest and green onions. It's very colorful and very tasty. You can use lemon or orange zest, raisins or dried cranberries, and any kind of nut you prefer. It's a recipe that's easy to mold to your tastes. The way I wrote it here is my favorite combination and always a hit with guests.
