Ingredients:
1 bunch asparagus, trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8 slices crisply cooked bacon, crumbled
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Pour olive oil into a resealable plastic bag; season with salt and pepper. Add asparagus, seal the bag, and shake bag to coat asparagus with the oil.
Remove asparagus from the oil and shake to remove excess. Discard the remaining oil. Arrange asparagus onto the prepared baking sheet.
Roast asparagus in preheated oven until tender, about 10 minutes.
Transfer asparagus to a serving platter; sprinkle bacon and feta cheese over the asparagus.

Description: 
My two favorite things combined: asparagus and bacon. The saltiness of the bacon is a perfect compliment to the asparagus, and the feta melts over the top of the asparagus. Delicious!
