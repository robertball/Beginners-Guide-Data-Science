Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
In a bowl mix the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the shortening until the mixture has only pea sized lumps. Add milk and mix until dry mixture is absorbed. Drop dough by heaping spoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
