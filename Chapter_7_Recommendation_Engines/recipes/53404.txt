Ingredients:
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup red wine
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 pinch dried rosemary, crushed
1 pinch hot chili powder (optional)
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1 pound flank steak

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the honey, soy sauce, and red wine. Stir in garlic, rosemary, chili powder, and pepper. Let stand for 15 minutes to blend the flavors.
Place the marinade and the steak into a large resealable plastic bag. Press out most of the air, seal, and lay flat in the refrigerator. Refrigerate for 24 hours, turning once halfway through.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Brush grill grate with oil. Discard marinade, and grill the flank steak for 7 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing very thinly against the grain.

Description: 
You HAVE to let this steak sit overnight. Don't bother making it if you can't put in the time, because the payoff is worth it. This staple in our household is a favorite of all who try it! You can BBQ in summer or broil in the winter for a perfect, filling meal. I like corn on the cob and some sort of rice to complement this mouth watering steak.
