Ingredients:
4 hot dogs
4 slices American cheese
4 (6 inch) flour tortillas
2 tablespoons ketchup, or to taste
2 tablespoons mustard, or to taste

Directions:
Place hot dogs in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Cook, turning occasionally, until cooked on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Place 1 slice of American cheese in the middle of each tortilla. Place cooked hot dogs over the cheese slices. Roll up tortillas around the filling.
Place all 4 roll-ups on a microwave-safe plate. Cook in the microwave for 10 to 12 seconds to fully melt the cheese and warm the tortillas. Drizzle ketchup and mustard over the roll-ups.
