Ingredients:
1/2 medium red onion, minced
3 tablespoons lime juice
2 large fresh peaches - peeled, pitted, and diced
1/2 cup cucamelons, thinly sliced
4 sprigs fresh cilantro, chopped
1 green chile pepper, seeded and minced (optional)
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Combine onion and lime juice in a bowl and marinate for 15 minutes.
Add peaches, cucamelons, cilantro, chile pepper, chili powder and salt to the bowl with the onion. Stir to combine. Chill until serving.

Description: 
The tiny cucamelons are fantastic in salsa. I don't make the salsa spicy, but you can up the heat by adding a jalapeno chile. Marinating the onion in lime juice gets rid of the strong raw onion taste, which I dislike.
