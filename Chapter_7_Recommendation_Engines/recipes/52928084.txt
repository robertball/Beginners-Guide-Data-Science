Title:
Healthy Turkey Sausage Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
2 pounds ground turkey
1 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 Tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 teaspoons ground black pepper
2 teaspoon thyme
1-2 Tablespoon Maple syrup

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients until well blended.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Form the turkey sausage into patties, and fry until browned on both sides, and no longer pink in the center. This should take about 15 minutes.
Freezer friendly: I keep a couple pounds pre-cooked in the freezer (crumbled) to easily throw in sauces, pizza, etc. I also keep a bag of balls in the freezer, which can easily be pulled out individually, thawed, and flattened into patties. Use a cookie scooper to quickly make balls, freeze them first on wax paper, then store them in a freezer bag.

Description: 
I don't think I'll ever buy sausage again! This tastes just like store-bought sausage, but using ground turkey, it is MUCH healthier. I have used this in spaghetti sauce, on pizza, and as patties. Costco sells 4-packs of ground turkey for really cheap! Freezer friendly.Modified from: Mom's Turkey Sausage Patties
