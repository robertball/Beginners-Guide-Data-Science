Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) can Pillsbury® refrigerated crescent dinner rolls
1 (8 ounce) round natural Brie cheese
1 egg, beaten
48 water crackers or baguette French bread slices

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Unroll dough and separate crosswise into 2 sections; press dough into 2 squares, firmly pressing perforations to seal. Place cheese round on center of 1 dough square.
With small cookie or canape cutter, cut 1 shape from each corner of remaining dough square; set cutouts aside. Place remaining dough square on top of cheese round. Press dough evenly around cheese, folding bottom edges over top edges; press to seal completely. Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Brush dough with egg.  Top with cutouts; brush with egg.
Bake 20 to 24 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from cookie sheet; place on serving plate. Cool 15 minutes. Serve warm with crackers.
