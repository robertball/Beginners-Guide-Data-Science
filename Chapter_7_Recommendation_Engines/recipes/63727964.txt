Ingredients:
Large ham  bone in ( I used a 7.27 lb butt section)
About 1 cup brown sugar
1 cup pineapple juice
Pinch of ginger
Pinch of cloves
½ cup butter or margarine melted

Directions:
*Preparing The Ham*
Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit
To prepare the ham, place in a large pan and score the ham
Mix the butter, ¼ cup of brown sugar and ¼ cup of pineapple juice.
Inject the mixture into the ham, pouring any remaining liquid over the ham
Pour an additional ½ cup of pineapple juice into the pan, and add about 1 cup of water.
Rub a handful of brown sugar onto the ham
Bake the ham on 325 for 20 minutes per pound
Brush the glaze onto the ham, and bake an additional 30 minutes, brushing more glaze on every 10 minutes.
Allow the ham to sit 10-15 minutes before slicing
*Preparing the glaze*
Mix the remaining pineapple juice, ½ cup of brown sugar, and the ginger and cloves in a small pan. Cook on medium until the mixture comes to a boil, then simmer about 10 minutes until the mixture reduces and turns a dark brown color.

Description: 
This is a recipe that I have adapted to my liking through trial and error. It makes a sweet ham with a nice brown sugar crust. I serve it with asparagus and potato salad or mashed potatoes.
