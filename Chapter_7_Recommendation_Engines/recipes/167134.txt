Ingredients:
12 eggs, beaten
1/4 cup softened butter
6 croissants, split
12 slices smoked ham
6 slices Colby-Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Pour the beaten eggs into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until they set and are no longer runny, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove, allow to cool, and cut into 6 portions.
Butter the cut sides of the croissants and place one portion of the cooked egg onto each croissant bottom. Top each sandwich with two slices of ham and a slice of Colby-Jack cheese. Place the croissant tops on top of the sandwiches; wrap each sandwich well with plastic wrap. Place the sandwiches onto a baking sheet; freeze until solid, about 3 hours. Store frozen.
To reheat, cook a wrapped sandwich in a microwave on High until hot in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
Easy baked egg breakfast sandwiches. Another frugal recipe that can be made ahead and frozen, then microwaved for fast breakfasts on the run. Try using other cheeses for extra flavor. I used Colby-Jack Slices. My boys loved this recipe!
