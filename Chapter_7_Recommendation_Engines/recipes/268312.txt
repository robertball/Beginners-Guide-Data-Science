Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3/4 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 shallot, minced
1 sprig fresh thyme, chopped
1 tablespoon curry powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
oil for frying

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook beef, onion, shallot, and thyme until meat is brown throughout and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Season with curry powder, salt, and pepper.
Lay a sheet of phyllo dough on a work surface and cut it lengthways into thirds. Add a spoonful of meat mixture at the top of each strip and fold into triangles, pressing samosa edges together with moistened fingers. Continue with remaining meat mixture.
Heat oil in a deep fryer or skillet to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Deep fry samosas in batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes each.
