Ingredients:
FILLING:
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
2 stalks celery, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
1 small onion, minced
1/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 cup chicken broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup, undiluted
4 cups cooked, cubed chicken or turkey
CRUST:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup milk
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
In a skillet, melt butter; saute celery, carrots and onion until soft. Stir in flour and salt. Gradually add milk and broth, stirring constantly until sauce thickens. Fold in mushroom soup and chicken or turkey. Spoon mixture into 9-in. x 13-in. baking pan; set aside.
For crust, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Cut butter into flour mixture. Add milk and mix to form soft dough. Roll out to a 12-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Sprinkle with cheese and roll up, jelly-roll style, starting from long side. Slice into 1/2-in wheels and place on chicken mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.

Description: 
This recipe came from our County Extension Agent's wife, who was a wonderful cook. Everyone always asks for the recipe when I make it because the ingredients are a little different than those in most chicken pies.
