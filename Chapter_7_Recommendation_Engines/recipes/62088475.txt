Ingredients:
1 lb fresh shrip/prawn tails
1 cup mayonnaise
6 tbsp ketchup
4 drops (or more) tobasco
1 orange
1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice (from the orange)
6 large lettuce leaves

Directions:
Rinse the shrimp tails under cold running water.
Fill a large pan wtih 2 quarts (2 litres) salted water and bring to a boil. Plunge the shrimp tails into the water and drain after 2 minutes. Let cool to lukewarm.
In a serving bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, ketchup, and tobasco.
Rinse the orange and grate the zest into fine julienne strips with a grater, then squeeze 1/2 cup juice from the fruit and add it to the cocktail sauce.
Mix the peeled shrimp tails into the sauce.
Rince the lettuce leaves and dry in a salad spinner.
Arrange a lettuce leaf in each of 6 ramekins. Do not worry if the leaves overlap the sides of the ramekins, this makes the presentation more attractive.
Divide the shrimp coctail equally between the ramekins and garnish with a few strips of orange zest.
Refrigerate for 5 minutes, and serve immediately.

Description: 
You can make this light by using low fat or no fat mayonnaise. Dont use miracle whip though, it will give it a funny taste.... use the real stuff! You can also cut the prep time down by using frozen, cooked shrimp instead of fresh.
