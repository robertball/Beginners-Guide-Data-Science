Ingredients:
2 large eggs
1 cup milk or milk substitute
1 TBSP vegetable oil
1/2 cup gluten free all purpose flour
3 Tbsp buckwheat flour

Directions:
Mix the wet ingredients in a medium size bowl.
Sift the flour into the egg mixture sprinkling it a little at a time.  Stir constantly.
The batter should be very liquid, much more than a pancake or waffle batter. The batter should not coat the back of the spoon.
Heat an 8-inch skillet or crepe pan over med-high heat.
Pour 1/4 cup of the batter in the middle of the skillet and swirl it around until it covers the entire bottm of the skillet or use a crepe pan.
Cook the crepe for about a minute or so, until it is no longer moist on top.
Use a super thin spatular to loosen the edges, loosening in a circular motion until you arrive to the center and the whole crepe is free and loose.
Flip the crepe and cook it another 15 seconds or so, just until golden.
Place on a cooling rack or serve immediately.
Repeat with the remaining batter mixing with a whisk before using.
