Ingredients:
1 box (16-oz.) gingerbread cake and cookie mix
2 large eggs
2/3 cup(s) (packed) brown sugar
1/2 cup(s) orange juice
1/4 cup(s) (4 Tbsp.) unsalted butter or margarine
1 1/2 teaspoon(s) (grated) orange zest
Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for garnish, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
In ungreased 8-inch square (2-quart) glass baking dish, stir gingerbread mix, 1 cup water, and egg together with a fork until blended. Keep stirring vigorously about 2 minutes more, scraping corners frequently, until well mixed.
Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over batter.
In 2-quart saucepan, warm orange juice, butter, and 1/2 cup water over high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture is hot and butter melts.
Stir orange zest into the orange juice mixture.
Slowly pour orange juice mixture over cake batter and brown sugar (some batter will rise to top).
Bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean (bottom pudding layer will still be moist).
Remove from oven carefully, as cake is floating on top of pudding layer (top of baked cake will have cracks).
Cool 30 minutes on wire rack. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
