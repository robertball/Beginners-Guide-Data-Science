Ingredients:
2 oranges, 1 sliced into rounds
1/3 onion, thinly sliced
olive oil
2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
3/4 tablespoon lemon pepper
1 teaspoons garlic powder
1/2 T Italian seasoning
Juice of 1 orange
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a small bowl or cup, stir together the lemon pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.  Place the slices from one of the oranges in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of onion slices over the orange. Drizzle with a little bit of olive oil, and sprinkle with half of the herb mixture.
Place the dish in the preheated oven, and roast for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are browned and tender. Remove the dish from the oven, and increase the temperature to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Push the onion and orange slices to the outer edge of the baking dish, and place the salmon fillets in the center.  Deskin the filet.   Season with the remaining half of the herb mixture (sprinkle over the top of the salmon).  Squeeze the orange juice over the salmon  and drizzle the barest amount of maple syrup over the salmon.
Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the salmon is opaque in center.  ( probably closer to 15 minutes for a 12 oz section).

Description: 
Salmon is simple to prepare, yet easy to serve as a meal for guests.  I made roasted vegetables and put the salmon in the oven so both dishes were done at the same time.Modified from: Orange Roasted Salmon
