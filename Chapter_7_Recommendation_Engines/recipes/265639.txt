Ingredients:
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed
coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 lemon, juiced
2 zucchini, sliced lengthwise
9 ounces ricotta cheese
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Directions:
Pour about 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a large, shallow dish and season with salt and a dash of lemon juice. Layer zucchini slices closely together in the dish and brush with more olive oil. Sprinkle with additional salt and lemon juice. Repeat with remaining zucchini, olive oil, salt, and lemon juice. Set aside to marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.
Combine ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a bowl; mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
Drain zucchini from marinade, using your fingers to remove excess oil and salt. Transfer 1 zucchini slice to a cutting board. Spoon 1 teaspoon of ricotta mixture onto the top edge and roll up. Arrange on a serving plate, stuffed side down. Repeat with remaining zucchini and filling; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
