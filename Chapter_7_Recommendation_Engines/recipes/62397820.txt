Ingredients:
8 ounces bacon
1 cup baking mix
2 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 eggs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Spray a 9 inch pie plate with non-stick cooking spray.
In a large bowl, beat together baking mix, 2 cups cheddar cheese, milk, maple syrup, brown sugar and eggs until only small lumps of cheese remain. Pour into prepared pie plate.
Bake in preheated oven for about 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of pancake comes out clean. Sprinkle bacon and remaining 1/2 cup cheese over top of pancake. Bake until cheese melts, about 3 to 5 minutes.
