Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and diced mango
1/2 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup, cilantro, chopped OR 1/4 cup parsley, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice
1 jalapeno pepper, roasted, peeled, and diced

Directions:
To prepare mango:
Place unpeeled ripe (but not mushy) mango on its end and slice down the sides removing the cheeks with a sharp knife.  Remember there is a large seed so don't attempt to cut down the middle.
Cut through the flesh of the mango with the tip of the knife...but not through the peel, making small cubes. You can then turn the mango 'inside out' and remove the cubed fruit into a bowl.
Stir in remaining ingredients and mix well.  This salsa can either be chilled or served room temperature.
***watermelon can be substituted for mango.
