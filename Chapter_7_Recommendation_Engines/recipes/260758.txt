Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white sugar, divided
1 cup softened butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon sea salt

1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until fluffy. Beat in eggs; add cream of tartar and baking soda. Beat in cocoa powder, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and cayenne powder. Beat in flour. Stir chocolate chips into the dough.

Roll heaping tablespoons of dough into balls. Roll balls in the sugar-cinnamon mixture and place on the prepared baking sheets.
