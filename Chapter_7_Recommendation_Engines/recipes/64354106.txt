Vegan Lasagna with Lemon Basil Cashew  "Cheese" Recipe

Ingredients:
454 g Box of lasagna noodles*
1.5 bottles of pasta sauce or use homemade marinara sauce
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 sweet onion, chopped (2.5 cups)
2 small zucchini, chopped
1 cup cremini mushrooms, sliced
1 large red pepper, chopped
1 large handful spinach
2 pre-cooked veggie burgers, crumbled (optional)
Lemon Basil "Cheese" Sauce (See my recipe box)
Daiya cheese (as much as desired)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400F. In a large skillet, saute onion and garlic over low-medium heat for 5 minutes. Now add in the rest of the veggies and saute for another 10-15 minutes. Season well with Herbamare or kosher salt and black pepper. This is key or you will have bland tasting vegetables in your lasagna.
Start boiling noodles 8 min if cooking, not necessary-just use raw and perhaps add a little extra water (1/2 cup) cook 15 min longer. Add 1 cup of pasta sauce on the bottom of your casserole dish. Add a layer of noodles, half the basil cheeze sauce, half the vegetables, more pasta sauce, another layer of noodles, veggie burger crumbles (optional), the rest of the cheese sauce, the rest of the vegetables, more pasta sauce, and finally a sprinkle of cheese.
4. Cover with tinfoil and prick with fork a few times. Bake at 400F for 40-45 minutes and then remove tinfoil and broil for 5 minutes on medium. Watch closely so you donâ€™t burn the edges. Remove and serve. Will keep in the fridge for at least 3-4 days.
