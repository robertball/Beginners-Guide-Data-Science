Ingredients:
3 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup coconut oil
2 cups grated zucchini flesh, remove seeds
1 tsp. vanilla
3 cups flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. or more cinnamon
1/4 tsp. baking powder
optional: 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, pecans and/or raisins

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ยบ.  Grease two 9 X 5 X 3" loaf pans.  Beat the eggs until light and foamy.  Add sugar, coconut oil, zucchini and vanilla and blend well.  Combine dry ingredients and add to the wet mixture.  Stir until well blended.  Add the optional ingredients if you desire.   Scoop the batter into loaf pans.  Bake for 70-80 mins.  It's best to let the bread sit in the pans for an hour or so, but it's hard to be patient and not slice it up and eat it right away!  Enjoy!
