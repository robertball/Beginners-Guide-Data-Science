Ingredients:
1 cup water
2/3 cup quinoa
5 carrots, diced
1/3 cup currants
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup green onions, chopped
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lime juice
1 teaspoon agave nectar
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let quinoa rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover the saucepan and cool to room temperature.
Stir quinoa, carrots, currants, mint, parsley, and green onions together in a bowl.
Combine olive oil, lime juice, agave nectar, cumin, and salt in a jar; seal the jar with a lid and shake vigorously until dressing is well-blended. Pour dressing over quinoa mixture and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
