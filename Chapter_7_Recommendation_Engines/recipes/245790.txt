Description: 
Radler means 'cyclist' in German, and this refreshing drink was invented in Germany in the late 19th or early 20th century as a way to refresh bicyclists worn out by the summer heat. It is a 50/50 or 60/40 mixture of beer and lemonade and is a delicious addition to the menu of your summer barbeque or party.
