Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
2 small onions, chopped
1 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 cup long grain white rice
2 cups water
1 tablespoon Creole seasoning
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 (15.5 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, drained

Directions:
Crumble the ground beef into a deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and green pepper. Cook and stir until beef is evenly browned. Drain the grease.
Add the rice and water to the pan, and season with Creole seasoning, pepper, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes, until the water is absorbed. About halfway through cooking the rice, stir in the black-eyed peas.

Description: 
An easy spicy dish. Adjust the spices to your needs - less Creole Seasoning if you like it mild, add chili powder or cayenne pepper for more kick! This is also good with salsa on top. You can substitute 1/2 pound dried black-eyed peas, cooked for the canned black-eyed peas if you wish.
