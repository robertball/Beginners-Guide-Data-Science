8 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate
1 cup chocolate covered creamy mints

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with aluminum foil or baking parchment.
Chop chocolates and mints.  Place the chocolates and mints in the top part of a double boiler over medium heat.  Stir occasionally until melted and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter until soft.  Add vanilla and sugar and mix well.  Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in the melted chocolate. Sift together the flour, cocoa, and baking soda.  Add to mixture and stir until well blended. Drop by tablespoon at least 2 inches apart on cookie sheets.
