Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can peaches, drained and chopped
4 cloves garlic, pressed
1 1/2 cups orange juice
2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 teaspoons dried basil
salt and pepper to taste
4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
2 tablespoons flour
3 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Bring peaches, garlic, orange juice, vinegar, sugar, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, and basil to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, season the chicken to taste with salt and pepper, then dust with flour and shake off the excess. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, and cook until lightly brown on both sides, but still pink in the center.
Season peach sauce with salt and pepper, and pour over browned chicken. Return the chicken to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes more until the chicken is no longer pink in the center.

Description: 
This was a recipe of my mom's that I manipulated in true Byrdhouse form.  Everyone loves this one, even the kids if you take it easy with the red pepper. I always serve this on broad, flat noodles.
