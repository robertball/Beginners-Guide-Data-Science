Description: 
I love cajun food and my favorite place to go in Kansas City is the Jazz on 39th st. I always tell myself I'm going to order something new each time I go, but I inevitably end up ordering Chicken a la Mer. The sauce is so delicious and can be served over practically any meat or pasta or it can be thickened slighty to make a great dip. This recipe is the closest I could come to actually duplicating their sauce. Enjoy!
