Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as Bisquick®)
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins
1/3 cup butter-flavored shortening (such as Crisco®)
3/4 cup milk
Frosting:
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk, or more as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Add oil to a skillet and place in the oven to heat.
Combine baking mix, sugar, cinnamon, and raisins in a medium-sized bowl and mix well. Cut in shortening using a fork until crumbly. Add milk until a soft dough form and mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
Knead dough on a floured surface until no longer sticky. Press dough out using fingers to 1/2-inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round cutter to cut out about 10 biscuits.
Remove skillet from the oven and place biscuits in the hot oil with sides touching.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
While biscuits bake, mix confectioners' sugar and milk together in a bowl. Frost biscuits while still warm and serve.

Description: 
If you are looking for a cinnamon-raisin biscuit that tastes like the pros, you have to try these amazing biscuits baked in an iron skillet. I've tried many other recipes but they didn't come close. I came up with this recipe myself and I must say there pretty darn close to the pros.
