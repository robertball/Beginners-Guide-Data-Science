Ingredients:
6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
1 pound thinly sliced deli ham
2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
3 cups chopped lettuce
1 medium tomato, seeded and diced
1/2 cup diced cucumber
2 tablespoons chopped green pepper
2 green onions, chopped
DRESSING:
3/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons milk
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/2 teaspoon celery seed

Directions:
On each tortilla, layer four slices of ham and 1/3 cup cheese; roll up and secure with toothpicks. Place in an ungreased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking pan. Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 14-16 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Meanwhile, combine the lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper and onions. In a small bowl, whisk the dressing ingredients. Unroll the tortillas halfway; top each with 1/3 cup lettuce mixture and 1 tablespoon dressing. Roll up again; serve immediately.

Description: 
I love to make these wraps when we have a busy week.  They're easy to put together...and my family gobbles them up. You can adapt the filling to use ingredients you have on hand or to suit your own tastes.
