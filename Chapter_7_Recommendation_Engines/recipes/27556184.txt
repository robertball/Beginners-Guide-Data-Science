Ingredients:
4 cups all purpose flour
2TBS. sugar
2 TBS. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
11 TBS. butter or margarine cold
1-1/4 cups milk, cold
Additional all-purpose flour
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped parsley or other fresh herbs

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425. Combine first 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Cut butter into 1/4" thick chunks; add flour mixture. Cut in butter with pastry blender or two knives until butter is broken into pea-size pieces. Make well in flour mixture; pour milk into well. Gently toss together with fork just until blended. Do not overwork dough.
Turn dough into lightly floured work surface. To knead dough, gently pat or roll into 1/2" thick rectangle; fold in half, adding more flour to work surface as needed to prevent sticking. Turn dough a 1/4 turn. Repeat kneading at least 5 times, then sprinkle dough with cheese and herbs. Continue kneading dough until it holds together and forms a soft dough.
Roll out dough to 1/2" thickness; cut out biscuits with 2" biscuit cutter. Place on lightly greased baking sheet, about 1/2" apart.
