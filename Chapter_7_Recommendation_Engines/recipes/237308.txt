Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup orange-cranberry muffin mix (such as Krusteaz®)
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoons butter, chilled and diced
1 apple, diced
1/3 cup sweetened dried cranberries (such as Craisins®)
3/4 cup half-and-half
1 egg
1 egg white
1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.
Whisk flour, muffin mix, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or fork until it resembles coarse crumbs.
Combine apple and dried cranberries together in a bowl; mix into flour mixture.
Beat half-and-half and egg together in a bowl until frothy; slowly stir into flour mixture using a rubber spatula until dough forms. Knead dough 4 to 5 times. Roll dough into a rectangle onto a lightly floured work surface using your hands. Cut rectangle in half diagonally and each half into 4 triangles, making 8 triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk egg white and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; brush over each triangle.
Bake in the preheated oven until scones are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
