Description: 
This is a traditonal Italian Cake made during Carnivale AND Easter. Some call it a Spongey Orange Cake but we think the texture is between that and a regular cake. It is by far my Husband's favorite cake of all time. I've topped it with Avon's Warm Orange Sauce which takes this dump-and-mix cake from GREAT to SPECTACULAR!
