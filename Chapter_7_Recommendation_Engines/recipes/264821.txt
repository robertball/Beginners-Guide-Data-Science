Description: 
Another twist on a new creation for tuna salad. I don't like olives, so there are none in my recipe, but other ingredients bring the Greek flavors to this tuna! Makes a generous portion for 2, or it can be divided up to make 3 or 4 smaller portions. Enjoy! Serve with pita chips if you like.
