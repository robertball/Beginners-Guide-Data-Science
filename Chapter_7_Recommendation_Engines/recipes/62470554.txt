Ingredients:
Ingredients:
2 lb. bag frozen shredded hash browns, thawed
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 C. vegetable oil
2 T. cold unsalted butter plus 1 C. unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces
3 T. lemon juice
2 T. lime juice
5 drops tabasco sauce
3 T. minced fresh chives
12 slices Canadian bacon, cooked until lightly browned and kept warm
12 poached eggs
hot sauce optional

Directions:
Directions:
In 10-inch fry pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Working in batches, form the thawed shredded potatoes into 1/4-cup patties and drop them into the oil. Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet and keep warm in a 250Â°F oven.
In a heavy bottomed saucepan over low heat, whisk egg yolks with the 2 T. cold butter and lemon and lime juices.
Continue to whisk until butter melts and mixture begins to thicken and coats back of a spoon. Immediately remove
pan from heat and begin adding room temperature butter, 1/4 C. at a time, returning pan to heat and whisking after
each addition until incorporated. Add tabasco and stir well. Sauce will thicken as you work. Final sauce is pale yellow
and silky with the consistency of a milk shake.
Place 2 hash brown patties on each plate. Top each patty with 1 slice of Canadian bacon, 1 poached egg and a spoonful of the hollandaise sauce. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.
Drizzle plate with hot sauce if desired for a nice kick.

Description: 
A spin on the classic eggs benedict, I like to serve mine on a bed of hash browns instead of the traditional english muffin.
