2 (9 inch) refrigerated pie crusts
3/4 cup shredded cheddar
2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

7 eggs

1 medium Granny Smith apple, cut into 1/4-inch slices

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line 10-inch quiche or pie pan with pie crust. Sprinkle sausage over bottom of crust. Beat eggs in medium bowl with wire whisk until light in color. Whisk in cheeses, chives and parsley, milk, salt and sugar until well blended. Carefully pour egg mixture over sausage layer; sprinkle with cayenne pepper, if desired. Arrange apple slices on top of quiche, pressing down slightly into egg mixture to coat apples. Bake 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F; bake 15 to 20 minutes more or until knife inserted into center comes out clean. Refrigerate leftovers.
