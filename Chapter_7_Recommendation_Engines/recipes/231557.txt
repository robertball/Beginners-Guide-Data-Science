Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 onion, diced
1 yellow bell pepper, diced
7 cloves garlic, minced
5 red potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
4 carrots, diced
1 zucchini, sliced and quartered
1 quart water, or as needed
4 cups salsa
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1 pinch chili powder
1 pinch ground paprika
1 head broccoli, cut into florets
1/2 cup frozen peas

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion, yellow bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add potatoes, carrots, zucchini, and enough water to cover mixture by 2 inches. Stir salsa into the mixture and add Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, bay leaves, chili powder, and paprika.
Cook soup over medium-low, maintaining a slight boil, until potatoes soften, about 40 minutes. Add broccoli and peas; cook until broccoli is tender, about 20 more minutes. Remove bay leaves.

Description: 
My mom makes a beef veggie stew that is similar to this, but I wanted something healthy, low sodium, and full of veggies! It is a great soup to eat on a cold winter night. I serve it by itself, but it would also be great with a side of French bread to dip in the broth!
