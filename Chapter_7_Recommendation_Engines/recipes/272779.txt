Ingredients:
Scones:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup lemon yogurt
1/4 cup melted butter
1 large egg
1 cup fresh blueberries
Glaze:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
Mix together lemon yogurt, butter, and egg in a separate bowl. Stir yogurt mixture into flour mixture until just moistened. Fold blueberries into mixture.
Drop batter by heaping tablespoons 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 18 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir together confectioners' sugar, lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest in a small bowl until glaze is smooth.
Drizzle glaze over warm scones and serve.
