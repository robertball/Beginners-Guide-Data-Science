Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground chuck
1 pkg. dry onion soup mix, I use Mrs. Grass
1/4 c. Townhouse crackers crumbs
1 egg, beaten
Sauce:
1 (14 oz.) bottle Heinz ketchup
10 oz. currant jelly
1/2 c. sweet wine, like Riesling, or Lambrusco

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix all together and make balls about the size of a silver dollar.  Place on a cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes, then turn them over and bake for another 10 minutes or until no longer pink inside.
Place meatballs in crock pot, mix sauce ingredients together, pour sauce over them and cook on low for 6 hours or longer.  Serve with toothpicks.
