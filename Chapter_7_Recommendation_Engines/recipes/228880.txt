Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons shortening
1/2 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture with a fork or pastry knife until crumbly texture. Add milk; mix until just combined.
Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until completely mixed, about 1 minute. Divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll or pat each piece into a 3/4-inch round. Cut each round into 4 pieces. Arrange pieces on a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.

Description: 
A hallmark of the Puyallup and Evergreen State Fairs in Washington State. Now you can make them at home any time of year. Just like at the fair, they are best served hot, with butter and raspberry jam.
