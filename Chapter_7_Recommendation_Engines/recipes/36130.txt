Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds new potatoes
2 pounds country style pork ribs, chopped
1/2 cup chopped onion
6 cups water, divided
2 (15 ounce) cans red beets, drained and chopped, juice reserved
2 cups sour cream
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add potatoes, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.
In another pot, simmer ribs and onions in 4 cups of water for 2 hours, or until ribs are tender. Remove ribs, and set aside. Skim fat from simmering liquid, and pour in beet juice. Add chopped pork and beets, and bring to a simmer.
In a bowl, whisk sour cream together with 2 cups of water and the vinegar. Slowly stir into soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over boiled potatoes.
