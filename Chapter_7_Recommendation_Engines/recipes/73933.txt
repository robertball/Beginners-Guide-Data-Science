In a large serving bowl, Stir together the eggs, green olives, dill and sweet pickle relishes, green onion, mayonnaise, yellow and brown mustards, and wine vinegar. Season with garlic powder, black pepper, white pepper, salt, celery seed, dill seed, and dill. Mix well, and stir in potatoes until coated. Chill for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.

Description: 
This is my potato salad I have created for many family gatherings. The olives and dill relish give it a twist from the typical bland salad. Everyone always brags on me about it. Enjoy!
