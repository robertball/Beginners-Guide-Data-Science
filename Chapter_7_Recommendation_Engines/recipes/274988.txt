Ingredients:
1 cup Medjool dates, pitted
1 cup hot water (optional)
1/2 cup shredded coconut
1 cup smoked and salted almonds
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a plate with parchment paper.
Put the dates in a small bowl and add enough boiling water to cover them. (Skip this step if dates are soft). Soak for 5 minutes, then drain.
Combine dates and coconut in the bowl of a food processor; pulse for 30 seconds or until dates are coarsely chopped. Add almonds, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Pulse until finely processed, about 15 seconds.
Scoop 1 tablespoon of the mixture and place on a sheet of plastic wrap. Protecting your fingertips with the plastic wrap, mold each scoop into a roll that is 3 inches long. Place rolls onto a plate lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 1 hour.
