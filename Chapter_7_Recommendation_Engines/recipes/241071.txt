Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups chicken broth
2 cups quinoa
1 cup halved grape tomatoes
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup sliced pitted kalamata olives
1/2 cup minced red onion
4 ounces chopped feta cheese, or more to taste
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemon, halved
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a large bowl and set aside to cool, about 10 minutes.
Mix tomatoes, parsley, kalamata olives, onion, feta cheese, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic into quinoa. Squeeze lemon juice over quinoa salad, season with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator, 1 to 4 hours.
