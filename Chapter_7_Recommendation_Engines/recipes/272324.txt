Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package pork rinds, crushed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon paprika
4 tablespoons avocado oil
1 egg
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
2 large chicken breasts, sliced in half
1 1/2 cups tomato sauce (such as Rao'sÂ®)
16 slices pepperoni
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Combine pork rinds, parsley, garlic powder, and paprika in a resealable plastic bag. Mix well and set aside.
Heat oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat.
Mix egg and cream together in a bowl to make a wash.
Dip 1 piece of chicken into the wash and then drop into the bag of pork rinds. Shake to coat completely and transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken. Put coated chicken into the hot oil in the skillet and cook until crispy and no longer pink inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
Remove skillet from heat and top each piece of chicken with 1/3 cup tomato sauce. Add 4 slices of pepperoni to each chicken and cover with mozzarella cheese.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil chicken in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and slightly browned, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
This is a chicken breast covered in cheese, pepperoni, and sauce. Very keto friendly and each piece is about 4 carbs depending on the sauce you use. Some people add a little bit of Parmesan cheese to the top as well to give a little extra flavor.
