3/4 cup buttermilk
2 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, packed
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or raspberry vinegar

Description: 
Thick, creamy and beautifully green, this easy blend makes a magnificent dressing as well as adding avocado's nutty flavor to a salad. You can replace the basil with parsley, oregano or even dill for a change in flavor. In addition to topping salad greens, try the dressing on burgers or steaks, over fish or poultry, or as a dip for fresh vegetable crudites. You may never go back to that bottle (of salad dressing) again.
