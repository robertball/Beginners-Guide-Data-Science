1 cup granulated sugar 200 g
1 egg lightly beaten, + 1 egg white
1 tsp vanilla extract 5 ml
1/4 tsp almond extract 1 ml, optional
3/4 cup buttermilk (or 3/4milk + 2 1/4 tsp vinegar stirred together and allowed to sit 5 minutes), 177 ml
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 281 g
2 tsp baking powder 10 g

Add lightly beaten egg, egg white, and vanilla and almond extracts. Stir well.
Add in buttermilk and stir until combined.
Stir in cranberries and white chocolate.
In separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.
Gradually, carefully add in flour mixture, stirring until just combined (there still may be some flour mixture visible, this is OK just do not over-mix)
Evenly divide into prepared muffin tin or mini loaf pan.
Bake on 350F for 20-25 minutes (until toothpick inserted in center comes out mostly clean with few crumbs).
Glaze
In micro-wave safe bowl, combine white chocolate chips and heavy cream. Microwave at 10 second intervals, stirring every 10 seconds until chocolate is melted and heavy cream and chocolate are combined.
Stir in powdered sugar.
