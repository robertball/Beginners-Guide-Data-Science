Description: 
This spinish and artichoke dip recipe was handed down to me by son's old sitter. My family has been making it the same way for about 17 years. She was famous by all who knew her for trying a recipe somewhere and being able to duplicate it. This was inspired by a dip in our favorite resturant, but is much better.
