Ingredients:
pork tenderloin
finely crushed pecans
applesauce
Dijon mustard (honey mustard might work too)
"at the golf course we made lots of tenderloin for weddings/tournaments and banquets-- equal parts applesauce- and dijon mustard-- slather well- pat on finely crushed pecans- wrap tightly in foil and grill- turn about every 10-15 minutes- time and amounts determined by the size of tenderloin- we usually served with a rocket salad- with pecans and feta- and a raspberry vinegarette- and a simple baked tater or scalloped"

Directions:
Wrap tightly in foil; place on grill turning every 10 minutes.
After taking off the grill let tenderloin sit to redistribute the juices in the meat before slicing.
