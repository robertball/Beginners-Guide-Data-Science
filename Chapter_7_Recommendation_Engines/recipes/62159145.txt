Ingredients:
1 pint fresh or frozen blueberries
juice of 1 small lime
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch (optional)

Directions:
In a small pan add blueberries, sugar, and lime juice. Mix and heat over medium low for about 20 minutes. The sugar will melt and liquify. When this happens, carefully use a potato masher to mash up 1/2 of your blueberries. Yes, you can do this if you are careful and slow when you mash. If you don't like this method you can always remove half the berries, mash 'em, and return to pan. You are also free to mash all your berries to a pulp. Very tasty served hot or cold.
