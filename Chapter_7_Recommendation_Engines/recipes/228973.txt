Ingredients:
1 cup fresh strawberries
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vanilla honey yogurt
3 tablespoons butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 cup chopped almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan.
Mix strawberries and 3 tablespoons brown sugar together in a bowl.
Mix flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a separate large bowl. Whisk yogurt, melted butter, vanilla extract, and egg in a third bowl. Stir yogurt mixture, alternating with milk, into flour mixture until just moistened. Spoon 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan; spread strawberry mixture evenly over batter. Top with remaining batter. Sprinkle almonds over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool in pan atop a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan before transferring cake to a serving platter.
