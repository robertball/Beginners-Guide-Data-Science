Ingredients:
1 (3 1/2-4 lb) whole chicken
1 tsp. seasoning salt
4-5 whole coves of garlic, peeled
Optional toppings: fresh herbs, such as rosemary, oregano, sage, basil, or tarragon

Directions:
Make 3 balls of aluminum foil about 2 inches in diameter. Place them in a triangular pattern on the bottom of your slow cooker. These balls hold the chicken off the bottom of the dish so the hot air can circulate all around the chicken and so the chicken isn't stewing in its own juices.
Slice garlic cloves lengthwise into thin slices and set aside.
Rinse chicken in cold water. Make sure to include the cavity and remove and discard any chicken parts inside the cavity. Pat dry with paper towels.
Place the chicken on a plate so it lies with the breast facing up and the legs on the plate. Loosen the skin of the entire chicken and gently separate the skin from the bird while keeping it attached around the edges. Use your hands to place the sliced garlic cloves under the skin.
Rub seasoning salt onto the skin of the chicken. Place chicken breast-up on the foil in the slow cooker. Cover with the lid, turn heat to low, and cook for 6-7 hours or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast registers 160 F.
