Ingredients:
Tools:
•Meat grinder
•Kitchen balance or scale
•Large bowl with 1 cup ice and 2 cups water
•Sheep casings or 21mm collagen casings (optional)
•Mortar and pestle (optional)
Ingredients:
•2 pounds trimmed pork butt, cubed into 1” pieces
•½ pound fat back, diced into 1/4-inch pieces*
•2 Tbsp. pure maple sugar**
•1 to 1 ½ tsp. rubbed sage, depending on age (start with 1 tsp. very lightly packed)***
•½ tsp. thyme, dried
•½ tsp. grated nutmeg
•2 tsp. kosher salt
•½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, fine grind
•1 Tbsp. water

Directions:
•Trim pork butt (same as Boston butt or Boston roast) of excess fat and cube into 1” pieces. Remember: if buying boneless, expect to lose about ¼ pound to excess fat. If it is bone-in, it is quite a bit of work to remove from the bone and you may need a 3 pound pork butt. You need 2 lbs. of trimmed pork but weighed out on the balance/scale. Do NOT use a pork shoulder picnic as it contains far too much connective tissue for this. While they are both parts of the shoulder, there is a large difference.
•Place the fatback on a cutting board, skin side down, and place a knife just above the skin. Cut to remove the skin from the fatback, and cube into ¼” pieces. This can be tricky as your hands start to melt the fat and make it slippery. If needed, place a potato masher in the freezer for 20 minutes and use that to hold down the fatback instead of your hand.
•Add maple sugar, sage, thyme, nutmeg, and salt. Toss until it is well distributed.
•Take all metal parts of your grinder that the meat will be in contact with and refrigerate until grinding time (the grinder body, auger, cutting knife, coarse grinding plate, hopper, etc.)
•Before grinding, place ice and water into a large bowl. This will be your ice bath that the bowl to catch the ground meat will sit in. Grind the meat using a coarse cutting plate.
•After grinding, mix in the 1 Tbsp. of water and let set overnight.
•Form patties. If you plan to stuff into sheep casings or 21mm collagen casings, follow the next step.
• Grind again, but on medium grinding plate, and refrigerate for 1 hour before stuffing.
