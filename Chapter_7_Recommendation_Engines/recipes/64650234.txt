Ingredients:
2/3 cup mayonnaise
1 TBSP vinegar
1 1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp celery seed
1/4 tsp salt
3 cups finely shredded green cabbage
1 cup finely shredded purple cabbage
1 cup finely shredded carrot
*You may substitute 1 lb. bagged shredded tri-color cabbage/coleslaw mix for the 2 types of cabbage and the carrot.  I find it is a wonderful time saver.

Directions:
Stir together mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, celery seeds, and salt in a large mixing bowl.
Combine green cabbage, red cabbage, and carrot in bowl; toss gently to coat.
Cover and chill at least 1 hour before serving.
