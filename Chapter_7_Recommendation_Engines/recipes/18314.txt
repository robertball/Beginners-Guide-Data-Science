Description: 
These green beans are nice and meaty, with a creamy sauce. My wife doesn't cook and is a little picky. She said she would only eat her mother's green beans so I got her recipe. For a variation on this recipe, mix in 1 cup sour cream with the other ingredients, or sprinkle 1 cup of your favorite shredded cheese over the top near the end of baking time
