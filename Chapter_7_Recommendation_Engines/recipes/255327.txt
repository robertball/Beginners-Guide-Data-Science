Ingredients:
4 cups chicken stock
2 cups rice
3 splashes soy sauce
2 tablespoons butter
cooking spray
2 pounds ground beef
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 eggs
1/4 cup Italian-style bread crumbs (such as ProgressoÂ®)
1/4 cup dehydrated onion flakes
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon whole milk, or to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 splash olive oil, or to taste
2 teaspoons beef bouillon powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/4 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon celery seed
1 cup pasta sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 splash soy sauce

Directions:
Bring chicken stock, rice, and 1 tablespoon butter to a boil in a pot; simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Add 1  tablespoon butter to rice and a few splashes soy sauce; stir.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (If using a countertop induction oven, preheat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) or use the Combo 2 function.) Spray a baking pan with cooking spray; place inside oven to warm.
Combine ground beef, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, bread crumbs, onion flakes, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, milk, brown sugar, onion powder, parsley, olive oil, beef bouillon powder, salt, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, and celery seed in a large bowl; mix until combined.
Form beef mixture into balls using a small ice cream scoop; arrange on warm prepared baking pan using heatproof gloves.
Bake in the preheated oven, turning meatballs 2 to 4 times, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes in the conventional oven and 8 to 10 minutes in the countertop induction oven. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Pour pasta sauce over meatballs. Top evenly with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese; splash with soy sauce.
Bake in the preheated oven until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce is warm, about 5 minutes.
Divide rice and meatballs evenly between serving plates.
