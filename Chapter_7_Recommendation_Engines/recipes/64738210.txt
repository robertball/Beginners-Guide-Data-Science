Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast
1 egg
1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
1 1/2 ounces pork rinds, crushed
1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 cup tomato sauce (Newman's)
1/4 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)

Directions:
Place oven rack about 6 inches from the the heat source.
Preheat the oven to broiler.
Slice chicken breast through the middle horizontally one side to within 1/2 inch of the other side.
Open the two sides and spread them out.
Pound chicken flat until about 1/2 inch thick.
Beat egg and cream together in a bowl.
Combine crushed pork rinds, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and Italian seasoning in shallow bowl and mix together well.
Dip chicken into egg mixture and coat completely.
Press chicken into breading, thickly coating both sides.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add ghee.
Place chicken in the pan and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 3 minutes per side.
Transfer chicken to a baking sheet.
Cover with tomato sauce and top with mozzarella cheese.
Broil until cheese is bubbling and barely browned, about 2 minutes.
