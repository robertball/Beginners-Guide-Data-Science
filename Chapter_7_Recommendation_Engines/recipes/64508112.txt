Ingredients:
1 cups scalded milk (cook over medium heat until it skins over)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup margarine or butter
1/2 tbsp salt
1 cups cold water
2 eggs
1 1/4 tbsp dry yeast
6 cups flour

Directions:
Scald the milk.  Add sugar, butter and salt to milk while still hot.
Sift flour into large bowl, making a "well".   Pour the milk mixture into the well, then add cold water.   Add eggs and dry yeast.   Mix all together.  Cover and let rise until light.
Divide the dough in half and roll one portion into a rectangular shape.  Brush generously with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and chopped nuts, raisins or coconut as desired.  Roll and slice.   Place in greased pans.  Cover and let rise again.   Bake 12-15 minutes at 375 degrees.   Ice while still warm.
