Ingredients:
1/3 cup margarine, melted
2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 pinch salt
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar
1 cup semisweet mini chocolate chips, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Line a 9x9 inch baking dish with aluminum foil, and set aside.
To make the cookie dough pieces, mix the melted margarine, brown sugar, and salt in a bowl. Stir in the flour to make a dough, and knead in 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. Form the dough into a disk about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick, place it on a sheet of plastic wrap, and then shape the disk into a square with your hands.
Place the square piece of dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes, until cold and stiff, and then slice it into 1/2 inch square pieces. Refrigerate the dough pieces while you make the cream cheese fudge.
Mix together the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar in a bowl until smooth, and stir in the melted chocolate chips and vanilla extract.
Lightly fold in the cookie dough pieces, and spread the candy out into the prepared dish. Refrigerate at least 1 hour, or until firm, and remove the candy from the foil-lined dish. Cut into squares, and serve.
