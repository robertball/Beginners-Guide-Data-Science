Ingredients:
2 cups almond flour
1/3 cup agave syrup
1/3 cup hazelnuts
1/2 cup medjool dates
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
Some hazelnuts for decoration

Directions:
Put the almond flour and agave syrup in a blender and blend for a couple of minutes until the mixture begins to form a ball on the blade (about 1-2 minutes, depending on your blender). You may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice. The marzipan is quite sticky. If you want it less sticky you can put it in the fridge for an hour before you continue.
Truffle...
Put all of the ingredients for the truffle in a blender and blend until you have a smooth texture.
How to make a marzipan roll...
You might find the marzipan needs to be refrigerated before it is firm enough to be rolled out.
Roll the marzipan into a long roll.
Use a rolling pin to roll the marzipan into a thin sheet.
Roll the truffle into a long roll and roll it into the marzipan sheet.
Divide the roll into three pieces.
Brush the rolls with melted chocolate and decorate with finely chopped hazelnuts.
