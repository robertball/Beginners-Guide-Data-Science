Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (3 1/2) pound whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
salt and ground black pepper to taste
8  carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
8  potatoes, quartered
4 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
½ large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2  chicken bouillon cubes
2 ½ cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Pour the olive oil into the bottom of a heavy Dutch oven, and place over medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and black pepper, and cook in the hot oil until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Add the carrots, potatoes, celery, onion, garlic, chicken bouillon cubes, and water, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, and cover the Dutch oven.
Place the Dutch oven into the preheated oven, and simmer, covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is a farm-style French dish that my Mom's German grandmother taught her to make as a young girl. It's easy and similar to our pot roast meals and very tasty as well. Mom updated the one she had to make it even easier for us to make years later. She made enough to make a different meal with her leftovers as well.
