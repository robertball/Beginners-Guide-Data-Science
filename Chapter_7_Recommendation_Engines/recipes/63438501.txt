Description: 
I experimented with a glaze for a small ham, and had more left over than I'd anticipated. I also had a sweet potato and apple left and it was the day before payday. I put them together with the glaze, and we were amazed at how it turned out. My husband had people begging for samples after the smell of them filled his lunch room when he warmed them up. Now I have to bring it to all the holiday functions.
