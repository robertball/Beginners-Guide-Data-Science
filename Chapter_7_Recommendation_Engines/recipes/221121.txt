Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 cups white sugar
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups grated zucchini
1 1/2 cups sweetened flaked coconut
1 1/2 cups chopped black walnuts (optional)
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter
3 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup sweetened flaked coconut
1/2 cup chopped black walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup raisins (optional)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Grease 2 9x13-inch baking pans.
Beat eggs, white sugar, and vegetable oil together until well blended.
Stir flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt into egg mixture until batter is just mixed.
Fold zucchini, 1 1/2 cups coconut and 1 1/2 cups black walnuts into batter until evenly distributed.
Divide batter evenly between the prepared baking pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on wire racks.
Beat cream cheese and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth.
Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into cream cheese mixture until frosting is light and fluffy.
Fold 1 cup coconut, 1/2 cup black walnuts, raisins, and vanilla extract into cream cheese frosting.
Spread cream cheese frosting over completely cooled cakes.

Description: 
My mom has been making this cake for years using fresh zucchini from the garden. It is a family favorite. It's even great to freeze and bring out when company comes.
