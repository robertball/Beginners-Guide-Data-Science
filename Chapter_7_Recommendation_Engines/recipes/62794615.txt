Ingredients:
1/4 cup mayonnaise (such as Hellmann's Â®), or to taste
1/4 cup prepared basil pesto sauce, or to taste
1 pound bacon, cooked crisp and drained
1 medium-large tomato, sliced thick
3/4 cup shredded lettuce, or to your liking
1- 8 inch round focaccia, plain or flavored (I like the asiago one)

Directions:
Cut focaccia loaf in half lengthwise, and set the top aside.
Layer the bacon over the bottom half of the bread, completely covering the surface and stacking the bacon thick.
Top the bacon layer with shredded lettuce.
Top the lettuce layer with the tomato slices.
On top half of focaccia, spread entire surface with mayonnaise and then with the pesto.
Place top of bread on sandwich and cut into 4 pieces.
Serve and enjoy!

Like the usual BLT, but kicked up for even more yummy deliciousness! Great for the hot months, as it doesn't require heating up the oven.
