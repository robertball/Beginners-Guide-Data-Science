Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) frozen pie crusts
2 cups sour cream
4 large eggs
3 cups white sugar
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 cups sliced strawberries
3 cups chopped rhubarb
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line 2 pie plates with the pie crusts.
Stir sour cream and eggs together in a large bowl. Stir in sugar, 4 tablespoons flour, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir in strawberries and rhubarb. Pour filling into the 2 pie crusts. Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C); continue baking until filling is soft and nicely thickened, about 20 minutes more. Leave oven on.
Stir brown sugar and 1/2 cup flour together in a bowl. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle mixture over the pie fillings.
Return pies to the hot oven. Bake until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes.

Everybody is familiar with strawberry-rhubarb pie, but very few have tasted this sour cream version. One taste of this and you'll want to smack your grandmother! It is that good.
