Description: 
Blackberries are plentiful where I am, and they taste great.  Here is a recipe for such a pie. The pioneers thought that blackberries were a weed. Gradually it came into cookbooks for medicinal purposes - blackberry syrup for cholera and summer complaint.  This nuisance became very popular, and the berry is unique and very tasty.
