Ingredients:
4 eggs, beaten
1 cup crushed corn flake cereal
1/3 cup chili sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon dried parsley
2 tablespoons dried onion flakes
8 vegetarian burger patties
2 servings (4 ounce) sleeves buttery round crackers, crumbled
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 (16 ounce) can cranberry sauce
1 cup Russian-style salad dressing
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine eggs, cornflake crumbs, chili sauce, soy sauce, parsley flakes, dehydrated onion, vegetable burger, buttery round crackers, cream cheese, and walnuts. Shape into 72 1-inch meatballs.  Arrange on prepared cookie sheets.
Bake the meatballs at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through.
In a large saucepan, combine cranberry sauce, Russian dressing, brown sugar, and lemon juice.  Cook, stirring frequently until the cranberry sauce is melted.  Add the meatballs and heat through. Serve with appetizer toothpicks, if desired.

Description: 
These are wonderful vegetarian meatballs with a sweet and sour sauce.  They're simple to make and they disappear very quickly.  Make these for Christmas holiday parties. If you don't have veggie burger patties, you may use TVP, textured vegetable protein, that's available at most health food stores.
