Ingredients:
Salad:
1/2 cup pine nuts
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
2 cups chopped fresh spinach
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup halved grape tomatoes
1/2 cup halved Kalamata olives
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
1/4 cup minced red onion
Dressing:
1/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir pine nuts in the hot skillet until fragrant and toasted, about 5 minutes.
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes; fluff with a fork and cool to room temperature.
Mix quinoa, spinach, kidney beans, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, and onion together in a bowl.
Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is smooth; drizzle over quinoa mixture and toss to coat.
