Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 (8 ounce) carton frozen whipped topping, thawed
1 (10 inch) prepared angel food cake
CARAMEL SAUCE:
1 cup half-and-half cream, divided
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup butter (no substitutes)
Pinch salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Fold in whipped topping; set aside. Cut cake horizontally into two layers. Place the bottom layer on a serving plate; spread with cream cheese mixture. Replace top; refrigerate.
In a saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of cream, sugar, corn syrup, butter and salt. Cook and stir until mixture reaches soft-ball stage (234 degrees F). Slowly add remaining cream. Cook and stir until mixture returns to soft-ball stage (234 degrees F). Remove from the heat; stir in vanilla. Cool. Drizzle over cake. Store in the refrigerator.
