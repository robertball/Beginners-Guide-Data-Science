Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup granulated white sugar
3/4 cup firmly packed light or dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Chips
1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter with the white and brown sugars using an electric mixer at medium speed until the mixture is creamy and lightened in color, about 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated.
Gradually blend the flour mixture into the creamed mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. Drop by the tablespoonful onto ungreased cookie sheets about 2 inches apart.
Bake for 9 to 11 minutes, until the cookies are golden brown. Transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool. Store in airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
