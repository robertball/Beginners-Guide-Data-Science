Ingredients:
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut in pieces
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bunch scallions (green onions), sliced
drizzle of oil
1 bottle peanut sauce
Garam Masala curry, to taste
1/2 cup toasted coconut
3 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Reserving the green part of the scallions in a separate bowl, combine the chicken, white part of scallions, 1/4 cup of the coconut, and garlic in a large pan. Drizzle just enough oil so that the ingredients don't burn, and cook over medium heat until the chicken is done. Remove from heat and drizzle the sauce over the chicken, adding the curry powder to taste. Serve over rice, and top with with the reserved scallions and coconut.
For extra flavor, try cooking the rice in coconut milk!
