Ingredients:
3 spears fresh asparagus, cut in half
1 serving cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)
1/4 cup milk
4 large eggs
4 teaspoons maple syrup
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 onion, diced
1/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 4 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 6 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Whisk milk, eggs, maple syrup, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
Place 1 asparagus half and about 1 teaspoon onion into each of the prepared muffin cups. Pour about 1/4 cup egg mixture into each muffin cup; sprinkle each with Swiss cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until frittatas are golden and puffed, about 25 minutes. Remove promptly and let cool only a few minutes, as they will deflate, like a souffle.
