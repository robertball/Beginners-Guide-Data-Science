Ingredients:
80 pearl onions
1 TB beef soup base
1-2 sticks butter (2-4 TB per batch)
4 TB lemon juice (1 TB per batch)
1 c. sugar (1/4 c. per batch)

Directions:
Peel the onions the night before you need them. Cut a bit of the root end off but try to leave some on so the onions stick together, and leave the pointy tip on because it looks nice.
Place onions in a bowl and cover with water to soak overnight.  Skim off any stray pieces that float up.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer onions to a bowl. (?) Pour the onion water into a stock pot. Add beef soup base and bring to a boil. Add the onions, about 20 at a time, and cook until almost soft. The middle of the onion will start to poke out.
In a large skillet, heat 2-4 TBs butter. Add a splash of lemon juice (1 TB) and 1/4 c. sugar to the skillet.
Remove the onions from the stock pot and place in skillet. Cook until caramelized, gently rolling frequently.
Repeat with remaining batches.
Save the broth for dressing or French onion soup.
