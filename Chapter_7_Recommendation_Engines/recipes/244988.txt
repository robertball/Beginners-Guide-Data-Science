Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1 cup self-rising flour
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup chopped pecans
3 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet baking chocolate

Directions:
Beat cream cheese and margarine together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Slowly add flour and continually mix until dough is smooth. Refrigerate mixture for 15 minutes.
Beat brown sugar, egg, cinnamon, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; add pecans and stir.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 24 mini muffin cups.
Spoon dough, about 1 tablespoon per pie, into each muffin cup. Press dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup, creating a pie shell. Fill each shell with pecan mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until pies are set, about 30 minutes. Cool pies on waxed paper.
Melt chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Dip a fork into melted chocolate and drizzle over pies.
