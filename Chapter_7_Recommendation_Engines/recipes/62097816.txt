Ingredients:
1/2 cup cream cheese
4 stalks of celery (diced)
1 onion (diced)
1 stick of butter
6 cups or three cans of chicken broth
one 16oz bag of sweet corn
2 cans of creamed corn
1 pint of heavy cream
3-4 potatoes peeled and diced
corn starch to thicken

Directions:
melt a stick of butter in the bottom of a large soup pot. stir in the diced celery and onions and sweat them over medium heat for a few minutes. Add the cream cheese and stir until melted being careful not to burn it. Add the chicken broth and the potatoes and bring to boil. Cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes then add the creamed corn, frozen corn and cream. I like to use white frozen and creamed corn because it seems to be a little sweeter. In a separate cup mix some corn starch with a little cold water to get any lumps out and stir in gradually until you get the desired thickness,just add a little at a time you don't need much. sprinkle a little salt and pepper and your ready to eat.

Description: 
I decided that the corn chowders I tried before weren't creamy enough so I made my own. It came out great and the whole pot was gone before I could blink.
