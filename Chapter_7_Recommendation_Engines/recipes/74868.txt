Ingredients:
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
4 (6 ounce) fillets catfish
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup oyster sauce

Directions:
In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge the catfish fillets in the flour mixture to lightly coat.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the catfish fillets 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Reduce heat to medium-low, and brush fillets with oyster sauce. Cover skillet, and continue cooking 5 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork.
