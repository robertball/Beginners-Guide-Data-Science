Ingredients:
water as needed
8 carrots, peeled and chopped into 1 1/2-inch chunks
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of celery soup
10 stalks celery, cut in large chunks
4 red potatoes, cut into large chunks
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
2 teaspoons crushed garlic
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon dried dill weed
salt to taste
1 pound pork tenderloin

Directions:
Turn slow cooker to High and add a little water to coat the bottom of the pot. Add carrots and cook until nearly tender, about 1 hour.
Add condensed soups to the carrots. Fill 1 emptied can with water and stir in until soup is as thin as a broth. Add celery, potatoes, and onion. Sprinkle in cumin, pepper, basil, garlic, mustard, and dill weed. Stir well and season with salt.
Lay pork tenderloin on top of vegetables; cut in half if needed to fit. Cover and continue cooking on High for 4 hours. Pork should be slightly pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Remove pork, cut into chunks, and return to the pot. Stir and simmer as desired.

Description: 
This is a tasty and easy-to-make pork tenderloin stew. The black pepper and cumin gives a nice edge to counter the softness of the potatoes and tenderized vegetables, I think, without being too spicy. You can also use half-and-half or cream instead of water, and add 1/4 cup flour if you want a creamier broth.
