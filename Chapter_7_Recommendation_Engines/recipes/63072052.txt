Allow butter to soften at room temperature. Grate the lemon and set zest aside. Grease bottom and sides of a round baking dish (9.5 inches/ 24 cm) - can use glass one.
Put cheese with sugar in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Add eggs and softened butter and beat (with a hand mixer.)
Add lemon zest, cinnamon and brandy and continue to beat. While beating, gradually add in the flour and continue beating until batter begins to thicken.
Bake in the oven for approximately 30 minutes, or until the cheese turns a golden colour on edges and the centre does not jiggle about. Remove and allow to cool before serving.
