Ingredients:
1 head of garlic
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/3 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
3 tablespoons onion, minced
1 tablespoon bourbon
1 tablespoon crushed pineapple
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Slice the garlic in half, horizontally.  Drizzle with olive oil, roast at 325 for 1 hour.  Remove from oven and let cool.
Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar in a medium saucepan over medium high heat.  Stir occasionally until mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture is just simmering.
Squeeze the sides of the head of garlic until the roasted garlic comes out.  Measure 2 teaspoons in to the saucepan and whisk to combine.  Add remaining ingredients to pan and stir.
Let mixture simmer for 40-50 minutes or until sauce has reduced by half.  Sauce will be thick and syrupy.
