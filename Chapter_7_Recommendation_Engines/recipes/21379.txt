Ingredients:
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 cups crushed saltine crackers
½ cup butter, melted
1 cup condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 (15 ounce) can asparagus, drained with liquid reserved
½ cup slivered almonds

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a small bowl, mix together the Cheddar cheese and cracker crumbs. In another dish, stir together the melted butter, soup, and the juice from the can of asparagus.
Use half of the cracker mixture to make a layer in the bottom of a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Arrange half of the asparagus spears over the crumbs, sprinkle with 1/2 of the almonds, then pour 1/2 of the soup mixture over. Build another layer, starting with the remaining asparagus spears, then the remaining soup mixture, and ending with the remaining cheese and crumbs on top.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden.
