Ingredients:
4 c. Pumpkin Guts (3 seeds only)
1 tsp. Sea Salt
2 tsp. Pepper (your favorite blend)
1 tsp. Celery Salt
2 tbsp. Turmeric
1 tsp. Sage
10-12 Small Red Potatoes. (whole)
2 Large Carrots. (chopped)
4 Stalks of Celery. (chopped)
1 Large Onion. (cut into eights)

Directions:
Place Pumpkin Guts in a large pot. Add water to barely cover the pumpkin guts. Add spices. (Taste the broth. It should be slightly salty.) Bring to a rolling boil, stirring occasionally so it does not stick to pan. Lower heat to medium high, cook until opaque, or transparent. Add potatoes, and carrots. Boil until you can almost pierce a fork to the center of your larger potatoes. Add Celery, and Onions. Cook 10 more minutes.
