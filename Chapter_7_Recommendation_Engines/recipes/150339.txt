Place the chicken wings in a roasting pan. Season with salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, peach chutney, onion soup mix and hot water. Pour this over the chicken wings.

Description: 
My absolute favorite chicken recipe since childhood. Sticky, savory, sweet... and absolutely delicious. This is a calorie-fest however, so be certain to offset all that sinful goodness with a crisp salad! Feel free to change or add ingredients as you go along! We don't usually bother with measurements!
