Ingredients:
12 Chicken Legs
1 c Barbeque Sauce OR Italian Salad Dressing OR Teriyaki Sauce
1/2 tsp dried sage OR oregano OR Sesame seeds
1/2 c beer or wine (optional)

Directions:
Spray a microwave-safe casserole dish with cooking spray.
Arrange chicken in pan, spoon sauce and beer over each leg, sprinkle with chosen spice.
Cover with plastic wrap, microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Rearrange chicken legs so those in the middle get moved to the outside edge of the pan.  Continue cooking chicken in 5 minute intervals(depending on your microwave) until it is cooked through and no longer pink.
Refrigerate legs until you're ready to grill, discard remaining sauce.  Heat your grill to med-high and grill for a couple minutes on each side just until chicken is hot and nicely browned.

Description: 
I ordinarily shy away from cooking meat in my microwave, and love grilled chicken pieces but hate having to babysit it so it doesn't burn.  These economical & tender chicken pieces are cooked up in the microwave and finished on the grill, and are an exception to my microwave rule!
