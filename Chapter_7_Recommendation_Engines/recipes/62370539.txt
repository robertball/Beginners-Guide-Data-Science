Ingredients:
4 eggs
3 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons milk
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
6-8 slices bread

Directions:
Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth, then whisk in all other ingredients except for the bread.
Heat a large frying pan over medium heat.  When hot, spray with no stick spray.  Dip bread, one slice at a time, into the egg mixture, let excess drip off, then place in the frying pan.  Cook until golden, then flip and cook the other side.
Repeat with the rest of the bread, putting as many slices in the skillet at once as will fit in a single layer.
Serve with maple syrup, honey, fruit sauce and whipped cream, or whatever else you can think of that sounds good!

Description: 
This is the only French Toast that I make.  We love the cinnamon in it and how the sugar gets a little bit caramelized when cooked.  Also, because it doesn't use a lot of milk, it won't seem soggy like some other recipes.  This recipe should be enough for 6-8 slices of toast- it depends on how big your bread is!
