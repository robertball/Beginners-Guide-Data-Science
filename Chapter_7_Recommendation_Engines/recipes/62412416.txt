Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
1 (3.9 ounce) package instant butterscotch pudding mix
1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup butterscotch chips (chopped)
1 tablespoon flour
1/8 cup confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the cake mix, instant pudding and sugar. Add the water, oil, eggs, and sour cream, mix until well blended. Toss bits in tablespoon flour and fold into batter. Pour into the prepared Bundt pan.
Bake for 50 minutes in the preheated oven. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar before cutting and serving.

I loved the chocolate version so I had to try a butterscotch one and it is just as good.  My boyfriend even likes it better.Modified from: Easy Chocolate Chip Pound Cake
