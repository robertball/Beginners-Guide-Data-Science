Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
2 1/8 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
Wet Ingredients:
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon lemon extract
1 cup strained fresh lemon juice

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Stir flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Beat milk, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and lemon extract into the dry ingredients using an electric mixer set to medium for 2 minutes.
Bring lemon juice to a boil in a small saucepan and immediately beat into the batter with the electric mixer on low speed.
Fill cupcake liners with batter to about two-thirds full.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
I am a huge fan of 'One Bowl Chocolate Cake' by Allrecipes user 'shirleyo' on Allrecipes! I was determined to create a new cake flavor just as moist, fluffy, and homemade. These lemon cupcakes are contest-winning fluffy and moist deliciousness!
