Ingredients:
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup water
6 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons dried rosemary, crushed
4 boneless pork chops

Directions:
Whisk together the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and rosemary in a bowl, and pour 1/2 of the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add the pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Set the remaining marinade aside.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Place pork chops on the grill and cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade, 4 to 5 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
