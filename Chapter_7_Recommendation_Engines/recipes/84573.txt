Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 bunches green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 pounds peeled crawfish tails
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 egg yolks, beaten
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
1 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food, cubed
salt and black pepper to taste
hot pepper sauce to taste

Directions:
Heat butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in green onions, and cook briefly. Add parsley and crawfish, and simmer about 7 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in flour to coat crawfish.
In a small bowl, mix together egg yolks and evaporated milk. Stir into crawfish, and reduce heat to medium-low. Gradually add cheese cubes, stirring continuously until the cheese has melted. Season with salt, pepper, and hot pepper sauce. Remove from heat, and bring to room temperature before serving.

Description: 
This should serve 8 to 10, but I usually double the recipe because it goes quickly.  I'm always asked to make this for every gathering.  It's a family favorite.
