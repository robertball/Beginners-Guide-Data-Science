Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups crushed ice
1 ripe banana
1/2 lime, juiced
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon shredded coconut, as garnish (optional)
2 pitted cherries, as garnish (optional)

Directions:
Blend the ice and banana together in a blender set to Low until mixed, adding the lime juice and lemon juice as it blends to keep the ice from freezing to the side of the blender. Serve in a tall glass and garnish with coconut or a cherry.

Description: 
Slightly bitter and extremely refreshing, this is one instance of what I have dubbed blender-miracles. Throw everything in and blend away! Make sure to use a well-ripened banana to add extra sweetness. If the end result is still slightly too bitter, blend in sugar to taste. This pairs nicely with a balsamic salad.
