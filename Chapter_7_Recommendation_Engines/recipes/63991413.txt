Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
2 large (or 3 small) crisp apples peeled, cored, and diced (I used granny smith)
¼ cup dark brown sugar
¼ teaspoon cinnamon
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoons whiskey or apple cider

Directions:
Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add the apples, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla.  Cook for about 10 minutes on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are soft and have released their juices.  (It will smell delicious!)
In a separate bowl, whisk together the whiskey/Cider/(water) with cornstarch. Then add to the pan with the apples and cook for another 3 minutes, until the liquid thickens.  Set aside to cool.
