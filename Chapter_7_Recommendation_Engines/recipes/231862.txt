Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) cod fillets
4 teaspoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 bunch fresh chives, coarsely chopped
2 lemons, sliced
2 cloves garlic, sliced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Cut 4 large squares of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Brush each fillet with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Place each fillet in the center of an aluminum foil square. Lay lemon slices down the length of each fillet and sprinkle garlic slices and chives over the top. Fold foil over the fish and turn the edges over 2 or 3 times; flatten to seal the packets.
Bake in the preheated oven until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This is a super simple recipe that can be used with any fish. I just happen to like cod a lot. You throw the ingredients in a foil pouch, then steam in the oven. A true no-brainer meal.
