Ingredients:
1 cup Butter
1  cup  Sugar
3  tbsp Water
1  tsp  Light corn syrup
1  cup  Fine chop toasted almonds
1  cup  Milk-chocolate chips

Directions:
Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the sugar, water, and corn syrup.  Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring often.  When the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to
boil, raise the heat and bring the mixture to 290 F degrees on a cooking thermometer (soft crack stage). It will be light brown in color, and syrup will separate into threads that are not brittle whendropped into cold water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  Immediately pour the
mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet. Wait 2 or 3 minutes for the candy surface to firm, then sprinkle on the chocolate chips. When the chips have softened, spread the chocolate evenly over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining almonds over the melted chocolate.  When the chocolate
hardens, crack the candy into pieces.
Store covered.
