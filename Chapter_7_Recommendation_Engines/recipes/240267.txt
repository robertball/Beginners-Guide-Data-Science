Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 cup fat free milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
6 egg whites
2 cups sucanat
1 cup light olive oil
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and dust with flour.
Mix milk and lemon juice together in a bowl.
Beat egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form; beat in sucanat until fluffy. Mix olive oil into beaten egg whites mixture until smooth.
Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, lemon zest, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl.
Stir egg white mixture, alternating with milk mixture, into the flour mixture until batter is smooth; pour into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.
