Ingredients:
3-4 pounds pasture-raised pork ribs
2-4 cups white vinegar
1-2 cups pure water
1 tsp. sea salt
2 Tbsp. rice wine vinegar or raw apple cider vinegar (where to find rice wine vinegar)
3 Tbsp. coconut aminos or wheat-free tamari (where to find coconut aminos)
Sea salt, to taste
Ground black pepper, to taste
Garlic powder, to taste
Chinese 5-spice powder, to taste

Directions:
Cover your ribs with white vinegar and water in a 2:1 ratio. Mix in a teaspoon of sea salt and soak 12 hours or overnight. (Place container in the fridge.)
In the morning, drain ribs thoroughly.
Sprinkle each side of your ribs generously with sea salt, black pepper and garlic powder.
Heavily coat each side with Chinese 5-spice powder until most of the meat appears covered in dark orange powder.
Gently rub the seasonings into the meat on both sides, then place the ribs upright on their ends into your slow cooker. (It's OK if they lean!)
Add the rice wine vinegar and coconut aminos or tamari to the bottom of the slow cooker.
Cook on high for 4-6 hours. Without much liquid in the pot, these ribs are roasting, not stewing, so keep your eye on them so they don't dry out!
