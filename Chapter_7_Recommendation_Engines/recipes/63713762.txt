1 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup water
1 tbsp minced fresh ginger
2 dried bay leaves

Boil all ingredients but thighs in a large pot over high heat.
Add thighs, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes.  Flip thighs, simmer 15 minutes more.  Cool thighs, then cover pot and chill.  Marinade 12 to 48 hours.
Preheat grill to medium low.  Brush grill grate with olive oil.
Remove thighs from marinade and pat dry.  Skim off and discard fat from marinade.  Boil marinade until reduced to 1 cup; strain.
