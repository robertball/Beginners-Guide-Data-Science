Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package linguine
1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons canola oil
2 cups snap peas
1 small sweet onion, chopped
1 (12 ounce) pork tenderloin, cut into thin strips
1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger, or to taste
2 cloves garlic, chopped
3 green onions, sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes; drain.
Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, cornstarch, sugar, and sesame oil together in a small bowl.
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir snap peas and onion in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork, mushrooms, red bell pepper, 1 clove garlic, and ginger; cook until pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes.
Mix 2 cloves garlic into the pork mixture; cook for 1 minute. Pour soy sauce mixture over pork mixture; cook and stir until sauce thickens, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat. Add linguine to the mixture; toss to coat. Sprinkle with green onions.
