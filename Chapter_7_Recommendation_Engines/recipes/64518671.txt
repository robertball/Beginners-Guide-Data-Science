Ingredients:
1 box Pillsbury Hot Roll mix (if you can't find Pillsbury, any bread/roll box mix will do.)
2 c. shredded cheddar cheese (not finely shredded)

Directions:
Combine flour and yeast from mix in bowl.  Add 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, before you add wet ingredients.  Mix in egg, butter and hot water according to package directions.   Knead on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide dough in half and put each half in a greased loaf pan.  Cover and let rise in a warm place for about 2 hours.  Bake in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes or until golden brown and it sounds hollow when you thump it with your finger.
