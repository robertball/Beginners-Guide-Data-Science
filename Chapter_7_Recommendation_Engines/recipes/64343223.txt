Ingredients:
1 medium spaghetti squash, halved and seeded
olive oil
kosher salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil (sage is also yummy)
3/4 cup shredded Gruyère cheese
1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted
black pepper

Directions:
1.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Rub squash with a little bit of olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Place the cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 25 minutes, until fork tender. Let cool about 10 minutes, then scrape the insides with a fork to pull the strands away from the skin. (At this point I put the strands in a colander, pressed them with a paper towel, and let them rest while I prepped the other ingredients - mine were really really heavy and watery, so this helped get some of the excess moisture out.)
2.In a large skillet, heat 2½ tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1½ minutes, until fragrant. Stir in spaghetti squash, vinegar, herbs, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook for about 2 minutes to heat through. Remove from heat and stir in Gruyère cheese, then top with pine nuts. Taste and add salt or pepper if desired.
