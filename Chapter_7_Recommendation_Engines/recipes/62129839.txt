Ingredients:
2 small pork tenderloins
Salt
Black pepper
Dried chopped rosemary
1 small jar orange marmalade, or you can use any flavor of preserves.
1 1/2 tablespoons prepared horseradish

Directions:
Sprinkle both sides of the tenderloins with salt, pepper and rosemary, and place in a baking dish lined with non-stick cooking spray.
Bake uncovered in a preheated 475 degree F. oven for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the orange marmalade and horseradish in a small saucepan and heat until bubbly.
Pour orange sauce evenly over the tenderloins and add 2/3 cup of water to the bottom of the baking dish to prevent sauce from burning.
Place pork back into the oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees F. Cook tenderloins an additional 30 minutes or until center of the tenderloin reaches 160 degrees F. (use a meat thermometer to check meat temperature).
When tenderloins are finished cooking, let them rest, covered, for 10 minutes before slicing.
Serve with juices from baking dish spooned over the sliced pork.
