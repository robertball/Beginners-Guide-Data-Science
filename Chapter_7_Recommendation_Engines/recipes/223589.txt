Description: 
Congee is rice cooked with large amounts of water or chicken stock. It is good for convalescents, as it is meant for a tired stomach. The Chinese eat congee for breakfast and supper. It be accompanied by eggs, salted peanuts, fish, or ham. This was a traditional congee in our family. We prepared this congee with eight ingredients: red dates, fresh water chestnuts, soybeans, bok choy, fresh chestnuts, ham, or chicken. This is the congee my family has served for more than one hundred years. It is highly nourishing!
