Ingredients:
1 head napa cabbage, chopped
1/4 cup salt, divided
6 cloves garlic
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
1 small white onion, peeled and chopped
2 tablespoons water
3 green onions, minced
cayenne pepper to taste
1 ripe persimmon, chopped
1 small radish, shredded
1 cucumber, diced (optional)

Directions:
Rinse cabbage well. Put the cabbage in a bowl and sprinkle liberally with salt, tossing to mix. Set aside for 1 hour.
Mix more salt into the cabbage and set aside for another hour. Wash and drain the cabbage. Combine the garlic, ginger, and onion in a blender with the water. Blend on high speed until smooth.
Stir together the rinsed drained cabbage, garlic-ginger mixture, minced green onions, cayenne pepper, persimmon, radish, and cucumber and mix well. Transfer the mixture into airtight containers, and refrigerate for 3 days before serving.

Description: 
This is a great authentic Korean dish: unlike in some kimchi, the sugar is from natural sources like persimmon and cucumber. It has a great flavor and just enough spice.
