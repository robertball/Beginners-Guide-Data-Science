Ingredients:
1 can (15 oz) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)
1 package (8 oz) reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchâtel), cut into 16 pieces, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
3/4 cup fat-free egg product
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup Bisquick Heart Smart® mix
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
2 cups frozen (thawed) fat-free whipped topping

Directions:
Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 9-inch glass pie plate with cooking spray.
In blender, place all ingredients except whipped topping. Cover; blend on high speed about 2 minutes or until smooth. (Or beat in medium bowl with hand beater 2 minutes, scraping bowl constantly.) Pour into pie plate.
Bake about 45 minutes or just until puffed and center is dry (do not overbake). Cool completely, about 1 hour. Spread with whipped topping. Refrigerate at least 3 hours until chilled. Store covered in refrigerator.
