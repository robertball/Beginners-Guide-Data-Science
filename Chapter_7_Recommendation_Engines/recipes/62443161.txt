Ingredients:
1 T melted butter
1 egg
1/3 C milk
1/4 C sugar
1/4 C brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 C grated zucchini, squeezed dry
1 1/2 C whole wheat flour
1 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. nutmeg
OIL for frying
ICING:
1 1/2 C powdered sugar
1/4 C milk
1 T vanilla

Directions:
In medium mixing bowl, whip together the melted butter with the egg, milk, both sugars and vanilla. Beat in the zucchini, flour, salt and nutmeg until combined.
Heat 1/2 quart oil in pot on medium heat.
Drop dough into hot oil, 1 teaspoon at a time. Fry until dark golden brown, 4 minutes or so. I flip them over when they rise to the top and are halfway golden brown. Place on cooling rack.
Mix the icing in a small bowl and dip the puffs in, rolling to coat. The cooler they are, the better the icing will stick.
