Ingredients:
¾ cup milk
½ cup all-purpose flour
2  eggs
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 pinch salt
cooking spray
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup spinach leaves
¼ cup sliced shallots
1 cup chopped cooked chicken
½ cup Brie cheese

Directions:
Mix milk, flour, eggs, melted butter, and salt together in a blender until combined. Let mixture rest for 15 minutes.
Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat; lightly coat with cooking spray. Add 1/2 cup of batter and swirl the skillet so the batter completely covers the bottom. Cook until bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Loosen the edges with a rubber spatula and use your fingers to quickly flip the crepe. Cook 1 minute more.
Slide crepe out of the skillet. Repeat with remaining batter, spraying skillet in between crepes. Stack cooked crepes directly on top of each other to maintain temperature.
Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach and shallots until softened, about 3 minutes. Add chicken and mix to combine and heat through, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside.
Spread 2 tablespoons Brie cheese onto each crepe; add chicken mixture. Fold crepe in half, return to the skillet, and heat until cheese is melted. Remove from skillet and roll into a cone shape.

Description: 
Just like there are street tacos, the French have street crepes. The combinations are endless. The use of rotisserie chicken makes this crepe recipe fast to prepare.
