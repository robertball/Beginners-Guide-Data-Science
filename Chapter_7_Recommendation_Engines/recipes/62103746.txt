1/2 t salt
3/4 c butter
3/4 c vegetable shortening
3/4 c sugar
3/4 c packed brown sugar

Directions:
For cookies, combine flour, baking soda and salt and set aside.  Beat together butter, shortening, sugar and brown sugar until fluffy.  Beat in eggs, milk and peppermint.  Gradually beat in flour mixture.  Divide dough into fourths, cover and chill 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375.  Prepare filling by combining ingredients in a bowl over hot, not boiling, water.  Stir until smooth.  Cool slightly to thicken a little.
Roll the dough, to 1/8 inch thickness.  Cut with a 2 1/2 inch heart-shaped cookie cutter.  Place hearts on ungreased cookie sheets.  Spread with a teaspoon of filling.  Top with another heart and gently press edges to seal.  Bake 10 minutes.  Cool.
Prepare Peppermint Drizzle by combining confectioner's sugar, peppermint extract and food coloring in a bowl.  Stir in enough milk to make a thin icing.
Prepare Chocolate Drizzle by combining ingredients in a bowl over hot, not boiling, water.  Stir until smooth.
Once cookies are cooled, drizzle pink icing one direction and chocolate the opposite direction.
