16-32 pretzel sticks(depending on how many legs you want)
8 rasians

Directions:
Lay 2 ritz crackers, 1 teaspoon of peanut butter, 4 pretzel sticks and 2 rasians on a paper plate,(this is kindof messy). Give each child a spoon and have them spread 1/2 the peanut butter on one of the crackers. Place 2-4 legs on each side of the cracker gently pressing them into the peanut butter.Spread most of the rest of the peanut butter on the other cracker. Put the two crackers together, pressing gently. Put alittle peanut butter on both of the rasians and gently put them on the top of the cracker for eyes.
