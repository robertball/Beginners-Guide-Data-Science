Ingredients:
1 cup sauerkraut
3 ounces chopped corned beef
1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese
5 egg roll wrappers
oil for frying
2 tablespoons Thousand Island dressing

Directions:
Combine sauerkraut, corned beef, and Swiss cheese in a bowl and mix well.
Lay egg roll wrappers on a flat surface. Place 1/5 the mixture on top of each egg roll. Pull the bottom left corner over the filling and fold the two sides in, moistening edges with water as you go. Roll tightly to close.
Heat about 1 inch oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add egg rolls to the hot oil and fry until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with Thousand Island dressing for dipping.

Description: 
I had something similar in a local German restaurant and told my husband, 'I can make these!' So this is what I came up with. It goes great with any German beer.
