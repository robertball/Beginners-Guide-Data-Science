Cream together butter, peanut butter and sugars. Beat in eggs.
In a separate bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and   salt. Stir into batter. Put batter in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Roll into 1 inch balls and put on baking sheets.  Flatten each ball with a fork, making   a criss-cross pattern.  Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for about 10 minutes or until cookies begin to brown. Do not over-bake.

Description: 
These cookies are soft and chewy.  I substituted margarine for the butter and decreased the amount of sugar in the revised recipe, the extra calories won't be missed!!   No need to refrigerate the dough either.Modified from: Classic Peanut Butter Cookies
