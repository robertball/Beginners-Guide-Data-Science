Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, beaten
2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas
3/4 cup Milk chocolate chips
3/4 cup White chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line with paper liner or grease muffin tin.
In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Add the chocolate chips. Pour batter into prepared muffin tin.
Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let muffins cool in pan for 10 minutes, then place onto a wire rack.
