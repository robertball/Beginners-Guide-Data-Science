Ingredients:
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sriracha hot sauce, or to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 green onions, chopped (optional)
3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 pinch Chinese five-spice powder
2 pounds beef short ribs, cut 1/3-inch-thick across the bones

Directions:
Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, sriracha hot sauce, and olive oil together in a large bowl; add brown sugar and stir until dissolved. Mix green onions, garlic, black pepper, sesame seeds, ginger, and five-spice powder into vinegar mixture until marinade is evenly combined.
Place short ribs in a large reseable bag and pour marinade over ribs; coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove ribs from marinade and place on the grill; cook for 6 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and spoon marinade over second side; cook until meat is no longer pink, 6 to 7 minutes more. Turn grill heat to high and cook ribs for 1 minute more per side. Remove ribs from heat and place on a plate; let rest for 5 minutes.
