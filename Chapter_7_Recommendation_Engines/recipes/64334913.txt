Smoky Deviled Eggs Recipe

Ingredients:
6 Eggs, hard-boiled and peeled
1/2 to 1 cup Greek Yogurt
2 Tbsp Sun-dried Tomatoes, finely chopped
3/4 tsp Smoked Paprika
1/4 tsp Salt, plus more for the shallots
1 Shallot, thinly sliced
1/4 cup Peanut oil

Directions:
Slice the eggs in half and scoop the yolks into a bowl. Set the whites aside on a plate.
Smash the yolks with the back of a fork. Add 1/2 cup Greek yogurt and stir until well combined. Mix in the sun-dried tomatoes, smoked paprika and salt.
Taste and, if you wish, add the remaining yogurt 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Adding the entire cup of yogurt will make quite a lot of filling and it will be thin. I prefer my eggs very creamy, so I do add the whole cup.
In a small saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Test the oil with a slice of shallot â€“ when it instantly sizzles, it's ready. Add the shallot slices to the pan and cook until they turn golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, remove them from the pan and place on a paper towel. While they're still hot, sprinkle lightly with salt.
Using a small spoon, fill each egg white with a generous amount of filling.
If serving immediately, top each one with a frizzled shallot. Or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, and top with shallots just before serving. Best eaten within a few hours.
