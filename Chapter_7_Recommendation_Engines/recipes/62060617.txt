Ingredients:
Crust:
2 cups Flour
2 T. Sugar
1 Cup cold butter
Filling:
2 cups Sugar
1/3 cup Flour
1 tsp. salt
6 egg yokes, beaten
1 cup heavy cream
5 cups thinly sliced rhubarb
2 cups thinly sliced strawberries
Meringue:
6 egg whites
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar
3/4 cups sugar
1 tsp. vanilla

Directions:
Make crust first by combining the flour and sugar.  Cut in butter until crumbly and press into a greased 9 X 13 pan.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes.
Combine filling ingredients and pour over baked crust.  Bake an additional 50 to 60 minutes at 350.
While dessert is still hot, prepare meringue.  Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar a tablespoon at a time until stiff peaks form.  Beat in vanilla.  Spread over filling and bake until golden brown.  Cool and then refrigerate.
