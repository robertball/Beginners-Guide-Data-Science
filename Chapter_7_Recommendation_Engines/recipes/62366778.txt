Black Olive Vinaigrette Recipe

Ingredients:
- 10 Black olives, quartered and stones discarded
- 1 Tablespoon good, aged, balsamic vinegar
- 6 Tablespoons EVOO
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to YOUR taste, but I don't usually add any!

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix the olives, the balsamic vinegar and the EVOO.
Using a hand-whizzer, blitz the mixture until most of the olives have broken down.
This mixture is now quite thick - simply put it to one side for 10 minutes or so and let it separate. (This is called a split olive vinaigrette).
Spoon out onto the dish, so that the dark central "blobs" float in a light white oil "puddle".

Description: 
This is delicious, particularly with pan-fried fish fillets (Red Mullet is just made for this) and Aubergine (Egg plant) pur√©e. It presents so well when separated!
