Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 tablespoons tequila
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
15 large tiger shrimp, peeled and deveined
4 wooden skewers

Directions:
Whisk olive oil, lime juice, tequila, garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, and black pepper in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add shrimp, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak wooden skewers in a bowl of water for 30 minutes.
Remove shrimp from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Thread shrimp on skewers, piercing once near the tail and once near the head.
Arrange skewers on preheated grill; cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 6 to 8 minutes.
