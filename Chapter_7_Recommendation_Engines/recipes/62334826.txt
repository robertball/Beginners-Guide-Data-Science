Description: 
I don't like the MSG that is in the ranch dip mixes you buy from the store. gives me such a headache after I eat it. But I absolutely love dill and ranch dip so I made my own. I have been told its much better then the mix and it is constantly requested in my house!very simple to make!! The longer it is in the fridge the better it tastes!
