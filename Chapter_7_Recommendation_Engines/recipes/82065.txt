Ingredients:
2 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated buttermilk biscuits (not the layered varieties)
Cornmeal for rolling
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 (10 ounce) packages white mushrooms, stems trimmed, cut into small dice
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chilies
2 large garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper to taste
4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
Olive oil, for brushing

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to center; heat oven to 450 degrees.
Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, stirring until moisture evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir in chilies, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a medium bowl; stir in goat cheese until cheese melts. Cool to room temperature.
Separate biscuits onto a cornmeal-coated work surface. Sprinkle with cornmeal as necessary, and roll each one into a 5 inch circle. Fill each one, using a scant 2 Tbs. filling and leaving a 1/2-inch border. Place on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. (At this point, can be frozen up to 2 weeks.)
Brush tops with oil. Bake until golden, 16 to 20 minutes (longer if frozen). Makes 20.

Description: 
Go deep this Super Bowl Sunday: Serve empanadas. These turnovers are perfect 'finger food' -- no knife and fork required. And because the recipes use refrigerated biscuit dough, it's an easy score. All you have to do is make the fillings.
