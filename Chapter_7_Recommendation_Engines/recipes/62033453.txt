Ingredients:
For the Coconut-Mint Mayo:
1 cup regular mayonnaise
1/4 cup shredded coconut, diced more finely
1 tbl. chopped fresh mint
For the Thai Chicken Burgers:
2 lbs. ground chicken
2.5 cups panko
2 tbl. minced green onion
2 tbl. minced parsley
1/2 cup Thai spicy peanut sauce
2 tbsp. thai red chili curry paste (A Taste of Thai brand works well)
2 tsp. soy sauce
3 cloves minced garlic
2 tsp. lemon juice
2 tsp. lime juice
3 tsp. hot sauce
canola oil
butter

Directions:
1.  Combine the mayo ingredients, and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.
2.  Mince and/or chop the green onion, parsley and garlic.
2.  Combine all of the burger ingredients into a large bowl and mix well -- do not overmix or "crush" the chicken.
3.  Shape into eight equally-sized balls.  Gently form into patties about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
4.  Barbecue until done, or, if pan-cooking, add small amounts of canola oil and butter to a large skillet on medium heat.  Add the patties, browing both sides quickly.  Flip to original side, cook seven minutes, flip and finish with another seven minutes.
5.  Toast rolls, combine burgers with chilled mayo mixture, and enjoy.
