Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package firm tofu
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1/3 cup chopped scallion stems
1/4 cup finely chopped crab
1/4 cup soy sauce, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Chop tofu into thin squares approximately 1 1/4 by 1/2 inch. Season one side of tofu squares with salt and pepper.
Place flour in a shallow dish and place beaten egg in a separate shallow dish. Coat tofu with flour first, then with egg, and place on a third dish. Reserve leftover beaten egg.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tofu in the hot oil for 2 minutes; sprinkle scallion on top. Flip tofu, brush remaining egg on top and sprinkle with crabmeat. Heat 2 minutes more and flip again. Brush again with egg, cook 2 minutes. Flip and coat again, for a total of 2 to 3 times. Reduce heat or cook for less time if egg coating is in danger of burning.
Pour soy sauce into a bowl and serve with tofu.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe I got from a Korean college friend of mine. She made it for a cultural event on campus, and it was a hit! It has plenty of ummph to counteract the blandness of the tofu. Also, this frying style is typical Korean.  According to my friend you can fry just about anything this way (she also made zucchini and a vegetable-crab pancake this way).
