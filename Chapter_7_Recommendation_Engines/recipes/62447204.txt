Ingredients:
16 oz of Marshmallows
2lbs of Powdered Sugar
1-2 Tsp Water

Directions:
Put 16 oz of marshmallows into a microwave safe bowl and set microwave on high setting for 30 seconds. Add 1-2 Tbs of water (I use about 1 1/2 Tbs- to much water makes the fondant to stretchy and sticky) Grease a large spoon with Crisco and the stir the marshmallows and keep melting in 30 second increments until marshmallows are smooth and creamy.
Begin adding the powdered sugar 1/2 lb at a time until the full 2lbs of p.sugar is incorporated into the marshmallows.
At this stage the mixture gets gummy and sticky so grease up your hands with Crisco and begin kneading it for about a minute. Then put some Crisco on your work surface (make sure it's clean)and place the fondant onto the surface then begin kneading the fondant more until it is smooth and dough like.
If you want you can add food coloring gel to create colored fondant. I use the Wilton food coloring gels but always remember to wear gloves to keep the color off your skin.
You can then grease your work surface lightly with Crisco and roll the fondant out and place over cake that has been covered with frosting.
