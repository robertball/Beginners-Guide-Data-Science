Ingredients:
2 cans artichoke hearts quartered, drained
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 container cherry or grape tomatoes
1 tablespoon coconut oil
2 cups vegetable broth
3 cups baby spinach
1 pound De Cecco penne pasta
1 1/2 teaspoon Simply Organic dried basil
1/2 teaspoon Simply Organic oregano
1/4 teaspoon Simply Organic red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon Simply Organic dried parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Heat a large saut√© pan over medium heat, add coconut oil. Then add spinach, artichokes, garlic and cook until the garlic is tender, about 2 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, broth, wine, Boil over medium-high heat until the sauce reduces slightly, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the penne in boiling water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring often, about 8 minutes.
Drain the pasta (do not rinse). Add the pasta, basil, parsley, oregano, and red pepper flakes to the artichoke mixture. Toss until the sauce is almost absorbed by the pasta. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Recently I have been experimenting with different recipes and I wanted to take one of my signature Italian dishes and reconstruct them so anyone can enjoy. I took a typical penne dish and put a vegan and also vegetarian twist on it. My family loved this  meal and were shocked that it was vegan!
