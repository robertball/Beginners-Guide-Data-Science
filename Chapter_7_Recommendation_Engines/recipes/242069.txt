Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79591.png
Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package brownie mix (such as Betty CrockerÂ®)
2/3 cup vegetable oil
2 eggs
1/4 cup water
1 (16 ounce) package prepared chocolate frosting
1 (1.5 ounce) tube red decorating gel
1 (12 ounce) package vanilla wafer cookies

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch square baking pans.
Mix brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water together in a bowl until batter is smooth; spread into the prepared pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until brownies are cooked through and edges are beginning to pull away from sides of pan, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool brownies.
Cut cooled brownies with a shot glass or small cookie cutter so they are slightly larger than the vanilla wafer. Put a small dot of chocolate frosting on the bottom and top of each "burger".
Make a rim around half of 60 vanilla wafer "top buns" with red gel representing the ketchup. Sandwich the "burger" with 2 vanilla wafers, with the "ketchup" wafers on top.

Description: 
This is the most adorable and unique snack for your child to take to school on their birthday or for a special treat day.  You will be the star mommy for coming in with a tray of these bite-size burgers! The vanilla wafers are the exact shape and color of a hamburger bun and the brownie looks just like a grilled hamburger when sandwiched between the vanilla wafers. We love 'ketchup' on our brownie hamburgers; but you could use yellow icing for 'mustard' or green icing for 'relish'.
