Ingredients:
1 package (500g) of shoestring potatoes
3 cuts (350g) of drye salted Cod Fish
2 tablespoons of minced parseley
1 large onion thinly sliced
5 eggs
3 cloves of garlic smashed
1dl of olive oil
1 pinch of salt
40ml of milk

Directions:
At the previous day put the cuts of Cod fish in a large bowl full of fresh water, skin side up, changing the water 3 times on a period of 24h.
Boil the Cod Fish for 20 min, take it from the pan and let it get cold. Discard the skins and bones and ripe it into very small hair-like pieces. Reserve it.
In a little bowl, beat the eggs with the milk and season with salt and pepper.
On a large casserole pour in the olive oil, the sliced onion and the cloves of garlic and let it cook in medium heat until the onion is smooth and translucent.
Add the Cod Fish and let it cook for 5 minutes stirring frequently so it doesn't stick. Turn into low heat
Very slowly drop small quantities of shoestring potatoes at a time, stirring, so they get more smooth and keep on doing this until they're all in the casserole and smooth as possible, mix well.
Turn off the heat of the cooktop and add the beaten eggs, stirring and mixing well until the shoestring potatoes are absolutely smooth.
Turn on the heat again, low, and cook for one more minute always stirring the mixture with letting the eggs cook.
Serve in a table platter with the parseley sprinkled on top.
