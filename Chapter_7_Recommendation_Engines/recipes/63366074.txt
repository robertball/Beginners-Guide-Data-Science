Ingredients:
1 pound ground venison
1 medium sweet or yellow onion, chopped
1 tablespoon EVOO (optional)
15 ounce can tomato sauce
14 1/2 ounce can petite diced tomatoes
15 1/2 ounce can chili beans in sauce (mild, hot or hot and spicy to your heat level of taste)
14 - 16 ounce can pinto beans (or may use black beans, kidney beans, small red beans or small white beans)
4 ounce can chopped green chilies
3 - 4 tablespoons chili powder (add or subtract amount to your heat preference)

Directions:
Heat EVOO in large pot over medium high heat. Crumble and brown the venison with the onions until no longer pink. Add remaining ingredients (I do not drain and rinse the beans, but you may if you like). Bring to a good simmer and turn down heat to low. Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours uncovered. Stir occasionally.
This is great served over cooked macaroni with American cheese or any other cheese of choice. Also may like to top with sour cream, chopped raw onions, sliced black olives and/or crackers. I always serve with a side of homemade cornbread! We especially like leftovers when flavors have had time to develop even farther.
