Ingredients:
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 garlic clove, minced
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
3/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound beef flank steak

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Cut an 1/8-in.-deep diamond pattern into both sides of steak. Place in the bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight.
Drain and discard marinade. Place steak on a broiler pan. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 7-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
