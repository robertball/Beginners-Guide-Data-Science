4 chicken breast (4.8 oz each)
12 fresh sage leaves
4 slices baby swiss cheese
1/4 cup zesty italian salad dressing
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon butter
salt
pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease baking dish or pan with butter or line with non-stick aluminum foil to prevent any food from sticking to the pan.
Pound chicken breast lightly in order to flatten enough to roll up. On a dinner plate mix bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Season bread crumb mixture with salt and pepper.
Place 1 slice of swiss cheese along with 3 sage leaves on top of each chicken breast. Roll each and secure with toothpick.
Coat each chicken breast in italian dressing then coat all sides well with bread crumb mixture.
Place in baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.
