Ingredients:
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1/3-1/2 cup Nutella
1/2 cup butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 (degrees Farenheit.)In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix ingredients together with a whisk. In a microwave safe bowl, put in the butter and microwave until soft. After butter is softened, add vanilla and egg to it. Stir together with a fork. Pour liquid mixture into dry mixture. Stir with a spoon unil well combined; batter should be thick, but easy to stir. Then add Nutella; you can add either 1/3 or 1/2 cup depending on how much chocolate you want. Stir until all ingredients are combined. Grease an 8x8 pan and coat the inside with flour. This prevents the brownies from sticking to the pan. Bake for 30 minutes. When they are done, they have a wonderful golden top and firm center.(test with toothpick) This is such a wonderful treat. Enjoy!
