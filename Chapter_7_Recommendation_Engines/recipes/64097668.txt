2 Tbsp dark brown sugar
1 tsp minced fresh garlic*
1 tsp dijon mustard
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup olive oil

Directions:
Beat the vinegar in a bowl with the brown sugar,  garlic, mustard, salt and pepper until sugar and salt dissolves.
Beat in the oil by droplets, whisking constantly. (Or place all the ingredients in a screw-top jar and shake to combine.) Taste and adjust the seasonings.
If not using dressing right away, cover and refrigerate, whisking or shaking again before use.
