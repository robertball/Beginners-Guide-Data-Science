Ingredients:
1 eggs
2/3 cups milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
powder sugar for dusting

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix salt, baking powder, and flour. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream eggs, sugar and milk. Add flour mixture and beat until smooth. Batter will be thin enough to run through a funnel.
In an eight inch skillet, heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Put your finger over the bottom opening of the funnel, and fill the funnel with a generous 1/2 cup of the batter. Hold the funnel close to the surface of the oil, and release the batter into the oil while making a circular motion. Fry until golden brown about 2 minutes. Use tongs and wide spatula to turn the cake over carefully. Fry the second side one to two minutes. Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with sifted confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar.
