Ingredients:
1 pound rump roast
coarse salt to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 cup bitter orange marinade (such as Goya® Naranja Agria)
3/4 cup garlic marinade (such as Goya® Mojo Criollo)
1 yellow onion, sliced
4 large cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
1/2 tablespoon ground cumin

Directions:
Cut roast into 4 quarters and season liberally with salt and pepper. Place a large cast iron pan over high heat and coat with olive oil; heat until smoking. Place meat in the hot pan and turn to sear on all sides until a crust forms, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer seared meat to a slow cooker.
Add bitter orange marinade, garlic marinade, onion, garlic, and cumin to the slow cooker. Make sure meat is mostly covered in marinade.
Cook on Low for 6 hours; shred meat in the slow cooker using tongs or a fork. Continue cooking on Low for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add additional salt or cumin if desired.

Description: 
I threw this recipe together using a slow cooker and flavors my Cuban stepfather always cooked with. It's easy and full flavored. Pairs great with rice or plantains.
