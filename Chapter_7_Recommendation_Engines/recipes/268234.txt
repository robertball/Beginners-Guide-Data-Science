Description: 
My version of traditional Eastern European beet root soup, made without animal products and to be cooked in an Instant Pot®. It's very easy to make: Just cut and prepare the veggies, put them into the pot, and start the Soup program. Then you can go do other stuff. 

This recipe yields about 5 or 6 liters of borscht. Lasts me a week. By the way, it's often said that borscht gets tastier in the refrigerator.
