Ingredients:
2 teaspoons olive oil
1/2 medium sweet onion, diced
6 chanterelle mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon butter, or as needed
2 cloves garlic, pressed
3 cups vegetable broth
2 cups cubed peeled butternut squash in 1/2-inch pieces
1 bay leaf
ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch curry powder
5 leaves kale, stems removed, thinly sliced
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and add mushrooms and salt. Cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
Stir butter into mushrooms and let melt fully. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add broth, squash, and bay leaf. Season with pepper and curry powder. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and partially cover the pot. Cook until squash is soft, about 15 minutes.
Stir kale into the pot and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste, if desired.

Description: 
This is a lovely broth-based butternut squash soup that screams out 'fall!' I used chanterelle mushrooms, but shiitakes or any other wild mushrooms will work great too!
