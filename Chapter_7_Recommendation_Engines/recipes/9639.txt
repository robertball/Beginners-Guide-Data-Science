Ingredients:
1 cup raisins
1 cup rum
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup shortening

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine raisins and rum. Use enough rum to completely cover raisins. Let stand for 30 minutes or up to overnight.  Drain the raisins and transfer to another bowl.  Add the flour and toss, thoroughly coating raisins.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degree C).
In a medium bowl, cream the shortening, and sugar.  Add eggs one at a time, mixing well.  Add the raisin/flour mixture and stir until well blended.
Drop the dough by spoonfuls 2 inches apart onto cookie sheets and bake 4 to 6 minutes, until lightly colored.  Let cool on wire racks.
