Ingredients:
3 tablespoons cooking oil
1 large green bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 pounds sirloin roast, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
3 (15 ounce) cans chili beans
2 (15 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
3 cups water
2 tablespoons mild chili powder
3 tablespoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, or more to taste
2 tablespoons salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
lime, juiced
6 drops Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir the green bell peppers, onion, and garlic in the hot oil until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sirloin roast to the pepper mixture and continue cooking until the beef is completely browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
Stir the chili beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, chili powder, cumin, nutmeg, salt, black pepper, lime juice, and Worcestershire sauce into the pot; reduce heat to medium-low and cook 3 to 5 hours. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before chilling in refrigerator overnight.
Before serving, return pot to stove over medium-low heat; cook another 3 to 4 hours.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe the first week of October, when I was participating in a chili cook-off in Mountain Home, ID. Came out great and every judge and taster enjoyed it. It will have the authentic chili flavor with a little 'twist.' This recipe should be started the night before you wish to serve it.
