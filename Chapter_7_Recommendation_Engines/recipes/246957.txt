Ingredients:
3 cups milk chocolate morsels
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1/4 cup salted butter
1/2 cup chopped almonds
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut

Directions:
Combine milk chocolate, condensed milk, and butter in a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Mix almonds and coconut into melted chocolate. Pour into a 9-inch pan and spread evenly. Pat down to make fudge even. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Cut into squares.

Description: 
A great fudge that disappears quickly and tastes quite similar to the popular candy! Sprinkle almonds and coconut on top of fudge before chilling if desired.
