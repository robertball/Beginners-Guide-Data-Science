Ingredients:
1/4 cup coffee beans
10 cardamom pods, crushed
2 star anise
2 cups water
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup Kahlua
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon sweetened cocoa mix
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Chill whipping cream, and the bowl and wire attachment of a stand mixer.
Mix coffee beans, cardamom pods, star anise and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, immediately reduce heat to low. Simmer over very low heat until the liquid has reduced to half.
While spiced water is reducing, beat the cream with the chilled wire attachment at medium-high speed until it forms soft peaks (1 1/2 minutes). Add sugar and beat until it forms firm peaks (2 to 3 minutes).
Strain coffee to eliminate solids. Stir in the Kahlua and brown sugar. Divide equally among 6 cups.
Top with a swirl of cream, and sprinkle with cocoa and cinnamon.
