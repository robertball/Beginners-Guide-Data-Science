Ingredients:
1 (4 pound) boneless beef brisket
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
3 large onions, thickly sliced
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Parsley sprigs

Directions:
Place beef brisket, fat side up, in 13 x 10-inch roasting pan.  Sprinkle brisket evenly with salt, pepper and garlic; top with onions.
Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour, or until the onions turn brown.  Add one cup of hot water; cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.  Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees, and continue baking 2 hours or until brisket is tender.  Remove brisket and onions to a warm platter.  Skim fat from juices.
To make gravy, combine one cup of water and cornstarch; add juices to the pan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until gravy thickens.
Carve brisket across the grain into two slices.  Serve brisket and onion with gravy.  Garnish with parsley and cherry tomatoes.
