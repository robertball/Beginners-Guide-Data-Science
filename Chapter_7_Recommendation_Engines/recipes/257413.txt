Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup white sugar
1/3 cup brown sugar
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup whole milk
1/3 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2/3 cup chocolate chips (optional)

Directions:
Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Add milk, butter, and vanilla extract; stir with a wooden spoon until dough is combined. Fold in chocolate chips.
Turn dough out on a large piece of plastic wrap; roll into a log and wrap up tightly. Freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Cut dough with a wet knife; it will be sticky.
