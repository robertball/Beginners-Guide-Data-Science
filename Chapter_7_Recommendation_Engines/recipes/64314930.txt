Ingredients:
4 Large onions
2 Green Peppers seeded
1/4 cup salt
3 1/2 cups vinegar
3 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 tsp powder cloves
3 1/2 tsp mustard seed
4 1/2 pounds of small tender okra to fit (in pint jars) whole with the caps trimmed at a slight angle but not into the seed cavity.

Directions:
Wash and allow to dry okra and set aside after trimming the caps remember at an angle and do not cut into the seed cavity.
Grind onions and peppers. I use my food processor. pour into large bowl sprinkle 1/4 cup of salt (I prefer canning salt) over all. Sit a plate or something smaller than the bowl down on top of onion mixture and weight it down as to mash the mix. wait 3 hrs.
In large colander drain well.
in large pot mix vinegar, sugar, spices heat to dissolve sugar. Add okra to mix cook over low heat until VERY HOT BUT DO NOT BOIL. Put okra in jars I try to stand mine up some as to utilize every bit of space then pour in some onion and pepper mixture. water bath 10 minutes. For whatever reason these seem harder to get to seal than most things I have found if I use my steamer pot with the 1 1/2 inch steamer tray in the bottom I get a much better seal rate. NOW FOR THE HARDEST PART SIT IN A DARK PLACE FOR FOUR MONTHS! Then be ready they are awesome.
