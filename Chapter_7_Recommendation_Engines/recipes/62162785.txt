Ingredients:
1       14-ounce can of quartered artichokes, drained
1       lemon, juiced
2     tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1 tsp   Salt, or to taste
1 tsp   Black Pepper, or to taste
1 tsp   Italian seasoning
2     cloves of garlic, chopped (optional)

Directions:
In a sealable plastic container, add all of the ingredients except for the drained artichokes.
Seal the container.
Shake the container to emulsify the oil and lemon juice mixture.
Remove the lid and add the artichokes.
Reseal the lid and continue shaking the container until the artichokes are completely coated with the marinade.
Enjoy immediately or chill the marinated artichokes for at least an hour before serving.

Description: 
Store-bought marinated artichokes are too expensive and are consumed faster than the time it takes to open the jar. I created this recipe with simple ingredients that are already found in the kitchen. It's delicious by itself, but feel free to experiment and even make your own artichoke salad. It's not like the real deal...it's better!
