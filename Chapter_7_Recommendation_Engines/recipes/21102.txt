Ingredients:
1/2 pound butter, melted
1 2/3 cups white sugar
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice
salt and pepper to taste
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste
1 pinch ground nutmeg
4 cups bread cubes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease an 8x10 inch casserole dish.
In a medium bowl combine butter, sugar, pineapple, salt, pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg; mix well.  Place bread cubes in the bottom of the casserole dish and pour pineapple mixture on top.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until golden brown and set throughout.  If the top browns too fast, before the center is set, cover the dish with aluminum foil until it sets.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I couldn't believe it when I saw your request Billie. This is a recipe my mom used to make many years ago.  She usually served it with ham or roasted chicken.  It was great.  Hope this is what you were looking for.
