2 1/2 cups dry pancake mix
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup water
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Preheat waffle iron.
In a bowl, mix the pancake mix and whole wheat flour. Form a well in the center, and pour in water, oil, and syrup. Stir until evenly moist. Stir in the milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. Fold in walnuts.
Pour about 1/3 cup batter per waffle into the waffle iron, and cook 5 minutes, until done. Transfer waffles to a baking dish, and place in the preheated oven. Cook 5 minutes, or until crisp.

Description: 
I created this recipe when trying to get my husband to stop eating fast food for breakfast. Crispy on the outside and full of maple walnut flavor on the inside. I make 6 at a time and freeze them -- just pop in the toaster or microwave to reheat. Serve with maple syrup and a sprinkling of walnuts.
