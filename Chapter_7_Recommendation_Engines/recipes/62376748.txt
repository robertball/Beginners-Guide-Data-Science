Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or barley flour)
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1 cup Earth Balance margarine, at room temperature
3/4 packed brown sugar
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup soft silken tofu, drained
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 cup vegan chocolate chips
3/4 cups chopped walnuts or pecans

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
In medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In mixer, combine margarine, sugars, tofu, and vanilla. Beat until light and fluffy, stopping to scraped down the sides of the bowl.  Add the dry ingredients and beat well. Fold in the chocolate chips and nuts with a spatula.
Using a 1-ounce cookie scoop or large spoon, place scoops of cookie dough on the baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Bake until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes.
Using a spatula, transfer the cookies from the baking sheet to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
