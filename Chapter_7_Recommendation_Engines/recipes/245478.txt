Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
1 small onion, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon chopped green chile pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine ground turkey, onion, garlic, cilantro, egg, chile pepper, coriander, paprika, chili powder, and salt together in a large bowl; mix thoroughly.
Divide turkey mixture into twelve 1/4-cup portions, roll into log-shaped ovals, and place on a baking sheet.
Grill ovals over indirect heat on middle rack, turning occasionally, until no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
My Persian neighbor introduced me to kofta about 20 years ago. His were made of beef and I never actually got his recipe but I'm pretty good at replicating flavors and these came pretty  close...and of course using turkey instead of beef makes these a lot lighter.
