Roasted Herb Potatoes Recipe

Ingredients:
5 pounds Yukon potatoes
6 tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature
3 sprigs creeping red thyme (or regular thyme), + extra for garnish
3 sprigs marjoram, + extra for garnish
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon sea salt (or Kosher salt)
4 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground

Directions:
Seasoning the potatoes: Gather the marjoram and thyme leaves and finely chop them. In a bowl, combine the butter, garlic powder, 2 teaspoons of salt and the herbs. Stir well. Add the olive oil and black pepper. The mixture should be creamy and easy to spread.
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
Boiling the potatoes: Wash the potatoes and cut them into 3-inch chunks (no need to peel the potatoes). Place them in a large pot. Fill it with cold water until the potatoes are barely covered. Bring to a boil, add 1 teaspoon of salt and reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook for about 20-23 minutes. The potatoes should be fork-tender but still firm. Remove from the pot. Drain the potatoes and let them cool a little. Remove the skin if it's peeling off (so it doesn't burn in the oven). Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle and dry, add the herb-flavored butter. Toss well.
Roasting the potatoes: Place the potatoes on an oiled baking sheet. Roast for about 30-35 minutes. When there's a nice brown crust, your potatoes are ready!
