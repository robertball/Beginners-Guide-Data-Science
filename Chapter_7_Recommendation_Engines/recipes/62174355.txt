Ingredients:
•2 Large Potatoes, I used Yukon Gold, shredded, rinsed well and squeezed dry.
•Flour- just enough to dust potatoes.
•2-4 slices of bacon.
•1 small onion-minced.
•1/2 tsp. salt.
•1/4 tsp pepper.
•5 oz. fresh chopped spinach (frozen is also okay...just thaw and squeeze dry).

Directions:
In a large non stick skillet over medium heat, cook bacon til crisp. Remove bacon, leaving drippings in skillet.
Saute onions in drippings til tender.
Add spinach and cook til wilted.
Crumble bacon and add back to skillet with shredded and flour dusted potatoes. If skillet is too dry add a little olive oil.
Add salt and pepper. Then mix everything together til well blended.
Spread mixture to cover bottom of skillet in a thin layer. Press slightly and let cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.
Cut this mixture into 4 equal pieces and flip each piece.
Cook another 5 minutes.
Then toss and break up sections to cook the inside of the mixture and brown really well, about another 2-3 minutes.
Taste and adjust salt if needed.
Serve warm.
