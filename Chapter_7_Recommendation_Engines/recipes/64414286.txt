Ingredients:
These were the most delicious potatoes I've ever had, I swear! In Australia their called Crash Hot Potatoes, I don't know why (any Australians have some insight?), whatever the name, they were SO awesome! And super simple, just boil some baby potatoes (I used red) until fork tender. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Drizzle olive oil on a baking sheet, set potatoes on sheet and using a potato masher, gently smash each potato down, rotating masher both ways (so it looks like a thick cookie). Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt/pepper and sprinkle cut fresh herbs and garlic over each. THEN top with some lovely grated Parmesan cheese. Bake for 20 minutes. OMG...crispy on the outside, soft in the middle, salty, garlicky, herby and cheesy goodness. I need to make more now!!
