Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups white sugar
1 cup butter
1 cup sour cream
6 eggs
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Filling
8 ounces thawed cream cheese
3.4 ounces instant pudding mix
1 tablespoon almond extract
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon maple syrup
8 ounce tub Cool Whip
4 Cups Berries
3 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 8x4 inch loaf pan.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add sour cream and eggs.
Add flour and baking soda, mix well. Pour into a 8x4 inch loaf pan, and 8 2x4" mini loaf pans.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30-35 minutes for the mini loafs, 50-60 minutes for the large loaf pan, or until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean.
Filling: Beat cream cheese until smooth. Add pudding mix and beat thoroughly. Add remaining ingredients, beating until smooth.
Mix berries and sugar, allowing to sit for at least 1 hour before serving. (This allows the juices to form.)
For each serving, slice to pieces of pound cake, and put a generous amount of filling in the center.  Top with berries and juice.
