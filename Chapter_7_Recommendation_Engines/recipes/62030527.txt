Description: 
My Sister-in-Law made this & we fell in love with it. When I found out it was EASY, I HAD to have the recipe. This is a SUPER easy soup with great results. A Tex Mex tasting soup that you can kick up to whatever heat you want simply by adding peppers or chili powder. A good soup for Croc Pot ooking  too!
