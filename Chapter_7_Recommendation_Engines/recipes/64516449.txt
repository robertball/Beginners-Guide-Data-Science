Ingredients:
1 8g pkg active dry yeast
2 tbsp. warm water
2 cups warm milk
1/2 cup sugar
1 egg
1 tsp. salt
6 cups flour, or less
3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted

Directions:
In large bowl, dissolve yeast in water.
Add milk, sugar, egg, salt and 3 cups flour; beat until smooth.
Beat in butter and enough remaining flour till your dough is still a bit sticky.
DO NOT KNEAD!
Place in a greased bowl.
Cover and refrigerate overnight or for several hours.
Punch dough down & divide in half.
On a floured surface, roll each half into a 12" circle.
Cut each circle into 12 pie-shaped wedges (cut circle into 1/3's, then each 1/3 in 1/4's = 12!). A pizza cutter works great for this job.
Beginning at the wide end, roll up each wedge.
Place rolls, point side down, 2" apart on greased baking sheets.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake @ 350 x 15 - 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
These yummy buns are quicker to make as they are started the night (or several hours) ahead, waiting in the fridge to be baked. They also make good cinnamon buns.
