Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/4 teaspoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, chopped
4 1/4 ounces coconut milk, divided
4 1/4 ounces water, divided
3 1/2 ounces cod, cut into bite-size pieces
1 large tomato, diced

Directions:
Combine curry powder, ground ginger, and ground turmeric in a skillet; toast the spices over medium heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour olive oil and garlic into the spice mixture and stir to make a paste.
Stir onion into the spice mixture; cook and stir until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir about half the coconut milk and half the water into the onion mixture; simmer together for 5 minutes. Add cod to the mixture; continue cooking until the fish is firm, about 5 minutes. Add tomato, remaining coconut milk, and remaining water to the skillet; cook until the tomato is softened, about 5 minutes.
