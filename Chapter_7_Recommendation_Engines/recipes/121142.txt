Description: 
My daughter-in-law created this recipe and shared it with me. I was delighted, since my husband and I were cutting down on fried foods and that's the way I had always prepared squash. The recipe is versatile...it can easily be enlarged to serve for a family dinner. -Sue Joyce, Winston-Salem, North Carolina
