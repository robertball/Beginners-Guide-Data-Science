Ingredients:
1 tube (8 ounces) refrigerated crescent rolls
1 pound ground chicken (or beef)
1 envelope taco seasoning
1 can (4 ounces) chopped green chilies
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup salsa
1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 cup shredded lettuce
1 small sweet red pepper, chopped
1 small green pepper, chopped
1 medium tomato, seeded and chopped
1 green onion, thinly sliced
2 Tbsp pickled jalapeno slices
Sour cream, additional salsa and or guacamole

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Unroll crescent dough and separate into triangles. Press onto bottom of a greased 9-in. pie plate to form a crust, sealing seams well. Bake 18-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook chicken over medium heat 6-8 minutes or until no longer pink, breaking into crumbles; drain. Stir in taco seasoning, green chilies, water and salsa; bring to a boil.
Spoon into crust; sprinkle with cheese. Bake 8-10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Top with lettuce, peppers, tomato, green onion and pickled jalapeno. Serve with sour cream, additional salsa and guacamole.

Description: 
Something super easy and fast.  I like that it can be made with the chicken or beef and to save some time, brown the meat the night before so it  can be  thrown it together for one of those nights when you know there won't be to be enough time.
