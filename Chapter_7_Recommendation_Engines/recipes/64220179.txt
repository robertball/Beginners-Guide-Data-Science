Ingredients for the Dumplings:
·         1 ½ cups gluten free Bisquick

·         2 eggs
·         ¼ cup melted earth balance soy free non dairy butter
·         1 tbsp parsley
·         1/8 tsp salt

Directions:
Instructions:
1.      Add the potatoes, onions and garlic to the bottom of a 4-6 quart crock pot.
2.      Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
3.      Add the carrots and celery then add the water, bouillon cubes, and bay leaf to the pot. Cover and cook on high for 6-7 hours or low for 8-10 hours.
4.      Remove the chicken and bay leaf from the pot then stir and taste it to see if it needs more salt and pepper.
5.      Blend 2 cups almond milk with 2 tablespoons bisquick, add to crock pot and whisk. Add the peas, cover and allow the pot to return to a boil while you shred the chicken before returning it to the pot.
6.      For the dumplings if you were cooking your stew on low switch the crock pot to high before starting the dumplings.
7.      In a medium bowl mix the almond milk, eggs, dairy free butter, parsley and salt together until well combined then add the gf Bisquick and stir until just combined.
8.      Drop the dumplings by rounded spoonfuls into the pot.  I used an ice cream scoop with about a ¼ cup measure.  Cover and cook on high for 30 minutes or until the dumplings appear light and fluffy then it’s ready to serve.
