Description: 
Wow, this taste like Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. This is my version of a recipe I found. It's great on anything that that you want a Vanilla Bean taste. This is made with Madagascar Vanilla Bean and not to waste any of the beans.  I cut the used bean in half and added to sugar in a sip lock baggie mixed up. This is great with coffee.My camera is not working so I had to find a picture of the frosting on the internet. See it's white with specs of Vanilla Bean Seeds in it.
