Description: 
Candy sushi is perfect for kids' birthdays or an April Fool's day joke. It is the most yummy thing I've ever made beside my orange Creamsicle® pie. And its very simple, so even my 6-year-old can make it! If you want to be more creative, spread frosting and sprinkles on the top of the circle under the Swedish Fish®!
