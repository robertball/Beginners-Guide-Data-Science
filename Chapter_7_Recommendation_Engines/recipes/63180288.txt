Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 whole onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 whole carrots, sliced in rounds
1 stalk celery, sliced
4 cups chicken broth
2 cups water
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cooked & shredded
1 (4.5 ounce) package quick cooking long grain and wild rice with seasoning packet
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons light margarine
1 cup evaporated skim milk
1 cup reduced fat (2%) milk

Directions:
In a large pot over medium heat, saute onion and garlic in oil until fragrant.  Add carrots and celery and saute until tender.  Add broth, water and chicken.  Bring just to boiling, then stir in rice, reserving seasoning packet.  Cover and remove from heat.
In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper and flour.  In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt margarine.  Stir in contents of seasoning packet until mixture is bubbly.  Reduce heat to low, then stir in flour mixture by tablespoons, to form a roux.  Whisk in milk and evaporated milk, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and smooth.  Cook until thickened, 5 minutes.
Stir milk mixture into broth and rice.  Cook over medium heat until heated through, 10 to 15 minutes.
