Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1/4 cup course ground mustard
2 tbsp fresh minced garlic
2 tsp lemon zest
2 tsp minced fresh thyme
2 tsp anchovy paste
2 tsp honey
salt and pepper to taste
2 12 oz tuna steaks
2 ciabatta buns, halved
green leaf lettuce
tomato slices
4 hard boiled eggs, sliced

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium.  Brush grate with oil.
Whisk together oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, zest, thyme, anchovy paste, and honey.  Season with salt and pepper.  Reserve 3 tbsp for Provincial Beans and Potatoes.
Marinate tuna in 1/4 cup vinaigrette for 10 minutes.  Grill tuna, covered, for 3-4 minutes.  Flip, brush with marinade, and cook to medium-rare, 3-4 minutes more.  Grill ciabatta until toasted, about 1 minutes.
Assemble sandwiches by drizzling 1 tbsp vinaigrette on each ciabatta half.  Top with lettuce, tomato, one egg, and a quarter of the tuna, then drizzle with another 1 tbsp vinaigrette.
