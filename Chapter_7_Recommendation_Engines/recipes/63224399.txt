Creamy Caesar Salad Recipe
Image:

Ingredients:
1 to 3 Cloves garlic (I use 3)
1 Whole Egg
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
2 Tbsp. Lemon juice
3 tsp. Anchovy paste
1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard
Dash of Fresh Pepper
1 Cup Salad Oil (not olive oil)
*******************
1/2 Cup Parmesan cheese
1 cup croutons
1/2 Cup Grated Mozzarella cheese
1 large head Romaine lettuce

Directions:
Put the first 7 ingredients in the blender, adding as much garlic as desired (the more the better for me). Add about 1/4 cup of the oil and blend on low and then turn up blender to high speed. With the blender running, add the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream.  Pour into a jar (or use spatula, it is thick!) and let sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.
Wash lettuce thoroughly, drain off excess water and tear into bite sized pieces. In a large bowl add the lettuce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and the croutons.  Pour dressing over the top and toss.  Serve immediately.
