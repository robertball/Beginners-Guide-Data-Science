6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach

4 cloves garlic, sliced
2 (4.5 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and add spinach and salt and pepper to taste. Saute spinach for 5 to 7 minutes or until wilted and no longer watery. Remove spinach from skillet and toss with pasta; transfer and keep warm.

I made this with my fiancee for a fancy New Year's Eve dinner. If you use sea scallops and not bay scallops, cut them into quarters before adding them to the pasta.
