Ingredients:
1 med. onion, finely chopped.		1 stalk celery, finely chopped.		3-4 garlic cloves, minced.		2 cups crushed BBQ potato chips.	1 1/2 lbs. ground chuck.		2 eggs.				1 tsp. salt.				1 tsp. Natures Own seasoning.
1 Tbsp. Mrs. Dash Table blend.
2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce.
1/2 cup milk.
Meatloaf glaze:
1/3 c. ketchup
2 Tbsp. brown sugar
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. You will need one large cookie sheet(to catch the grease) and a small wire rack covered in foil. I poke mine full of holes so the grease drips off the meatloaf.  1.) In skillet over low heat, saute the onion,celery and garlic til soft. About 5-8 minutes. Set aside  2.) In large bowl combine the ground chuck with all ingredients except those for the glaze. Mix well and form into a loaf on the wire rack covered in foil 3.)  In small bowl mix together the ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce. Pour this over the meatloaf to coat it well. Place the rack on your cookie sheet and bake in your preheated oven for 60-70 minutes. Let it set for about 5-10 minutes prior to slicing.
