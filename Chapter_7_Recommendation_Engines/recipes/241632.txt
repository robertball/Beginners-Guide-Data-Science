Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped onion
2 cups water
1 cup white rice
1 cup whole kernel corn

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute celery and onion in olive oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir water, rice, corn, chicken bouillon, and salt with the celery mixture. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a lid on the saucepan, and cook until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Leave covered and let sit off heat until the liquid is completely absorbed, about 10 minutes more.
