Ingredients:
1 - 8oz block of neufchatel cheese
4 tbs margarine (Yes, margarine. Not butter.)
Splash of vanilla
Approx 2 cups of powdered sugar

Directions:
In large bowl, cream together the neufchatel cheese, margarine, and vanilla.
Start to add powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time. Beat thoroughly between each addition. Once about one cup of powdered sugar has been added, taste to see if frosting is sweet enough. If not, continue to add sugar in 1/4 cup increments, tasting frequently. Stop adding sugar once frosting reaches desired sweetness. You may not need the full 2 cups.

Description: 
The key to making the perfect cream cheese frosting is to gradually add the powdered sugar. Most recipes tell you to dump in a certain amount of sugar all at once and mix. The right way, however, is to add a little at a time until you reach your desired sweetness.
