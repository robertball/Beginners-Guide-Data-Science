Ingredients:
5 chicken thighs
2 quarts water
4 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 stalks celery, chopped
6 carrots, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach
4 ounces thin egg noodles
8 ounces meat tortellini

Directions:
Fill a large pot with water and place chicken thighs in the pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until meat falls from the bone, 45 minutes.  Remove chicken, cut up meat and return meat to the pot.
Stir in chicken bouillon, onion, garlic, celery, carrots and bell pepper; simmer until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in frozen spinach and cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Cook egg noodles in water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.  Drain and reserve.
Stir tortellini into soup and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.  Stir in reserved egg noodles, salt and pepper.  Heat through and serve.
