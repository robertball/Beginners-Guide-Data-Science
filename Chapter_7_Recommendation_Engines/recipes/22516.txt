Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups peeled, seeded and chopped mango
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup shredded coconut

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans.
In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, oil and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition, then stir in the vanilla.  Blend this mixture into the flour mixture; just to combine. Fold in the mango, raisins, walnuts and coconut; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
Let stand for 20 minutes then bake in preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.

Description: 
I never particularly cared for mangos until I tried this recipe. This recipe came from a friend in Hawaii and is the only bread I now make.
