1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons molasses

Broil the steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Arrange on a platter to serve.

Description: 
A quick and easy, very tasty version of the teriyaki steak-on-a-stick that you get from a Chinese restaurant. It's great as an appetizer or even as finger food at a football watching party! I also use it for just plain old regular steaks to grill! Either way, it's awesome! My uncle came up with the recipe and gave it to my mother, who passed it on to me! LOVE it!
