Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked quinoa
1 cup oats
1/2 cups coconut
1 cup combination of nuts and dried fruit (I used just pecans in the pictures above)
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup peanut butter
3/4 cup honey
1 TBL  oil
3 TBL Brown Sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a ceramic or glass 9X13 inch baking dish.  Spread oats and quinoa on a cookie sheet and toast in preheated oven for 8 minutes. Return mixture to a large bowl and add coconut, nuts, and dried fruit.  In a medium saucepan, combine salt, peanut butter, honey, oil, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat and immediately remove from heat. Pour over oats mixture and combine until dry ingredients are evenly coated. Pour into baking dish. Press mixture down into pan.Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool for up to 2 hours and then cut and serve.  (Oven times may vary! Watch your bars carefully to not burn them!)  Once they are browned on the edges, you can take them out.
For a tastier treat, we took:
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 TBL oil
Melted in the microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring until melted.  Cut the granola bars, and dipped each one in the chocolate, and let sit on a piece of parchment paper until it hardened.
