Ingredients:
1 lbs beef round
1 Tablespoon oil
1 Tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed
1 Tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon garlic, minced
1/2 cup sour cream
3/4 teaspoons dijon mustard

2 Tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Remove fat from steak.
Combine peppercorns, butter and garlic and spread evenly on both sides of the steak.
Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the steak and brown on both sides to desired degree of doneness. Allow 5 minutes for rare and 7 to 8 minutes for medium rare.
Place on serving platter and keep warm.
Add the broth to the pan.
Cook over high heat, scraping all the particles off the bottom, until reduced to 1/4 of a cup.
Add the sour cream and mustard, continue cooking to reduce to the thickness of gravy.
Just before serving stir in the Parsley.
Cut the steak diagonally across the grain into thin slices, pour sauce over the top and serve immediately.

Description: 
After watching several famous TV cooks making Steak Au Poivre with expensive cuts of beef, heavy cream and congac, I decided to try for a less fussy version.  This is really tasty and very economical.
