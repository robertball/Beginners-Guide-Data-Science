Ingredients:
2 (1 1/4 pound) beef flank steaks
1 cup teriyaki sauce
1 cup pineapple juice
1/2 cup cooking oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 tablespoon bottled minced garlic
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1 recipe Marsala Sauce (recipe follows)

Directions:
Score flank steaks by making shallow cuts 1 inch apart diagonally across steaks. Repeat on other side of steaks. Place meat in a plastic bag. Set bag in a shallow dish.
In a bowl, combine teriyaki sauce, pineapple juice, oil, onion, garlic and rosemary. Pour over meat in bag.
Seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator up to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Remove meat from marinade and place on the unheated rack of a broiler pan. Discard marinade. Broil meat 3 inches from heat for 6 minutes. Turn and broil for 6 to 8 minutes more for medium-rare (145 degrees F.).
To serve, thinly slice meat diagonally across the grain. Serve with Marsala Sauce.
Marsala Sauce: In a medium saucepan cook 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion and 1/2 teaspoon bottled minced garlic in 1 teaspoon olive oil until vegetables are tender. Add 1/2 cup dry Marsala wine or beef broth; bring to boiling. Cook, uncovered, about 5 minutes or until mixture is reduced to half (about 1/3 cup). Add 1 cup beef stock or beef broth and 1/4  cup tomato puree. Stir in one 1.2-ounce package demi-glace sauce mix. Bring to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil gently for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Makes about 1-3/4 cups.
