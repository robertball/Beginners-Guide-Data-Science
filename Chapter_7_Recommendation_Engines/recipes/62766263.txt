Ingredients:
2 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon white sugar (can use splenda)
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla (1 1/2 if using real vanilla)
4 ripe banana's mashed real fine

Directions:
Combine flour, white sugar, vanilla,  baking powder and salt (I sift the dry ingredents). In a separate bowl, mix together egg, milk, vegetable oil and bananas.
Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.
