Ingredients:
For Guacamole:
2 ripe avocados
1/2 small onion, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 jalapeño, minced (stems/seeds removed)
2 tablespoons cilantro leaves, finely diced
1 tablespoon lime juice (fresh best)
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
freshly grated black pepper (to taste)
1 Roma tomato, finely chopped
For Grilled Cheese Sandwiches
4 slices Texas Toast Bread (or regular white bread if have to use)
4 slices Cheddar cheese (I used Harvarti instead and great mix of flavors)
Butter for bread

Directions:
For guacamole mix-cut avocados in half and remove seed. In large mixing bowl, add scooped out avacado and mash. Add onion, garlic, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, salt and pepper. Mix until well combined then add chopped roma tomato and stir.
Heat a skillet to medium-high heat.
Spread desired amount of guacamole on both slices of bread then top with cheese of choice (telling you Harvarti...the best).
Butter outer slices of bread and brown on one side for about 2-3 minutes or till golden brown. Flip the sandwich and skillet again till golden brown.
Option: I always serve with tomato soup...of course!
