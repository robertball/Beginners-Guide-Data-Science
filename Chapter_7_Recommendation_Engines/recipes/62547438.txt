Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Butter
2 Cloves Garlic finely minced
Dash of salt and pepper
Pinch dried Dillweed or Parsley
Dash Paprika
4 Tilapia Fillets

Directions:
In saucepan, combine butter, garlic, pepper, salt, dillweed, and paprika. Heat over low heat until butter is melted and starts simmering. Remove from heat.
Brush a little of the butter mixture in the bottom of a shallow baking dish (line baking dish with foil, if desired) then place tilapia fillets on the buttered area. Brush top of each tilapia fillet with the seasoned butter mixture.
Bake at 350Â° for 12 to 15 minutes, until tilapia flakes easily with a fork.
