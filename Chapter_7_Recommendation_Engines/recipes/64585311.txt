Ingredients:
5 - 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts
1/2 stick of butter
1/2 c Frank's Red Hot Hot Sauce
1 pk Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing Mix
1/2 c  Mayonnaise
1/2 c milk
1 16oz container sour cream
2-4 Tbsp Heavy Cream
1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese
2Tbsp yellow mustard

Directions:
Thinly slice chicken breasts.  Melt butter over medium heat and simmer the sliced chicken breasts in the butter.  When chicken is cooked stir in the ranch dressing mix, mayo, milk, and mustard.  Let this simmer for 10 - 15 minutes.   Stir in sour cream, Parmesan cheese and bring back to a bubbling simmer.  Add heavy cream to reach a gravy like consistency.  Let sit for a minute or two before serving over rice / noodles.  My family likes to eat this over rice cooked with chicken stock, onions, and garlic, with added crushed potato chips over the top.
Notes:  Milk can be substituted for heavy cream.  Hot sauce can be increased or decreased to reach desired level of heat.  A little white wine can be used to cut the richness of this dish.

Description: 
This is a delicious fusion recipe my husband and I discovered.  It's a blend of American Hot Wing flavors with Brazilian Stroganoff flavors.  We serve ours Brazilian style over savory rice with crushed potato chips on top, but the sauce is also good with noodles, tortilla chips, potatoes, or any carbohydrate.  Recipe is easily adjusted to be more or less spicy.
