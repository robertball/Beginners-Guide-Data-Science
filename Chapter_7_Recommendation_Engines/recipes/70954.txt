1 teaspoon olive oil
1 pound shark steaks, cut into chunks

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, cook for 6 to 8 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Mix in the shark, shrimp, and tomatoes with green chiles. Cover, and cook 15 minutes, or until shark is easily flaked with a fork.
