Description: 
We're turning s'mores into the perfect Father's Day-inspired dessert. Your father will associate this pie with so many things men love: building fires, carving pointy sticks, scaring things, and so forth. This has the classic three layers of the s'more: the graham crackers, chocolate, and toasted marshmallows.
