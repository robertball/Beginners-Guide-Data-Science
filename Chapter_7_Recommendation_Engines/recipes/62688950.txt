Ingredients:
2.5 lb sweet Italian sausage links
3 pints cherry tomatoes
1 medium-large onion, cut in 1.5 inch pieces
4 large garlic cloves, sliced
3 T olive oil
1.5 T balsamic vinegar
2 t dried thyme
3 bay leaves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
3 cans white beans, rinsed and drained

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees.
Combine all ingredients except the beans in a large, heavy roasting pan.  Set pan in oven and roast until sausages are brown and tomatoes have reduced to a thick sauce, about 60 minutes, "popping" the tomatoes after about 45.
Remove from oven, stir in beans and roast until mixture has heated through, at least 10 minutes.
Discard bay leaves and serve.
