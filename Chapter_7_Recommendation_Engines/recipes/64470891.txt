Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup coconut oil
2 tablespoons dried, ground kale
1/4 cup + 1/2 cup powdered sugar, divided
1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut
2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Cream together butter, coconut oil, kale powder and 1/4 cup powdered sugar until smooth. Add shredded coconut and flour and mix until combined. Mixture will be somewhat crumbly but should stick together.
Roll dough into 24 balls, approximately 1-1/2 inches in size. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or just until set.
Meanwhile, place 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a wide, shallow dish; set aside.
Remove cookies from oven and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes. Roll each cookie in powdered sugar and set aside until completely cooled.
* If you prefer to use unsweetened shredded coconut, increase Â¼ cup powdered sugar to 1/3 cup and proceed with recipe as directed.
