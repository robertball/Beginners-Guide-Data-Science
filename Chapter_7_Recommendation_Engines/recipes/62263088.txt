Ingredients:
•2lbs Boneless pork butt (2 ½ lbs bone-in)
•1 ½ Tbsp. aleppo pepper
•1 ½ Tbsp chili powder
•¼ tsp.  coriander, ground
•½ tsp. oregano, dried
•¼ tsp. cloves, ground
•½ tsp. cumin, ground
•1 tsp. black pepper, freshly ground
•2 tsp. salt
•4 cloves garlic, minced
•½ cup white vinegar
•2 Tbsp. water
•Meat grinder

Directions:
Cut pork into cubes between ½” and 1”. Combine all spices and garlic (the liquid ingredients will come later). Toss with meat until all meat is well coated and cover. Refrigerate meat, meat grinder head assembly, and hopper for 1 hour.
Before grinding, place a metal bowl into an ice bath and let sit for 5 minute to cool. This bowl will be used to catch the ground meat, and should remain in the ice bath until grinding is finished. Assemble the meat grinder and immediately begin grinding the meat through the coarse cutting plate. After grinding, place meat in refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Remove meat from refrigerator and add vinegar and water. Mix with a fork until fully incorporated into the meat mixture. Form into patties. It is best to wait over night before cooking to let the flavors come out. Cook on medium-low heat until fully cooked and browned, about 10-15 minutes.
Optional: Can be stuffed into natural hog or collagen casings instead of forming patties.
