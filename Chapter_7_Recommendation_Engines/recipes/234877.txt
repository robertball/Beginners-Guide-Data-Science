Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup melted butter
3 1/2 cups peeled and sliced apples
1 1/2 cups blueberries
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup cold water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Grease a microwave-safe 2-quart casserole dish.
Mix flour, brown sugar, oats, graham cracker crumbs, and cinnamon together in a bowl; stir in butter until well mixed. Press 1/2 the oat mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Spread apples and blueberries over oat mixture; drizzle with lemon juice.
Stir white sugar and cornstarch together in a microwave-safe bowl; mix in water and vanilla extract until smooth. Heat sugar mixture in the microwave, stirring every 45 seconds, until sauce is thick and nearly clear, 2 to 4 minutes. Pour sauce over fruit layer and sprinkle remaining oat mixture over top.
Heat in microwave at 70 percent power until fruit is tender and juice is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.
