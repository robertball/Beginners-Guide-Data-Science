Ingredients:
3 cups coarsely chopped fresh rhubarb (about 12 ounces)
2 Tbsp plus 1-3/4 cups sugar, divided
1 cup canola oil
2 large eggs
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup chopped pecans, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Grease and flour two 8x4-in. loaf pans.
Toss rhubarb with 2 tablespoons sugar; let stand while preparing batter.
In a large bowl, beat oil, eggs, vanilla and remaining sugar until well blended. In another bowl, whisk flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon and baking powder; gradually beat into oil mixture (batter will be thick). Stir in rhubarb mixture and, if desired, pecans.
Transfer to prepared pans. Bake 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
I have always had lots of fresh rhubarb from my yard, so I am always looking for ways to make new recipes. To use some of those ruby stalks, I made rhubarb bread with cinnamon and pecans.
