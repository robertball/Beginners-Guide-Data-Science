Ingredients:
1/2 cup milk, low or fat free
1 cup peanut butter, natural or organic
3 cups rolled oats

Directions:
Stir vigorously to combine the first two ingredients in a large bowl.
Slowly stir (and mash) in the oats, about a 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture will be very thick.
Scoop out the peanut butter balls with a cookie scooper. Then roll with damp hands until you create a uniform ball shape.
Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
