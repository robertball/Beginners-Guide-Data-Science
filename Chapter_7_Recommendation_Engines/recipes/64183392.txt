Ingredients:
6 ounces high quality white chocolate (See notes below)
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
1/2 cup high ratio vegetable shortening (See note below)
2 cups pure cane sugar confectioners sugar (See note below)
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions:
Melt chocolate in double boiler, or saucepan over low heat stirring constantly to avoid scorching. Set aside to cool.
Beat the butter and shortening together for 1 minute on high using paddle attachment. Add vanilla and blend in well. Gradually add the confectioners sugar a 1/2 cup at a time, sifting first. Beat in on low to medium speed, scraping sides of bowl as needed. Once chocolate has cooled (it may be a touch warm) add about 1/3 of it and beat in on high. Add remaining chocolate and beat on high for 3 to 4 minutes scraping sides of bowl as needed, until fluffy and light.
