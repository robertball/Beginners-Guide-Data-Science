Description: 
What better way to take advantage than to use up some of our pumpkin puree to make a fall themed smoothie?
Smoothies are so easy to make, which is part of what helps make them awesome in my book. All you need to make one of these is pumpkin puree, banana, milk, cinnamon and add just a touch of raw honey if you desire.
