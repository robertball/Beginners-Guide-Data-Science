Ingredients:
Topping:
6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup margarine, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup grated zucchini
1 cup cranberries
1/2 cup walnut pieces

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with liners.
Mix 6 tablespoons flour and brown sugar together in a bowl for topping; cut butter into the flour mixture until you have pea-sized crumbs. Set aside.
Beat margarine and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat egg and vanilla into the butter mixture.
Mix 1 1/2 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl; gradually beat into the butter mixture. Fold zucchini, cranberries, and walnuts into the mixture; spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling nearly to the top. Sprinkle reserved topping mixture onto the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Steve, my farmer friend, has kept me well supplied with zucchini. I was looking to make an original muffin recipe to thank him that would knock his socks off.
