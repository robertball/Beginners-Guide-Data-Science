Ingredients:
3/4 pint Guinness® stout
1/2 shot Bailey's® Irish cream
1/2 shot Jameson® Irish whiskey

Directions:
Pour Guinness® into a pint glass, 3/4 full. Let some of the foam settle.
Pour the Bailey's® and Jameson® into a single shot glass, layering the Bailey's® on the bottom. [NOTE: Make sure the shot glass is small enough for the pint. I've seen some bartenders use bar-sized shots that get stuck in the glass once they're dropped.]
Drop the shot glass into the pint and chug! If you don't drink fast enough, the concoction curdles and becomes really nasty and undrinkable, so don't waste that delicious Irish stout!
