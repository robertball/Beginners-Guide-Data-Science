Ingredients:
1 teaspoon butter
1 (10 inch) flour tortilla
2 tablespoons peanut butter
2 tablespoons grape jelly

Directions:
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Spread one side of the tortilla with peanut butter. Fold tortilla in half so that the peanut butter is on the inside. Place folded tortilla in the skillet, and heat 2 minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Slice into wedges, and dip in the jelly to serve.
