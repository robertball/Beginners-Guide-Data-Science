Ingredients:
1/2 cup farro
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into strips
1 pinch salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
1 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1 teaspoon sherry vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farro in the boiling water, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 45 minutes; drain.
Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Cook the chicken in hot oil until lightly browned and just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove chicken and set aside.
Pour white wine into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add chicken stock; continue cooking until the volume of liquid reduces by about half. Stir mint, thyme, honey, lemon zest, sherry vinegar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt into the liquid; cook until the volume of the liquid reduces again by about half. Stir cooked farro and chicken into the sauce to coat and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
