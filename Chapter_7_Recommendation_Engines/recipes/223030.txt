Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
¼ cup soy sauce
2 teaspoons minced garlic
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place chicken breasts in a shallow baking dish. Whisk soy sauce, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; pour over chicken, turning to coat. Allow chicken to marinate for 10 minutes.
Whisk honey and lime juice in a bowl; set aside.
Place chicken on preheated grill; brush with marinade. Discard remaining marinade. Cover grill and cook for 5 minutes, then brush both sides with honey lime mixture. Flip chicken and continue cooking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
