Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1  large banana, mashed (1/2 cup)
1/2  cup chunky natural peanut butter (unsalted and unsweetened) or regular chunky peanut butter
1/2  cup sugar free pancake syrup
1  teaspoon vanilla
1  cup rolled oats
1/2  cup whole wheat flour
1/4  cup nonfat dry milk powder (I used buttermilk powder)
2  teaspoons ground cinnamon (I used my homemade pumpkin pie spice)
1/4  teaspoon baking soda
1  cup dried cranberries or raisins (hubbie hates raisins so I used unsweetened cranberries) recipe calls for a cup, but I used less since my husband is a diabetic.

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat two cookie sheets with cooking spray; set aside. In a large bowl, stir together banana, peanut butter, pancake syrup, and vanilla. In a small bowl, combine oats, flour, milk powder, cinnamon, and baking soda. Stir the oat mixture into the banana mixture until combined. Stir in dried cranberries.
Using a 1/4-cup measure, drop mounds of dough 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. With a thin metal or small plastic spatula dipped in water, flatten and spread each mound of dough to a 2 3/4-inch round, about 1/2-inch thick. Once baked, each cookie will be about 3-1/2 to 4 inches in diameter.
Bake, one sheet at a time, for 14 to 16 minutes or until browned. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Store in an airtight container or resealable plastic bag for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 2 months; thaw before serving.

One serving of oats has 2 grams of soluble fiber; according to the Mayo Clinic, 10 grams or more of soluble fiber daily decreases your total and LDL (bad) cholesterol. Revised this recipe from one I found on Heart Healthy Online. ~ SD
