Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups wide egg noodles
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
96 oz (2 large cans) chicken broth (I use 1-low sodium and 1-regular)
1/2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped onion
I also get a bag of shredded carrots and toss in a handful - chopped a bit
3 cups diced, cooked chicken meat

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles and oil, and boil for 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and rinse under cool running water.
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine broth, salt, and poultry seasoning. Bring to a boil. Stir in celery and onion. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 15 minutes.
Stir in noodles and chicken, and heat through.
