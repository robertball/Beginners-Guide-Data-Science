Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 leek, chopped
1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
1 pound ground lamb
1 clove garlic, minced
3/4 cup beef broth
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1/2 teaspoon garlic and herb seasoning blend
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1 bay leaf
3 cups chopped potatoes
1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 head cabbage, cored and shredded

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in leeks and mushrooms until they begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Crumble lamb into skillet, add garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until lamb loses its pink color, about 8 minutes. Drain liquid from pan.
Stir in broth, dill, garlic and herb seasoning blend, pepper, onion powder, bay leaf, and potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until potatoes are almost tender, about 12 minutes. Add tomato sauce and shredded cabbage. Increase heat to medium and simmer, covered, until cabbage is cooked and potatoes are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
Remove bay leaf and serve.

I learned this one from my little Irish Grandmother, so good! Serve this with spinach for a yummy complete meal! While this calls for leek, you can substitute two green onions if you prefer.
