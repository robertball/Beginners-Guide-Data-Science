Ingredients:
16 ounces  elbow macaroni
1 head cauliflower, roughly chopped
1 cup bread crumbs
1/2 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
Kosher salt and pepper
1 onion, finely chopped
1 (8 oz) package grated Sharp Cheddar
1 1/2 cups reduced-fat sour cream
1/2 cup 1 percent milk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

Directions:
Heat oven to 400Â° F. Cook the pasta according to the package directions, adding the cauliflower during the last 3 minutes of cooking time; drain and set aside.
In the pasta pot, turn to medium heat and add the tablespoon of oil. Add the onion, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, just until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in the pasta, cauliflower, cheese, sour cream, milk, and mustard.
Transfer to a shallow 3-quart baking dish, sprinkle with the bread crumbs, and bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
