Ingredients:
3/4 cup dried soy tvp crumbles
3/4 cup boiling water
1/3 cup buckwheat flakes
1 Tbsp curry spice blend, or to taste
1 Tbsp sriracha sauce
1 small carrot
1 small onion
1 stalk of celery
2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
2 Tbsp flaxmeal
5 Tbsp water
1 egg (optional)
1 tbsp olive oil, or more as needed.
Salt and pepper to taste if desired.

Directions:
Mix the boiling water and tvp in a  medium-sized bowl (make sure the bowl can withstand the heat of the boiling water). Set aside and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes.
In a small bowl, mix together the flaxmeal and 5 Tbsp water together with a whisk. Set aside to gel.
In a mini food processor, pulse the carrot, onion, and celery.
Once the tvp has soaked up all the water, add the carrot, onion, and celery mixture and combine. Add curry, sriracha, buckwheat flakes, nutritional yeast, and flaxmeal gel. Mix well. If desired, add egg. Add salt and pepper if desired.
Allow the mixture to rest until set, about 10 minutes. Divide into four equal parts and form into patties.
In a skillet, heat the oil on medium-low. Cook the patties on each side until firm. Donâ€™t flip them too soon or they may fall apart.
Serve with a salad or on a bun with your favorite condiments.
You can use 1/4 cup oatmeal instead of 1/3 buckwheat flakes.
