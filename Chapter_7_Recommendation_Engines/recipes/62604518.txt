Taiwanese Dumplings Recipe

Ingredients:
3-4 Jalapeno peppers
2 lb ground pork
2 Napa (Taiwanese) cabbages OR 2 leeks (no flowers)
1 bundle cilantro
1 medium sized ginger root, peeled
1-2 T black sesame oil
2 egg whites
3-4 packs potsticker (gyoza) wrappers

Directions:
Mince Jalapenos and ginger and put in very large mixing bowl.
Finely chop cabbages/leeks and cilantro.  Wring as dry as possible in a dish towel and add to the mixing bowl.
To vegetables, add sesame oil, egg whites and pork.  Mix thoroughly with hands.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
Cover a cookie sheet with wax paper and prepare a small bowl of water. Hold a dumpling wrapper in your palm and put about a tablespoon in the center (if you're new to this, use a little less until you get used to the folding process... or cheat and use an empanada maker).
Dip your finger in the water and use it to wet the edges of the wrapper.  Fold the sides together at the top (do not seal completely).  Push the bottom of the new sides up to the top middle of the dumpling, then fold the front half forward and seal all edges (see photos; I know the written directions mean almost nothing).
Place the completed dumpling on the cookie sheet.  Line up all dumplings on the sheet, then freeze and bag for later use.
To cook frozen dumplings, boil about 5 minutes, then place in a Pammed skillet and brown on all sides on medium.  If the dumplings have not been frozen, skip the boiling process.
Serve with Lu's Sauce (on this site).
