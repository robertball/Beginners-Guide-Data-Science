Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups rolled oats
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1 Tbsp salt
2 packages (4.5 tsp) active dry yeast
1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees)
5 1/2 cups AP flour

Directions:
Cook oats with 2 cups water about 1 minute, until thick.  Stir in brown sugar, butter, and salt.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm.  In large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add 3 cups flour and the oat mixture.  Stir with wooden spoon.  Gradually mix in 2 more cups of flour by hand.  Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead, adding more flour as necessary.  Continue kneading about 10 minutes.  Gather into ball and place in greased bowl.  Cover with a town and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in bulk - about 1 hour.  Lightly grease 2 9 X 5 loaf pans.  Turn dough out onto floured surface and divide in half.  Roll out each half into an 8 X 12 rectangle.  Roll up from short side, Press ends even and tuck under the loaf.  Place seam side down in each loaf pan.  Brush tops with melted butter, if desired.  Cover with towel and let rise about 1.5 hours, or until sides of dough come to top of pan.  Preheat oven to 375.  Bake loaves for 50-55 minutes, or until crust is deep golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped on bottom.  Turn bread out onto wire racks to cool completely.
