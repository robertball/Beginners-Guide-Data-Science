Country-Style Honey Mustard Recipe

Ingredients:
4 tablespoons yellow mustard seed
4 tablespoons brown mustard seed
6 tablespoons ground mustard powder
1/2 cup almond-fruit flavored soda (such as Dr PepperÂ®)
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional)
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

Directions:
Wash 4 (3 ounce) jars in soap and hot water; dry well.
Pulse yellow and brown mustard seeds a few times in a spice grinder to crack the seeds. (Alternatively, use a blender, rolling pin, mortar and pestle or a small food processor. The key is to crack the seeds to release the flavor.)
Stir together cracked seeds, mustard powder, Dr Pepper(R), honey, salt, thyme, and turmeric (if using) in a bowl. Cover loosely and set aside for 10 minutes for a very spicy mustard or up to 1 hour for a more mellow mustard.
Add vinegar, stirring thoroughly. If a smoother consistency is more to your liking, puree the paste and vinegar in a blender until smooth. (The mustard will thicken as it sits; don't worry if it seems loose.) Divide equally among prepared jars, allowing 1/2- to 3/4-inch of headspace in each jar.
Cover the jars and let stand at room temperature for 2 days before using. This curing period removes any remaining bitterness, smoothing the edges. Mustard can be stored without refrigeration for months. If it dries out, add liquid (such as water, wine, or beer), a few drops at a time, and stir to reconstitute.
