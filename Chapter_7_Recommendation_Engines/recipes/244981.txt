Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
6 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste
1 cup hot water
6 tablespoons soy sauce
1 large rutabaga, peeled and cubed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat; add brown sugar and cook and stir until brown sugar has dissolved. Stir water and soy sauce into butter mixture, increase heat to medium-high, and bring mixture to a boil. Stir in chopped rutabaga and return to boil.
Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This is an excellent recipe for an often overlooked and unpopular root vegetable. Even folks who dislike Rutabagas love this delicious dish. Added bonus is this is a great way to introduce this vegetable to kids. A Southern staple with a sweet Asian twist!
