Ingredients:
Start by cutting up eight cups of apples into small 1/2in bits.
Mix the apples with:
12 tablespoons of flour
1 1/2c of sugar
4 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon
1/4-1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg (depending on how much you like nutmeg...you could also leave it out)

Directions:
You will also need:
4 tablespoons of chilled butter cut into 24 equal portions.
two boxes of pilsbury pie crusts (four chilled NOT frozen crusts)
Unroll your first pie crust and cut several circles out. Continue this until you have enough crusts.
I found that a wide mouth mason jar ring worked perfectly.
Line each cup of your muffin tin with a tiny pie crust.
gently fill the crusts with your apple mixture
You should be able to fill until slightly mounded.
and put a dab of butter on each pie.
Cover as desired with left over dough. Brush with melted butter and bake at 400 for 18 to 22 minutes.
