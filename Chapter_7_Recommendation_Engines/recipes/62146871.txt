Ingredients:
30 oz.  Frozen shredded hashbrowns (make sure you thaw them out when ready to make this)
4 cups shredded Monterey Jack Cheese
3 cups of diced ham
7 eggs
1 cup Milk
1/2 to 1 tsp salt (however you like it)
1/2 tsp pepper
(sometimes I add some garlic powder too)
1/2 tsp. dry mustard

Directions:
Put thawed hashbrowns in greased 13x9 pan.  If they aren't thawed out it will take longer to cook.  Sprinkle with cheese and ham.  Beat eggs & milk in another bowl. Combine  salt and mustard to egg mixture. Pour evenly over hashbrowns, ham and cheese.  Then kind of spread it around so it coats the whole top.  Bake 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Uncover after an hour and bake another 15 min. This serves 8 people.  You can also prepare it the night before and bake it in the morning. Yum!!
