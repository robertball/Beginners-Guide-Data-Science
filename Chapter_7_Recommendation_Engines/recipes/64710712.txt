Ingredients:
Canola cooking spray (Pam)
4 cup wide egg noodles
2 tbsp vegetable oil, divided
2 tsp salt, divided
1 lb sirloin steak cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup onions, diced
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 1/2 cups mushrooms
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup beef broth
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 cup sour cream
1 tsp ground pepper
2 cups French's crispy fried onions
2 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Spray 9x12 glass casserole with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Place 8 cups of water in a Dutch oven, along with 1 tsp salt and 1 tbsp vegetable oil, and bring to a boil.  Add egg noodles and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and place back into Dutch oven.
In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil. Add steak, garlic, onions, and mushrooms. Sautee just until meat is lightly browned and mushrooms and onions are soft, about 5-7 minutes. Don't over-cook.
Add cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and sour cream. Stir until blended. Add 1 tsp salt and pepper. Bring to a light boil and then lower heat. Simmer for 2 minutes.
Pour stroganoff contents into noodles in Dutch oven and stir until well combined. Pour into 9x12 prepared dish, cover with foil and cook for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.
Remove foil, sprinkle fried onions on top and cook for about 5 more minutes just until they get golden brown. Serve.
