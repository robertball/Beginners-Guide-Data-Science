Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onions
2 tablespoons brunoise red peppers
2 tablespoons brunoise yellow peppers
Salt
Cayenne
1 pounds crawfish tails
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
9 large eggs
1/4 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
2 cups basic Hollandaise Sauce, warm

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Butter 4 individual oval au gratin ramekins and place on a baking sheet. In a saute pan, over medium heat, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions and peppers. Season the vegetables with salt and cayenne. Saute for 2 minutes. Add the crawfish tails and continue to saute for 2 minutes. Add the green onions, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Saute for 1 minute. Remove the mixture from the heat and turn into a mixing bowl. Cool the mixture for 2 minutes. Add one of the eggs, bread crumbs and cheese and mix well. Spread 1/4 of the filling over the bottom of each ramekin. Crack two eggs over each ramekin of filling. Season with salt and pepper. Place the ramekins in the oven and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes, or until the white of the eggs are firm but the yolks are still liquid. Remove from the oven and place on individual serving plates. Spoon the Hollandaise Sauce over the top and garnish with the remaining parsley.
