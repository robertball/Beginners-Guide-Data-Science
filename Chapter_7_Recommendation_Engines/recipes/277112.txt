Ingredients:
olive oil
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies, undrained
1 cup rice, rinsed until the water runs clear
1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
4 tablespoons shredded Mexican cheese blend, or to taste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

Directions:
Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and select Saute function. Heat olive oil in the pot. Add chicken and saute until edges are lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Cancel Saute mode and transfer chicken to a plate.
Pour chicken broth into the pot; scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits with a spoon. Add corn, black beans, diced tomatoes with green chilies and their juices, rice, seasoning salt, chili powder, and garlic powder. Place chicken pieces on top of rice mixture.
Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 7 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 1 more minute. Unlock and remove the lid.
Open the lid and stir chicken and rice. Serve in bowls topped with shredded Mexican cheese and chopped cilantro.
