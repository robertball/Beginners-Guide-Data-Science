Ingredients:
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon ground paprika
1 pinch cayenne pepper
1 pinch salt
1 cup ground pecan meal
4 (4 ounce) fillets walleye
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Beat the egg with the garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt until evenly mixed. Spread the pecan meal into a shallow dish. Dip the walleye fillets into the egg mixture, then press into the pecan flour.
Heat the butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the walleye fillets into the pan. Cook until golden brown on both sides and the fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
