Ingredients
•	12 lasagna noodles
•	1 tub (475 g) extra-smooth ricotta cheese
•	2 eggs
•	1 pinch pepper
•	3 cups (750 mL) shredded mozzarella cheese
•	1 cup (250 mL) grated Parmesan cheese
Tomato Meat Sauce:
•	2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
•	2 onions, diced
•	1 rib celery, diced
•	1 carrot, diced
•	4 cloves garlic, minced
•	1-1/2 lb (680 g) lean ground beef
•	1/3 cup (75 mL) tomato paste
•	2 cans (28 oz/796 mL each) diced tomatoes
•	1 cup (250 mL) red wine or white wine
•	2 bay leaves
•	1 tsp (5 mL) dried oregano
•	1/2 tsp (2 mL) pepper
•	2 tbsp (30 mL) chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Tomato Meat Sauce: In Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat; cook onions, celery, carrot and garlic, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
Add beef; cook, breaking up with back of wooden spoon, until browned and liquid has evaporated, about 6 minutes.
Stir in tomato paste. Add tomatoes, wine, bay leaves, oregano and pepper; simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 40 minutes. Stir in basil. Discard bay leaves. (Make-ahead: Let cool for 30 minutes; refrigerate in airtight container for up to 3 days.)
Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling salted water, cook noodles for 2 minutes less than package directions for al dente. Drain and arrange noodles in single layer on towels.
In small bowl, stir together ricotta, eggs and pepper.
In 13- x 9-inch (3 L) baking dish, spread 1-1/2 cups of the meat sauce. Arrange 3 noodles over top; sprinkle with half of the mozzarella cheese. Top with 2-1/2 cups of the meat sauce, 3 noodles, ricotta mixture, 3 noodles, 2-1/2 cups of the meat sauce, 3 noodles, then remaining meat sauce and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese (Make-ahead: Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days; remove plastic wrap.)
Cover with foil. Bake in 375ºF (190ºC) oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake until cheese is golden, about 15 minutes. Loosely cover with foil and let stand for 30 minutes before serving.
