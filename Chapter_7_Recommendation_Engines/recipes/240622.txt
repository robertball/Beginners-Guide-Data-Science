Ingredients:
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 pound ground beef
1/2 clove garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, undrained
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and garlic in hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Stir kidney beans, onion, and bell pepper with the beef mixture. Pour tomato sauce over the beef mixture; season with chili powder and salt. Stir the mixture so the sauce coats everything, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chili thickens, about 45 minutes.
