Ingredients:
1 stick of unsalted butter
5 shallots minced
2 pounds ground lamb
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 Tablespoons finely grated lemon peel
1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram
salt and freshly ground pepper
Unsalted butter and olive oil for frying
2 or 3 Tablespoons tomato sauce
1/4 cup wine
1 small garlic clove, minced
dash of cinnamon

Directions:
Melt butter, add shallots and saute until soft and golden.  Transfer to a large bowl and add ground lamb, breadcrumbs, parsley, egg, lemon peel, marjoram, and salt and pepper.  Blend well.  Let mixture stand about 1 hour and then form into chestnut sized balls. Heat the unsalted butter and olive oil over medium-high heat.  Add meatballs in batches and saute until browned on all sides.  These can be made ahead of time and reheated at a low temperature in the oven.
To keep the meatballs moist, add about 2 or 3 Tablespoons of tomato sauce to the drippings in the pan.  Then add the wine, garlic and cinnamon.  Simmer for a few minutes and pour over the cooked meatballs and toss gently.

Description: 
This is a great alternative to regular meatballs.  I have served these many times at cocktail parties, and they have always been a hit!  The sauce adds a nice touch, but I have also served them with greek marinade and plain.
