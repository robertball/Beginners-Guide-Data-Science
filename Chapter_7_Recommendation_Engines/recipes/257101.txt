Ingredients:
1 cup warm water (95 to 110 degrees F/35 to 43 degrees C)
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2 tablespoons shortening
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
3 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Combine warm water and yeast in a small bowl; stir until yeast is dissolved. Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 10 minutes.
Pour yeast mixture into a large bowl; add shortening, salt, sugar, and Italian seasoning. Stir in flour by hand until dough comes together.
Turn dough out on a floured work surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a large greased bowl. Cover with a moist towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Punch dough down gently. Let stand for 3 to 5 minutes for air to release. Roll into a ball; spread and stretch over the bottom of a pizza pan. Let rise for 15 minutes before topping and baking.
