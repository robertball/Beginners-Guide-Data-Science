Ingredients:
1 pound ground turkey
3/4 cup chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced peeled Granny Smith apple
1 1/4 cups ketchup
1/3 cup water, or more as needed
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves

Directions:
Place ground turkey, onion, bell pepper, and apple into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook until turkey is browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes.
Stir ketchup, water, Dijon mustard, cider vinegar, sugar, tarragon, salt, and cloves into the skillet. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, adding a little more water if mixture gets a bit thick.

Description: 
A more wholesome version of the ever-popular sloppy joe using ground turkey instead of ground beef. You'll get sweetness from the apples, a subtle hint of anise from the tarragon, and a burst of aromatic flavor from the cloves. Be adventuresome, step outside the box, and give it a try! Serve on butter-toasted hamburger buns.
