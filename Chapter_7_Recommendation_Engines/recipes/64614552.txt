Ingredients:
For the mashed potatoes:
3 pounds potatoes, peeled
1/4-1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup milk
salt and pepper to taste
4 oz Sour Cream
1 cup cheddar cheese, shredded & divided
1 tbsp. chives (optional)
1/4 pound bacon, cooked & crumbled (optional)

Directions:
Place peeled potatoes in large pot of water and bring to a boil. Then boil for 20-30 minutes or until fork tender.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Mash potatoes (I use a potato masher), then add in 1/4 cup milk, salt and pepper to taste. (May need more butter depending on the potatoes.)
Once potatoes are mashed, add in sour cream and 1/2 cup cheese. Mix well.
Spray a 3 quart casserole dish with butter spray, then add in the potatoes.
Bake at 350F for 20 minutes, then top with remaining cheese, chives and bacon; bake for an additional 5 minutes or until cheese melts.
Notes: This dish can be made one day in advance. Cover casserole dish prior to baking overnight in the refrigerator. Take out 30 minutes prior to baking and bake (the baking time may need to be increased). Soften potatoes up by adding a little more milk and butter prior to baking.
