Ingredients:
4 whole catfish, cleaned with head and tail removed
1/2 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup cracked black pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter

Directions:
Pat the catfish dry, and spread a layer of mustard over the surface. Place the cracked pepper onto a plate, and press the coated catfish into the pepper so it is well covered.
Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the catfish for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until fish flakes with a fork.
