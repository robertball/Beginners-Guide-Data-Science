Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons light corn syrup
1 egg
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, sugar and corn syrup until smooth. Beat in the egg. Combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and allspice; stir into the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1/2 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 1/2 inches apart onto cookie sheets.
Bake for 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the frosting, whip egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy. Gradually add sugar and continue to beat until icing is stiff. Add food coloring if desired and pipe onto cooled cookies. This icing can also be used as a glue to affix candy decorations.
