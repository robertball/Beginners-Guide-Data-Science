Ingredients:
5 pounds red potatoes, chopped
3 cups mayonnaise
2 cups finely chopped pickles
5 hard-cooked eggs, chopped
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
3 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to empty pot to dry while you mix the dressing. Sprinkle with salt.
Stir mayonnaise, pickles, hard-cooked eggs, red onion, celery, mustard, cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Fold potatoes into the mayonnaise mixture. Allow to chill at least six hours, or overnight, before serving.
