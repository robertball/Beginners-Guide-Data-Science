Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder (optional)
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mini chocolate chips
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Combine vanilla extract and espresso powder in a small bowl; mix until espresso powder is dissolved.
Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt into a bowl; mix in chocolate chips.
Whisk vanilla mixture, sugar, eggs, and oil together in a large bowl. Add flour mixture; stir, by hand if needed, until dough comes together and is thick and stiff.
Divide dough into 2 equal pieces and place onto the baking sheets. Shape each piece into a log as long as the baking sheet; press down with wet hands to about 1/2 inch thickness.
Bake in the preheated oven until firm, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes.
Move cooled logs to a cutting board and slice into 1/2-inch long slices with a serrated knife. Return the slices to the baking sheets, placing them on their sides.
Bake until dry, about 6 minutes per side. Remove from oven and let cool until hardened on wire racks.

Description: 
A brownie-like biscotti that tastes great with a cup of coffee. Drizzle with more chocolate if desired. Especially popular in the winter time when coffee and chocolate taste so much better. Enjoy!
