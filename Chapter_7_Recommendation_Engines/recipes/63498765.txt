Ingredients:
2 Tbsp Olive Oil
1 Hillshire Farms Beef Smoked Sausage
2 Large Russett Potatoes
2 Cans Green Chile
2 Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese

Directions:
Pour Olive Oil in large skillet and turn to medium-high heat.
Peel potatoes and cut into 1 inch cubes and put them in covered skillet.
Meanwhile, slice Smoked Sausage into half-inch pieces and put it into the skillet along with the potatoes.
Stir frequently and carefully so the potatoes don't mash up and so it doesn't burn on the bottom.
Once the potatoes are almost done, stir in the green chile and cover for 5 more minutes.
Once the potatoes are completely cooked, turn off heat, spread Cheddar Cheese over the Sausage, Potatoes and Green Chile.
Cover with lid until cheese melts.
Enjoy!
