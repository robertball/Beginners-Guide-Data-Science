Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/3 cups butter
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/4 cups evaporated milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and line an 8 inch round or square cake pan.
Sift together flour and baking powder once.
In a medium bowl, beat butter or margarine and sugar for 7 minutes. (Color should be pale yellow. Do not overbeat.) Mix evaporated milk with vanilla; mix slowly into the sugar mixture.  Mix in flour one spoonful at a time until well blended. Pour into prepared cake pan.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
