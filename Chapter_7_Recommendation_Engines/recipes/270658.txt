Ingredients:
3 pounds red potatoes, peeled and cubed (such as Black Gold Farms)
1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
1 (16 ounce) package FarmlandÂ® Sliced Ham, cut into strips about 1/2-inch wide
1 cup diced white onion
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup minced fresh chives
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Cook potatoes in boiling salted water until just tender, about 20 minutes.
While potatoes are cooking, heat pan over medium heat and add oil. When oil is hot, add sliced ham and cook until lightly browned with crispy, golden edges, about 5 minutes.
Drain potatoes and allow to cool slightly. While still warm, gently mix potatoes in large bowl with all other ingredients. Taste for seasoning.
