Ingredients:
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat, drained
1 (8.25 ounce) can cream style corn
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco
2 medium scallions (green onions), trimmed and finely chopped
1 1/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs, divided

Directions:
Mix crabmeat, corn, hot sauce, scallions and 3/4 cup bread crumbs in a medium mixing bowl until well blended.
Spread the remaining breadcrumbs on a sheet of foil and divide the crab mixture into 8 even portions (about 1/3 cup each). Roll each portion in bread crumbs until the surface is well coated, and form into 1/2-inch thick patties.
Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some canola or vegetable oil (about 3 tablespoons). When the oil is hot, brown the crab cakes on both sides, about 4 minutes per side.

Description: 
Crab cakes may seem out of the question when you're watching the family food budget, but canned crab is a fraction of the cost of fresh, equally nutritious, and ready-to-use without worrying about the need to clean the crab of its shell.Â  In this classic American version, the cakes are embellished with a can of creamed corn (adds a little sweetness and moisture), a dash of hot pepper sauce for pizzazz, and some chopped green onion for a fresh from the garden flavor.
