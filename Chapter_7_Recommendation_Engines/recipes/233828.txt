Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15.5 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (4 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained (optional)
1/3 cup water
1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir spaghetti into the beef mixture; add kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, mushrooms, water, chili seasoning mix, and Parmesan cheese. Place a cover on the skillet, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until hot, about 10 minutes. Top with Cheddar cheese.

Description: 
This is an easy recipe similar to chili-mac but made with spaghetti. My son loved it and thought it was a neat concept. He even wanted it for breakfast the next day!
