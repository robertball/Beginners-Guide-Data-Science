Description: 
This is a tasty, healthy, filling smoothie that my kids love.  It is pretty green and why not name it something fun so they don't focus on the health factor?  You can change it up quite a bit with different yogurts and different available fruit.  It's quite easy because you can literally just dump the ingredients in without making any mistakes.
