Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, diced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 cups vegetable broth
6 medium red potatoes, diced
1 cup chopped baby carrots
2 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
1 1/2 cups soy milk
1 tablespoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup soy milk
2 tablespoons dried parsley

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to brown slightly, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
Combine the vegetable broth, potatoes, carrots, corn, 1 1/2 cups soy milk, garlic powder salt, and pepper in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then stir in the onion mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes and carrots are tender, about 20 minutes.
Whisk together the flour and remaining 1/2 cup soy milk in a bowl. Stir the mixture into the soup, and continue to simmer until the soup has thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the parsley before serving.

Description: 
A comforting and satisfying chowder with chunky veggies - perfect for a cold winter's day or any time you crave comfort soup! My son has severe food allergies and cannot have any dairy or egg - so I created this to satisfy his craving for soup!  I make it a point to create recipes for him that the rest of the family is also thrilled to eat and this definitely meets that criteria. It tastes a little more broth-like than traditional chowders, but was very comforting nonetheless.
