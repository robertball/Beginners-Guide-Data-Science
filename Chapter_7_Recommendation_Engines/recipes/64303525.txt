Ingredients:
8 oz whole-wheat pasta (elbow, penne)
1/2 large onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste
1 tablespoon drained capers opt
1 cup canned diced tomatoes, undrained
2 to 4 cups thinly sliced kale, ribs removed
1/4 cup green olives, sliced
1/2 cup sliced black olives, drained
1/2 cup nutritional yeast, opt

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Meanwhile, water saute onions. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and begun to turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, capers if using, and diced tomatoes, and bring to a simmer. Stir in kale, and simmer over medium-low heat until wilted and tender, about 10 minutes.
Once the pasta has cooked and been drained, stir into the puttanesca along with the black and green olives. Toss and sprinkle with nutritional yeast before serving.
