Ingredients:
2 packages of softened Cream Cheese (brick style--do not use spreadable or "soft" cream cheese)
1 egg
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 14 oz can of pumpkin
2T pumpkin pie spices
Graham Cracker pie crust of your choice (10")

Directions:
Let cream cheese soften.  Add sugar and eggs, mix with an electric mixer until creamy.  Add pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices.  Blend just until mix is smooth and consistent; do not over blend.  Pour filling into crust.  Cook at 350 degrees for approximately 35-40 minutes or until the texture in middle of the pie appears cake-like, and only slightly wiggly/wet.  Allow to cool for approximately 3 hours or overnight.

Description: 
This is a creamy, fluffy version of a pumpkin cheesecake.  It tastes more like pumpkin pie but more creamy and fluffy, rather than moist and wet pumpkin.
