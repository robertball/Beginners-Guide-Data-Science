Ingredients:
1 teaspoon avocado oil
1 medium sweet potato, peeled and sliced crossways into 1/8-inch slices
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place sweet potato slices in a large bowl. Stir in avocado oil, evenly coating each piece. Add Creole seasoning, stirring to combine. Place slices in a thin layer on the bottom of the air fryer basket.
Cook in the preheated air fryer for 7 minutes. Shake slices and turn to allow for even cooking. Continue cooking until desired crispness is achieved, about 6 more minutes. Transfer potato slices to a rack and allow to cool.
