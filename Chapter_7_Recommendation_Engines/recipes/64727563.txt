Ingredients:
1 box vanilla cake mix
1 1/4 c. champagne, at room temperature
1/2 c. melted butter
3 egg whites
1 lb. strawberries, sliced
1 1/2 c. champagne
4 c. heavy cream

Preheat oven to 350° and line a 9”-x-13” baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, beat cake mix, champagne, melted butter, and egg whites. Pour into prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool completely.
Make champagne syrup: In a small saucepan over medium heat, add champagne and simmer until reduced to about ¼ cup. Let cool completely.
Make whipped cream: In a large bowl using a hand mixer (or in a stand mixer using the whisk attachment), beat heavy cream and powdered sugar until soft peaks form, then beat in champagne syrup until stiff peaks form.
Assemble trifle: Cut cake into large cubes. Spoon a thin layer of whipped cream into bottom of trifle dish. Top with a layer of cake, then strawberries, and whipped cream. Repeat twice more. Crumble leftover cake on top for garnish. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
