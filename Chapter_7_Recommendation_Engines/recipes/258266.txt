Ingredients:
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, label removed
12 ounces digestive biscuits, crushed
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 1/2 tablespoons butter, melted
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
3 bananas, sliced
1 teaspoon instant coffee granules (optional)

Directions:
Immerse the can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of boiling water. Simmer, ensuring the can is fully covered with water, until caramelized, 2 to 3 hours. Remove the can from the boiling water using tongs and let cool, 8 hours to overnight.
Mix digestive biscuits with 1/2 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons melted butter in a bowl. Press into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate crust until firm.
Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
Mix caramelized condensed milk and bananas together in a bowl. Pour over the crust. Sprinkle instant coffee over banana mixture. Spread whipped cream on top.

Description: 
I tried three different banoffee pie recipes I found online and in a recipe book. So I've made my own version of the banoffee pie using the basis of the recipes I have found and added a bit of a twist! My partner and friends love this and I hope you will too.
