Ingredients:
4 poblano peppers
1 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
3 eggs
1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 (16 ounce) package frozen corn
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet.
Roast peppers in the preheated oven until slumped and charred, about 30 minutes. Remove the stems, seeds, and the charred skin and roughly chop peppers.
Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and butter a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
Whisk milk, cream, eggs, sugar, flour, butter, and salt together in a bowl; stir in corn, Cheddar cheese, and roasted peppers. Pour corn mixture into the prepared dish.
Bake in the oven until slightly puffed, golden around the edges, and set, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Garnish corn pudding with chopped chives.

Description: 
In our family, a warm bowl of corn is always on our Thanksgiving table. My mom dumps a few bags of frozen corn into boiling water while the turkey rests and the potatoes get mashed. She'll then inevitably forget about the now water-logged corn until we are sitting at the table ready to eat. And still a Thanksgiving table without corn is not complete in my mind. This dish transforms frozen corn into a decadent and richly flavored dish with just a bit more work than setting a pot of water to boil.
