Ingredients:
1 unbaked 9-inch pie shell, defrosted
1 (40 ounce) can Bruce's Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes in Syrup, drained, 3 tablespoons syrup reserved
3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
2 eggs
1 egg yolk
1/4 cup melted butter
2 tablespoons sifted flour
Whipped cream for serving (optional)
Pumpkin pie spice (optional)

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees F.
Bake empty pie shell for 6-7 minutes, or until the bottom of crust begins to turn light brown. Remove from oven and turn heat down to 350 degrees F. Place pie on a cookie sheet.
Whip the sweet potatoes in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth. Add the reserved syrup, buttermilk, eggs, egg yolk, melted butter, and flour; mix until incorporated.
Pour into the pie shell and bake for 60-65 minutes, or until center of pie has set. If crust starts to brown too much, cover pie with a sheet of tin foil.
Garnish with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.
