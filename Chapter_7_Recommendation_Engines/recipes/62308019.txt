Ingredients:
1/3 cup quality cocoa powder (Hersheys or preferably Valrhona)
1/4 cup boiling water
2 tablespoons butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 eggs, separated
2/3 cup white sugar, divided
1/3 cup finely ground toasted almonds
1 TBSP cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups heavy cream, chilled
1/3 cup white sugar
3 TBSP cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
-  Heat oven to 350° F.  Line bottom of 15.5" x 10.5" x 1" jelly roll pan with parchment paper (slightly extend over the edge); spray parchment w/ non stick spray.
-  Stir together 1/3 cup cocoa and water in small bowl until smooth.  Stir in butter and vanilla; let cool.
-  Combine egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar in large bowl; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.  Add chocolate mixture and ground almonds until well blended.
-  Beat egg whites in another bowl until just foamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar, beating until stiff peaks form.  Gently, fold 1/4 of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture.  Then add remaining whites, folding well.  Pour batter into prepared pan.  Spread gently.
-  Bake 18-20 minutes at 350°  until cake springs back when touched lightly in center.  Dust cake with 1 TBSP of cocoa powder.  Cover with a clean, dry, cotton towel.  Cool completely, in pan, on a wire rack.
-  Cut cake into four equal sized pieces.  Remove paper before placing on serving plate.  Prepare COCOA WHIPPED CREAM; reserve 1 1/4 cups to frost the four sides.  Place one cake layer on plate, spread with cocoa whipped cream. Repeat.
-  Repeat layering, ending with whipped cream.  Spread reserved whipped cream around all sides of assembled cake.  Garnish as desired.  Refrigerate until serving time.
COCOA WHIPPED CREAM:
- Combine 1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream, 1/3 cup sugar, 3 TBSP cocoa powder, and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract in large COLD bowl.  Beat with cold beaters until stiff.  Makes about 3 cups.
