Description: 
This simple restaurant-style salsa is made with vegetables that are first roasted in your air fryer. Roasting adds an extra depth of flavor, while mellowing the usual bite you'd get from the onion and garlic. If you have an air fryer with a smaller basket, you can halve the recipe or roast the veggies in 2 batches. The longer you let the salsa sit, the better it becomes!
