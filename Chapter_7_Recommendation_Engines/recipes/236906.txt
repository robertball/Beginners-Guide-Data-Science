Ingredients:
cooking spray
Cream Cheese Filling:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Cake Batter:
2 cups gluten-free flour blend
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup melted butter
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare 2 loaf pans with cooking spray.
Beat cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, and cornstarch together in a small bowl until creamy and smooth.
Beat flour blend, pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 cups sugar, eggs, milk, butter, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a large mixing bowl with an electric hand mixer set to Low until you have a thick batter.
Pour about 1/4 of the batter into the bottom of each prepared loaf pan. Spread 1/2 the cream cheese filling over each batter portion. Divide remaining batter between the two pans and spread into an even layer.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake, not the filling, comes out clean, about 1 hour.

Description: 
My Dad was recently diagnosed with gluten intolerance. It has been challenging to find easy recipes that he likes, but I finally found a way to make a gluten-free cake that doesn't taste gluten-free!
