Description: 
The world's favorite tropical fruit. 

Mangos are juicy deliciousness. So flavorful I'm always reluctant to put them in a smoothie. They are too fragile to share the spotlight with other ingredients. But if you're lucky enough to find too many ripe ones in the fridge, this is where they belong.
