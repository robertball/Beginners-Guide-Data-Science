2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
Combine cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.
Spread 1 can crescent roll dough onto the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Spread cream cheese mixture over top, and top with remaining can of crescent roll dough.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool to room temperature, at least 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix together powdered sugar and milk to make a glaze. Pour glaze on top of cooled Danishes and cut into squares.
