Ingredients:
3 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
2 large ripe pears, cored and sliced
2 large eggs
1/3 cup milk
1 tablespoon honey
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
4 slices bread
1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds, for garnish

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Stir 3 tablespoons honey, the lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger together in a small bowl; spread evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange the sliced pears in 2 rows.
Beat the eggs, milk, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger together in a shallow dish; soak each piece of bread in the egg mixture and arrange atop the pears.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is set and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
To serve, cut into squares and use a thin, flat spatula to lift each portion out of the pan and turn pear side up. Sprinkle with toasted almonds and drizzle with any syrup left in the baking dish.
