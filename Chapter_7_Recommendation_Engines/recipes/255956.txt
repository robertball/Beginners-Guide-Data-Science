Ingredients:
1 instant apple cider mix
1/2 cup white sugar, or as needed
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 cup milk
1 egg
1/2 orange, zested (optional)
vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Pour apple cider mix into a 1/2 cup measuring cup. Top off with enough sugar to equal 1/2 cup.
Combine sugar mixture, flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl.
Mix milk, egg, and orange zest together in a small bowl. Pour over flour mixture; mix gently until dough comes together in a ball.
Turn dough out onto a floured work surface; pat into a rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into doughnuts using a floured doughnut cutter.
Fill a large saucepan with oil to a depth 1 1/2 inch; heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a few doughnuts carefully into the hot oil. Fry until deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining doughnuts.
