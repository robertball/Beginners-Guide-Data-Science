Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut up
8 oz semi sweet Baker's Chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened dark chocolate cocoa powder
1/2 tsp. salt
6 large eggs, room temp
1 cup white sugar
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 tsp. vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 13" x 9" pan with shortening.
In a large, heavy saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate on low, stirring constantly. Remove from heat.
In a bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, and salt. In a large bowl, with mixer on high speed, beat eggs until well blended. Gradually add in the sugars. Beat for at least 10 minutes or until tripled in volume and very pale yellow. The mixture should leave a ribbon when you lift the beaters.
Fold in the chocolate & butter mixture and vanilla, then flour mixture. Pour into the pan. Bake for 28 to 32 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out almost clean.
Cool and cut into 16 brownies.

Once you try them you won't go back to the bakery or box again. These bake up with yummy light & crackly meringue tops and are the perfect fudge consistency on the inside.
