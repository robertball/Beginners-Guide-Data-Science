Ingredients:
6 roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped
3 cloves minced garlic
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons dried basil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 French baguette
3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven on broiler setting.
In a large bowl, combine the roma tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper. Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes.
Cut the baguette into 3/4-inch slices. On a baking sheet, arrange the baguette slices in a single layer. Broil for 1 to 2 minutes, until slightly brown.
Divide the tomato mixture evenly over the baguette slices. Top the slices with mozzarella cheese.
Broil for 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.

Description: 
I love to make bruschetta but my kiddos aren't too fond. I can always get them to eat this recipe though, because it looks like cheese pizza. I simplified the original recipe and add a lot more cheese.Modified from: Double Tomato Bruschetta
