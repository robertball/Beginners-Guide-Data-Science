Description: 
This is my first attempt ever at this incredibly unique and delicious Sicilian stuffed flatbread. What we have here is a very familiar pizza-like flavor profile, but the delivery system is unlike anything you've ever experienced. The outside edges are crispy and crunchy while that saucy and cheesy center is much like a pasta in texture. So, while this is vaguely similar to a lot of things, it's really unlike anything else.
