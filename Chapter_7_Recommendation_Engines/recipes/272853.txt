Ingredients:
4 tablespoons dill pickle juice
1 tablespoon sriracha salt
1 tablespoon celery seed
1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper
4 cups vegetable juice (such as V8®)
3/4 cup vodka
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
1/4 teaspoon powdered horseradish
4 dashes hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco®), or to taste
4 bamboo skewers
4 pickled eggs
4 pickled okra spears
4 dill pickles
8 ice cubes
4 celery stalks

Directions:
Pour dill pickle juice into a shallow plate. Combine sriracha salt, celery seed, and black pepper on another shallow plate.
One-by-one, dip the rims of 4 glasses first into the dill pickle juice and then into the salt mixture to coat the rims. Place glasses into the refrigerator or freezer. Pour remaining dill pickle juice and salt mixture into a large pitcher. Add vegetable juice, vodka, lime juice, horseradish powder, and hot sauce. Mix well. Allow Bloody Mary mixture to rest for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Slide 1 pickled egg, 1 pickled okra spear, and 1 dill pickle onto each bamboo skewer.
Before serving, add 2 two ice cubes, 1 loaded bamboo skewer, and 1 celery stalk to each rimmed glass. Give the Bloody Mary pitcher a stir and pour evenly into the 4 prepared glasses. Serve immediately.
