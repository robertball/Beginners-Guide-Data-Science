Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup butter
1/2 cup shortening
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 drops red food coloring
1/3 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons water
3 drops green food coloring

Directions:
Combine flour, baking powder and salt in a small mixing bowl.
Beat butter and shortening with an electric mixer at medium speed until fluffy; gradually add sugar, beating well.  Stir in egg, milk, and vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture  to creamed mixture, mixing well. Add a small amount of red food coloring to color dough as desired, beating until blended.  Shape dough into a ball; cover and chill at least 3 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Divide dough in half; store one portion in refrigerator.  Roll remaining portion to 1/4 inch thickness on a lightly floured surface. Cut dough with a 3-inch round cookie cutter; cut circle in half.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Press several chocolate mini chocolate chips in each cookie. Repeat with remaining dough.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes (do not brown).  Cool on wire racks.
Make frosting: Combine powdered sugar and water, mixing until smooth.  Add a small amount of green food coloring, mixing until blended.  Dip round edge of each cookie in green frosting, and place cookie on wax paper until frosting is firm.
