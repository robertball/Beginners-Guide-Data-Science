Description: 
What to do with Thanksgiving left overs? Simple just make an easy turkey noodle soup. Turkey noodle soup is one of my favorite soups during the holidays. I normally add a bit of garlic, and a tad of red pepper flakes. I also prefer to tear my chicken into chucks instead of dicing it up. It think it looks more homemade that way. You can make this soup with just a few ingredients or add your own vegetables. I use A Campbell's soup cup for portion control (so I don't get fat).
