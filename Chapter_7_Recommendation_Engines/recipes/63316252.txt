Ingredients:
1-6 ounce minced clams  go with the good stuff
1-8 ounce package cream cheese softened
Garlic salt to taste
1 ½ tablespoons parsley - chopped
1/4 cup real mayo
1/8 teaspoon lemon zest
Few dashes of choice of hot sauce to taste  optional
Sprinkle of paprika

Directions:
Drain and rinse clams then pat dry with a paper towel.
In a medium size bowl, beat cream cheese and mayonnaise until smooth.
Add seasonings, parsley and hot sauce.  Taste and season accordingly if not perfect.
Check the clams for anything that looks stringy and remove then.  Fold into mixture.
Refrigerate for a good 30 minutes or longer and place in serving bowl surrounded with your favorite chips or crackers. I usually pop my serving bowl in the freezer for a good 10 minutes before putting the clam dip in it. Super chilled!
Top with a few parsley springs and a sprinkle of paprika.
