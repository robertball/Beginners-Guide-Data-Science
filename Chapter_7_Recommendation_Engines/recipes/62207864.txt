Ingredients:
3 bacon slices, cut into 1/2" pieces
2 1/2 lbs boneless chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2" cubes
2 cups chopped onions
5 cups sliced cremini mushrooms (about 12 ozs)
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 T all-purpose flour
1 (12 oz) bottle amber beer
2 cups (1/2" thick) slices carrot (about 1/2 lb)
1 3/4 cups (1/2" thick) slices parsnip (about 1/2 lb)
1 cup fat-free, less sodium beef broth
2 T country-style Dijon mustard (I used whole grain)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp caraway seeds
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 bay leaf

Directions:
Cook bacon in a large Dutch oven over med-hi heat until crisp.  Remove bacon from pan, reserving drippings; set aside.  Add half of beef to drippings in pan; cook 5 minutes, browning on all sides.  Remove beef from pan.  Repeat procedure with remaining beef.
Add onion to pan; saute 4 minutes.  Stir in mushrooms and garlic; saute 4 minutes or until half of liquid evaporates.  Stir in flour; cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in beer, scraping pan to loosen browned bits.  Add bacon, beef, carrot, and remaining ingredients to pan; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 2 hours or until beef is tender.  Discard Bay leaf.
