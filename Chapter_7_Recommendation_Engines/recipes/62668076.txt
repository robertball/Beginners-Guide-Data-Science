1 8 oz package portabello mushrooms, sliced
1 shallot, fine diced
1 tablespoon prepared minced garlic

1/2 cup low-sodium beef broth

Directions:
Add the butter and olive oil to a saute pan on medium heat and heat until butter has melted and just slightly bubbly.  Add the mushrooms and shallot, and saute until the mushrooms have given up their liquid, about ten minutes.  Add the garlic and continue cooking several minutes more.  Add the port, broth, and thyme, and bring to a simmer, about 10 minutes more.  Reduce heat to low, then and add the cream, salt, and pepper.
