Ingredients:
1 (9 oz) pkg yellow cake mix
1 1/2 tsp allspice
1 egg
2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 medium carrots, peeled, divided
6 oz cream cheese
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup thawed frozen whipped topping
Sprinkles

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Spray cups of Mini-Muffin Pan with nonstick cooking spray. For mini-cakes, combine cake mix, allspice, egg and oil in Classic Batter Bowl; stir until ingredients are moistened.(Mixture will be very thick.)
Grate carrots. Stir 3/4 cup  of the carrots into batter; set aside remaining carrots for garnish.
Divide batter evenly among cups, filling cups about two-thirds full; bake 11-13 minutes or until mini-cakes feel firm to the touch.
Meanwhile, in clean batter bowl, whisk together cream cheese and sugar until smooth; fold in whipped topping. Spoon cream cheese mixture into resealable plastic bag; secure bag and set aside.
Remove pan from oven. Cool in pan 3 minutes. Carefully remove mini-cakes from pan; cool 5 minutes. Trim corner of cream cheese-fitled bag pipe filling evenly into mini-cakes. Garnish with sprinkles or reserved grated carrots, if desired.
