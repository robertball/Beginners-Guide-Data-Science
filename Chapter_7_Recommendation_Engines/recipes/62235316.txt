Ingredients:
2- Devil's Food Cake Mix (Duncan Hines is the one pictured)
**Don't add what they say on the box, instead use**:
2 cups water
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup miracle whip
6 eggs

Directions:
Beat at medium/high speed for two minutes. Use cooking times as directed on box but check with a toothpick that it comes out clean.
I used two, 9" cake pans, as it's a layer cake. Split the batter in the 2 cake pans.
Let the cakes cool off before you frost them.
