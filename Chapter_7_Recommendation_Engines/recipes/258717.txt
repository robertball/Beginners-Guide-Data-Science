Ingredients:
2 cups red wine
1 cup honey
2 cups water, divided
2 cups hickory wood chips
1 cup vegetable oil
1 bunch sage, chopped
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast
3 cups orange marmalade

Directions:
Mix red wine, honey, and 1 cup water together in a large bowl. Add hickory wood chips and soak for 10 minutes.
Preheat smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Mix oil, sage, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Place pork on a rimmed baking tray and coat with oil-herb mixture.
Place pork on highest rack in smoker. Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions. Smoke until pork is no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 45 minutes. Transfer pork to a serving platter.
Mix marmalade and 1 cup water in a saucepan over low heat. Stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour over pork.
