Ingredients:
1 yellow cake mix prepared and baked exactly according to the directions on the cake box.
1 can of evaporated milk
1 can condensed milk
8 ounces milk
1 container of creamy cool whip
12 maraschino cherries - drained and placed on a napkin to absorb all liquid.

Directions:
Bake the yellow cake in a 9"x13" cake pan exactly according to the directions on the cake mix box.
Leave the cake in the pan and allow the cake to cool for 30 minutes.
When the cake is fully cooled, poke the entire surface of the cake with a fork or knife about 30 times total.
Whisk together all 3 milks and very slowly pour the milks over the cake. All the milk will eventually be absorbed. Even if you see the milk pooling, don't worry, it will be absorbed eventually.
Place the cake in the fridge for an hour to chill then cover with the cool whip.
Place 12 cherries on the top of the cake. One cherry for each square serving. Make sure to drain the cherries well to avoid having the red cherry syrup from leaking all over the cake. Serve chilled.

Description: 
My version is easier and tastier than any other version. I make this Tres Leches every time I want to impress. There is never a drop left unconsumed at any dinner party or pot luck I bring it to. I constantly have to give this recipe out to most people who taste it so I wanted to post it here to make my life easier and to please all my fellow allrecipes.com cooks. You can make it with all the low-fat substitues for every ingredient. Make it as low fat and low calorie as you want. Still tasty. Kids love it and it's loaded with calcium.
