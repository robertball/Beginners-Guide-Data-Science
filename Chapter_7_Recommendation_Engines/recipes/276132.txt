Ingredients:
For the Quesadillas:
8 ounces Pure FarmlandÂ® Simply Seasoned Plant-Based Protein Starters
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small onion, diced
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
Cooking spray
Salt and pepper
2 (10 inch) flour tortillas
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
Sliced dill pickles (optional)
For the Special Sauce:
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons pickle juice
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
To Serve:
Shredded lettuce
Sliced cherry tomatoes

Directions:
For the Quesadillas: Heat oil in a medium saute pan over medium-high heat. Add protein starters and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove and set aside.
To the same pan, add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes more. Add reserved protein starters back to the pan, add Worcestershire sauce, mix to combine, and set aside.
Wipe out the pan, coat with nonstick spray, and heat over medium heat. Add 1 tortilla to pan. Top half the tortilla with 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 of the cooked protein.
Top with pickle slices (if desired) and another 1/2 cup cheese. Fold in half and cook until cheese is melted and the quesadilla is golden brown on one side, about 2 minutes. Repeat with second tortilla and remaining ingredients.
For the Special Sauce: Mix all ingredients in a small bowl and season to taste.
Cut quesadillas into pieces and serve with lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce.
