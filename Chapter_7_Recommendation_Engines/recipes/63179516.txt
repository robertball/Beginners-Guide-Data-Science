Description: 
This is similar to an alfredo sauce with vegetables and herbs. Three kinds of pepper turn up the heat in this creamy shrimp and scallop sauce. Fresh basil, thyme and parsley add just the right counterpoint, while Parmesan cheese adds its own sharp flavors. Perfect over fettucine!Modified from: Cajun Seafood Pasta
