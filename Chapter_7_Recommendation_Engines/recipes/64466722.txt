Ingredients:
4 oz white chocolate premium baking bar (because you never want to slum on your chocolate!)
4 0.33 oz packs of Pop Rocks (whatever flavor grabs you)
12 marshmallows
12 wooden skewers
2-3 kale leaves

Directions:
Chunk chocolate bar, place pieces in a small microwavable dish, heat on high for 30 seconds.  Stir.  If it is not melted and smooth, repeat heating and stirring until it is.
In another small bowl, place contents of Pop Rocks packs.
One at a time, place a marshmallow on the tip of a skewer.  Dip into the chocolate.  Allow excess chocolate to drip back into the chocolate bowl.
When chocolate stops dripping and has begun to firm, quickly dip into the Pop Rocks bowl.
Place skewered masterpiece, handle-side down, into a tall glass or vase to allow the Fluffy Bite to fully set.  Set time will vary, depending on how hot it is in your kitchen.
Repeat steps 3-5.
Garnish arrangement with kale.
