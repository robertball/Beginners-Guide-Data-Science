Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
1/3 cup whole natural almonds, roughly chopped
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Place green beans in a baking pan and toss with olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Place almonds on a baking sheet. Roast almonds and green beans for 10 minutes. Set almonds aside. Cover green beans with foil and roast for an additional 30 minutes.
While green beans are roasting, make the brittle. Spray a sheet of foil with cooking spray and set aside. Place sugar and 1/2 cup water in a small, very clean saucepan, ensuring sugar is completely covered with water. Turn heat to high and bring to a simmer. Let caramelize until deep, golden brown, watching constantly as this happens fairly quickly. Stir in chopped almonds, still warm from the oven. Spread this sticky brittle on prepared foil. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and let cool. Combine green beans and almond brittle then serve.
