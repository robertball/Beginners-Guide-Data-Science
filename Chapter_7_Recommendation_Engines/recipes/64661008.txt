Ingredients:
1 pkg (18 ounces/540 g) refrigerated sugar cookie dough
1 pkg (8 ounces/250 g) cream cheese, softened
½ cup (125 mL) packed brown sugar
¼ cup (50 mL) creamy peanut butter
½ teaspoon (2 mL) vanilla
2 medium Granny Smith apples
¼ cup caramel ice cream topping
½ cup peanuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).
Shape the cookie dough into a ball and place the dough in the center of the Pizza Stone; flatten the dough slightly. Using a lightly floured a Baker's Roller®, roll out the dough into a 14" (35-cm) circle, about ¼" (6 mm) thick.
Bake for 16-18 minutes or until the dough is a light golden brown.
Remove the stone from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.
Carefully loosen the cookie from the baking stone using a Forged Bread Knife; let the cookie cool completely on the baking stone.
Combine the cream cheese, brown sugar, peanut butter, and vanilla in a Small Batter Bowl and mix well.
Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the baked cookie.
Peel, core, and slice the apples using the Apple Peeler, Corer & Slicer. Cut the apple slices in half and arrange them evenly over the cream cheese mixture.
Microwave the ice cream topping on HIGH for 30-45 seconds or until warm; drizzle the topping evenly over the apples. Chop the peanuts using a Food Chopper; sprinkle the nuts over the apples. Cut the pizza into wedges.
