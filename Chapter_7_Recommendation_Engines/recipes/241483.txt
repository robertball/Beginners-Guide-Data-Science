3/4 cup kosher salt
2/3 cup white sugar
2 heads garlic, crushed and chopped

1/4 cup dried basil, or to taste
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
1 large bay leaf

Directions:
Mix water, kosher salt, white sugar, garlic, sage, basil, peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the salt and sugar are dissolved completely, about 20 minutes.
Remove pot from heat and cover with a lid. Cool brine at room temperature for 2 hours before refrigerating to cool completely.
