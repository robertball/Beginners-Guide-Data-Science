Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
2 pounds Lean Ground Beef
4 slices Good-quality Bacon (raw), Chopped
½ cups Chopped Red Onion
2 cloves Garlic, Minced
1 Tablespoon Minced Fresh Ginger
½ cups Plain Breadcrumbs
1 whole Large Egg
¼ teaspoons Ground Ginger
¼ teaspoons Salt
¾ cups Teriyaki Sauce, Divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400°F and coat the inside of a 9×5 loaf pan with the olive oil.
Combine the remaining ingredients (use only ¼ cup teriyaki sauce at this point) in a medium bowl with your hands. Pat the meat mixture into the greased loaf pan so that it is evenly distributed. Pour the remaining ½ cup of teriyaki sauce over the top of the meatloaf, spreading with a rubber spatula if necessary to cover.
Bake at 400° for 50 minutes to 1 hour, until meatloaf is cooked through and comes away from the sides of the pan slightly.
Let rest 10-15 minutes (so it can set) before slicing and serving.
