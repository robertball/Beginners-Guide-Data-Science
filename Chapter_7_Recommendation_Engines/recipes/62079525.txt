Ingredients:
Nonfat cooking spray
1 1/2 cups frozen hashbrown potatoes
3 eggs
1/4 tsp. oregano
1/4 tsp. basil
1/4 tsp crushed rosemary
1/4 tsp salt (I use salt substitute)
Dash fresh ground pepper
1 clove garlic, minced
2 green onions, chopped
sliced green pepper
1 tomato, sliced
1/2 cup pizza sauce or salsa
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and set to medium-high.  When the skillet has heated, add hashbrowns and cook until golden brown (spraying with cooking spray if necessary).
Spray an 8-inch cake pan with cooking spray and spread hashbrowns on the bottom, covering evenly.  In a separate bowl, beat eggs and combine with seasonings, garlic, and green onions.  Pour mixture over hashbrowns, and place in the oven for approximately 5 minutes.
When the mixture has set slightly, remove from oven and spread with sauce.  Top sauce with tomato, green pepper, and mozzarella.  Place back in the oven for another 10 minutes, until egg mixture is firm and cheese is melted.
Let the pizza sit for 3-5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve.

Description: 
I came up with this dish one morning and it turned out to be a hit in our family.  Unlike other breakfast pizzas with a dough crust, this crust is made with frozen hashbrown potatoes.  Nutritious and low fat!
