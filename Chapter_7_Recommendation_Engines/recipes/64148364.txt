Ingredients:
1 lb bacon, diced
1 large stalk celery, finely diced
1 large carrot, finely diced
4 lbs potatos, diced
1 c. half and half
1/4 c. AP flour
3 c. chicken stock
3 c. water
dash black pepper
dash hot sauce
dash BBQ seasoning
dash paprika
1/2 tsp. seasoned salt

Directions:
In a large soup pot, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp.  Set bacon aside.  Drain the grease from the pot, but do not wash the pot, keep as much any of the brown bits in the pot as you can.
Add the vegetables and stir for a couple of minutes.  Deglaze the pan with chicken stock.  Add the remainder of the stock and the water.  Bring the pot to a boil then reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender.
In a separate dish, whisk the flour into the half and half  Add the flour/half and half mixture, seasonings, and evaporated milk to soup.  Simmer 5 minutes.
Ladle about 4 cups of soup into a blender and blend until completely smooth (if the blender is small, blend in batches or you can use an emersion blender until desired texture is achieved).  Be careful, the soup is hot and has a tendency to take up more blender space than expected.  I never fill my blender more than half way with hot stuff.
Immediately return the blended soup to pot.  Give the pot a stir and serve the soup garnished with the reserved bacon and any other desired additions your family desires such as cheese or chives.  Enjoy!
