Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 egg
1/2 cup water
1 pinch salt
1 large potato, diced
1 onion, diced
1/2 pound bacon, chopped
3 cups milk
1 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine flour, egg, 1/2 cup water and salt to form a dough.  Cut into thin strips or small pieces.
Bring a large pot of water to boil.  Stir in dough, potatoes and onion.  Cook 20 minutes, until potatoes are tender.  Drain.
While pasta and potatoes are cooking, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp.  Save drippings.
Return pasta and potato mixture to large pot over medium-low heat, and combine with bacon, a teaspoon of bacon grease, milk, cream and salt and pepper.  Adjust bacon grease to taste and milk or cream to cover.  Simmer 20 minutes, without boiling.  Serve hot.
