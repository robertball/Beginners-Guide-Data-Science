Submitter: 
Bumble Bee
Description: 
This is a fresh and modern take on two recipes from my Italian mother-in-law.  Fresh peas in place of canned, sun dried tomatoes in place of heavy tomato sauce and Bumble Bee® Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water replacing tuna in oil. This is a fast and flavorful meal to put together with just a few shelf stable ingredients.
