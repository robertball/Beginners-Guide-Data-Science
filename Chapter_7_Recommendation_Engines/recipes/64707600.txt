Preheat oven to 250°F(121°C).
In a small bowl mix together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar, then add melted butter or margarine and toss until combined.
In a 9x13 inch pan, press the graham cracker mixture into the bottom in an even layer.
Spread the chocolate chips evenly over the graham cracker mixture, and sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the chocolate chips if desired.
Lay 7 of the graham crackers evenly into the pan, then pour the mini marshmallows on top of the graham crackers. Spread in an even layer.
Lay the remaining 7 graham crackers over the marshmallows, then drizzle the chocolate syrup over the top.
Bake the bars in the oven for 30 minutes. Let them cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.
