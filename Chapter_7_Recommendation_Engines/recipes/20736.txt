Ingredients:
6 eggs
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon prepared Dijon-style mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons sliced pimento-stuffed green olives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
1 tablespoon olive oil
paprika

Directions:
Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend cream cheese, lemon juice, prepared Dijon-style mustard and ground black pepper. Stir in chopped eggs, olives and chives.
Cut each bread slice into 4 triangles. Lay triangles flat and create a shallow hollow on the face of each. Brush  with olive oil and fill with mixture from the bowl.
Arrange slices on baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes, or until bread is lightly toasted. Garnish with paprika before serving.
