Ingredients:
3 cups bread flour
2 teaspoons active dry yeast
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 oz black olives (1 can) drained and sliced
3 tbsp. olive oil
1 1/4 cups warm water
1 tbsp. cornmeal
1 tbsp. (heaping) Italian seasoning
1 tbsp. minced garlic

Directions:
1.  Place warm water in a large bowl and add yeast and sugar.
2.  Let that stand while you lightly grease a cookie sheet and sprinkle the corn meal on the greased surface, then fill a pan with water and place it on the bottom shelf of your oven.
3.  Add all other ingredients to the bowl with they water, sugar and yeast and mix well.
4.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead until smooth - five to ten minutes, then let rise until doubled in size.
5.  Punch down and knead well again for five to ten minutes, then let rise  to double size.
6. Round the dough on the board, then place upside down in a bowl lined with a well-floured lint-free cloth and let rise a third time until double in size again.
7.  preheat oven to 400 degrees while bread rises.
8.  Gently turn bread out onto the prepared cookie sheet and place in oven for 15 minutes.
9.  Reduce oven temp to 350 and bake for 30 to 40 more minutes, or until golden brown.
10. Remove from oven and gently wipe the surface with butter.
Let cool slightly before slicing, or slice with VERY little pressure - an electric carving knife is best for this.
Bread must be in a warm place to rise - but not HOT.
