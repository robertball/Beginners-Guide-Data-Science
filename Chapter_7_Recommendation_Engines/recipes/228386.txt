Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 1/2 cups diced onions
salt to taste
1 large Yukon Gold potato, peeled and diced
1 1/2 cups roughly chopped celery
6 green onions, chopped
8 cloves garlic
6 cups baby carrots
10 cups vegetable stock
4 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 teaspoon mild curry powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a pressure cooker over medium heat; cook and stir onions and salt in the hot butter until onions become translucent, about 10 minutes. Add potato, celery, green onions, and garlic; cook until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrots and vegetable stock; increase heat to high. Place lid on pressure cooker and lock. Set valve to 15 pounds per square inch (psi) or 'high', depending on model; bring to pressure. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook for 7 minutes.
Transfer pressure cooker to sink; pour cold water over the cooker to release pressure. Return cooker to stove and remove the lid. Stir cream and curry powder into soup. Puree soup with an immersion blender until completely smooth. Season with salt and black pepper.
