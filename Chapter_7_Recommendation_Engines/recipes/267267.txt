Ingredients:
cooking spray
5 eggs, beaten
2 Roma tomatoes, chopped and drained
4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled
1 tablespoon whipped cream cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons basil pesto
1 (14 ounce) package pre-baked pizza crust
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Spray a medium skillet with cooking spray; warm over medium heat.
Whisk eggs, tomato, bacon, cream cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour into the skillet; cook and stir until eggs are set, 3 to 5 minutes.
Spread pesto evenly over pizza crust and layer on the egg mixture. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and pizza is hot, 10 to 15 minutes. Cut and serve.

Description: 
I had something similar for breakfast at a restaurant recently that I decided to try to emulate. My attempt turned out extremely well. This is something that you can prepare the night before then heat in the oven for a quick breakfast the next morning.
