Ingredients:
1 pound ground buffalo meat
1 pound ground turkey
1/4 large sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®), chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
Mix buffalo, turkey, onion, garlic, parsley, sea salt, and Worcestershire sauce together in a bowl; form into 12 large meatballs. Place meatballs in a glass casserole dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue baking until meatballs are cooked through, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
