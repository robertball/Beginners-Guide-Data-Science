Ingredients:
5 pounds miniature smoked sausages (or hot dogs)
1 qt beer
1 qt BBQ sauce (sweet, tomato style)

Directions:
Place sausages in a slow cooker (crockpot).  Add enough beer to cover. Cook for 2-3 hours, until sausages plump up. Drain and return to crockpot. Add BBQ sauce. Cook for an additional 1-3 hours.
It is just as good when substituting hot dogs cut into 1 in pieces for sausages.
