Ingredients:
1/2 cup uncooked white, jasmine or sushi rice
1 cup water
1 teaspoon wasabi powder or paste, or to taste (I use 2 teaspoons)
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon pickled ginger juice
3 sheets sushi nori, crumbled or cut into squares
1/2 English cucumber, cut into 1 inch strips
1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and cubed
2 cups shredded imitation crabmeat
2 tablespoons pickled ginger, diced

Directions:
Prepare rice: Place rice and water in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender. Set aside to cool.
Prepare dressing: In a small bowl, stir together the wasabi powder/paste(to taste, 2 teaspoons is pretty hot), mayonnaise, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar and sesame oil. Add to cooled rice and  toss to coat and breakup rice clumps.
Toss nori, cucumber, avocado, crabmeat and pickled ginger into rice. Careful not to over mix because avocado will break down. Chill and serve.
