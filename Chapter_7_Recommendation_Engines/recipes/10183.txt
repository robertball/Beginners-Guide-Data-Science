Ingredients:
3 tablespoons shortening
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/3 cup molasses
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 dash ground allspice

Directions:
In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and molasses until smooth. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice; blend into the creamed mixture.  Work dough with hands until well blended. Cover and chill for about 4 hours.  Dough must be thoroughly chilled to hold together.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll out dough paper thin a little at a time.  Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters.  Place on greased baking sheets.
Bake 5 to 6 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned.
