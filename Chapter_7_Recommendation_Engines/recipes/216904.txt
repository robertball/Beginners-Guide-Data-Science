Ingredients:
2 tablespoons shallot, minced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons blackberry jam
1 cup red wine
1 cup beef stock
1 tablespoon butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 (1/2 pound) venison steaks
12 fresh blackberries

Directions:
Heat shallots, garlic, blackberry jam, and red wine in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer until reduced to 1/2 cup of liquid, about 15 minutes. Strain liquid through a fine mesh sieve and set aside. Heat the beef broth in a separate skillet over medium-high heat until reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes. Whisk the two reduced sauces together, and stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the venison steaks until they are beginning to firm, and are hot and slightly pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Serve the steaks with the sauce and a few fresh blackberries.
