Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package cheese gnocchi
1/3 cup finely chopped shallots
1/3 cup Pinot Grigio wine
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup salted sweet cream butter
1 teaspoon black truffle oil
1 cup finely grated Grana Padano cheese
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon black truffle salt
3 thin slices shaved black truffle (optional)
1 tablespoon Grana Padano cheese, or to taste
black sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain gnocchi, and reserve and set aside 1/4 cup cooking water.
Bring shallots and wine to a boil in a large saute pan. Reduce heat slightly and simmer until reduced by half, 5 to 7 minutes. Add butter and cook until melted. Stir in truffle oil until well distributed. Add reserved cooking water, gnocchi, and Grada Padano cheese; toss until evenly covered and cook over medium-low heat until heated through and cheese has melted. Add pepper and truffle salt; toss well.
Transfer to a large serving bowl. Top with shaved truffles and remaining cheese and season with black sea salt and pepper.
