Ingredients:
1 12-ounce package fresh cranberries
1 egg white
1/2 teaspoon water
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 cup sugar

Directions:
Whisk the egg white, water and cardamom in a large bowl until frothy.
Add the fresh cranberries to the egg white mixture and stir to coat all the cranberries.
Put the sugar in a flat bowl and roll each cranberry (one at a time works best) in the sugar until coated.
Using a teaspoon or small fork, place the sugared cranberries on wax paper to dry.
They take two or three hours to dry throughly depending on the temperature and humidity in your house and kitchen.  I let mine dry overnight.
