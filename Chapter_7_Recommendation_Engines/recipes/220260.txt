Ingredients:
2 pounds halibut, cut into bite size pieces
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
3/4 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce
1/2 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon sesame oil
4 cups thinly sliced mushrooms
2 cups thinly sliced onions
1 lemon, cut in half
Kosher salt, to taste
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
3/4 cup sliced green onions

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Set an oven rack into the center of the oven.
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and a layer of cooking spray.
Arrange halibut pieces on the prepared baking sheet so that all pieces are touching.
Mix the mayonnaise, lemon juice, chili garlic sauce, sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a bowl; fold the mushrooms and onion into the mayonnaise mixture.
Spread the mushroom mixture over the halibut pieces.
Squeeze one lemon half over the mushroom mixture; sprinkle with Kosher salt.
Bake in the preheated oven until almost opaque, 15 to 20 minutes; remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Raise the oven rack with the baking sheet to the next-highest level switch the oven to broil.
Continue cooking the fish under the broiler until the top is browned, about 10 minutes.
Squeeze the remaining lemon half evenly over the fish.
Sprinkle with sesame seeds and green onions.

Description: 
I created this recipe because my family just loves the dynamite dishes served in sushi restaurants. It's a hit for all ages! This would even be great on top of chicken breasts! Serve atop of sushi rice and a side of steamed broccoli. Garnish with a lemon wedge.
