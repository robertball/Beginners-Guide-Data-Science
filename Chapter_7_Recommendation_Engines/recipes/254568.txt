Ingredients:
6 cups cubed russet potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream
1 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle WhipÂ®)
1/2 teaspoon coarse ground black pepper
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/2 cup chopped green onions
1/2 cup real bacon bits

Directions:
Place potatoes in a pot; fill with water until potatoes are covered. Add salt; bring to boil. Simmer until potatoes are just tender enough to be pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes. Drain and run under cold water until potatoes are slightly cool.
Mix sour cream, creamy salad dressing, and ground black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in Cheddar cheese, green onion, and bacon bits; add potatoes. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
