Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 8” round cake pan.
In a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time. Add almond flour and mix until smooth. Fold in cherimoya and cinnamon.
Pour into greased pan. Bake in the oven for ?30 minutes. Top with shaved almonds and continue baking until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, another 15 minutes.
Cool completely before topping with powdered sugar to serve.
