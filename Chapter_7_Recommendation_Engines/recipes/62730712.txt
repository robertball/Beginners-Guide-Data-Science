Ingredients:
Bunch of kale
Olive oil
Salt, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Hold the thick stem of each kale leaf with one hand. Pinch the base with the fingers of the other hand and rub them up the stem - the leaves will tear right off!
Put the kale pieces on a baking sheet lined with a silpat (a silicone baking mat) or with parchment paper.
Pour on a little olive oil and toss with clean hands.  Sprinkle with salt (and pepper if your kids like that...)
Make sure they are in a single layer on the baking sheet sheet.
Bake at 350 for 12-14 minutes or until crisp.
Keep an eye on them in case they start to burn.

Description: 
For people like me who tend to eat just a few too many tortilla chips, this recipe is pure heaven.  It's hard to argue with eating too much kale!
