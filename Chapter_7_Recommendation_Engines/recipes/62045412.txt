Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef, defrosted
1/3 package southern hash browns
1 can or 2 cups of whole kernel yellow corn
1 tsp cayanne pepper (add more if you want)
3 tbsp cajun spices

Directions:
We have something in the NW called "Cajun Spice", so if you don't have it available, improvise with other spicy ingredients.
Brown ground beef with the cayanne pepper and cajun spices.  Drain off most of the grease.
Add the hash browns to the pan and fry until cooked and beginning to turn brown.
Add the corn and mix thoroughly.
Add more spices if you want, or not...  It depends on your taste.  As written, you should feel a slight kick, but not enough to set your mouth on fire.
Enjoy!

Description: 
My husband requested something simple with a kick to it, but we didn't have much in the house at the time...  This is a great leftovers recipe...
