Crockpot Yogurt Recipe

Ingredients:
1/2 gallon 1% milk, make sure it's NOT "Ultra-pasturized"
1 cup vanilla flavored greek yogurt (or save some from a previous batch)
1/2 cup powdered milk
3/4 cup honey
1 Tbsp of vanilla

Directions:
Pour 1/2 gallon of milk into crockpot.
Cover, turn to the 8 hour setting and let the milk heat until almost boiling. This kills off any competing bacteria so that the yogurt will respond better to the culture we’ll be adding in later. The actual temp is 180F. Mine takes about 3 hours.
Turn the crockpot off. Take the lid of and let cool back down to 115F or where you can stick your finger in and leave it for 10 seconds. If the milk is any hotter than this then it will kill off the yogurt cultures. Stir it around every once in a while as it’s cooling. This takes about an hour
Stir in yogurt, powdered milk, honey, and vanilla.
Put lid back on, wrap entire crockpot with a beach or bath towel and set away for 8-12 hours. The yogurt needs to cool down sloooowly. I usually stick it in the oven–keeps it away from drafts and it will retain some more of the heat longer.
Stir it up, put it in mason jars, and refrigerate. Don't worry, it will thicken up once in the refrigerator.
