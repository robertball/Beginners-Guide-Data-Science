Ingredients:
2 cups panko bread crumbs
3 tablespoons tapioca starch
1/2 cup tapioca starch
2 large eggs, beaten
1 eggplant, cut into matchsticks
1 large zucchini, cut into matchsticks
vegetable oil for frying
1/2 teaspoon malt vinegar, or to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
salt to taste
1 cup ranch dressing
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Directions:
Pulse bread crumbs in a food processor into a fine powder. Pour into a bowl; stir in 3 tablespoons tapioca starch.
Place 1/2 cup tapioca starch and eggs in separate bowls.
Dust each piece of eggplant and zucchini with tapioca starch; dip into the eggs and coat with bread crumb mixture. Arrange dredged vegetables on a baking sheet.
Heat 1 1/2 inches oil in a saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fry vegetables in batches, turning occasionally, until golden and heated through, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Drizzle vinegar over vegetables. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top; season with salt. Serve with ranch dressing and lemon wedges.

Description: 
My lifelong search for a good and crispy deep-fried eggplant recipe has been solved...with the addition of a secret ingredient: tapioca flour! These are so yummy and a great base to be tweaked into any flavor profile you wish. Interesting mix-ins could be sesame seeds with an Asian dipping sauce or cumin and cayenne and a salsa dip.
