Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup sushi rice, rinsed
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 medium carrot, peeled and thinly sliced into 1-inch strips
1/2 cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced into 1-inch strips
6 pieces imitation crab sticks, chopped, or more to taste
1/4 cup pickled ginger (optional)
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons wasabi sauce
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 sheets nori, torn into nickel-sized pieces
1/2 ripe avocado, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt to a slight boil in a saucepan, about 5 minutes. Stir until dissolved and let cool 2 minutes. Pour mixture over cooked rice. Transfer to a serving bowl.
Combine carrot, cucumber, crab sticks, ginger, water, wasabi, and oil in a bowl.
Combine wet crab mixture with cooked rice in the serving bowl. Add avocado and nori just before serving. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top.
