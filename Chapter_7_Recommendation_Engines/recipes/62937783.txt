Ingredients:
1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
3 Tbs maple syrup
2 Tbs orange juice concentrate
1 Tbs Dijon mustard
4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, skinned

Directions:
Salt and pepper salmon, rub into the fish.
Combine first 4 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag; add fish. Seal and marinate in refrigerator 3 hours.
Remove fish from bag while the grill is heating to medium high. Pour marinade into a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until reduced to 2 tablespoons (about 5 minutes).
Place fish on grill rack or pan coated with cooking spray; grill 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork or until desired degree of doneness, basting occasionally with marinade. Remove fish from grill; sprinkle with salt and pepper.
