Ingredients:
2 cans salmon, with juice
1 cup oatmeal
1/2 cup chickpea flour
2 eggs
2 tablespoons cod liver oil
1/2 cup chicken broth
Non-stick cooking spray

Directions:
Spray the cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
Mix all ingredients together in a medium bowl, until you have a dough that can be rolled out.
Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 1/4 ", or slightly thicker.
With a sharp knife, score the dough part way through, both horizontally and vertically to make a checkerboard pattern. The squares should be small, as each square will be one treat.
Place in oven and bake for approximately 45 minutes, until fully baked and golden.
Break into squares along the score lines and freeze, thawing them out as your kitty requires.
