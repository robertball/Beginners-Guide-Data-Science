Ingredients:
4 matzo sheets
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste
2 apples - peeled, cored and cubed
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish. Break the matzo sheets into pieces, and soak in a bowl of water until soft. Drain in a colander, mashing to squeeze the water out.
In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, salt, sugar, oil and cinnamon. Add the soaked matzo, and mix well. Fold in the apples and raisins. Spoon into the prepared baking dish, and spread evenly.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until nicely browned and apples are tender.
