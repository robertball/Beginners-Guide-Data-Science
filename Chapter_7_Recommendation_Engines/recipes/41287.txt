Ingredients:
1 medium head cabbage, cored
1 1/2 cups chopped onion, divided
1 tablespoon butter
2 (14.5 ounce) cans Italian stewed tomatoes
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 cup cooked rice
1/4 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 pound bulk Italian sausage
1/2 cup V-8 juice (optional)

Directions:
In a Dutch oven, cook cabbage in boiling water for 10 minutes or until outer leaves are tender; drain. Rinse in cold water; drain. Remove eight large outer leaves (refrigerate remaining cabbage for another use); set aside.
In a saucepan, saute 1 cup onion in butter until tender. Add tomatoes, garlic, brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine rice, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, pepper and remaining onion and salt. Add beef and sausage; mix well.
Remove thick vein from cabbage leaves for easier rolling. Place about 1/2 cup meat mixture on each leaf; fold in sides. Starting at an unfolded edge, roll up leaf to completely enclose filling. Place seam side down in a skillet. Top with the sauce. Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 1 hour. Add V-8 juice if desired.
Reduce heat to low; cook 20 minutes longer or until rolls are heated through and meat is no longer pink.
