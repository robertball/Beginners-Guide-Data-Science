Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups white sugar
1 3/4 cups water
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1 (12 ounce) package frozen unsweetened raspberries
1 1/2 cups cherry juice
1/2 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate

Directions:
Bring the sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. When the sugar is dissolved, stir in the cranberries, and cook and stir for 5 minutes. Add the raspberries, and simmer for 5 more minutes, until the raspberries have softened and the cranberries have popped.
Strain the mixture through a sieve or strainer, discard the pulp, and refrigerate the mixture for 2 hours. Mix in the cherry juice, lime juice, and orange juice concentrate, and pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to directions.
Pack the sorbet into a freezer container and freeze for about 2 hours, until the sorbet is firm. Remove from the freezer about 10 minutes before serving.
