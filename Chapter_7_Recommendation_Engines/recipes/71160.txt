Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
2 cups water
1 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 onion, thinly sliced
1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 skinless, boneless chicken breast half - cut into strips
4 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 eggs, beaten
6 snow peas, thinly sliced

Directions:
Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a small saucepan. Stir in the soy sauce and brown sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Reduce heat to low; keep warm.
Heat several tablespoons of the chicken sauce in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onion and shiitake mushrooms in the sauce until the onion has softened, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken, green onions, and a few more tablespoons of the sauce; continue cooking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Spread the chicken mixture evenly over the skillet; pour the beaten egg overtop. Reduce heat to medium-low and sprinkle with the snow peas. Cook and stir until the egg has firmed and is no longer runny, about 3 minutes.
Divide the rice between two bowls and spoon the egg mixture evenly overtop. Pour additional chicken sauce over the rice to serve.

Description: 
This dish is very easy to make and very Japanese. It reminds me of dishes I've ordered in Japanese restaurants. You can add Korean hot sauce if you like it a little spicy.
