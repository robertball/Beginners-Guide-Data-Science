Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 (1 pound) package smoked sausage, chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
10 cups water
3 cups chopped cabbage
2 carrots, thinly sliced
1 (15.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
4 beef bouillon cubes
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1 dash cayenne pepper
2 small zucchini, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (8 ounce) package thin egg noodles
grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; cook the sausage, onions, bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until the onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the water, cabbage, carrots, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, beef bouillon cubes, seasoned salt, thyme, and cayenne pepper to the stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the stockpot, and cook the soup at a simmer for 45 minutes. Stir the zucchini and beans into the soup; cook another 10 minutes.
Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles in boiling water until cooked yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and stir into the soup. Ladle the soup into bowls, and top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
