Ingredients:
½ ounce dried porcini mushrooms
2 tablespoons ghee (or fat of choice)
2 onions, diced
1 teaspoon tomato paste
½ teaspoon fish sauce
½ pound cremini mushrooms, sliced
3 garlic cloves, minced
4 cups bone broth or organic chicken stock
3 fresh thyme sprigs
kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Rinse the dried mushrooms with cool water and place them in a small bowl. Add enough water to cover the mushrooms and set aside for at least 30 minutes to soften.
In a medium saucepan, melt the ghee over medium heat. Add in the onions and sauté for 10 to 15 minutes or until translucent.
Add fish sauce and tomato paste, stir until evenly distributed.
Add mushrooms (Cremini), cook until the liquid they make evaporates (10 minutes).
Add garlic, let the mixture cook for about 30 seconds.
Add, chopped porcini mushrooms (drained) and chicken broth (use vegetable stock to make it vegetarian).
Add thyme and bring the mixture to a boil.
Decrease heat to medium-low to maintain a strong simmer/low boil, and cook until the gravy has reduced by half, about 30 minutes.
Take off heat, remove thyme and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Let the mixture cool slightly, and then blend with immersion or stand blender.
