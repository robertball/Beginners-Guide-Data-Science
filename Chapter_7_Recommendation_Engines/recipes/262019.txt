1 small onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
3 (15 ounce) cans navy beans, drained

Description: 
On a recent trip to Paris I ordered the special at Le Cafe Marguerite. After sightseeing in the freezing rain, we needed something warm. I got a delicious dish of boiled ham, salami, potatoes, cabbage, and carrots. 

I love ham bean soup and make it quite a bit in the cold months. I dress up my normal recipe with salami and cabbage. 

I love adding turnip, potato, carrot and zucchini, too. This a great recipe to play with. 

The result is quite delicious. Enjoy.
