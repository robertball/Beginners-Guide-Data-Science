Ingredients:
1 otter pop, frozen
2 tablespoons Tequila
1 tablespoon Triple Sec or Cointreau
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 cup ice cubes
salt and agave nectar to taste

Directions:
Combine all ingredients in a blender, process to desired consistency. I made mine as a slush. Sprinkle  a little salt and add a few drops of agave nectar (or more if you like sweet).  If you like salty rim, wet the edge of your glass and press into salt.

Description: 
This drink was created as a challenge. Nachos called for a Margarita, but last minute store run did not seem practical. Otter pop makes a pretty cocktail. What's better, you can offer different flavors to your guests and have a colorful party!
