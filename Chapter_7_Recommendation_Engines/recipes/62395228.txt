Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix
4 eggs
1/3 cup oil
1 1/3 cup water
1 box brownie mix
1/4 cup oil
1/2 cup water
2 eggs
or ingredients per cake mix box and brownie box
1 can prepared frosting or 1 cup homemade frosting
yellow, red and green food coloring
corn syrup, optional
white sesame seeds, optional

Directions:
Mix both cake and brownies as per directions on box. Bake cake batter in greased round cake forms or mini muffin tins, per box direction. At 350 for about 15 minutes.
Bake brownies in greased 9 x 13 in ch pan, per box directions.
Allow cupcakes and brownies to cool throughly. Cut cupcakes in half. Cut 12 rounds from the brownies using a round biscuit or cookie cutter, the "burger should be as wide as the cupcake or slightly smaller.
Mix 1/4 cup yellow frosting, 1/4 c red frosting and 1/2c cup green frosting. Put frosting into 3 seperate piping bags fit with a #3 or a #59 on the yellow and red bags. A #102 on the green bag. (these are just the tips I used, you can use whatever you have on hand.)
Pipe as small dot of green frosting on the bottom of each "bun", place a brownie round on each bun. Using the red and yellow bags, add mustard and ketchup to the edges of "burger". Then pipe a rectangle arounf the edge of the "burger" with the green frosting to make the lettuce. Top each burger with the top bun. Spread a thin layer of corn syrup on the top bun and sprinkle a few sesame seeds on each bun.
