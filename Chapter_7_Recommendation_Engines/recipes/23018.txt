6 ounces shredded Gruyere cheese
1 cup mayonnaise

In small mixing bowl, toss the bread crumbs with 1 tablespoon of melted butter; mix thoroughly and set aside.
In another small bowl, combine the cheese, mayonnaise, wine and parsley; mix thoroughly and set aside.
In a skillet over medium heat, saute scallops in 2 tablespoons of melted butter until opaque. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels. Preheat broiler for medium/high heat.
Reheat the skillet over medium heat and cook the mushrooms and onion in 2 tablespoons of melted butter until tender. Add cheese mixture and return the scallops to the skillet.
