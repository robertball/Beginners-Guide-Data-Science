Ingredients:
1 Venison loin(roughly 2.5-3 pounds)
1/4 cup port wine
1/4 seedless rasberty preserves
3/4 cup olive oil
1 tbs dried oregano
1 tbs minced garlic
1 tbs dried rosemary
1/2 tbs dried thyme
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Combine all ingredients, whisk till all combined.
Remove any silver-skin from venison loin and pour mixture over allowing to marinate at least 2 hours.
Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat and preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Sear venison loin on each side (reserve marinade) then transfer to a roasting rack place in oven for 20 minute or until internal temp reads 130 then remove and tent with aluminum foil for 10 minutes.  Place reserved marinade in sauce pan, bring to a boil, and let reduce by roughly 1/2, or until it reaches a syrupy consistency.  Thicken with cornstarch or flour if needed.  Spoon sauce over sliced loin and serve
