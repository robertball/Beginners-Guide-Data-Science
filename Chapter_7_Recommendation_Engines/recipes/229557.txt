Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
salt to taste
white pepper to taste
4 cups milk
1 (16 ounce) package corkscrew-shaped pasta (fusilli)
2 egg yolks
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 (12 ounce) package garlic chicken sausage (such as al frescoÂ® All Natural Roasted Garlic Chicken Sausage), sliced

Directions:
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk flour into the melted butter until dissolved, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and white pepper. Pour milk into the flour mixture; cook and stir until sauce is smooth and thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl.
Remove sauce from heat and stir in egg yolks and nutmeg until well incorporated. Pour sauce over pasta; toss to coat.
Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir sausage into pasta; season with salt and white pepper.
