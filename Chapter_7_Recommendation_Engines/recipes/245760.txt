Ingredients:
Meatloaf:
cooking spray
1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey
1 small onion, grated
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Buffalo Sauce:
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHotÂ®)
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste
Blue Cheese Dressing:
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste
1 pinch black pepper, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking pan with aluminum foil; spray lightly with cooking spray.
Combine ground turkey, grated onion, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl; mix to combine. Transfer turkey mixture to baking pan and shape into a loaf.
Bake meatloaf in the preheated oven until light golden, about 40 minutes.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in hot pepper sauce, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon onion powder. Pour evenly over meatloaf.
Return meatloaf to the oven and cook until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, and blue cheese crumbs in a bowl to make blue cheese dressing. Season with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, and black pepper. Serve alongside meatloaf.
