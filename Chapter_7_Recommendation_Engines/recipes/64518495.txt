Ingredients:
1 gal of apple cider
1 gal of water (may need more to cover turkey in bucket)
1 1/2 cups of kosher salt (add more if you add more water)
zest of 1 orange
1/3 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp ground ginger
2 tsp chopped garlic
4 bay leaves
1/4 fresh ground pepper
2-3 lbs ice

Directions:
In a clean plastic food grade 5 gallon bucket put all of the ingredients except the ice in.
Stir until salt is dissolved.  Place thawed turkey slowly into bucket. Make sure it is completely immersed.  Add the ice. Cover with lid. Place bucket in cool area. Leave set for 12-24 hours.
I suggest getting the apple cider in the fall from a farmers market. Buy a gallon then put half of it into another gallon container for freezing. It has to have room to expand.
Take turkey out of brine. Discard the brine. Give the turkey a quick rinse with cold water. Place in oven, bbq, or smoker.  I suggest covering it for the first couple of hours because the sugar will burn the skin before it is done cooking.
