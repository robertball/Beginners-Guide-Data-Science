Description: 
This is a family recipe from my husband.  I always serve with pressure cooked pinto beans and tortillas.  The chilis can be purchased and roasted from farms in September and then peeled and frozen for use the rest of the year.  you can also buy fresh halepenios and roast them on the barbeque. When handling and peeling the chilis always wear gloves to avoid burns.
