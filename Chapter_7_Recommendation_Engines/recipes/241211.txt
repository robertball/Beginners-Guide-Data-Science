Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package al frescoÂ® Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage, browned, sliced on the bias
4 (10 inch) sun-dried tomato wraps or tortillas
16 thin slices provolone cheese
6 ounces roasted red peppers, drained, sliced
1 fresh avocado, thinly sliced
2/3 cup grated carrots
2/3 cup mild salsa
1/2 cup fat-free sour cream

Directions:
Warm a 10-inch skillet on medium heat, coat with cooking spray.
Place 1 piece of the flat bread in the pan and top with 4 slices of the cheese. Follow with half the slices of Smoked Andouille, and half of the red pepper strips, avocado slices, and shredded carrots filling in a circular pattern. Top with half the salsa. Finish with 4 more pieces of the cheese and a piece of flat bread.
Allow the bottom to brown and heat through well, 4 - 5 minutes. Pre-heat broiler.
Once well browned, spray top tortilla with cooking spray and place quesadilla under broiler to nicely brown the top. Use a watchful eye for this step, since the top can brown quickly. Allow to rest for 3 - 5 minutes.
Place a large platter over the pan and carefully flip over. Slice into 8 wedges and serve with a dollop of sour cream.
Repeat to make second quesadilla.
