Ingredients:
8 large egg whites
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup coconut flour
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup coconut oil, or as needed

Directions:
Whisk egg whites, water, coconut flour, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl until smooth.
Melt 1 to 2 teaspoons coconut oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, swirling pan to coat surface to the edges.
Pour about 3 tablespoons batter into the hot skillet, tilting pan to spread batter around.
Cook until bottom side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes; flip and continue cooking until other side is also browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining coconut oil and batter.
