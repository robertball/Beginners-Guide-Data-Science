Ingredients:
1/4 cup (57g) butter
2 dark chocolate squares (approx 20g)
6 tbs (48g) cocoa powder
1/2 cup (100g) white sugar
1/2 cup (105g) brown sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup (65g) flour
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup (125 ml) dulce de leche
caramel or toffee dessert topping

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350ºF (175ºC) and grease an 8x8 (20cm x 20cm) square baking pan
Melt the butter in a metal or glass bowl that is placed over a pot of boiling water to create a double boiler.  Once the butter is melted stir in the chocolate squares until they are melted and combined into the butter mixture.
Stir the cocoa powder, both sugars, salt, flour and vanilla into the melted butter and chocolate until combined.  Stir in the eggs with a spoon or spatula - try not to use more than 30 or 40 strokes.
Pour a little over 1/2 of the brownie batter into the greased pan.  Drop small spoon fulls of the dulce de leche evenly spaced across the the top of the batter.  Lightly drag a knife through the dollops of dulce de leche to create a slight swirl pattern.  Cover with the remaining brownie batter.  Take the caramel or toffee dessert topping and create a swirling pattern across the top of the brownies.
Bake for 25-30 mins.
