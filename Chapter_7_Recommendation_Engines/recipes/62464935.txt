Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons of coconut oil
3 leek, white and green parts, chopped into 1 inch cubes; rinse several times to remove sand
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 large potato, peeled and cubed
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1-32 oz container of organic vegetable broth, low sodium
1 head white cauliflower, chopped
1 can of light coconut milk
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon allspice
Chopped parsley, for garnish (optional)

Directions:
In a large pot over medium low heat, melt olive oil and coconut oil.  Stir in leek and garlic and cook until leek is translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in cauliflower, potato and carrots and cook for about 20-30 minutes more, or until tender, stirring occasionally.  Pour in vegetable broth and bring to a gentle simmer.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer on low until vegetables are tender, 10 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.
Puree in batches in a blender or food processor, or in the pot using an immersion blender.  Return to low heat and stir in light coconut milk and all the spices.  Heat through.  Serve garnished with parsley. Add additional seasonings to taste, if necessary
