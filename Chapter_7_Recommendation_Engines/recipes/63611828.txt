Ingredients:
2 chicken breasts, cooked and chopped in small     cubes
8 flour tortillas(8 inch)
Herdez Pasillo Chile sauce
1/2 cup corn
4 oz light cream cheese room temperature
2 tbsp fat free half and half (or milk)
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 cup shredded cheese
Garnish (if desired)
Sour cream
Black olives
Cilantro

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lightly spray a 13x9 inch pan. Spread the chile sauce to lightly coat the bottom, about 4 tbsp.
Mix the chopped chicken, corn, onion, and 1/2 a cup of the Herdez sauce in a large bowl.
Spread 3 tbsp of the chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle lightly with cheese, reserving at least 1/2 a cup to top all of the enchiladas. Roll the tortillas up and place seam side down in the prepared dish.
In a separate bowl, mix the cream cheese and 1/2 cup of the Herdez sauce and half and half to a smooth consistency. Top each enchilada equally with the cream sauce.
Place uncovered in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the enchiladas and continue to bake for 5 more minutes. Garnish with sour cream, olives, and cilantro.
