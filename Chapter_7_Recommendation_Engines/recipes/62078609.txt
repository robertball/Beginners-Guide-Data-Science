Ingredients:
2 spoons of butter (1 earlier, 1 later)
2 tsp Salt (1 earlier, 1 later)
2 tsp Pepper (1 earlier, 1 later)
2 lbs of filet mignon
1 Spoon of Ketchup
1 Spoon of Mustard
1 Spoon of Worcestershire Sauce
1 can of Crème de Leite (found at any Albertson’s store)

Directions:
Take the one spoon of salt, pepper and butter; mix and put all over little cut pieces of the filet mignon. Take the 2 lbs of filet mignon (cut in little pieces) frying it in a pan until thoroughly cooked. Make sure you put the cut meat little by little otherwise it will create foam.
After all the meat is cooked set aside.
Take the same pan and put the 2nd spoon of butter, salt and pepper inside the pan. Put the 1 spoon of ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and one can of the Crème de Leite inside the pan. Continue mixing  before it starts boiling and add the meat that was prepared before. Warm for about 5 minutes. Done!
Great served with Brazilian rice!
