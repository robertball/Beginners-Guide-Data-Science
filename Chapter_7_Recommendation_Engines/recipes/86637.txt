Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1 clove garlic, chopped
â…“ cup honey
1 tablespoon lemon juice
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat a grill for medium heat.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in honey and lemon juice. Reserve half for basting, and brush the other half onto the chicken breasts.
Lightly oil the grill grate, and place chicken on the grill. Cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, turning frequently. Baste often during the last 5 minutes. Chicken is done when the meat is firm, and juices run clear.
