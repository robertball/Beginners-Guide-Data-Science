Ingredients:
2 cups sugar snap peas, strings removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce

Directions:
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add snap peas, cover, and steam until tender, about 2 minutes.
Heat oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; saute garlic until nearly brown, about 2 minutes. Pour in snap peas and soy sauce. Cook and stir until snap peas begin to brown, about 4 minutes.
