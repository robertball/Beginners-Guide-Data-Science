Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 (8 ounce) package white chocolate chips
3/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries
1/2 cup sweetened shredded coconut
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer until creamy and smooth. Beat eggs, 1 at a time, into creamed butter mixture, beating until 1 egg is fully incorporated before adding the next; add vanilla extract and mix well. Stir white chocolate chips, cranberries, and coconut into creamed butter mixture.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; mix into the butter mixture until dough is thoroughly combined. Spoon dough in heaping spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, leaving 2 inches between each.
Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are slightly golden and center is partially soft, 10 to 13 minutes. Cool cookies on the baking sheet until soft and chewy.

Description: 
I made this recipe up recently, when I was invited to someone's house and found myself in a pinch with nothing to bring. After throwing it together and running out the door, I was pleasantly surprised when it was such a huge hit! I went home and tried to remember step-by-step what I did and I remade them to be sure. It's such an easy yet tasty cookie and the butter makes all the difference!
