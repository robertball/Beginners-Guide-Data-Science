Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup finely chopped shallots or onions
1 (24 ounce) jar Bertolli® Tomato and Basil Sauce
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, broiled or grilled and shredded
1/3 cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon pine nuts (optional)
24 sheets phyllo dough, thawed
1/2 cup I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!® Spread, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Heat olive oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook shallots, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes or until tender. Stir in sauce, chicken, roasted peppers, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Stir in cheese and pine nuts; let cool.
Meanwhile, unfold phyllo and cover with plastic wrap and damp cloth. Working with 4 layered, lightly buttered sheets at a time, cut sheets into 8 equal (2-x 12-in.) strips. Place 1 heaping teaspoon chicken mixture on top corner of each strip; fold corner over to opposite edge, forming a triangle. Continue folding, keeping triangle shape with each fold, until rolled completely to end. On ungreased baking sheet, arrange triangles and lightly brush with spread. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Bake 12 minutes or until golden brown. To serve, arrange each triangle on serving dish and, if desired, drizzle with additional heated sauce.
