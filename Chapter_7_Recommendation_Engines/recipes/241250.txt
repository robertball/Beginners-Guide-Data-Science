Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup quinoa
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1/2 red onion, chopped
3 cups torn kale leaves
2 cups broccoli florets
4 ounces tempeh, crumbled
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons tamari
1 lime, juiced
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

Directions:
Bring 2 cups water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
Heat coconut oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; saute red onion until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add kale, broccoli, tempeh, and garlic; saute until kale is wilted, about 3 minutes.
Whisk sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons water, tamari, lime juice, Dijon mustard, ginger, black pepper, and red pepper flakes together in a bowl; pour over kale mixture and cook for 2 minutes.
Spoon quinoa into serving bowls and top with kale mixture.
