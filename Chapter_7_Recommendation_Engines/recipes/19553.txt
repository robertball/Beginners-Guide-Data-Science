1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup persimmon pulp, pureed
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons warm water
7 tablespoons brandy
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 egg
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar

1 tablespoon brandy flavoring
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Stir together sugar and melted butter. Resift flour with salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add to butter mixture. Stir in persimmon pulp. Dissolve baking soda in warm water. Add to mixture with 3 tablespoons brandy and vanilla. Add eggs, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Add raisins and walnuts, stirring just until mixed.

Unmold onto serving dish. Pour about 4 tablespoons warmed brandy over pudding and flame. Serve with Brandy Whipped Cream Sauce.
Prepare the brandy whipped cream sauce by beating the egg until light and fluffy. Beat in butter, confectioners' sugar, salt and brandy flavoring. Whip cream until stiff. Gently fold into egg mixture. Cover and chill.
