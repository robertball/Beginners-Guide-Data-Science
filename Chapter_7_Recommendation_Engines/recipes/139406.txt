Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 onion, sliced
8 ounces fresh mushrooms, quartered
1 pound calves' liver, sliced
6 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cut into strips
1/2 cup dry sherry
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon dried basil, crushed

Directions:
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and mushrooms; cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet with a slotted spoon; set aside.
In the same skillet, cook liver over medium heat until brown on both sides.  Add sherry, rosemary, basil, and sauteed onion and mushrooms. Top each liver piece with a strip of cheese.
Cover and simmer 10 minutes.

Description: 
When I was a child, I could never enjoy the fried or smothered liver that Mom made because I didn't like liver.  As an adult, wishing to please a liver-loving friend, I found this recipe and was amazed to really like it myself.  I searched the web for this recipe to no avail and finally found it in my collection.  It's so good, I had to share.  Mushrooms, onion, Monterey Jack cheese, sherry, and herbs add a wonderful balance.
