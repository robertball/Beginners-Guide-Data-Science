Ingredients:
cooking spray
Crust:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cold butter
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
Custard:
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup lemon juice, or more to taste
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon lemon zest, or to taste (optional)
confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
Process 2 cups flour, butter, and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar in a food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; press into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the crust are golden brown, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool crust to room temperature.
Beat white sugar, eggs, 1/4 cup flour, lemon juice, baking powder, and lemon zest together in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy; pour onto the cooled crust.
Bake in the oven until custard is set, 25 to 28 minutes. Cool lemon squares completely; dust the top with more confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
I'd lost my family recipe for lemon squares and spent a lot of time trying new ones that would measure up. None did, but thankfully I recently found the recipe again. Best lemon squares out there.
