1 C Milk

Bring mixture to a boil over med-high heat; whisk frequently until the mixture begins to bubble and thicken. When it is the thickness you like, removed from heat and stir in 1 C of the shredded cheese.
Add cooked pasta to cheese sauce in the pot and mix together.
Dump coated pasta into a greased 9 by 13 inch pan. Sprinkle the remaining one cup of cheese over the top. Bake at 400 degrees until the cheese on the top is melted and brown.
