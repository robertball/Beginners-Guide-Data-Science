Ingredients:
1 2.5 - 3 lb pork roast trimmed of most of the fat
1 large onion cut on half and thinly sliced
1 cup of low sodium soy sauce
1 14oz can of pineapple tidbits with juice
1/4 cup of orange juice
2 tbsps of cornstarch

Directions:
Cook the pork roast, the pineapple with juice, the onion and the soy sauce in the slowcooker for 6-8 hours.
Remove the roast along with most of the onions and pineapple and pull the meat apart with 2 forks.
Pour the liquid from the slow cooker into a small saucepan over medium/high heat.
Mix the orange juice and cornstarch together and add to the liquid while stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
Simmer while stirring until thick.
Add the sauce back to the meat, onions and pineapple and stir together.
Serve on buns or with rice.

Description: 
I like the ease of pulled pork in the slow cooker, but am not a big fan of traditional bbq sauces. The pineapple in this recipe helps keep the pork moist. I like to use pork loin and vidalia onion in this recipe. This also is great as an eggroll filling.
