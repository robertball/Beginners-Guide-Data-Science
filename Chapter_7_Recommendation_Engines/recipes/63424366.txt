Ingredients:
4-7 lb. pork shoulder or pork butt (bone-in)
Dry Rub:
1 tbsp. ground cumin
1 tbsp.garlic powder
1 tbsp. onion powder
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 tbsp. cayenne pepper
1 tbsp. salt
1 tbsp. ground pepper
1 tbsp. paprika
1/2 cup brown sugar
Brine:
1/2 cup salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 qts. cold water
3 tbsp. dry rub mix
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Combine dry rub ingredients and set aside.
For brine, add salt to water and stir well to combine then add brown sugar and 3 tbsp. of the dry rub and stir well to combine.
Rinse meat and place in a container or zip loc bag large enough to hold meat and brine.
Pour brine over meat, add bay leaves, and refrigerate at least 8 hours.
Preheat oven to 225 and place brined meat in a roasting pan.
Pat meat dry with paper towels and very generously coat meat with dry rub(you do not have to use all of the dry rub)
Massage rub into meat and make sure fat layer is facing up when you are finished.
Cook to an internal temperature of 200 degrees - about 1.5 - 2 hours per pound.
When 200 degrees is reached, turn off the oven but let the meat stay in there about 2 hours - if the bottom of the pan is very dry - cover with foil, if there is juice in the bottom of the pan there is no need to cover it.
When the internal temperature reaches about 170 degrees, remove from oven.
Place meat on large cutting board and remove layer of fat then start pulling meat apart with large forks.
Taste test meat then sprinkle with additional dry rub if necessary and rub in to shredded meat.
