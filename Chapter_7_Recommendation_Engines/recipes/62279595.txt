Ingredients:
Green Goddess Dressing:
¼ cup Silk Unsweetened
3 ounces silken tofu (1/4 block)
¼ cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons fresh parsley leaves
2 green onions, green section only, chopped
8 large basil leaves, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 avocado
½ teaspoon salt
freshly ground pepper
Salad:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, poached, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 avocados, peeled, halved, cut into ½-inch cubes
1 head romaine, leaves cut into 1/2-inch-wide strips
6 slices bacon, cooked until crisp, crumbled
2 medium tomatoes (3/4 lb), cut into 1/2-inch pieces
½ cup Roquefort cheese, crumbled
1 bunch watercress, coarse stems discarded
2 hard-boiled large eggs, halved and finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Directions:
Prepare dressing. Place all ingredients in a blender or mini food processor and blend until smooth. Adjust salt and pepper. Chill until ready to serve.
Prepare four individual salads. Divide romaine lettuce and watercress among 4 large salad plates. Arrange remaining ingredients in sections or patterns on top of greens on each plate.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve Green Goddess dressing on the side.
If one large salad is preferred, place romaine in a large salad bowl. Layer remaining ingredients in the order listed: chicken, avocado, bacon, tomatoes, Roquefort, watercress, eggs, chives, salt and pepper.
Drizzle with dressing when ready to serve, or serve dressing on the side.
