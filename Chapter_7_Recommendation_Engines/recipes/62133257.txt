Ingredients:
1 packet (0.25 oz.) active dry yeast
2 1/2 c. warm milk
1/3 c. honey
1/4 c. butter, melted
2 t. salt
8 to 8 1/2 c. bread flour

Directions:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in the warm milk.
Add honey, butter, salt and 5 c. of flour, stirring until smooth.
Now stir in about 2 c. of the remaining flour to form a soft dough.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface and begin kneading, adding more of the 1 1/2 c. of flour as needed, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. This should take 7 to 10 minutes.
Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.
Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled, about 1 hr.
Punch dough down. Divide in half and shape into loaves.
Place in two greased 9x5 loaf pans.
Cover and let rise until doubled, approx. 30 min.
Bake at 350 degrees F. for about 40 minutes or until golden brown.
Brush tops with butter if desired.
Remove from pans and cool on wire racks.
