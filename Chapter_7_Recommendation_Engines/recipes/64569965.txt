Ingredients:
3 small, very ripe bananas
1 large egg white
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 tsp almond extract
1/4 cup unsalted peanut butter
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 1/2 cups Gluten Free rolled oats
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/3 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and prepare a muffin tin by spraying it with cooking spray.
Using a standing mixer or using a hand mixer, add the egg white and bananas and blend together until banana is mashed very well and incorporated into the egg. I usually let mine go 5-7 minutes.
Then add almond extract, almond milk, sugar and peanut butter to the town and blend until combined.
Next add oats, cocoa powder, baking power and salt to the bowl and mix to combine. Do not over mix.
Finally fold in chocolate chips into the batter by hand.
Transfer to your muffin tin filling the batter about 3/4 of the way full.
Bake 15-18 minutes until a toothpick can be removed clean, these will be thick so check before removing from the oven.
Remove from the oven, cool in the pan 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Sprinkle muffin tops with cinnamon and add 1 extra chip on top of each muffin if desired.
Keep muffins in the refrigerator in a storage container up to 1 week or freeze up to a month.
