Ingredients:
-6-9lb brisket-
-Fiesta brand brisket rub
-Mustard
-1/4 cup water mixed with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce put into a spray bottle

Directions:
-Wash brisket and trim any extra fat (save the fat)-Coat with mustard-Cover with rub-Bring up to room temp before smoking-Place on smoker once it's at 220-225-Smoke approx 1-1/4-1-1/2 hrs per pound-Sprits with water/worcestershire mix every couple of hours-Looking for an internal temp of about 200-205. Brisket is ready when thermometer slides in and out of meat like knife thru hot butter-Stall usually occurs at about 160-165.  At this point wrap in foil (place a layer of the fat trimmed off earlier on top of and below the brisket once in foil) and put back on smoker until 195-200 internal is reached and thermometer  easily slides through meat -Once done leave in foil, place in ice chest(with no ice in it) and let rest 1 or 2 hours.

Description: 
Beef brisket slow smoked with mesquite, Texas style. Time consuming but very tasty.  It is best to have a decent digital thermometer because internal temperature is an important part of cooking this way.
