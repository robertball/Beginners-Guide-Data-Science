Ingredients:
2 teaspoons butter, divided
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, grated
1 (16 ounce) package large curd cottage cheese
2 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup parsley, minced

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan with 1 teaspoon butter.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain.
Mix Monterey Jack cheese, cottage cheese, eggs, and salt together in bowl. Pour half into another bowl. Add parsley to 1 of the bowls.
Spread half of the egg noodles into the prepared baking pan; pour in cheese and parsley mixture. Add remaining egg noodles; top with remaining cheese mixture. Dot with remaining 1 teaspoon butter.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Cut into squares.

This was a family favorite growing up. It is very simple and is not as heavy as American macaroni and cheese.
