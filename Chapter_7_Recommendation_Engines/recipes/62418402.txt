Ingredients:
3 1/2C flour
1/4C granulated sugar
one pkg active dry yeast
1/2tsp salt
2/3C evaporated milk
1 egga
2Tbsp veg. oil plus more for frying
1 Tbsp instant coffee powder
1tsp cinnamon
3/4 C sifted powdered sugar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, egg and 2Tbsp oil until smooth. Stir in 1/2C warm water. Set aside 1/3C of the flour mixture and stir in half of the remaining flour mixture into the milk mixture. Gradually stir in the remaining half of the flour mixture to form a stiff dough. With floured hands, knead the dough in the bowl until smooth but not sticky. Cover with a kitchen towel and let stand at room temp for 10 minutes.
Line 2 large baking sheets with wax paper. Sprinkle the work surface and rolling pin with some of the reserved four mixture. Roll out the dough into a 12in square. Cut into 16 squares. Transfer the squares to the prepared baking sheets, cover with a kitchen towel and let stand in a warm place for 2 hours.
Fill a large pot with enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches. Heat over medium heat until it registers 360 on a deep fat thermometer. Working in batches of 3, fry the squares of dough, turning carefully with a slotted spoon, until golden brown and puffed, about 2 min. Transfer the beignets to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Dust the beignets generously with the coffee, cinnamon, and powdered sugar.
