Ingredients:
2 medium heirloom tomatoes
1 cup fresh or frozen wild blueberries
3/4 cup chopped sweet onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped
1/2 Hungarian hot pepper, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a pot of water to a boil. Score the skin of the tomatoes by slicing an X into the skin on the bottom. Immerse the tomatoes in boiling water for about 15 seconds. Remove and place into a bowl of cold water. The skins should slip off easily. Peel the tomatoes, cut in half and remove the seeds. Chop the tomatoes and discard the seeds.
In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, blueberries, onion, garlic, jalapeno pepper, Hungarian pepper, cilantro and parsley. Pour in the rice vinegar and olive oil and stir gently to mix. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and store in the refrigerator overnight to allow the flavors to blend. You may wish to drain the salsa slightly before serving, depending on how juicy your tomatoes are.

Description: 
An antioxidant powerhouse that tastes incredible. The contrast between the sweet wild blueberries and tartness of the onions, peppers and tomatoes, makes this a great dish on its own with tortilla chips or served alongside beef or chicken.
