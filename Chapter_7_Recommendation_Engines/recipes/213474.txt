Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup prepared salsa
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot, and cook and stir the green and red bell pepper until they are starting to become tender, about 5 minutes. Set the peppers aside.
Mix flour and taco seasoning in a bowl, and stir in chicken pieces, a few at a time, to thoroughly coat with the flour mixture. Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chicken until no longer pink and the coating is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bell peppers, black beans, and salsa, and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes to blend the flavors.
To serve, sprinkle each portion with Cheddar cheese.
