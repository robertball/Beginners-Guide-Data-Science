Ingredients:
1 c. butter
4 c. Rice Krispies cereal
1 c. brown sugar
1 c. coconut
1 c. pecans or walnuts, chopped
1/2 gallon strawberry ice cream

Directions:
Melt butter.  Combine remaining ingredients, except the ice cream.  When well blended, pat 1/2 of the cereal mixture into the botton of a 9X13 inch pan.  Cut slices (letting the ice cream melt a little makes this step easier)of ice cream and layer over the cereal mixture.  Smooth the rest of the cereal mixture over the ice cream.  Freeze.
