Description: 
This delightful salad is the perfect pairing for a BBQ. We love it with applewood smoked ribs and a cool gin cocktail (a white lady is the best). 

It's a Mediterranean-inspired Toronto summer classic, named after Danforth Avenue, which is home to a large Greek community. Not sure when it was invented, but we ate it all the time growing up in north Toronto in the 1980s. Yummy.
