Description: 
This is a classic recipe I use and love. Nutritional yeast is substituted for the traditionally used dairy. Tasty on pasta, bread, sandwiches, omelets, etc. Try adding sun-dried tomato slices post-completion for an added boost of rich flavor. P.S. - It also freezes beautifully.Modified from: Yummy Vegan Pesto Classico
