Ingredients:
1 cup chopped walnuts
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cold butter
FILLING:
2 medium ripe pears, peeled and sliced
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
In a bowl, combine walnuts, brown sugar and cinnamon; set aside. Place flour in a small bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 3/4 cup of nut mixture; set aside for topping. Set aside remaining nut mixture for filling.
Toss pears with lemon juice; set aside. In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream.
Spread two-thirds of the batter into a greased 9-in. springform pan. Top with the reserved nut mixture, pears and remaining batter. Sprinkle with walnuts and reserved topping mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 50-55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; remove sides of pan. Cool for 1 hour before cutting.
