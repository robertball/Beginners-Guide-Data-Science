Ingredients:
3 eggs
1/2 c margarine or butter
1 rounded cup sugar
1 cup cake meal
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup potato starch
1 10-12 oz bag chocolate chips
3/4 cup toasted walnuts or pecans (I don't use, we don't eat nuts here)

Directions:
beat together eggs, margarine and sugar.
combine dry ingredients, add to egg mixture.
Add chocolate chips and nuts; mix well.
drop by the spoonful on a greased (I used parchment paper) cookie sheet.
Bake for 10-15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven. Cookies should be light golden brown (mine never got very brown, they just looked cooked!)
Remove from pan quickly and cool.
Store in an airtight container.
