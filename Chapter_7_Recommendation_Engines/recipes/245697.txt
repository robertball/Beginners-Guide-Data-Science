Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
1/2 cup crushed peppermint candies, divided
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Place cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Mix in the eggs 1 at a time until well-incorporated. Fold crushed peppermint candies into filling with a spoon, reserving 2 tablespoons for decorating the top. Pour filling into the prepared crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is set, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool at room temperature, about 1 hour.
Refrigerate cheesecake until completely chilled, 4 hours to overnight. Sprinkle reserved peppermint candies on top.
