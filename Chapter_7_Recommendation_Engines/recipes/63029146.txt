6-8  oz rice noodles or wheat ramen noodles
1 Tablespoon safflower or sunflower oil

2 heaping tablespoons Better than Bouillon Chicken base
Juice from 1/2 lime

Drizzle oil in soup pot. Add red curry and cook, stirring and cook for 1-2 mnutes until aromatic.  Add garlic, stir for several seconds before adding water. Add bouillon paste and juice from half a lime, and bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Add rice noodles (I like to break them up a little) and bring to boil, stirring until noodles are cooked.
