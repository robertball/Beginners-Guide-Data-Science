Ingredients:
6 Tablespoons packed brown sugar
2 Tablespoons chili powder
1 Tablespoon paprika
3 Teaspoons garlic powder
2 Teaspoons onion powder
2 Teaspoons coarse salt
3 Teaspoons cumin
1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 Teaspoons freshly cracked pepper
1 Teaspoon cayenne pepper
2-3 Slabs of pork back ribs

Directions:
Mix all ingredients in a mixer.
Spread liberally on both sides of the ribs. Be sure to rub into the ribs.  Cover with foil overnight or for a couple hours before cooking.
Preheat oven to 260, wrap each individual rack with foil and cook for 4- 4 1/2 hours. You can unwrap and slather with Bbq sauce then broil for a few minutes or preheat grill to low and cook ribs with your favorite sauce to crisp them up.

Description: 
Brown sugar based rib rub that brings out the flavors of the ribs.  Controlled temperature in the oven makes it foolproof. Easy fall off the bone ribs! I finish them off on the grill with some barbeque sauce.
