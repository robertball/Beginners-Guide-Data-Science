Ingredients:
3 cups soft peaches, or as needed
3 cups soft nectarines, or as needed
1/2 cup white sugar (optional)
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
Crumble Topping:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup extra-virgin coconut oil
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch baking pan.
Boil peaches and nectarines 1 fruit at a time in a pot until very soft, about 30 seconds each. Let cool until ready to handle. Peel, core, and chop into bite-sized pieces.
Mix the fruit, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour into the prepared pan.
Combine flour, brown sugar, coconut oil, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl. Mix with hands or a fork until crumbly. Sprinkle evenly over the fruit mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and juice appears bubbly, about 30 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Peaches and nectarines are so in season right now - any farmer's market will be guaranteed have at least 3 or 4 vendors selling 'em. This recipe uses up those stone fruits in a way that elevates them without being too fussy. It's pretty enough to be a treat for house guests, but still easy enough to make for an indulgent breakfast.
