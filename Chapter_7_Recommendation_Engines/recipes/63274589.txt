Ingredients:
1 - 3 lb whole chicken
Tony Chachere's spice mix*
Special Equipment: a chicken stand and a meat thermometer

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Rinse your whole chicken and remove any innards
Put the chicken on the chicken stand without a beer can
Sprinkle seasoning, to taste, all over the chicken
Stand the chicken up on the stand over a drip pan at least 2 inches deep.
Bake chicken for 20 minutes at 425 to sear the meat
Lower oven temperature to 325 to slow roast the meat
Cook for another hour
Insert meat thermometer in chicken thigh - do not hit bone
Continue to cook chicken until internal temperature is 180 degrees
Remove chicken from oven and let sit for 10-15 minutes to seal in the juices.  If you cut the chicken right away, all the juice will come out.
Most of the fat drips downward into the pan basting the chicken as it cooks.  The skin is crispy and delicious.  You may have to fight off your family to get to eat it.

Description: 
In our house, cooking this style chicken is called chicken night.  It's known to other people as beer can chicken.  We all love it, including the dogs who help my husband while he cleans the meat off the bones after we've eaten. (The dogs don't get the bones.  Chicken bones can kill dogs!)
