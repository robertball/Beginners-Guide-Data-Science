Ingredients:
1 leg/thigh section baked in pesto
1/4 cup Greek 0% Fat Yogurt
2 tsp. Ranch Dressing powder
2 chives, finely chopped
1 tablespoon grated or finely chopped manchego cheese
1 slice Havarti
10-20 arugula leaves, stemmed
4 slices wheat bread

Directions:
If you don't have some cold chicken in the fridge, the day before, slather a piece of chicken with some Pesto and bake at 375 for 30-35 min or until done. Do not overcook.  Put in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic overnight. If you don't want to do the pesto chicken, add a tsp of pre-made pesto to the mix.
Debone the chicken. Chop into 1/4 or smaller bits
Chop the chives
Grate or chop the manchego cheese.
Combine all into a work bowl with the ranch powder and yogurt. Mix well.
Place scoops of the mix on to the wheat bread and spread them with a knife.
Remove the lower stems from baby arugula by pinching them off with your fingers and lay them over the chicken salad.
Place a slice of Havarti on each sandwich. Top with the other slice of bread, cut and serve.

Description: 
What to do with leftover pistachio pesto chicken?  I chop up the dark meat and add it to this Greek yogurt based chicken salad that is more guilt-reduced than fat-free, and very, very tasty.
