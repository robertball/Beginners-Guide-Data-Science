Ingredients:
1 17.3oz box Pepperidge FarmÂ® Puff Pastry Sheets
1 3.9oz box Chocolate Pudding
1 cup low-fat milk
4 oz whip topping
Powdered Sugar for dusting

Directions:
**Follow basic Instruction on Thawing Process for Puff Pastry Sheets and thaw entire package.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
When completely thawed, unfold both sheets of pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut each sheet into 3 strips along the fold marks. Then cut each strip into 4 even pieces, making 12 pastry squares per sheet. 24 pastry squares in total.
Bake for 15 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and cool completely.
In a medium bowl, combine pudding mix & milk together until thick and smooth. Fold in whip topping until well blended. Set aside.
With one corner of the puff pastry, using a butter knife or using your finger, gently make a small opening. Stick knife or finger gently into the pastry to make a pocket inside the pastry, be careful pastry is delicate.
Place mousse mixture into a pastry bag or use a ziploc baggie. Gently pipe the mixture into the opening of the pastry until you see a slight bit of mousse at the piping site. Wipe off excess.
Repeat process for each of the pastries. When complete, dust the tops with powdered sugar and serve.
