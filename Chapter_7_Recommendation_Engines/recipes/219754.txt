Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
2 (16 ounce) cans ranch style chili beans
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 (14 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
1/2 (1 pound) loaf processed cheese food (such as Velveeta®), cubed
1 pint half-and-half cream
1 pint heavy cream
1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
1 (1 ounce) package ranch dressing mix

Directions:
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.
Add the ranch beans, pinto beans, corn, tomatoes with green chiles, processed cheese food, half-and-half cream, heavy cream, taco seasoning, and ranch dressing mix. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to simmer until cheese food is melted, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
A very rich soup to serve on a very cold night!  I love this recipe passed to me by my good friend Tasha! I make this one when I have a lot of people to feed. You can let people fix it how they want to, chips or no chips. I like to add sour cream sometimes on top.
