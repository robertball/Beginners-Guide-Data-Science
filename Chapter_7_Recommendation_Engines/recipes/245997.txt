Description: 
Blueberries and cardamom are a match made in heaven. Take advantage whenever you can to enjoy this pairing! Warning: blueberry smoothies cause people to wonder what you are drinking, as the skins do not blend well, but it's tasty enough that I don't mind. Place in a reusable, sustainable to-go cup to take with you.
