1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs

1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Place chicken between 2 sheets of heavy-duty plastic wrap; flatten to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.
Dip chicken in egg; dredge in crumbs.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; add chicken, and cook 2 minutes on each side or until browned.
Pour spaghetti sauce over chicken. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cheeses. Cover and simmer 5 more minutes or until cheese melts.
