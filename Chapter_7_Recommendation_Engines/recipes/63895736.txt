Ingredients:
4 Cornish hens
4 Tbsp butter, melted
1 16-oz. can crushed pineapple in juice, drained
¾ cup pure maple syrup
½ cup fresh lemon juice
¼ cup Dijon-style mustard, plus 2 tablespoons
2 Tbsp soy sauce
1 Tbsp cider vinegar (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°.  Arrange game hens, breast side up, in a 13x9-inch baking dish.  Brush the hens with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine the crushed pineapple, maple syrup, lemon juice, mustard and soy sauce in a food processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a saucepan.  Baste the hens with some of the pineapple mixture.  Continue roasting for about 45 more minutes, basting occasionally with more pineapple mixture.
While the hens are cooking, reduce the pineapple mixture by a quarter over medium heat.  About 15 minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the juices from the baking dish and add them to the pineapple mixture.  Bring it to a boil.  Simmer until the  mixture thickens to a sauce consistency, stirring occasionally.  (It should be reduced by about half altogether).
Remove the hens from the oven.  Serve the hens warm with the sauce drizzled over them.  Pass the extra sauce separately.
