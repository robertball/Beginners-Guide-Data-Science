Description: 
THESE BISCUITS are simple to make and have a wonderful aroma when baking!    This particular recipe is one of my husband's favorites - and biscuits were a steady diet in the Southern household where he grew up.     The muffin shape makes them a bit different. -Virginia Foster, Paducah, Kentucky
