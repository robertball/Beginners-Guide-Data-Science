Ingredients:
2 large zucchini
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (chopped)
2 cloves garlic (minced)
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
3 cups romaine lettuce (chopped)
1 cup baby rocket
1/2 cup olives
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (chopped or sliced)
4 ounces goat cheese (crumbled)
1 lemon--juiced (1 tablespoon)
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2 tablespoons or more extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
Take zucchini and thinly slice the long way--(cut off the bottom to help by creating a flat bottom).
In a large bowl, combine rosemary, garlic and olive oil.  Add zucchini slices in the bowl and use your hands to coat them evenly.
Heat your outdoor grill or indoor grill pan to a medium-high heat.
Grill zucchini for 3-4 minutes on each side.  Remove from pan and set aside.  When cool enough, cut into thirds.
In a large bowl or platter, add a layer of romaine then baby rocket.  Add olives, sun-dried tomatoes then the zucchini.  Top with crumbled goat cheese.  Drizzle with lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
Before serving, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.

Description: 
My grandfather had a large garden every year and there was always an abundance of zucchini.  We would enjoy them for every meal of the day.  I just love them anyway, but sometimes I just want it in a simple salad.  This is one of my favorite summer salads when using zucchini.
