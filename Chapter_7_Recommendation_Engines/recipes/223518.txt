Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
1 cup almond meal
3/4 cup butter, melted
1/2 cup gluten-free flour
6 egg whites, beaten
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
3/4 cup fresh blueberries
2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar for dusting (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups.
Mix 1 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, almond meal, butter, flour, egg whites, and xanthan gum together in a bowl until just combined. The mixture will be slightly grainy. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups. Scatter blueberries onto batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool muffins in pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Dust with about 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar.

Description: 
My hubby just found out he's gluten-intolerant, so I set about turning some of his fave recipes gluten-free. This recipe was originally a little cake recipe, but he always preferred these to real blueberry muffins. These are so good you can't even tell the difference between the real recipe and the gluten-free recipe! I prefer these with finely chopped canned peaches instead of the blueberries, so I usually make 6 peach and 6 blueberry. Hope you enjoy!
