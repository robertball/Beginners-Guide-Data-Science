Ingredients:
13 Tablespoons water
2 1/2 tablespoons beaten egg
5 teaspoons dry buttermilk powder
2.5 teaspoons white sugar
2.5 tablespoons canola oil
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast

Directions:
Place ingredients in order suggested by your manufacturer.
Select dough setting. Grease a standard pyrex loaf pan.
When the dough cycle is done, pull dough out and knead a few times on a floured board or silpat.
With your hands, press out into a 9x14 inch rectangle.
Roll up from a short end, and place in greased bread pan.
Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and set aside. Set timer for 20 minutes, and preheat oven to 375.
When the timer goes off, place your loaf in the center of the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove loaf from pan onto wire cooling rack, and brush top with butter.
