Description: 
Mama made this salad a family tradition during the holidays, and we just loved its fresh taste. Now I have the responsibility to make it and I haven't changed a thing. It just reminds me of home. Now my grown children expect it at our holidays together and it reminds them of their Gran. Enjoy!
