Description: 
This is a delicious pork chop recipe that cuts out all the grease from frying them in a pan. Best of all, you can use any type of chop (even ones with bone still in)! My husband loves this recipe so much, I'm not allowed to make pork chops any other way! Pair it with some cheesy mashed potatoes and a vegetable for a great meal.
