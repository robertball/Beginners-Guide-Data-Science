Description: 
One of my favorite pan gravy’s is when I make grilled filet mignon. I take an 8 oz package of sliced mushrooms then the recipe below but instead of using oregano I use rosemary! You can be creative with herbs but my entire family gets excited when gravy comes to the table. But now we don’t use a gravy boat but everyone gets a mini-ramekin.. Yup, I created a family of dippers.. 
This recipe is for a basic pan gravy but go ahead and add some of the herbs/spices your added to your dinner then the flavors all go well together.
