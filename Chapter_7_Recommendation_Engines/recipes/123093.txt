Description: 
I always double this recipe whenever I prepare it, since we love leftovers. This is the easiest soup I've ever made. Our 10-month-old daughter can really dig in, since this thick nutritious mixture clings to her spoon. We prefer it warm, but it can also be served chilled. -Gayle Becker, Mt. Clemens, Michigan
