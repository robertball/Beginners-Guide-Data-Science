Ingredients:
4 cups vegetable oil for frying
1 pound squid, cleaned and sliced into rings
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1/2 tablespoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste (optional)
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 lemon, cut into wedges
1/4 cup marinara sauce, warmed

Directions:
Preheat oil to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a deep fryer, deep frying pan, or pot.
Coat squid with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, cayenne, and white pepper in a medium bowl. Mix thoroughly. Add flour and toss to dredge.
Fry squid in the hot oil, in batches if needed, until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook, or squid will be tough and chewy. Drain on paper towels. Serve with lemon wedges and marinara sauce.
