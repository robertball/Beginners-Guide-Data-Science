Ingredients:
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, softened

Mix brown sugar and cinnamon into the softened butter. Spread cinnamon butter over each slice of brioche.

Description: 
Cinnamon toast with a unique twist. While grilling, the butter mixture caramelizes, and as it cools, it develops a bit of a crunch.
