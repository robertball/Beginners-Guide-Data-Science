Ingredients:
½ cup powdered sugar
2 cups flour
1 cup butter
¾ cup butter
¼ cup heavy cream
½ cup honey
1 cup light brown sugar, packed
4 cups very coarsely chopped pecans

Directions:
Line a 9 x 13 pan with enough parchment hanging over the edge for you to lift the bars out of the pan when finished.
In a food processor, mix powdered sugar and flour together. Pulse in 1 cup butter until crumbly. Firmly pat crumbs on to the bottom of the parchment lined pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
In saucepan over medium heat, melt 3/4 cup butter. Add cream, honey and brown sugar, stirring constantly until well mixed. Remove from heat. Stir in pecans and spread over hot crust. Return to oven and bake an additional 30 minutes.
Allow bars to cool completely, then lift them from the pan and cut into 1" squares. Store in a cool place in an air-tight container.

Description: 
Rich, chewy and loaded with nuts. With a pound of pecans and nearly a pound of butter in the recipe, what's not to like? Since going back to work full time, this is pretty much the only baking I do for Christmas. They go together quickly, store well, and everyone loves them!
