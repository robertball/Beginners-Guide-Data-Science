Ingredients:
3 Tablespoons Borax
3 Tablespoons Washing Soda
2 Tablespoons AVON bubble bath

Directions:
I like to line up (3) one gallon jugs and then add the ingredients assembly line style. I use a small plastic funnel for this and it helps to make it all go much faster and with much fewer spills.
Once all three jugs have the 3 ingredients inside, I pour 4 cups of VERY HOT water into each one. I just use water from the kitchen faucet, it doesnâ€™t need to be boiling. Swirl each bottle until all the ingredients are dissolved in the liquid. Then fill almost to the top with cold water. (Bubbles will overflow out of the bottle a little.)
Use about 1 cup/load.
