Ingredients:
8 (1 ounce) slices bread
4 slices Cheddar cheese
1 large tomato, sliced
2 serrano peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
2 teaspoons dried basil
salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Butter one side of each slice of bread, and place 4 of the slices butter-side down on a griddle over medium heat.
On each piece of bread, place one slice of cheese, 1 slice of tomato, and a few slices of serrano pepper. Sprinkle dried basil and salt and pepper to taste. Top each sandwich with a slice of buttered bread, butter-side up.
Grill sandwiches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes each side.
