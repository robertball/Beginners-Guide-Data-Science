Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup mustard powder
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 egg yolks, beaten
2 cups half-and-half
1 cup white vinegar

Directions:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, mustard powder and flour. Mix in egg yolks until smooth. Heat half and half in the top half of a double boiler, or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water until just short of boiling. Stir in the egg yolk and sugar mixture, and then stir in the vinegar. Continue to stir over simmering water until thickened, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a friend and my family loves it. Someone always asks to have a little ham with their sauce so now I can't make a ham without it.
