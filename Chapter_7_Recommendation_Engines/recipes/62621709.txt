Ingredients:
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup HERSHEY'S Cocoa
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2-1/4 cups milk
* 2 tablespoons butter or margarine
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Whipped topping (optional)

Directions:
Stir together sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt in medium saucepan; gradually stir in milk.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils; boil and stir 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into individual dessert dishes. To avoid a skin from forming on top, press plastic wrap directly onto surface; serve warm or refrigerate at least 2 hours. Garnish with whipped topping, if desired. 4 to 5 servings.
MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS:
Stir together sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt in large microwave-safe bowl; gradually stir in milk.
Microwave at HIGH (100%) 7 to 10 minutes or until mixture comes to full boil, stirring every 2 minutes. Stir in butter and vanilla. Pour into dishes and serve as directed above.

Description: 
A classic and definitely a keeper. Very smooth and comforting. Not too sweet. I tried the microwave version and it was super easy. I may never buy a mix again!
