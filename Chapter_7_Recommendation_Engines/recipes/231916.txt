Ingredients:
6 ounces leftover cooked roast beef (chuck, cross rib, or top round)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves, chopped, or more if desired
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (15 ounce) cans unseasoned tomato sauce
1 cup Holland HouseÂ® Red Cooking Wine
2 teaspoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon or nutmeg
1/2 cup half-and-half
Hot, cooked wide noodles such as tagliatelle or pappardelle
Grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

Directions:
Coarsely chop, or shred by hand, enough cooked roast beef to make 1-1/2 cups. If meat is cold, cut into chunks and warm slightly in microwave to make hand-shredding easier.
Heat olive oil in a 4-quart pot and gently cook garlic, basil, oregano and rosemary about 3 minutes. Stir in the 1-1/2 cups beef and tomato paste. Add tomato sauce, red cooking wine, brown sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg, stirring until smooth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 30-40 minutes.
Remove from heat; stir in half & half. Serve over pasta, sprinkled with cheese if desired.
