Ingredients:
1/4 Granny Smith apple, cored
3 green grapes, halved
1 teaspoon cream cheese, softened
2 raisins

Directions:
Lay the apple sideways on a plate; cut out a thin horizontal sliver for the mouth.
Arrange 1 grape half on each side of the apple as arms. Cut out 2 little triangles from the other 4 grapes so they look like toes and fingers and arrange them as hands and feet. Shape cream cheese into 2 little balls and stick a grape into each as a pupil. Stick creme cheese eyes on top of the quartered apple.
