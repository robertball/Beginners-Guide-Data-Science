Ingredients:
Dough:
1/2 cup warm water
2 1/4 tsp. active dry yeast
1 1/4 whole wheat flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/2 cup milk or soy milk
2 T butter
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
Pumpkin "Insides"
1/4 cup cream
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
2 T molasses
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground allspice
1/4 tsp. ground cloves
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp. ground ginger
Pumpkin Whiskey "Goo"
1/2 cup cream
1/2 cup pumpkin puree
3 T whiskey
1/2 cup sugar

Directions:
To make dough: Combine warm water with yeast and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour, let sit until doubled in size, about 10 minutes.
In small saucepan, heat milk and butter over low heat until butter just starts to melt.
In medium bowl, combine rest of whole wheat flour, salt and sugar.  Add milk and butter, combine.  Add pumpkin and egg, combine.
Make sure this is a warm dough, not a hot one to continue! When yeast mixture has risen to double, add and combine.
Add all purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring and adding until the dough is no longer sticky.  Turn on to a floured surface, quickly kneading to keep from sticking to fingers!  Knead several minutes. Remember that kneading is a process of adding air, not flour!
Place dough in sprayed bowl, cover.  Let rise until doubled in bulk, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
While dough is rising, mix the ingredients for the "insides" in a small bowl, set aside.
Also while dough is rising, combine cream, pumpkin, whiskey and sugar in saucepan.  Bring to boil, let boil 2 minutes, remove from heat.  Prepare 9" x 13" pan by spraying, then pour "Goo" mixture in, spread to evenly coat bottom.
When dough has doubled in bulk, punch down.  Turn oven to 350.  Turn onto floured surface.  Roll into a rectangle, 8" x 20".
Spread surface with "insides".  Roll jelly roll fashion, creating a 20" log.  Using dental floss, slide floss under roll, bring to top, criss-cross over dough and pull.  This creates a clean cut. Make each slice 1" to 1 1/2" thick, then place on "goo" in pan. Press down slightly, to make dough in pan a uniform height.
Let sit a few minutes after placing in pan, but these do not have to double.  Place in oven for 15-18 minutes, until they "knock hollow".
Immediately flip pan on to serving plate, and let "goo" seep into r
