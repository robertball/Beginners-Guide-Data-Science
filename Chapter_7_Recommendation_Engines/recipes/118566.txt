Description: 
'These crisp buttery croutons are so good,' comments Ellen Benninger of Greenville, Pennsylvania. 'I don't know where I got the recipe, but I've been using it for more than 10 years.' Toss the croutons in a salad, garnish a bowl of soup with them or sprinkle them on top of a creamy casserole.
