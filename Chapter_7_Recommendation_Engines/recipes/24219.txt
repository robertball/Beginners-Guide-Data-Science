Ingredients:
2 fluid ounces amaretto liqueur
1/2 fluid ounce 151 proof rum
1 (1.5 fluid ounce) jigger beer

Directions:
Pour amaretto into a highball glass. Gently pour the rum over the back of a spoon, so that it forms a layer on top of the amaretto. Carefully light rum with a match. Pour in the beer, wait for flames to die down, and drink entire contents in one gulp.

Description: 
This fiery drink is meant to be slammed down with a few big gulps! It tastes like the carbonated beverage with the same name.
