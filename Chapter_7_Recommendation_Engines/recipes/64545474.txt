Ingredients:
1 jalapeno finely chopped (remove the seeds  if you don't want the heat)
1 juice of 1 lemon (3 Tbsp.)
1 Tbsp dried oregano
3 Tbsp olive oil
3 cloves of garlic, minced
3 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs

Directions:
Combine first 5 ingredients in the food processor.  Pulse until combined and jalapeno is finely diced.  Pour into a re-sealable bag, add chicken.  Toss to coat.  Let marinate in refrigerator overnight and then grill 5-8 minutes per side, until crispy.

Description: 
A nice change to grilling chicken thighs (can use breasts but I think they dry out too much).
