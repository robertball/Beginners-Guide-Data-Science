Ingredients:
¾ cup mayonnaise
¼ cup creme fraiche
½  lemon, juiced
1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon
½ teaspoon white sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper
2 large crisp, sweet apples, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup cubed (1/4 inch) celery root, soaked briefly in cold water, drained well
1 cup quartered seedless green grapes
½ cup toasted walnut pieces

Description: 
A fruit salad has to be pretty darn good to actually get a name, and the venerable Waldorf salad is certainly worthy. Embellish this as you see fit, but I really like it best with just the four ingredients seen here. Things like dried cranberries can add a nice seasonal touch but, for me, the chewy fruit gets in the way of that addictive crunchy/crisp texture.
