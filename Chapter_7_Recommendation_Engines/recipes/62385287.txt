Ingredients:
1 lb Confectioner's sugar
1/2 cup cocoa powder
2 teaspoons real vanilla
8 oz tub plain whipped cream cheese

Directions:
Sift together and set aside: confectioner's sugar and cocoa
In the bowl of a standing mixer with the whipping balloon beater add vanilla and cream cheese and whip 1 minute to blend vanilla
With the mixer on low speed begin spooning in the sugar/cocoa blend to whipped cream cheese little by little
Once all the sugar/cocoa blend is added turn the mixer to a higher speed and whip until the frosting is smooth and even and color lightens a bit.

Description: 
Not too sweet; very tangy; very chocolaty with a strong body and smooth whipped texture. Enough to lightly frost 8 two layer cake. I usually fill my chocolate cakes with seedless raspberry jam so I suggest doing that and then there will be plenty of frosting for the top and sides. Easily doubled if necessary.
