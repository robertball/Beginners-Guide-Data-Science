Ingredients:
1 box Red Velvet Cake Mix
1 Egg
1 brick Cream Cheese, room temperature
1 stick Butter, room temperature
1/2 cup Confectioner's Sugar
Hershey's kisses (preferably the carmel kisses)

Directions:
In a mixer, cream together butter and cream cheese.
Mix in the egg, then slowly incorporate the cake mix.
Place the bowl of dough into the fridge for at least 2 hours (refrigerating makes the dough easier to roll).
Preheat oven to 350.
Roll dough into tablespoon-sized balls.  Roll the balls into confectioner's sugar and place on a baking sheet.
Cook for 12-15 minutes.  Cookies should still be a little gooey.
While still warm, place a hershey's kiss in the middle of each cookie.  Then let the cookies cool.
If you wish, sprinkle confectioner's sugar over the cookies.
