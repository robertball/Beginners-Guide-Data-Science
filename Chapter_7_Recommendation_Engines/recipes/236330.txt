Description: 
I don't like mayonnaise and so I never have it in the house. I do, however, like egg salad, and I adjusted it to make it without the mayo. Pretty close to the original but tastier and healthier! If it seems too dry, add more yogurt, 1 teaspoon at a time. Enjoy on top of toast or in a sandwich.
