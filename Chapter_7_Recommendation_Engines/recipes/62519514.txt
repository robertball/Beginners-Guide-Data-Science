Ingredients:
1-1/2 lbs boneless beef chuck tender steak, cut into small cubes
7 red potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 carrots, peeled and finely sliced
1 stalk celery, rinsed and finely chopped
1 onion minced
4 garlic cloves minced
4 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
2 tablespoons steak seasoning (ex: McCormick Spicy Montreal Seasoning)
2 cups milk
1/3 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons margarine, melted
2 cups shredded four-cheese blend
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill pot with water and add potatoes.  Cook until done.  Drain and set a side.
Sprinkle steak seasoning over meat and press into meat. Set aside
In a dutch oven over medium heat add butter and melt, add carrot, celery, onion and garlic. Saute vegetables for about 7-10 minutes.  Add thyme, white pepper and meat.  Cook until meat is brown on all sides, about 10 minutes.  Add chicken broth and white wine, cover dutch oven and simmer over medium heat until the meat is tender, about 45 minutes.
Slowly add milk to dutch oven, stirring, then heavy cream. Add potatoes and cheese mix together and cover for a few minutes until cheese is melted.  If your soup is not thick enough you can mash some of the potatoes until you get the consistency you desire.  Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
