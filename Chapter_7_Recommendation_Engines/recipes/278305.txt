Description: 
Two types of legumes, brown basmati rice, and goda masala are cooked in an Instant Pot® for a traditionally flavored Indian classic. Goda masala is a coconut-based seasoning, which gives this dish a fragrant and tasty edge. Khichdi is easy to digest, so it is nice for detox or when you want something light. Leftovers warm up nicely with a touch of water. This is a simple recipe; some cooks like to add vegetables to the saute.
