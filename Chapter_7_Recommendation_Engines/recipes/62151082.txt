Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups fat free half and half
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
8 tbsp sugar separated
8 egg yolks
1 tsp good vanilla
hot water
1 1/2 deep pan
6-8 ramekins

Directions:
Preheat over to 375
heat the heavy cream and half and half over medium low heat until warm, but not boiling.
beat the egg yolks, 6 tbsp sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Slowly add the warm cream mixtured to the eggs, beating with a wisk after each addition
Place ramekins in your baking pan. Distribute the egg/cream mixture between 6 or 8 ramekins. Fill the pan with hot water half way up the ramekins. Bake in a preheated oven until the custards are done through (should jiggle like jello) Let the custards cool at room temp. until you are able to handle them with your hands.
Let the custards chill in the fridge for 2-8 hours (or over night).
Lightly coat the tops with sugar and hit them with a kitchen torch until the tops are carmelized and crispy. Serve while the tops are still hard ( you can also broil in the oven.. but, keep in mind that the creme brulees will be slightly warm if you use this method)
