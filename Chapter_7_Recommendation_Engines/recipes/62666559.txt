Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
2 shallots, minced
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
12 baby carrots, chopped
1 small head cauliflower(optional, I had some leftover)
3 small heads of broccoli (1-2 large) stems and all
3 cups chicken broth (veggie broth for vegetarians)
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups milk (I used organic fat-free)
salt and ground white pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in medium sized stock pot, and saute shallots, garlic and celery until tender, about 10-15 minutes. Add broccoli, carrots, (cauliflower if using), and broth, cover and simmer for 20-30 minutes.
Using a stick blender, puree the soup right in the stockpot. If you don't have one, very carefully add the soup to your blender in small batches, cover, and blend until smooth. Leave some veg. in stockpot unblended. Carefully pour back into stockpot.
In small saucepan, over medium-heat melt 3 tablespoons butter, stir in flour and add milk.  Stir until thick and bubbly, about 5-10 minutes, and add to soup.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.
