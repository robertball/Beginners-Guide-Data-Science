Ingredients:
20 small new potatoes
1/4 cup vegetable oil
coarse sea salt to taste
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet; drizzle with the oil, and toss to coat. Season with salt. Place potatoes in preheated oven and bake until very tender when pierced with a fork, 45 to 50 minutes.
With a small knife, cut a cross in the top of each potato; press firmly on sides to open. Combine sour cream and Gorgonzola in a small bowl. Top each potato with a generous spoonful of the cheese mixture; garnish with chives. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Description: 
These miniature potatoes make the perfect finger food. Use a strong-flavored Cheddar or feta instead of Gorgonzola for a nice twist!
