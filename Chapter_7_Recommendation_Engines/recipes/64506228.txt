Chicken and Gnocchi Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced
3 stalks celery, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 carrots, peeled and shredded
1/2 pound cooked, cubed chicken breast (more, if desired)
4 cups chicken broth or stock
1 (16 ounce) package mini potato gnocchi *
1 (6 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves **
½ tsp. ground turmeric *** (optional, but it adds a nice golden color)
1 Tbsp. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp. cold water (optional)****
2 cups half-and-half or evaporated milk
1 ¼ tsp. salt
½ tsp. ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook onion, celery, garlic, and carrots in the hot oil until onion is translucent and celery begins to lose its crunch, about 5 minutes. Stir in cubed chicken and chicken broth; bring to a simmer.
Stir gnocchi into the simmering soup and cook until they begin to float, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in turmeric. Stir in spinach; cook until wilted, about 3 additional minutes.
If using cornstarch mixture, stir into simmering soup along with the half-and-half or evaporated milk. Cook until soup thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in salt and pepper.
*		Trader Joe’s has inexpensive gnocchi in the dry pasta section – much cheaper than grocery store prices.
** 	Use the whole bag of spinach! It looks like a lot, but it cooks down pretty quickly. Don’t add the spinach too far in advance. If it overcooks, it will lose its bright green color.
*** 	I also get my turmeric at Trader Joe’s, as their spices are priced well.
****	The cornstarch mixture isn’t necessary. This makes a decently thick soup without it, but if you want a thicker soup, go for it! I used cornstarch in the pot I made for church, but it got “spoon-stands-up-by-itself” thick the next day (the gnocchi itself helps thicken the soup). If you use the cornstarch mix and the soup gets too thick, you can always thin it with broth or milk.

Description: 
Similar to Olive Garden's yummy soup but with a secret twist (Tumeric). Wonderful belly-warmer on a cold fall day.
