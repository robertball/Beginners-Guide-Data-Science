Image:
NA
Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package tri-color spiral pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
2 ½ tablespoons paprika
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup sour cream
¼ cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules, or to taste
1 tablespoon dried parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add chicken; cook and stir until juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes.
Stir chicken broth and paprika into the saucepan. Cook until flavors blend, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces to a plate. Reserve broth.
Combine half-and-half, sour cream, and flour together in a bowl. Mix until well blended. Add about 1 cup broth from the saucepan; stir until no lumps remain. Whisk mixture into the remaining broth in the saucepan. Whisk in garlic powder, bouillon, and parsley; cook over medium heat until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
Stir mushrooms into the sauce; add chicken pieces. Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve paprikash on top of the pasta.
