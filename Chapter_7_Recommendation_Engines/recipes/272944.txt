Ingredients:
Lasagna:
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles
Filling:
1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian burger crumbles (such as MorningStar Farms® Grillers® Crumbles™)
2 links vegetarian Italian-style sausage (such as Tofurky®), diced, or more as needed
4 meatless meatballs, crumbled, or more as needed
1 yellow squash, diced
2 carrots, diced
1 small yellow onion, diced
3 whole mushrooms, diced
1 portobello mushroom, diced
2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon fennel seed, or to taste
Sauce:
1 (26 ounce) jar marinara sauce
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in lasagna and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
While the noodles are cooking, combine crumbles, sausage, meatballs, squash, carrots, onion, mushrooms, oil, garlic powder, pepper, oregano, thyme, and fennel in a large bowl; stir until mixed. Combine marinara sauce and diced tomatoes in a second bowl.
Drain pasta. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom. Cover the sauce with 1 layer of lasagna noodles, a thin layer of sauce, 1/2 of the filling, and about 4 tablespoons sauce; repeat layers once more. Add the last layer of lasagna noodles and spoon a generous amount of sauce on top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until fully cooked, 30 to 40 minutes.
