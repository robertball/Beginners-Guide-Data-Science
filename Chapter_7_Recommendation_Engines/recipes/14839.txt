Ingredients:
1 large cucumber
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup blue cheese salad dressing

15 pimento-stuffed green olives, chopped

Directions:
Using the tines of a fork, score the unpeeled cucumber lengthwise on all sides. Slice the cucumber into 1/4-inch thick rounds.
In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and blue cheese dressing. Spread the cheese mixture on the rye bread slices.  Top with a slice of cucumber and a slice of olive.

Description: 
I got this recipe from one of my cooking classes in college.  It's the old fashioned type of appetizer, but one that makes a beautiful display on the plate and I never take any home with me because they disappear quickly.
