Ingredients:
Dry Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/4 cup rolled oats
3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
Wet Ingredients:
1/4 cup soft non-hydrogenated margarine
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup milk of choice (I`ve used soy and rice)
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp ground flax seeds
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Move oven rack to slightly above middle and turn oven on to 375F. In one bowl, sift dry ingredients together and set aside. In another bowl, beat margarine with brown sugar, then add the rest of the wet ingredients and mix until well combined. Pour wet mixture into dry mixture and mix until just combined. Spoon 12 batches on the greased and foil-lined cookie sheet and, with a water-wet spoon, spread out and push down the batter to the height of the chocolate chips. Bake for 8-12 minutes, careful not to overbake - Cookies should be soft. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack after a minute of taking them out of the oven. Best eaten warm.
