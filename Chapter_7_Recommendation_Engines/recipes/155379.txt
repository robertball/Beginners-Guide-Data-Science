Ingredients:
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups whole milk

Directions:
Whisk together the cornstarch, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Stir in the milk to evenly blend ingredients, and set over medium-high heat. Continue whisking and cooking until custard reaches a thick consistency, 25 to 30 minutes. It is important to stir the entire time, or the custard can easily burn or clump. The custard will continue to thicken as it cools. Spoon into bowls to serve.

Description: 
This is a unique Spanish breakfast custard that my Puerto Rican father loved as a child and something my mother made for us as we were growing up. It takes patience to whisk the custard for 25 minutes, but the results are very delicious and warming on a cold winter morning.
