Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds fresh broccoli, cut into bite size pieces (can use other veggies too or try bag of frozen steam in the bag veggies)
1/3 Cup of butter(can lessen to 3 tab.)
2 cloves of minced garlic
1 tablespoon brown sugar
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 to 1 tablespoon of corn starch
1/3 cup chopped salted (can use unsalted as soy sauce is salty and can also roast cashews in oven on cookie sheet for 10 min.)

Directions:
Place the broccoli into a large pot with about 1 inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil, and cook for 7 minutes, or until tender but still crisp. Drain, and arrange broccoli on a serving platter.
While the broccoli is cooking, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat, add garlic and saute. Mix in the brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, and pepper.  Bring to boil.  Stir in 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon of corn starch to thicken.  Remove from the heat when thick enough.  Mix in the cashews, and pour the sauce over the broccoli. Serve immediately.
