Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups water
2 tablespoons butter, divided
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups pearl (Israeli) couscous
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup white wine
2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pound bay scallops
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste - divided (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan and stir couscous, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt into boiling water. Reduce heat to low and simmer until couscous is tender and plump, about 10 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir white wine, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and parsley into hot oil and butter. Cook and stir until parsley is tender and wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Increase heat to medium-high and add scallops to sauce; cook until scallops just become opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide couscous onto serving plates and top each serving with scallops in sauce. Sprinkle each portion with 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese and a pinch of fresh parsley.
