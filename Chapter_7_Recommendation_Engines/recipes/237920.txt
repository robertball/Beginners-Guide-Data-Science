Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup white rice
5 slices bacon
1 (14 ounce) can black beans
2 teaspoons taco seasoning mix, divided
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
5 flour tortillas
2 tomatoes, diced
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, retaining the drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon.
Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
Combine beans and 1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until warmed, about 5 minutes.
Cook and stir the cooked rice and 1 teaspoon taco seasoning mix in the reserved bacon drippings until evenly coated, 2 to 3 minutes.
Brush vegetable oil over each tortilla and arrange tortillas on a baking sheet.
Bake tortillas in the preheated oven until warmed, about 5 minutes.
Place black bean mixture, rice mixture, bacon, tomatoes, green bell peppers, and Cheddar cheese each in separate bowls; serve with tortillas.
