Ingredients:
2 cups cooked brown rice, divided
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup, divided
1 zucchini, sliced
1 yellow squash, sliced
7 baby portobello mushrooms, sliced - or more to taste
3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
3/4 cup Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 cup chopped broccoli
1/2 cup sliced white onion
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
1 carrot, shredded
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Spread 1/2 of the rice into the bottom of a large baking dish. Pour about 1/2 can tomato soup over rice and top with zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese over vegetables. Pour remaining 1/2 can soup over cheese.
Spread remaining rice into baking dish. Add broccoli, onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, carrot, garlic, parsley, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Pour remaining 1 can soup over vegetables and top with remaining cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until tomato soup is bubbly and cheese is melted, 25 to 30 minutes. Let stand about 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I came up with this recipe in an effort to make some food stretch until payday. Using random vegetables I had in the fridge, plus some leftover rice, I came up with this casserole and was pleasantly surprised with the results. You could easily add chicken or leave as-is for a great vegetarian dinner!
