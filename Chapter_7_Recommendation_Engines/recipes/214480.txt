Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) boneless pork loin roast
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 tablespoon garam masala
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
1 onion, roughly chopped
2 tablespoons fig compote
1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 cup chicken broth

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pat pork roast dry with a clean towel. Mix curry powder, turmeric, garam masala, ground ginger, chili powder, cumin, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub spice mixture all over the pork roast.
Heat the olive oil and butter in a large, heavy bottom pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the seasoned pork roast into the pot and cook until evenly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove pork and set aside.  Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the fig compote, until well blended. Return pork to the pot, coating it with the fig mixture. Pour in the tomatoes and chicken broth. Cover, and bring to a boil.
Place covered pot in the preheated oven. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).

Description: 
A succulent, savory and sweet pork roast, ideally served over a vegetable rice or couscous.  I love using spices as much as possible, so in this experiment I used quite a few which I rubbed onto the pork roast before I seared it.  I think it would be even better if you let the rub sit on the roast for an hour or so in the fridge prior to cooking.
