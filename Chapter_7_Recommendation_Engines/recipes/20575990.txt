Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
1 onion, diced (about 1 1/4 cups)
1 celery stalk, diced (1/2 cup)
1 leek, white and green parts, diced (1 1/4 cups)
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
2 cups chopped plum tomatoes (canned or peeled and seeded fresh)
1 cup tomato puree
1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, chopped
1/4 cup long grain white rice
3 tbsp balsamic vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat.
Add onion, celery, and leek.
Cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, four to six minutes.
Add broth, plum tomatoes, tomato puree, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme leaves. Bring to a simmer and cook thirty minutes.
Add rice and continue to simmer fifteen minutes.
Puree soup until very smooth.
Optional: To give soup an extremely fine texture, strain through a fine sieve or cheesecloth-lined colander after pureeing.
Return soup to pot.
Stir in vinegar and reheat to just below a simmer.
Serve in heated bowls.

Description: 
Bisques are thick, rich soups that include a traditional base of crustaceans such as shrimp, lobster, or crayfish, and are thickened with rice, rice flour, or bread. The unique texture of bisques comes from the shells of the crustaceans that are usually pureed along with the other ingredients, giving bisque a consistency similar to a cream soup, but with a slightly grainier texture.
