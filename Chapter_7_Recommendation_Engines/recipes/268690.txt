Ingredients:
3/4 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as SplendaÂ®)
1/2 cup butter
3 eggs
1/2 tablespoon heavy cream
1 teaspoon almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
6 tablespoons coconut flour
1/4 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Beat sweetener and butter together in a bowl until creamy. Add eggs, heavy cream, and almond milk; beat until smooth. Scrape down sides with a spatula.
Mix coconut flakes, coconut flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Beat into the butter mixture until dough comes together.
Drop teaspoonfuls of cookie dough onto the baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 17 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
