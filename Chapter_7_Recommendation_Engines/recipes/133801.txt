Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 eggs
1 red apple, diced
3 green onions, chopped
1/2 cup sweet pickle relish
1/2 cup low-fat mayonnaise
3 stalks celery, thinly sliced
1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon dry fajita seasoning
1 medium cucumber, thinly sliced
1 head green leaf lettuce, rinsed
24 slices Sara Lee® Soft and Smooth 100% Whole Wheat Bread

Directions:
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and slice.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add chicken and cook until no longer pink inside, approximately 20 minutes.  Drain, cool and chop.
In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, sliced eggs, apple, onions, relish, mayonnaise, celery, pineapple (with just a little juice for flavor), cilantro, pecans and fajita seasoning.
Divide chicken salad equally onto 12 slices of bread. Top with sliced cucumber, and remaining bread slices.
