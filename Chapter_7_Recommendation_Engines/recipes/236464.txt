2 onions, chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger root
2 bunches collard greens, torn into pieces
12 cups water
5 cups brown rice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Saute tomatoes, onions, and ginger in the hot oil until the tomatoes are just beginning to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir collard green pieces into the tomato mixture; cook until the greens begin to soften, about 1 minute more.
Transfer tomato mixture to a slow cooker; add water, rice, and salt.
Cook on Medium until the water is completely absorbed, about 4 hours. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Description: 
This is a recipe from Madagascar. I converted it to a slow cooker dish so I could take it to work for a fundraiser for 'Operation Rice Bowl.' I tripled the recipe to feed a crowd. I increased the healthy aspect by using fresh vegetables.
