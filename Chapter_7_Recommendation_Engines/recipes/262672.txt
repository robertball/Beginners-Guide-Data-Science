Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
1 cup sour cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste
6 eggs
1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups shredded Swiss cheese
1/2 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough, thawed
1 cup melted butter, divided
1 (14 ounce) package smoked turkey sausage, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute spinach until liquid is evaporated, about 5 minutes; be careful not to scorch. Blend in sour cream. Season with salt and pepper.
Mix eggs, Cheddar cheese, and Swiss cheese together in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unroll phyllo dough and cover with a damp cloth. Place 2 sheets in a 9x13-inch baking pan. Brush top layer with butter using a basting brush. Repeat process 2 more times for a total of 6 sheets of layered phyllo dough.
Spread the spinach mixture over the dough. Top with 6 more sheets of dough, brushing every second layer with butter.
Spread 1/2 the sausage evenly over the dough. Add 1/2 the egg and cheese mixture. Repeat layering and buttering 4 more sheets of dough. Top with remaining sausage and remaining egg and cheese mixture. Add the remaining dough; do not butter the very top layer.
Cut breaklava into even squares using a sharp knife. Butter the top layer and sprinkle with parsley.
Bake in the preheated oven until top layer is lightly browned and egg mixture is set, 35 to 45 minutes. Re-cut along the pre-cut lines.

Description: 
My husband named this recipe Breaklava because I use phyllo dough, butter, and breakfast ingredients and layer it in a similar way you do for baklava. So it's breakfast baklava! You can use any combination of cheese to make it unique.
