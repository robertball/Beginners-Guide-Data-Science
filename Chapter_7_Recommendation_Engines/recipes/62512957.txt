Ingredients:
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup sugar
3 egg yolks
1/2 cup butter/margarine
2 tsp. vanilla
1 1/2 cups coconut
1 cup chopped nuts

Directions:
Bake a 2 layer cake and let cool.
Cook milk, sugar, eggs, and butter in microwave until it thickens (about 5 minutes). Make sure you cook it long enough to thicken or it will be too runny. Add vanilla, coconut and nuts.
Cool and spread over cooled German chocolate cake. Also frost between the layers and around the sides. Enjoy!
