Ingredients:
Feta Sauce:
2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
1/4 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1 tablespoon water, or more as needed
Couscous:
2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 cups Israeli (large pearl) couscous
1/3 cup pomegranate seeds
1/4 cup chopped pistachios
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon baharat (Middle Eastern spice mix)
Kebabs:
12 ounces beef top sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon baharat (Middle Eastern spice mix)
1 red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 small red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
2 portobello mushrooms, stem and ribs removed, cut into 1-inch pieces

Directions:
To make the feta sauce, stir together feta, yogurt, lemon juice, and zest in a small bowl. Add enough water to thin to desired consistency.
To prepare the couscous, bring broth to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add couscous. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until couscous is tender and broth is absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork. Add pomegranate seeds, pistachios, mint, and baharat. Toss to combine.
Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (325 to 375 degrees F (160 to 190 degrees C)). Sprinkle steak cubes with baharat; toss to coat. Thread steak, bell pepper, tomatoes, onion, and mushrooms onto eight 10-inch metal skewers (or bamboo skewers that have been soaked in water at least 30 minutes).
Grill kebabs, turning once or twice, until vegetables are tender and meat is just pink in center, or until desired doneness, 8 to 12 minutes. Serve kebabs with couscous and feta sauce on the side.
