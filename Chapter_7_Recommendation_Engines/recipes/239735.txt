Ingredients:
1 pastry for an 8-inch pie crust
6 slices bacon, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (10 ounce) bag fresh spinach
1 courgette (zucchini), thinly sliced
1 1/2 cups milk
2 eggs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Press pie pastry into an 8-inch pie dish.
Heat a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bacon for 3 minutes. Add onion, spinach, and courgette to bacon; cook and stir until onion and courgette are tender, spinach is wilted, and bacon is fully cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon-courgette mixture to the pie pastry.
Beat milk, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; pour into pastry crust. Top egg mixture with mozzarella cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and quiche bounces back when touched, about 35 minutes.
