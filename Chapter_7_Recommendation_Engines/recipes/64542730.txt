Ingredients:
2 medium size Korean/Asian eggplants
1 scallion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1-1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame oil
¼ teaspoon sugar
½ teaspoon gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper flakes)
1 teaspoon roasted sesame seeds
pinch pepper

Directions:
Cut the eggplants lengthwise in quarters. Then cut crosswise into about 2-inch pieces.
Boil the water in a pot with a steamer tier or basket over high heat, covered.
Place the eggplant pieces in the steamer, and steam until softened but still a bit firm, about 3 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl to cool.
Add all remaining ingredients and gently toss everything together.
Add more soy sauce to taste if needed.
