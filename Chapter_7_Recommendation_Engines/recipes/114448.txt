Ingredients:
1 cup tarragon vinegar
2 cups water
4 (1 pint) canning jars with lids and rings
2 pounds fresh green beans, rinsed and trimmed
4 sprigs fresh dill
1 teaspoon celery seed, divided
1 teaspoon mustard seed, divided
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, divided
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, divided
4 cloves garlic, peeled and cut in half lengthwise
1/2 teaspoon salt, or as needed

Directions:
Stir the tarragon vinegar and water together in a bowl.
Pack each jar with green beans so they stand on end without crowding. Into each jar, place 1 sprig of fresh dill, 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed, 1/4 teaspoon of mustard seed, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, 8 to 10 whole black peppercorns, and 2 garlic clove halves. Sprinkle a pinch of salt into each jar.
Fill the rest of the space in the jars with the tarragon vinegar-water mixture, place the lids on the jars, and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
These beans are cold-pickled rather than canned. Crispy and delicious, the pickled beans will stay fresh for several months as long as they're kept cold -- if they last that long!
