Description: 
My best friend took me out on the town in Nashville and we ordered a few of these amazing drinks. Then... a few weeks later I had something similar in Dallas! I became obsessed with figuring out how to throw one together and this is as close as it comes to heaven in a glass with a splash of burning as it goes down!
