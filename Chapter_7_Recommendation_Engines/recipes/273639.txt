Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 carrots, peeled and chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
4 cups vegetable broth
1 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons unsalted raw cashews
1 1/2 cups chopped spinach
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Grease a saucepan with cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat. Saute carrots, celery, and coriander until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add vegetable broth and red lentils and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until lentils are tender but not mushy, about 15 minutes.
Blend lemon juice and cashews together in a food processor or blender until smooth and creamy.
Stir the cashew cream, spinach, and parsley in with the lentils. Season with salt and pepper and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes more.
