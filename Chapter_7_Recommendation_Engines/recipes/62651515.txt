Description: 
I love turkey barbeque but I don't have the patience to roast and pick a turkey.  This is a shortcut version that hits the spot in my house.  It's great for a party just double the recipe and use smaller rolls.
If you don’t want to wait add all the ingredients to a sauce pan and double the water.  Bring to a boil and simmer, covered  on low for 15 minutes.
