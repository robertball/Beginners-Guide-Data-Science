Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 sweet onion, diced
2 links Merguez sausage, casing removed
1 green bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
1 red chile pepper, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 tomato, roughly chopped
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 eggs
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Directions:
Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper. Cook and stir until peppers start to soften, about 5 minutes.
Stir red chile pepper, garlic, and cumin seed into the onion-bell pepper mixture until coated in oil. Add tomato. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetable mixture is thick, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
Make 4 wells in the vegetable mixture and break an egg into each. Place the skillet on a simmer mat to prevent bottom from scorching. Cover and cook until eggs are set, about 10 minutes. Scatter the surface with cilantro and season with black pepper.
