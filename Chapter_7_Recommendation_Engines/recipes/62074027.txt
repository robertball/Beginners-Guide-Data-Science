Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
taco seasoning
1+ tomatoes, chopped (to taste)
1 bunch green onion, chopped
1 red pepper, chopped (optional)
1 red onion or yellow onion, chopped (optional
1 bag tortilla chips (or corn chips)
1 bag prepared salad (all green) or lettuce
1 bag shredded cheese
1 can sliced black olives
1 bottle Kraft BBQ Ranch dressing (can substitute with regular Ranch or Spicy Ranch)

Directions:
Cook the beef with the taco seasoning according to the directions on the packet.  If desired, mix in the red peppers and red onion and cook with the beef.
Tear up the lettuce into smaller pieces.  Mix together the lettuce, tomato, black olives, green onion, shredded cheese, and beef mixture.
Crumble tortilla chips onto the top of the salad and mix with the BBQ Ranch dressing.
This is typically  not good left over.  If you want to keep it for a few days, it's best to mix together the meat and vegetables but keep the rest seperate.  Then you can mix the cheese, lettuce, beef mixture, tortilla chips, and dressing together as you eat it.
