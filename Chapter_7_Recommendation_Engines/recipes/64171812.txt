3c unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon traditional yeast or 1/2 teaspoon Instant or Rapid-rise yeast
1teaspoon salt

Directions:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt and yeast.
Add water and stir until a shaggy mixture forms (mixture will be loose and sticky; this is what you want).
Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 12 - 18 hours (up to 24).
Preheat oven to 450. Place a cast iron dutch oven with a lid in the oven and heat the pot for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour the risen dough onto a heavily floured surface (mixture will be sticky) and lightly shape into a round loaf.
Remove hot pot from the oven and carefully set in the dough.
Cover and bake for 30 minutes.
Remove the lid and bake an additional 10-15 minutes. Carefully remove bread from oven and from pot and place on a cooling rack.
