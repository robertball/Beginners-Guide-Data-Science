1/4 cup butter
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 2-quart baking dish.
Massage kale for a few minutes until leaves are wilted.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add kale and heat through.
Place kale mixture in a bowl; add bread and Parmesan cheese. Pour in broth and toss until mixture is moistened. Season with salt and pepper; mix well. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 30 to 40 minutes.
