Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter, room temperature
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon maple extract
1/3 cup chopped cooked bacon
1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
Beat together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer until smooth. Add one egg; beat until blended into the butter mixture. Add the remaining egg, vanilla extract, and maple extract; beat until well blended and slightly fluffy. Stir in the flour mixture a little at a time, mixing just until combined. Stir in the bacon and chocolate chips. Scoop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.

Description: 
This recipe was born out of a challenge to include bacon in a cookie batter. While that has been done before, the inclusion of chocolate chips and maple together in a whipped batter make this a sweet-yet-savory chewy cookie treat!
