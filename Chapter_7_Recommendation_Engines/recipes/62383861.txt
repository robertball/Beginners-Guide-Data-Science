Description: 
My mother in law used to make this recipe when we would visit her and her family in Tennessee for the summers.  I used to look so forward to this delicious pie after a long day of camping and hiking. She has passed away and I came across the recipe the other day and decided to make it.  It reminded me of those wonderful summers in Tennessee.
