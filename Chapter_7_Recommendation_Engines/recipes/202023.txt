Ingredients:
2 large seedless cucumbers, sliced thin
1 large sweet onion, halved and sliced thin
2 teaspoons salt
1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
1/4 cup minced carrot
1/3 cup rice vinegar
1 teaspoon ground ginger
5 teaspoons white sugar
1/4 teaspoon coarse black pepper

Directions:
Use a vegetable peeler to peel stripes in the cucumbers leaving half the skin. Halve the cucumbers lengthwise. Use spoon to remove the seeds from the cucumber halves. Slice the halves thinly.
Place the cucumber, onion, and 2 teaspoons salt in a bowl with enough water to cover; allow to marinate in refrigerator at least 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander and transfer to a large bowl; add the jalapeno pepper and carrot to the mixture.
Stir the rice vinegar, ginger, sugar, and pepper together in a small bowl until the sugar is completely dissolved; pour over the cucumber mixture and stir to evenly coat. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator at least 30 minutes.

Description: 
A spicy, tangy, cold, yummy way to use all those cucumbers you grow! This is an old favorite that will cool you off while heating up your taste buds. Simple to make and it keeps for 3-4 days. I grow cucumbers and one plant can have 10-15 cucumbers a day ripen. This is a great variation of the traditional cucumber salad. Add tomatoes for a different variation. If you use fresh ginger be sure to grate it fine and increase amount to 1 1/2 teaspoons.
