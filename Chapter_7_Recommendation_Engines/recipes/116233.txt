Ingredients:
2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins
3 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
SALSA:
2 cups chopped fresh pineapple
1/3 cup chopped sweet red pepper
1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
2 green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon brown sugar

Directions:
Place pork on a greased rack in a foil-lined shallow roasting pan. Combine the brown sugar, mustard and ginger; spread over pork. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 35-40 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
In a bowl, combine the salsa ingredients. Serve with pork.

Description: 
The fresh salsa makes this dish perfect for a hot summer night or picnic. It's great the rest of the year, though, too.  --Patricia Schmeling
