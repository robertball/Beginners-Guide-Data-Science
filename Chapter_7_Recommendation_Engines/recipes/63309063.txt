1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup baking cocoa
1/2 tsp salt

18 large marshmallows, halved
FROSTING:
3 tbsps butter, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tbsps baking cocoa
1/8 tsp salt

Directions:
1. In a large bowl, cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla. Combine the flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.
