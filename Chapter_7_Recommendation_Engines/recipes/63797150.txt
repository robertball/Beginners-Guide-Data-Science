Ingredients:
14 ounces 72% cacao chocolate, broken into tiny pieces
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3/4 cup Nutella
2 cups crushed cornflakes (about 3 cups whole)
1 3/4 cups heavy cream

Directions:
Fill a medium saucepan three-quarters full with water and bring to a simmer. Combine 1 ounce of the chocolate with the butter in a large bowl. Place the bowl over the saucepan and slowly melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.
Remove from the heat, reserving the pan of hot water, and stir in the Nutella. Cool completely.
Mix in the crushed cornflakes.
Spread this mixture evenly in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan and reserve in the refrigerator until the coating is ready.
Bring the saucepan of hot water back to a simmer. Combine the remaining 13 ounces chocolate and the heavy cream in a large bowl and place it over the saucepan. Stir the mixture occasionally with a rubber spatula to combine the melting chocolate with the heavy cream.
Remove from the heat and slowly pour the ganache over the crispy Nutella mixture.
Place the baking pan in the refrigerator until the chocolate is completely set and firm.
Cut into finger-sized rectangles and watch them disappear in minutes.
