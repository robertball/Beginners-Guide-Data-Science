Ingredients:
1 cup white wine
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pound boneless pork loin, cubed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, sliced
1 pound cooked and diced potatoes
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans
1 pinch ground cayenne pepper
18 clams
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

Directions:
To Marinate: Combine the wine, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and cumin in a nonporous glass dish or bowl. Mix together. Add pork and toss to coat. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate to marinate for 2 to 3 hours.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute until soft. Remove pork from dish or bowl (reserving marinade) and add to skillet; brown quickly, then add potato cubes, reserved marinade, beans, cayenne pepper and clams or mussels. Cook until open, about 7 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve hot.
