Ingredients:
2-1/2 Cups Ground Walnut
1 Cup Sugar
4 Cups Flour
1 TB Sugar
1/2 TSP Baking Soda
1/4 TSP Salt
1-1/3 Cup Butter
1 Egg slightly beaten
2 Egg Yolks slightly beaten
1 Cake of Yeast (.6 oz)
1/2 Cup Sour Cream
12 oz. jar of Apricot preserves
3 TB Cocoa Powder
8 TB Sugar
1/4 Cup Butter
2-3 TB Water

Directions:
Combine the walnuts and sugar.  Set aside.
Sift flour, baking soda, 1 TB sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter, or knife.
Add the egg, egg yolk, crumbled yeast cake, and sour cream.  Ball it up, then knead it until it is smooth.  Divide into four pieces.
Roll out one section on a pastry board until approximately 1/8" thick.  Place it onto a greased jelly roll pan, and size to fit.
Spread a thin layer of the apricot preserves.  Sprinkle 1/3 of the sugar/nut mixture on top of that.
Roll out a second layer of the dough, and layer it ontop of the the sugar/nut mixture.  Perform the layering in this fashion until the final layer is the dough.
Set aside in a warm location for 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.
Just as it is about done baking mix together in a saucepan the 3 TB cocoa powder, 8 TB sugar, 1/4 Cup butter and 2 TB of water.  Melt all of these together until it boils.
As soon as the cookies are brought out of the over put the chocolate on top of the entire pan.
The chocolate will take a little while to harden entirely, but can be eaten at any time.

Description: 
A wonderful nutty layered bar cookie with an apricot center, and glazed over with chocolate.  This is an Austrian family tradition!  My great grandmother passed it on down the generations.  It does take some time, but the results are really worth it!
