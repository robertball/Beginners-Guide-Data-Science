Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 (4 pound) beef chuck roast
1 cup chili sauce
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon chili powder
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons white sugar

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place the roast in the pan, and brown on all sides.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and pour in the chili sauce, water, and vinegar. Season with chili powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder and white sugar. Simmer over medium-low heat for 3 hours, or until meat is fork tender. Remove beef, and refrigerate overnight. Reserve sauce, and refrigerate.
Slice or shred beef, and place in a large pot on the stove with the sauce. Heat through, and serve alone, or on your favorite sandwich buns.
