Ingredients:
3 medium Haas avocadoes
1-2 ears fresh corn
1 medium tomato, finely diced
1/3 cup red onion, finely diced
3 TBL olive oil
3 TBL rice vinegar
1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
salt and black pepper

Directions:
Cut avocados in half lengthwise and remove seed.
Score cube shapes with a knife; scoop out each half with a spoon.
Blanch or lightly steam the corn*; cut kernels from cob and add to avocado in a medium-sized bowl. Fold in diced tomatoes and onion. In a separate bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, and seasonings to make the dressing; drizzle over avocado mixture and gently fold to coat. Makes 4-6 servings.
*Grilled corn would also be very appropriate for this salsa. For a stronger, smoky flavor, the other primary ingredients could be grilled, or roasted, as well.
