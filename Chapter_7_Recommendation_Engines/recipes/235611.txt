Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, crushed
1 clove garlic, thinly sliced or minced
1 (14 ounce) package prepared pizza crust (11 inch)
1/2 cup PregoÂ® Alfredo Sauce Flavored with Bacon
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup jarred roasted red peppers, rinsed, drained and chopped
1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves

Directions:
Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Heat the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and cook until well browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally.  Add 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning and the garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute.
Place the pizza crust onto a baking sheet.  Spread the sauce on the crust to within 1/2-inch of the edge.  Layer with the chicken mixture, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese and peppers.  Sprinkle with the remaining Italian seasoning.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the cheeses are melted.  Sprinkle with the basil, if desired.
