Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups water
2/3 cup quinoa
3/4 cup butter, melted and cooled
1/3 cup milk
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 10 minutes more. Fluff with a fork and cool to room temperature.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease two 8-inch cake pans and line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper.
Blend butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract in a blender until combined. Add 2 cups cooked quinoa and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender with a rubber spatula as necessary.
Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Add quinoa mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until batter is smooth. Pour batter into prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool completely in the pans before removing to a plate.

Description: 
This deliciously moist and fudgy chocolate cake is made with a gluten-free twist that nobody ever suspects: quinoa! I've also made a vegan option of this by using egg substitute and replacing the milk with almond milk. The taste and texture was identical to my non-vegan original! Either version stores well in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 1 month. My favorite frosting for this cake is coconut cream cheese.
