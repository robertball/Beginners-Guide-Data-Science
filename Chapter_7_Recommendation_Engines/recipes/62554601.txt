Ingredients:
2 tbsp adobo seasoning (store bought or make your own, like I did)
2 tbsp minced shallot
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp minced thyme
1 tsp oregano
1 tsp parsley
4 lb pork loin
1 cup light brown sugar
2 tsp finely chopped garlic
2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp kosher salt

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine adobo, shallots, garlic, thyme, oregano, and parsley. Rub the mixture all over pork, pressing firmly, and refrigerate overnight.
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Bake pork loin in a pan or dish and for 30 minutes. Remove pork from the oven and let rest until cool enough to touch.
Mix remaining ingredients and spread all over the loin. Return to oven and cook about 25 to 30 minutes, or to around 170°F on the meat thermometer.
Baste with juices from pan, making sure brown sugar mixture blends well with juices and coats loin.
Remove loin and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut into thick slices and drizzle/brush with pan juices.
Serve.

Description: 
This is an adaptation of an adaptation I found online and quite possibly the best thing I ever tasted, ate,  or made in my life!  Thick cut slices of this loin were perfect with cinnamon-spiced mashed sweet potatoes.
