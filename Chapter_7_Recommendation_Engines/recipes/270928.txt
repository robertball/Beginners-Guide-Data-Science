Ingredients:
1 (3 pound) blade chuck roast
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic, finely grated
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1 teaspoon dried parsley
Au jus:
1 1/2 cups water
2 teaspoons beef base (such as Better than Bouillon®)
1/2 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg®)
1/4 teaspoon garlic granules

Directions:
Place a heat-resistant pad underneath a large pot filled with warm water. Attach a sous vide precision cooker to the pot and set temperature to 135 degrees F (57°C). Set the timer to 24 hours.
Remove all surface fat and silver skin from the roast. Truss the roast and generously season with salt and pepper on all sides.
Place the roast in a large resealable bag and remove all the air with a vacuum sealer. Place bag in the pot once the right temperature is reached, making sure it is completely submerged. Cover pot with plastic wrap to ensure the water doesn't evaporate.
Combine olive oil, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, thyme, and parsley in a small bowl 1 hour before the timer goes off.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) 20 minutes before the timer goes off. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Remove the bag from the pot and transfer to a plate. Remove roast and pat dry using paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Place the roast on the prepared baking sheet and cover with olive oil mixture.
Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.
While the roast is in the oven, combine water, beef base, soy sauce, and garlic granules in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a soft boil, then reduce heat, and simmer until sauce is reduced, 10 to 15 minutes.
Remove roast from the oven, cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes.
Slice roast and place on a platter. Drizzle au jus on top or serve sauce separately.
