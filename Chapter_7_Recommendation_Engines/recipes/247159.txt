1 (1 ounce) package onion soup mix

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.

Divide spaghetti into 4 bowls. Ladle soup over spaghetti.

Description: 
I made this recipe one night when pressed for time. I had a taste for Asian flavors and not many ingredients in the pantry. Mildly spicy and super fast to prepare, this recipe is an easy after-work meal. The type of protein or vegetable used could easily be adapted to whatever you have on hand!
