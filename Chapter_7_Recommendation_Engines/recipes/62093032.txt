Ingredients:
5-6 Large ripe tomatoes
1 Medium onion
1 Clove garlic
Juice of 1/2 a lime
1/2 a bunch of chopped cilantro
1 or 2 jalepeno peppers
1/2 Tablespoon salt

Directions:
Using a food processor chop the onion,garlic clove, and jalepeno to desired consistancy, add to a two quart bowl.
add the lime juice and salt and stir together.
quarter each tomato and add half of them with the cilantro to the processor. Be careful not to over process. Empty into bowl.
Add the last half of tomatoes and process again to desired consistancy, add to the bowl and stir well.
Eat right away, but has best flavor after it has set a few hours. The color will deepen and the flavors will blend together perfectly. For a milder flavor seed the peppers first.

Description: 
This is the only salsa I make. Excellent  when made with garden tomatoes. During July and August will make countless bowls of this wonderful summer salsa. My family eats one bowl per day, hard to keep up with the demand! Luckily the food processor does the hard work.
