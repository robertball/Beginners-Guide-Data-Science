Ingredients:
1 bag of butterscotch chips
2 (5 ounce) cans chow mein noodles or 2 1/2 cups small pretzel sticks
1/2 cup cashew halves or cocktail peanuts

Directions:
Pour butterscotch chips into a microwave safe bowl.
Add the shortening to the butterscotch chips.
Microwave 1 minute and then stir. If chips are not melted, then microwave 30 more seconds.
As you stir, the chips and shortening should blend into a creamy mixture.
Add the noodles/or nuts and stir till all are coated. If the mixture is runny, you may want to add a few more noodles.
Using a spoon or cookie scoop, place spoonfuls onto a plate or wax paper to cool. They should be hardened and ready to eat within a few minutes (can place the haystacks in the fridge for quick cooling).
