Ingredients:
350 g all purpose flour
120 g sugar
1 tbs baking soda
2 tbs cocoa
200 ml oil
500 ml kefir
1 egg
For glaze: 200 ml sour cream, 100 g dark chocolate

Directions:
Combine flour, sugar, baking soda and cocoa. Then add oil, kefir and egg. Combine well. Pour batter into a baking pan. Bake at 190°C (375°F) for approximately 20 minutes. To make the glaze melt the chocolate and then add sour cream into melted chocolate.
Tip: to get real Dinomite bites, cut out the pieces in the shape of Dinomite:  ;)
UPDATE: Serve on piece of Kale because Dinomite loves Kale and because as Lisa Cereso said in reviews: "...kale with chocolate is the best combination ever." Thanks Lisa for suggestion.
