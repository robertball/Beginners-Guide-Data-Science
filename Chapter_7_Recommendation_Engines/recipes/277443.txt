Ingredients:
4 eggs
2/3 cup granular sucralose sweetener (such as Splenda®)
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
4 tablespoons sour cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wrap the outside of a 9 1/2-inch springform pan with foil to prevent water seeping in while baking.
Beat eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer until light and doubled in volume. Add sucralose sweetener and mix on medium speed to combine. Beat in ricotta cheese until well combined. Reduce speed to medium-low, add cream cheese, and mix well. Blend in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.
Pour batter into the prepared pan; lower pan into a larger baking dish filled with 2 inches of hot water.
Carefully transfer to the preheated oven and bake for 90 minutes. Turn oven off; do not open the door. Leave cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour more.
Remove from oven and let cool on the counter for 1 hour. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours.
