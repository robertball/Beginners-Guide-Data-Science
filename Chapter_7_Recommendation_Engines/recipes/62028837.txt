Ingredients:
1 pillsbury ready made pie crust
1 tsp. garlic powder
8 chicken bullion cubes
1 tsp parsley
1 quart water
1 tsp onion powder
5 T butter
1 can evaporated milk
5 T flour
your favorite frozen casserole vegetables
1 tsp curry powder
2 cups cooked poultry

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450 F
Set out frozen crusts to thaw.  Add the bullion cubes to the quart of water in a glass dish and microwave on high for 6 minutes.
Melt butter in a large sauce pan on low-medium setting.  Add the flour and whisk with the melted butter.  Add curry powder, garlic, parsley and onion.  Whisk well.
Add the bullion water and whisk, continue stirring until thickened.  Add the evaporated milk and mix well.
Set the sauce on low and in a large mixing bowl combine small pieces of poultry with the frozen vegetables.  Pour two cups of the sauce over the meat/veggies, mix until they are coated.  Place the bottom pie crust in the deep dish pie pan.  Poke holes in the bottom with a fork.  Pour in pie filling and cover with top crust, sealing the edges and cutting 6-8 vents in the top.
Place pie in preheated over and bake for 25 minutes.  After the first 25, reduce heat to 350 and bake an additional 25 minutes, until lightly golden.  Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes.  Serve warm with extra sauce.

Description: 
This is a great way to use up the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, or chicken from a large chicken dinner. This pot pie recipe is different than most, because it has a creamy curried sauce that turns a critic into a fan :)
