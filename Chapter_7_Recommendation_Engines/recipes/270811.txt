Ingredients:
2 cups water
2 cups uncooked short-grain sticky rice
2 1/2 cups skim milk, divided
1/3 cup white sugar, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)
1 egg, beaten
2/3 cup golden raisins (optional)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon lemon extract (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir; reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook until rice tender, about 20 minutes.
Increase heat to medium; add 1 3/4 cups milk, sugar, and salt. Cook and stir until thick and creamy, 10 to 12 minutes.
Beat remaining 3/4 cup milk with egg in a small bowl or glass measuring cup. Add 3 tablespoons of the hot rice mixture, 1 spoonful at a time, stirring each time to temper the egg. Pour mixture into the pan and stir for 1 more minute.
Remove from heat and stir in raisins, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix in cinnamon and nutmeg. Serve hot or cold.

Description: 
The use of short-grain sticky rice (also called glutinous rice for its texture) makes this dish creamy without the need for whole milk, cream, or butter. Cook the rice in a rice cooker, and it's even easier! 
You can find this variety of rice in almost any Asian market, many natural foods stores, and increasingly in the international section of mainstream supermarkets.
