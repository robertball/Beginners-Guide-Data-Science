Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 slices turkey bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 large onion, sliced
1 large head green cabbage, cut into 1/2-inch strips
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 tablespoon rice vinegar, or to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in an extra-large frying pan or stockpot over medium-high heat. Add bacon; saute until crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until softened and starting to brown, about 5 minutes.
Stir in cabbage and garlic. Cook and stir until cabbage begins to wilt, about 10 minutes. Season with cayenne pepper and paprika; sprinkle in vinegar.
Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cabbage reaches desired texture, 8 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
The title says it all! Cabbage is fried with turkey bacon, onion, and garlic with a touch of cayenne to make you remember it!

 I love this recipe because it's simple, quick and so delicious! It is a great recipe because you can adjust any of the ingredients to suit your own taste or mood. It is delicious with a side of cornbread or jasmine rice.
