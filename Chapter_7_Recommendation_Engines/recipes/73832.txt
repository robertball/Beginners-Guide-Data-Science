Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed
½ cup water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
¼ cup frozen, chopped carrots
¼ cup frozen peas (optional)
1 tablespoon cumin
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup uncooked white rice

Directions:
Place the chicken into a large saucepan and fill with enough water to cover, about 3 cups. Bring to a boil and cook for about fifteen minutes, or until chicken is done.  Dice chicken, and reserve cooking liquid.
In a food processor or blender, puree cilantro with 1/2 cup water.
Heat oil in a saucepan and cook garlic until lightly browned.  Pour in 2 cups of the cooking liquid and stir in the cilantro puree, diced chicken, carrots, peas, cumin and rice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a simmer, then cover; cook on low heat until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
