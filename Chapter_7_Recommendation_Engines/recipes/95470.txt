Ingredients:
5 egg yolks
1 1/4 cups white sugar
1 1/2 cups finely chopped almonds
2 cups grated carrots
1 lemon, zested and juiced
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
5 egg whites
1 pinch salt
1 lemon, juiced
1 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square baking dish or 9 inch Bundt pan.
In a large bowl, whip egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in the almonds, carrots,1 lemon's juice and zest, flour and baking powder. In a separate bowl with a clean beater, whip egg whites with a pinch of salt until they can hold a peak. Fold egg whites into the carrot batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.
Bake for 50 minutes, or until a small knife inserted into the center comes out clean. For icing, mix the remaining lemon's juice with confectioners' sugar until it can be drizzled easily from a spoon. Pour over the cake while warm or cooled. If making in a Bundt pan, remove from the pan before glazing.
