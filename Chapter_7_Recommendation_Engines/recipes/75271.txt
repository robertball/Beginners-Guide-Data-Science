4 ounces light or regular cream cheese (do not use fat free)
3/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola or blue cheese
3 tablespoons pesto or sun dried tomato pesto
2 tablespoons minced fresh basil leaves

2 (5.75 ounce) cans Lindsay® Colossal Black Ripe Pitted Olives, drained

Directions:
In bowl of food processor, combine cream cheese, Gorgonzola, pesto, basil, salt and pepper; process until well combined.    Transfer mixture to a 1-quart zip top plastic food storage bag. At this point, bag may be refrigerated up to 2 days.
To serve, cut a tiny end off food storage bag (no larger than 1/4 inch width). Place corner of bag as deep as possible inside each olive, gently squeeze bag filling olive and letting a small amount of mixture mound out of the top of the olive.
