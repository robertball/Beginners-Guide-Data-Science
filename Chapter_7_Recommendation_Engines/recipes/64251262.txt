Ingredients:
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup paprika
¼ cup salt
¼ cup black pepper
1 tbsp. garlic powder
1 tbsp. onion powder
1 tbsp. chili powder
1 tbsp. McCormick cilantro leaves
¼ tsp cumin powder
¼ tsp ginger powder
Optional: 1 tbsp. Cyan pepper

Directions:
Combine ingredients in a small plastic bowl with a lid. Close lid and shake well until all ingredients are blended evenly. You can either leave the rub in the container, or transfer it to your favorite spice container. Its best to have a shaker that has medium size holes that can be closed shut. After storage, shake well to re-loosen rub before using again.

Description: 
I made this rub for my daughters 14th birthday which is why I called it BBQ dry rub No.14. It gives pork a nice sweet flavor that goes well with all the other spices.
