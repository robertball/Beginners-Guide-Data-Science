Description: 
To make this simple remoulade sauce, combine mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, fresh dill, pickles, minced garlic, capers, lemon juice, and a dash of cayenne. This version has some body to it. It's easy and so much better than store-bought versions. Try it with crab cakes or pretty much any grilled, broiled, or pan-seared fish.
