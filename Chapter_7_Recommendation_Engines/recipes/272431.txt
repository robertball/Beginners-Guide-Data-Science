Ingredients:
1 bunch kale - stems removed, roughly chopped, and rinsed
1 bunch spinach - stems removed, coarsely chopped, and rinsed
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 serrano chile pepper, minced
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Combine kale and spinach in a large soup pot over low heat. Cook just until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer greens to a blender a little at a time. Blend until finely shredded, but not pureed, adding a small amount of water if needed.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, serrano chile pepper, ginger, and garlic. Cook until onion is medium brown, about 5 minutes. Add coriander, cumin, garam masala, and cayenne pepper. Cook for about 1 minute more. Add kale mixture and salt and stir thoroughly. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat, and simmer 5 more minutes.

Description: 
This dish is based on Indian saag or saag paneer, commonly served in Indian restaurants. In this case, I used kale instead of mustard greens and left out the cream common in the Indian version. You can also substitute other greens for the spinach. Goes great with beef entrees.
