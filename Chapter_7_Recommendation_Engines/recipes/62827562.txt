Ingredients:
4 large scoops vanilla ice cream
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup milk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
8 fresh strawberries
8 graham cracker halves

Directions:
In a blender, combine ice cream, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla; pulse on high speed 1 minute, or until well blended.**
Pour into glasses, garnish with strawberries and graham crackers, and serve immediately.
**Another option you could try is to take a few strawberries and seperately blend in your blender/food processor, then add them into the completed milkshake

Description: 
This is a milkshake to die for, if you love cheesecake and strawberries...hmmm!:) I got this off a two minute cooking episode from a local news channel. Be experimental with this too--blueberries, rasberries, peaches!!
