Ingredients:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound (1 inch thick) boneless sirloin steak
4 bacon strips
Lemon-pepper seasoning
GLAZE:
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1/2 cup steak sauce
1/2 cup honey
1 tablespoon molasses

Directions:
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Cut steak into four wide strips; add to the marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 2-3 hours or overnight, turning once.
Drain and discard marinade. Wrap a bacon strip around each steak piece; secure with a toothpick. Sprinkle with lemon-pepper. Coat grill rack with nonstick cooking spray before starting the grill.
Grill steak, covered, over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F) Combine the glaze ingredients; brush over steaks. Grill until glaze is heated. Discard toothpicks.

My love of cooking started when I was trying to earn my Girl Scout cooking badge. My family savors the sweet sauce on these skewers.                                  --Joanne Haldeman, Bainbridge, Pennsylvania
