Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1 slice onion, minced
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
2 cups Marsala wine
1 1/2 cups chicken stock
5 tablespoons brown sugar
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon molasses
1 tablespoon corn syrup
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon cold water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded flat
2 tablespoons chopped green onion, or to taste

Directions:
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic into the melted butter, increase heat to medium-high, and cook and stir the mixture until the mushrooms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir Marsala wine, chicken stock, brown sugar, lemon juice, molasses, and corn syrup into the mushroom mixture; bring to a boil and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid reduces by about half, 10 to 15 minutes.
Whisk cornstarch into cold water in a small bowl. Stream the cornstarch slurry into the Marsala sauce, stirring continually; cook and stir until the sauce thickens, another 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat olive oil with 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook chicken until golden brown until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Arrange each chicken breast into the center of a plate. Drizzle Marsala sauce over each chicken breast; garnish with green onion to serve.
