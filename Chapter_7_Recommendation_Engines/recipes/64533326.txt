Ingredients:
In a slow cooker, combine:
1 medium onion, chopped
1 Shallot, Chopped
1 Poblano Pepper, Diced (roasted ,skinned and deseeded)
5 or 6 cloves of garlic, minced
1 pound of dried beans (rinsed)
1/2 lb of diced Bacon (ends and Pieces chopped)
1 Teaspoon salt
1/2 Teaspoon Coarse Black Pepper
5 cups (approximately) of Chicken Stock.

Directions:
Cook on high for about 6 hours.
After 3 hrs, taste the broth, this is when you should add some extra seasoning
1 Tablespoon BBQ sauce
or
1 teaspoon of Chili powder
(Or anything else you want to, I add 1/2 teaspoon Smoked Chipotle Tabasco)
Check the broth level as you cook â€“ you might need a little bit more broth after the beans have been cooking for a few hours.
