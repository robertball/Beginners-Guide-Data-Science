Ingredients:
1 pound hot pork sausage
1/2 (30 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup milk
3 large eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a half-casserole baking dish or deep-dish pie plate.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
Stir hash browns, cooked sausage, Cheddar cheese, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Whisk milk, eggs, and remaining salt together in another bowl. Pour hash brown mixture into prepared baking dish; pour egg mixture evenly over hash brown mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This super-easy breakfast casserole is actually good. You can make it the night before and keep the sausage/hash brown mixture separate from the egg mixture, then pour it over top right before it goes into the oven. You might need to cook it a little longer if its cold from the fridge. This is also great if you add a little onion.
