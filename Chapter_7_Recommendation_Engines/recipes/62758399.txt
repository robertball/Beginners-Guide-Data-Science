Ingredients:
1	pound  small red potatoes , quartered
2	tablespoons  vegetable oil
2	strip steaks about 1 1/2 inches thick, trimmed of fat and halved crosswise
Salt and pepper
2	tablespoons  unsalted butter
1/2	teaspoon  dried oregano
1/2	teaspoon  paprika (see Test Kitchen Discovery, above)
1/2	teaspoon  onion powder
1/4	teaspoon  garlic powder
1/8	teaspoon  cayenne pepper

Directions:
1. Toss potatoes and 1 tablespoon oil in large bowl. Wrap tightly with plastic and microwave until edges of potatoes are translucent, 4 to 7 minutes, shaking bowl (without removing plastic) to redistribute potatoes halfway through cooking.
2. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook steaks until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and tent with foil.
3. Drain potatoes and cook in empty skillet until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Add butter, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Serve.

Description: 
Potatoes in the skillet are usually burnt to a crisp, undercooked, or mushy and soaked with oil. We wanted crispy, perfectly cooked potatoes and a steak that could hold its own without a complicated sauce or rub
