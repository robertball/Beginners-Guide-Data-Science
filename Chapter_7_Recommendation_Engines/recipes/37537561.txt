Ingredients:
2 small to medium zucchini
2 small to medium yellow squash
kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Garlic Powder
3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Directions:
preheat the oven to 350. Spray a small baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside.
Cut off the ends of the zucchini and yellow squash, then cut each lengthwise in half. Place the pieces cut sides up close together on the baking sheet.
Sprinkle everything in the pan liberally with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
Next carefully pile the Parmesan cheese high on every piece.
Drizzle the olive oil over the zucchini and squash, then bake for about 12 minutes, until the squash and cheese start to turn golden brown.
Remove and serve while still warm.
