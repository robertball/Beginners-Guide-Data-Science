Ingredients:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 lb boneless pork chops, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 lb. skinless boneless chicken cutlets, cut into 1 inch cubes
2 (14.5 ounce) cans enchilada sauce - mild
2 (15.5 ounce) cans white hominy, drained
1 onion, sliced thin
1/2 cup green chilies, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoons dried oregano
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped - omit or use parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tsp. cumin

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the pork; cook and stir just until meat is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Place the meat in a 4 quart slow cooker. Pour the enchilada sauce over the meat. Top with the hominy, onion, chilies, garlic, cumin, and oregano. Add 1 1/2 cups of water to the slow cooker.
Cover, and cook on High for 6 hours. Stir in the cilantro and salt. Cook on Low for 30 minutes more.
I serve with refried beans,cheese, sour cream and chives. You can also add some lime juice if you like.
