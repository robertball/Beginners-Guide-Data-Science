Ingredients:
1 cup Warm Water
1 1/2 tsp Active Dry Yeast
1 tsp Sugar
3 TBS Olive Oil
1 1/2 tsp Salt
2 1/2 - 3 cups Bread Flour
1 ½ TBS Whole Peppercorns
1 cup cubed Parmesan Cheese
1 TBS melted Butter

Directions:
Add the yeast, warm water, sugar and oil to a large bowl. Allow to sit for about 5-10 minutes.
Add in about 1 1/2 cups of the flour, stirring to incorporate.
Crush your peppercorns using the side of a large knife or a rolling pin (should be coarse). Add peppercorns and salt and stir again.
Continue adding flour and dump onto a clean surface to knead. You only want to add enough flour for the dough not to stick to anything....you may not use it all.
Knead for about 8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and set in a warm place for about 30 minutes...or until it has doubled in size.
Gently degas the dough and spread flat on a floured surface.
Cover evenly with the Parmesan chunks and roll back into a ball.
Divide into 2 loaves shape the dough into a ball. The chunks of cheese may stick out in a few places...that's ok!
Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.
Cover and allow to rise for another 30 minutes.
Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes...or until golden brown and hollow sounding.
Brush with butter after removing from the oven to ensure a soft crust.
