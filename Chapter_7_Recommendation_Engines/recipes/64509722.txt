Ingredients:
1/2 cup gluten free starter, at room temperature
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 Tbsp oil
1 egg, beaten well
1 Tbsp raw sugar
1/4 tsp vanilla, or more to taste
1 Tbsp pumpkin spice mix, optional
2 Tbsp milk, or more if needed

Directions:
Heat a griddle or pan to med heat.
Mix together egg and oil. Add the flour, sugar, vanilla and spice mix and mix well. Fold in the starter mixing until just combined. Add milk spoon-by-spoon until the right consistency is achieved. Try not to mix the batter too much as it will release the natural gases needed to maintain a fluffy pancake.
Pour approx. 1/4 cup of batter onto a hot griddle and cook for about 45 seconds on each side or until browned.

Submitter: 
Buckwheat Queen
Description: 
Pancakes made with a gluten free starter instead of commercial leavening agents. The flavor will depend on the type of starter you use so it is always unique. For bolder flavours, go with a starter made of buckwheat and teff  flours, you won't be sorry. If your starter is a bold mix, then use a milder flour mix or vice versa. The fact that they are gluten free will simply be an afterthought.
