Description: 
My mom wanted me to make dinner and I was tempted to go into the frozen food isle and buy hot pockets. Then I thought to myself...why not make my own! My family raved over them and now I make them all the time. Very quick, low-cost dinner, yet delicious and addicting. Easy to add or subtract ingredients in each separate pocket to please everyone's taste. Very simple recipe. Familiar name...better taste.
