Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive oil
salt to taste
1/2 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
1/2 cup Chardonnay white wine
1 pound fresh mussels
1/2 cup salted butter
1 head garlic, peeled and minced
1 shallot, minced
1 small French baguette, halved lengthwise
1 teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste
1 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
3 jalapeno peppers, diced, or more to taste
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Fill a medium pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt. Carefully break pasta in half and place into the boiling water. Cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 4 minutes. Drain in a colander and toss with remaining olive oil. Set aside and allow pasta to cool.
Fill a large pot 1/3 of the way with water. Add 1/4 cup wine and bring to a boil. Carefully add mussels and cook until shells have opened up, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, measure 3/4 cup cooking liquid into a bowl, and cover the pot.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Melt 1/3 of the butter in a saucepan. Saute 1/3 of the garlic and shallot until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread over the baguette halves. Spoon melted butter evenly over both halves.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot, about 5 minutes. Broil until top is browned, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle paprika and basil on top.
Melt remaining butter in the same saucepan. Saute remaining garlic, shallot, and jalapeno peppers until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup wine and reserved cooking liquid. Cook and stir until sauce is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add pasta; toss well to combine.
Remove pasta from heat. Add Parmesan cheese and salt. Toss together. Divide pasta among serving plates. Arrange mussels around the pasta. Serve with sliced garlic bread.
