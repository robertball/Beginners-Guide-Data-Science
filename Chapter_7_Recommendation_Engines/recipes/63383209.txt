https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup unsalted butter, (2 sticks)
2 cups white sugar
4 eggs
2 t. vanilla extract
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 cup AP flour
1/2 t. salt
1/2 t. baking powder, (maybe slightly heaping...)

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees, (175 degrees C.).
If using a pan, grease and flour a 9x13 pan.
If using muffin tins, line tins.  I make mine in a bite sized muffin tn with plain white or seasonally colored liners, makes them fast, fun and easy to portion out.
2. Have butter softened to room temperature, (do not melt or soften in microwave).  Combine butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla extract and mix vigorously with a wire whisk until butter is incorporated yet you can still see bubbles of butter, (these will create steam pockets while cooking and make them fluffy-ish).
3. Add salt, baking powder, cocoa and flour, mix gently until just incorporated, do not overmix.
4. Pour into pan or portion into muffic tins, (I use different size ice cream scoops for speed and consistency).
5. use fleur de sel or really good sea salt and gently cover the top of your baking pan or muffins with a dusting of flakes, big flakes are pretty and make a pretty finish.
6. Dependent on baking dish, bake until set and toothpick or knife comes away clean.

Description: 
Not too dense, not too cake like, these brownies are perfect and a step up from Sam's, BJ's or Costco's brownie bites.  The consistency is perfect and the sea salt finishes them perfectly.
