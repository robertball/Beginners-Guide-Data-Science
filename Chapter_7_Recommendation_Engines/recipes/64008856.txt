Ingredients:
6 large eggs
1 cup of light cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 grindings fresh ground pepper
2 tablespoons butter
3 drops of tarragon vinegar

Directions:
1. Bring water in the bottom of a double boiler, boil and reduce the heat so that the water barely simmers.
2. Break the eggs into a small bowl and add the cream, salt and pepper.  Beat egg mixture vigorously with a whisk.
3.  Melt the butter in the top of the double boiler and add the egg-cream mixture.  Cover and place over the simmering water.
4.  Allow to cook undisturbed for about 15 minutes.  Uncover and stir with a wooden spoon and continue to stir until desired degree of firmness.  Be sure that the water does not reach a full boil.
5.  In the meantime, cook the clarified butter in a heavy bottom pan over low heat until it turns dark brown, and a few drops of vinegar, stir and serve as a sauce over the scrambled eggs
