Ingredients:
Crust:
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Filling:
3/4 cup caramel ice cream topping
1 cup chopped pecans
5 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1/4 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Toppings:
1 cup frozen whipped topping, thawed (optional)
1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping, or to taste (optional)
1/4 cup chopped pecans, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and cinnamon together in a bowl; press into a pie pan.
Bake crust in preheated oven until set, 6 to 8 minutes.
Spread 3/4 cup caramel ice cream topping over the pie crust. Sprinkle 1 cup chopped pecans over the caramel. Refrigerate until the caramel is set, at least 15 minutes.
Melt 5 tablespoons butter in a saucepan. Stir brown sugar and salt into the butter; add apples and stir to coat. Cook until apples are fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes; transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until completely cool, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Beat cream cheese, white sugar, egg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth.
Spread chilled apple mixture over the caramel and pecans in the pie crust; top with the cream cheese layer.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let pie cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
Top pie with whipped topping. Drizzle 1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping over the pie. Sprinkle 1/4 cup pecans over the caramel and whipped topping.
