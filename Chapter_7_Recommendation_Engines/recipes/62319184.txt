Ingredients:
•3/4 cup fresh cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and grated
•2 1/4 cups  plain yogurt
•Cheesecloth
•4 cloves garlic, minced
•3 Tbsp. Olive Oil, with 2 Tbsp. reserved.
•2 1/2 tsp. fresh lemon juice
•1 Tbsp. fresh dill, chopped
•1 red onion, sliced very thin
•1 tsp. lemon juice
•1 tsp. sumac, ground*
•1 lb. ground beef, 73% to 80% lean
•1 small sweet yellow onion, finely minced
•1 1/4 tsp. red pepper flake
•1/2 Tbsp. coriander, ground
•1/2 Tbsp. cumin, ground
•1 Tbsp. urfa biber*
•Salt to taste (1 tsp. kosher salt seems about right, maybe a pinch more).
•1 Tbsp. butter, softened
•1/2 red bell pepper, chopped

Directions:
Place grated cucumbers on a towel . Place another towel on top and pat to remove excess moisture and set aside.
Place yogurt in cheesecloth, twisting the top to seal it in, and squeeze to remove excess moisture. This will produce a thicker yogurt. Alternatively, just use Greek yogurt.
Fold in the lemon juice until fully incorporated.
Slowly fold in 1 Tbsp. of the olive oil, bit by bit, until fully incorporated.
Add dill and cucumbers, and fold in. Once the product in homogeneous, cover and refrigerate.
Mix red onion, lemon juice and sumac. Refrigerate. (This is tzatziki)
Place meat in a bowl, and add yellow onion, red pepper flake, coriander, cumin, urfa biber, salt, and butter. Mix until all ingredients are well distributed.
Place bell pepper in blender and blend until it is mostly pureed. Remove excess liquid, and add the bell pepper and salt to the meat, and mix well.
Divide into 4 equal portions and form into patties a bit larger than the bun it will be placed on as patties will shrink a bit.
Brush patties with reserved olive oil and grill on high and direct heat until it is done to your liking.**
Top burger with tzatziki and the lemon-soaked red onion and sumac mixture. Enjoy!
