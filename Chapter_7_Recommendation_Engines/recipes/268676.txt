Ingredients:
3/4 cup Marie's® Balsamic Vinaigrette, divided
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons honey
2 teaspoons orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®) (optional)
1 large navel orange
4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
Sea salt to taste
1 (5 ounce) package spring salad greens
1 pound slender asparagus - lightly steamed, chilled, and cut on the diagonal into 2-inch pieces
1 small fennel bulb, stalks and core removed, thinly sliced
1 (3 ounce) package shaved Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Combine 1/4 cup Marie's Balsamic Vinaigrette, pepper, honey, and orange liqueur to make glaze. Zest orange and add to the glaze.
Slice peel off orange, removing all of white pith. Slice oranges into rounds, then into quarters. Reserve.
Preheat the oven's broiler. Cover a broiler pan with nonstick foil. Sprinkle salmon with salt. Broil salmon, brushing often with glaze until cooked, about 8 minutes. Do not turn.
Toss spring mix with asparagus, fennel, and remaining 1/2 cup Marie's Balsamic Vinaigrette. Divide among 4 plates and top with salmon. Garnish salads with orange pieces and Parmesan.
