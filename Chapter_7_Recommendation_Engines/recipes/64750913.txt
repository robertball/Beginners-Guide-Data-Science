Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups creamy peanut butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 Tablespoons cocoa powder unsweetened
2 cups coconut flakes unsweetened
2 Tablespoons butter melted

Directions:
Prepare a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a non-stick silicone baking mat.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, vanilla extract, melted butted, coconut flake and cocoa powder and stir until well combined. (If you like your cookies a little sweeter, feel free to add 1-2 teaspoons Stevia).
Scoop batter onto your prepared baking sheet. Use the back of the spoon to gently shape each scoop into into a 3" cookie
