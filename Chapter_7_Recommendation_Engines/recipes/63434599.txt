Ingredients:
1 medium head of broccoli
3-4 cloves of chopped garlic
1/2 red bell pepper sliced into bite sized pieces
olive oil
sesame oil
2 tablespoons of soy sauce
red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to taste
water for steaming

Directions:
Wash the broccoli and slice it into bite sized pieces. Do the same for the red bell pepper. Heat up a cast iron skillet and add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Start to fry the broccoli for about 2 minutes, turning it when edges start to brown. Continue to cook it for about 1 more minute. Chop the garlic and add the red bell pepper to the pan, plus about 1/2 cup of water and place a lid over the top of the pan. After about another minute add the garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce and red pepper flakes as the water is evaporated. Replace the lid back on the pan and cook until desired tenderness, a few minutes more.

Description: 
Simple taste of asia but with less oil than the restaurants typically use. I like it with salmon pizza but it would be nice with a steak or roast or chops. I will probably use my leftovers to top a baked potato.
