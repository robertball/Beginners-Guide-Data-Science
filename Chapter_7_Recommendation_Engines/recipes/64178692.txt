1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Roughly chop the onion, scotch bonnet peppers (if you are concerned about this being too spicy remove the seeds and white flesh from one of the peppers), scallions, garlic, and ginger.

Marinate the chicken for at least two hours preferably for 8 hours. Reserving some marinade for basting while grilling.
