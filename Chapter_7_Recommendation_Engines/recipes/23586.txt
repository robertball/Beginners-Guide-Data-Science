Ingredients:
1/2 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni
1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 cup shredded provolone cheese

1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk

Directions:
Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Place macaroni in the saucepan and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.
Spread the Cheddar cheese over the bottom of the baking dish. Top with a thin layer of macaroni. Top macaroni with Provolone cheese, another layer of macaroni, a layer of mozzarella and a third layer of macaroni. Top with a layer of Colby-Monterey Jack cheese. Pour the egg over all, followed by the milk.
Bake in the preheated oven 20 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown.

Description: 
This is a layered four cheese recipe that my very good friend gave me. She knew I didn't like to cook and this was pretty simple to do. Now I make this dish every Thanksgiving.
