Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 slices pumpernickel bread, cut into strips
ground black pepper to taste
6 large kale leaves, cut into small pieces
2 1/2 ounces grated Romano cheese
1/2 pint grape tomatoes, halved
1/2 large lemon, juiced, or more to taste

Directions:
Whisk olive oil and garlic together in a bowl; let rest until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread bread strips out onto a baking sheet and season with black pepper.
Bake bread in the preheated oven until toasted, about 5 minutes.
Combine kale leaves, toasted bread, Romano cheese, and tomatoes in a large bowl. Pour olive oil mixture and lemon juice over the top; toss to coat completely.

Description: 
This is a great no-meat alternative meal. I crave this salad weekly. The oil to salad or lemon to oil ratios are the trick. Master these and you've got something.
