Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 large sweet potatoes
1/4 cup vegan butter
1/2 cup almond milk
1/3 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup orange juice
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
Topping:
3/4 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/4 cup vegan butter
2 tablespoons maple syrup

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Add vegan butter and mash to the desired consistency. Add almond milk, maple syrup, orange juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Pour into the prepared casserole dish.
Combine pecans, brown sugar, flour, vegan butter, and maple syrup in a bowl and sprinkle over casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until hot, about 45 minutes.
