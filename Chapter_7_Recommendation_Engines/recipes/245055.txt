Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
salt to taste
1 cup canned mushrooms, including liquid
1 onion, sliced
1 green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 clove garlic, peeled
1 (16 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
1 cup dry white wine
3/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1/4 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 bay leaf
1 1/2 cups cooked rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken with paprika, black pepper, and salt to taste. Cook chicken in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving oil in the skillet.
Drain mushroom liquid into the same skillet; add onion, green bell pepper, and garlic. Cover skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Mix chicken, tomatoes, white wine, 3/4 teaspoon salt, marjoram, and bay leaf into onion mixture; simmer over low heat until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes. Remove bay leaf and garlic.
Serve chicken over rice.
