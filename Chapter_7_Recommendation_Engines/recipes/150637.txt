Ingredients:
2 (28 ounce) cans baked beans
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons pancake syrup
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
4 slices bacon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large bowl, stir together the baked beans, onion, brown sugar, syrup, ketchup and mustard. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish, and lay strips of bacon across the top.
Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is browned and the beans have thickened.

Description: 
Tangy, sweet old fashioned baked beans, are made the easy way in this side dish. This is my grandma's favorite semi home-made recipe. She makes it every Thanksgiving, and we usually end up scraping the pan clean! Never any leftovers!
