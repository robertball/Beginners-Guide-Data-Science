Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
2 cups shredded reduced-fat Cheddar or part-skim mozzarella cheese

Directions:
Thaw bread dough according to package directions; let rise until doubled. Meanwhile, in a skillet, saute onion and garlic in oil until tender. Stir in spinach.
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 14-in. x 10-in. rectangle. Spread the spinach mixture to within 1/2 in. of edges; sprinkle with cheese. Roll up jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal. Place seam side down on a baking sheet coated with nonstick cooking spray; tuck ends under.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan to a wire rack; let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm.
