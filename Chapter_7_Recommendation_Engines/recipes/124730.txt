Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups pineapple juice
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 cup lemon-lime soda
6 (1 inch thick) pork loin chops

Directions:
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add pineapple juice, vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire and liquid smoke; mix well. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook for 2 minutes or until thickened. Pour the soda into a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. glass baking dish. Add 1/2 cup of the sauce; mix well. Add chops and turn to coat; cover and refrigerate overnight. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce. Remove chops, discarding marinade. Grill chops, covered, over hot coals for 10-15 minutes per side or until juices run clear or the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Heat reserved sauce and serve over chops.

Description: 
Since there's a lot of pork produced in the Midwest, I think this recipe represents our area well. My family likes to grill pork chops, and this is the recipe that they request most often. We love the sweet/sour tang of the marinade.
