Ingredients:
1 pound baby potatoes, cut into quarters
1 tablespoon avocado oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine potatoes and oil in a bowl and toss to coat. Add 1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic and 1/4 teaspoon parsley and toss to coat. Repeat with remaining garlic and parsley. Pour potatoes into the air fryer basket.
Place the basket in the air fryer and cook, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.
