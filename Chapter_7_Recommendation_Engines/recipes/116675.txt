Description: 
'We used to enjoy pizza bagel bites from the freezer section, but found they weren't filling unless we made quite a few,' writes Michel Potter from Caledonia, Michigan. 'Now we use whole bagels to prepare a heartier meal that's ready in a jiffy. It's nice that we can each add our favorite toppings.'
