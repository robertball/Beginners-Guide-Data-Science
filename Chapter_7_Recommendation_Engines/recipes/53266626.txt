Ingredients:
For the cake
Cooking spray
1 1/2 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup finely ground almonds
5 tablespoons cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 ounces beets, peeled and finely grated
4 ounces low-fat buttermilk
2 tablespoons strong black coffee
3 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
For the icing
1/2 cup dark chocolate, cut into small pieces
2 tablespoons strong black coffee
2 tablespoons honey
For the top (optional)
Organic, unsprayed rose petals

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly spray an 8-inch springform baking pan with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, ground almonds, salt and baking soda, and set aside.
Using a standing or handheld mixer set at medium speed, beat the eggs and sugar for 4 full minutes until pale and fluffy. On low speed, beat in the grated beets, followed by dry ingredients. Add the buttermilk and coffee, and beat until the batter is smooth.
Pour into the pan and place in the middle of a hot oven and bake for 30 minutes. Test with a toothpick inserted for doneness; it should come out clean. Bake for an additional 5 minutes if needed.
Cool for 10 minutes or so in the pan and unmold onto cooling rack. Cool on a wire rack until cold. 7. To make the icing, prepare a double boiler.
Combine all the ingredients and gently stir until the chocolate is smooth. Stir occasionally until the mixture thickens.
With the cake still on the wire rack, pour the icing liberally over the top of the cake and let it drip down the sides. Transfer
