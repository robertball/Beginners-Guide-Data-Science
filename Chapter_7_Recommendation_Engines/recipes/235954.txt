Ingredients:
1 pound suet
1 pound brown sugar
1 pound sultana raisins
1 pound dark raisins
1 pound dried currants
4 ounces candied mixed fruit peel
4 ounces chopped almonds
1/4 cup ground allspice

Directions:
Melt suet in a saucepan over medium-low heat; strain liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl and discard solids. Refrigerate liquid until again solid.
Grate solid suet, measure 12 ounces of grated suet into a bowl, and set aside.
Stir brown sugar, sultana raisins, dark raisins, currants, fruit peel, almonds, allspice, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl; add grated suet and stir. Fold grated apple through the mixture.
Cover bowl loosely with aluminum foil and allow it to sit at room temperature, stirring once daily, until fermented, 3 to 5 days. Refrigerate until needed.

Description: 
My Mum's recipe from Lancashire, UK. I have taken over the yearly family tradition for making mincemeat. You will want to make this early- to mid-November to allow it to ferment and the flavors to mingle in time for Christmas.
