Description: 
This is a quick, easy way to have supper ready when they get home. Because of the shorter cooking time, I sometimes put it in to cook over night. Then the family reheats it for supper the next night. Also works great as a chip dip.Modified from: Slow Cooker Nacho Chicken and Rice Wraps
