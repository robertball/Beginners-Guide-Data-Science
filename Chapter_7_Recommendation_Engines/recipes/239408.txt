Ingredients:
Herb Salt:
1/4 cup Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 clove garlic, chopped
Stuffed Pork Loin:
1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast, butterflied
1/4 cup chopped roasted pistachios
1/4 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/4 cup golden raisins
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
Ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place Diamond Crystal(R) Kosher Salt, parsley, thyme, rosemary and garlic in a food processor. Pulse several times until well blended.
Mix pistachios, dried cranberries, raisins, garlic, and 1 teaspoon of the herb salt mixture together in a bowl.
Unroll the pork roast onto a roasting pan or baking dish.  Spread the dried fruit mixture evenly over the roast, leaving a 1-inch margin around the edges.  Roll up the roast and tie with kitchen twine at two-inch intervals to hold stuffing in place.
Drizzle roast with olive oil; and sprinkle with herb salt and pepper to taste. Save any remaining herb salt for another use.*
Roast for 1 hour. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and roast until golden brown, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
Allow roast to sit for 10 minutes prior to serving.
