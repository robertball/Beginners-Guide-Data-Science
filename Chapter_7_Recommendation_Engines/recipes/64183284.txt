Jenny Pinkerton's Artichoke Roasted Tomato Baked Chicken Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
4 large skinned uncooked chicken breasts
1 tbsp. olive oil
1/4 - 1/2 c. chopped sweet onion
1-2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 jar chopped marinated [in water] artichokes
4 oz. fat free cream cheese
1/2 c. crumbled feta cheese
3-4 medium sized roasted tomatoes (easy to do in your oven)
1/2 c. white wine

Directions:
Saute' garlic and chopped onions in olive or flaxseed oil (or a mixture of the two ). Add a jar of chopped marinated artichoke hearts (drained or undrained - your preference; I use undrained since its water - read for salt content on the jar though - it really varies).
Add cream cheese, feta, roasted tomatoes and white wine.
Simmer on low for 10 minutes.
Spray baking dish with light coating of non-stick oil.
Place uncooked chicken breast in baking dish.
Cover with artichoke/tomato mixture over all
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
Depending on size of your chicken breasts this yields 4-8 servings. Re-heats well too.
For roasted tomatoes:
I mix finely chopped fresh herbs- basil & oregano & or rosemary (or use your favorite bottled dry herb mix) with a about 1 tbsp olive oil.
Slice fresh tomatoes; discarding seeds, or halve grape tomatoes (ok to leave seeds in these).
Add tomatoes to the oil mixture, stir carefully to coat.
Lay tomatoes out on parchment lined foil on cookie sheet (grape tomatoes cut side up).
Bake at 400 degrees for 25-35 minutes, or until they begin to brown.
