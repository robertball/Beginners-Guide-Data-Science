Description: 
Perfect for nut lovers & health nuts! I came up with this no-bake recipe after searching for a healthy bar for my diabetic husband. Agave nectar is the ingredient used to sweeten these bars, it's a great alternative to honey or sugar as it's low on the glycemic index, i.e. won't give spikes in glucose levels like regular sugar.
