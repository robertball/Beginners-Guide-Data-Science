Ingredients:
Pastry:
3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1/8 teaspoon marjarom
1/8 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 Tablespoon cold milk
Filling:
1 Tablespoon butter
1/4 cup thinly sliced carrots
1 Tablespoon chopped celery
1 Tablespoon frozen peas
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped onion
1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
Gravy:
1 1/2 tablespoons flour
1/8 teaspoon sage
1/4 teaspoon marjarom
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
3 Tablespoons milk
1/3 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup chopped cooked chicken

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix all pastry ingredients together. Divide the pastry in half and pat half of dough into bottom and sides of 3 cup baking dish. Cover other half of remaining crust for now. Bake crust until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.
While bottom crust is baking, melt butter in a large saucepan. Saute carrots, celery, peas and onion in butter until half cooked and starting to soften. Add mushrooms and cook until they start to soften. Reduce heat to medium.
Mix flour, sage, marjarom and pepper together. Add to vegetable mixture and stir until flour is well incorporated. Gradually add milk, then chicken stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Stir until smooth. Place chicken in the gravy mixture. Fill baked pie crust with this mixture. You may have some of the gravy left over. Save this and re-purpose it (see below in Notes). Roll out the reserved pastry between sheets of waxed papper. Carefully place on top of filled bottom crust, the crust is fragile. The edges of the top crust do not need to meet the rest of the crust. Make a slit in top crust. Bake for 30-45 minutes or until top crust is golden and gravy is bubbling. Allow to cool 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
The best way to do this is as you make vegetables for a meal, make a little extra and freeze them to make this at a later time.  I haven't tried to freeze this, I would say it is more of a have some now and then for a meal tomorrow.
