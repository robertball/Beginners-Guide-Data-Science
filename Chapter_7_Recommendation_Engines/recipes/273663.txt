Ingredients:
Marinade:
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1/2 cup rice vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
1/2 pound chicken tenders, sliced on the diagonal into thin strips
2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
1/2 cup shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced
1/2 cup shredded napa cabbage
1/2 cup julienned carrots
1/2 cup julienned red cabbage
4 scallions, green parts only, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons water
1 large egg, beaten
10 Mandarin pancakes

Directions:
Mix hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and Chinese five-spice powder together in a bowl. Add chicken strips and let marinate for 10 minutes.
Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large wok over medium-high heat. Add marinated chicken. Stir-fry until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl. Wipe out wok.
Pour remaining tablespoon sesame oil into wok over medium-high heat. Add shiitake mushrooms, napa cabbage, carrots, red cabbage, and scallions; stir-fry until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Pour in water.
Pour beaten egg into vegetable mixture; stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked chicken and stir-fry to combine.
Heat pancakes according in a microwave oven until warmed, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Divide stir-fry mixture between pancakes and fold over like a taco or wrap like a sandwich wrap. Serve.

Description: 
This is a decidedly American version of moo shu chicken, but fast to make! The Mandarin pancakes, also called moo shu shells, can be found in almost any Asian market, but feel free to use flour tortillas. Keep in mind the moo shu shells are much thinner than a typical flour tortilla, and have a different (pasta-like) taste.
