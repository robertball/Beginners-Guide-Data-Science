Ingredients:
3 eggs
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup canola oil, plus 1 Tbsp
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 cups sliced zucchini
1 cup biscuit/baking mix
1 small onion, chopped

Directions:
In a small skillet, saute the onions in 1 Tbsp oil.
In a large bowl, whisk the first seven ingredients. Stir in the zucchini, baking mix and onion. Pour into a greased 10" cast iron skillet. Bake at 350Â° for 25-35 minutes or until lightly browned.
NOTE: If you don't have a cast iron skillet, feel free to use a 9-in. deep-dish pie plate,  small baking dish (8-in. square) or a souffle dish (1-1/2 to 2 quarts). Reduce oven time as needed, baking until lightly browned and eggs have reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees. To change flavor, use basil or dill in place of the parsley. Dill packs a punch, so you need only 1 teaspoon.

Description: 
When you grow a lot of zucchini, or when your neighbors do and hand it off to you, this is a good and different way to use the excess.
