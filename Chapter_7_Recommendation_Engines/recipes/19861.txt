Ingredients:
1 pound baking potatoes
1 cup butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Peel and dice potatoes, arrange in a pan or on a sheet of tin foil. Season with salt and pepper. Place butter on top.
Put potatoes on grill or in the oven at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix around so they get all buttery and don't burn.  Cook until potatoes are soft.
