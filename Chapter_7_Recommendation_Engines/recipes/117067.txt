Ingredients:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons orange juice
1 (15 ounce) can mandarin oranges
1 tablespoon sliced green onion
1 tablespoon chopped green pepper
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
4 (4 ounce) boneless pork loin chops
2 teaspoons canola oil

Directions:
In a microwave-safe bowl, combine cornstarch and orange juice until smooth. Drain oranges, reserving juice; set oranges aside. Stir reserved juice into cornstarch mixture; add onion and green pepper. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 2-3 minutes or until thickened, stirring twice. Stir in oranges; set aside and keep warm.
In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Add pork chops, one at a time, and shake to coat. In a large nonstick skillet, cook pork in oil over medium heat until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve with orange sauce.
