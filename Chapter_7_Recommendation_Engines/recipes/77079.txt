Description: 
Living in the Caribbean is a wonderful way of life! I am always trying to come up with new recipes that combine my new culture and my roots. Although I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, southern barbecue was a big part of my youth. Coming up with unique BBQ sauces was family fun. Spice this recipe up or down according to your personal taste.
