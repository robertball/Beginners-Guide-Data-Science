Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon bread crumbs
4 eggs, separated
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/4 cup margarine
1 cup almond flour
1 cup rye flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 cup warm milk, divided
2/3 cup raisins
2 teaspoons cocoa powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt(R)) with cooking spray and coat with bread crumbs.
Combine egg yolks, confectioners' sugar, applesauce, and margarine in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in almond flour, rye flour, and baking powder slowly. Stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the milk into the batter.
Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold egg whites into the batter. Fold in raisins.
Pour most of the batter into the prepared pan, reserving 3/4 cup batter in the bowl. Add reserved 2 tablespoons milk and cocoa powder to the bowl; stir until smooth. Drizzle over the batter in the pan. Trace over the batter with a spatula to create a marbled effect.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.
