Ingredients:
Batter:
1/2 cup white sugar
2 tablespoons margarine
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
10 Italian plums, halved and pitted
Topping:
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoons margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 7x11-inch baking dish.
Beat 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons margarine together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix eggs, 1 cup flour, baking powder, and salt into creamed margarine mixture; stir in vanilla. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish. Arrange plums, skin side-down, atop batter.
Mix 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 tablespoons margarine, and cinnamon together in a bowl until crumbly; spoon over batter and plums.
Bake in the preheated oven until plums are softened, about 35 minutes.
