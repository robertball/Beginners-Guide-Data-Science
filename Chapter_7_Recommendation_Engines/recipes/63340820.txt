Description: 
My mother-in-law often makes this for family gatherings, and when I finally asked for the recipe I couldn't believe how easy it was! People always rave over this dish. Perfect for cooler weather and could even go in the crock pot. Good for using up leftover chicken, too! I always serve this with warm flour tortillas for dipping in the chili. The cilantro gives it a little mexican flair!
