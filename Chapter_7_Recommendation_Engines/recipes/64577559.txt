Ingredients:
Steak
Salt
Pepper

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 275 degrees (135 Celsius)
Give the steak a good coating of salt and pepper and stick in the temperature sensor (you do have a grill thermometer with a pokey remote sensor right?)
When oven is pre-heated, place steak in the oven on a raise rack in a pan (this is a small detail but being up on a raised rack allows the steak to cook evenly... a cooling rack is all you need)
Let the steak bake until the internal temperature reaches 135 (57 Celsius) for a perfect medium rare. This will take about an hour depending on the thickness of the steak, the temperature of the oven and the phase of the moon so make sure you watch the thermometer closely after it hit about 100 degrees because the last few degrees go fast!)
Once the steak has hit the desired temperature, take it out, pop it on a plate, cover it loosely with foil (or tightly if you like that sort of thing) and let it rest for 15 minutes
While steak is resting, get a cast-iron frying pan nice and hot on the stove or the grill (like surface of the sun hot if you can)
After the 15 minutes of rest, give the steak a sear for one minute per side (just one minute... sixty seconds... we just want a nice char, you don't have to cook it any more)
Your done. No more resting, just eating now.
Slice and enjoy!

Description: 
The best way to make a steak I have seen so far and it also works on burgers if you like big burgers. You will need a thermometer with a remote poking sensor to do this right. It's worth the $15. Trust me.
