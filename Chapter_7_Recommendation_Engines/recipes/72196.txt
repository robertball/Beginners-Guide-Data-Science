Ingredients:
5 fluid ounces sweet-and-sour cocktail mix
2 fluid ounces premium tequila
1 fluid ounce cointreau

1 lime, cut into 4 wedges

Directions:
Pour the sweet and sour mix, tequila, cointreau, and raspberry liqueur into a shaker filled with ice. Shake until the shaker is frosty on the outside. Rub the rim of a margarita glass with a lime wedge, then dip in salt. Add a few ice cubes to the glass, then strain the liquid from the shaker carefully into the glass. Garnish with a lime wedge.

Description: 
Delicious raspberry-flavored margarita. This recipe is inspired by one of the big chains that is famous for its margaritas!  You'll love this!  Be sure to use top-quality tequila and raspberry liqueur for maximum effect. I sometimes like to add a 'floater' of Chambord to top it all off.
