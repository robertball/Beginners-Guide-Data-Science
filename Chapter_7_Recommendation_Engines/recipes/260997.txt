Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or as needed
5 eggs
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
5 slices country ham
2 (17.5 ounce) cans refrigerated cinnamon roll dough with icing
5 slices sharp Cheddar cheese, or to taste
1 tablespoon orange zest, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat waffle iron and spray with cooking spray.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry eggs to your desired doneness, 3 to 6 minutes. Season with sea salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate.
Cook ham in the same skillet until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
Place 1 cinnamon roll in the waffle iron; cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough to create 10 cinnamon roll waffles.
Place 1 slice of Cheddar cheese on half of the cinnamon roll waffles; add 1 fried egg and 1 slice of ham. Cover each sandwich with another cinnamon roll waffle.
Combine the cream cheese icing from the cinnamon roll package with orange zest; mix until combined. Drizzle on top of the sandwiches.
