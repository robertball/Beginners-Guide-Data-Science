Description: 
I know everyone says their mum's meatloaf is the best and I am one of those who agree my mum's recipe is the best! This has been one of my favorites since my childhood. While I love served fresh and hot, a good next day meatloaf sandwich is always a comfort food also.  I serve with a nice mix arugula salad with cherry tomatoes, raisins, chopped walnuts and vinaigrette dressing or for a southern flare garlic smashed potatoes and fresh steamed snap green beans. Just yummy deliciousness and MUM is always right!
