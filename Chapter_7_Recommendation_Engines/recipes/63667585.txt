Ingredients:
1 package of graham crackers (9 crackers)
6 tablespoons of butter melted
4 cups miniature marshmallows
Topping:
3/4 cup chocolate chips
3/4 cup peanut butter
2 tbsp butter
1.5 cups crisp rice cereal

Directions:
1. In a food processor, process graham crackers into crumbs and add melted butter until well combined. Press mixture evenly into a 9x9 square pan lined with aluminum foil and bake at 325 for 10 minutes until it has set. Remove from oven
2. Turn the oven to broil. Sprinkle marshmallows evenly over graham cracker layer; return to oven until marshmallows have melted. (THIS HAPPENS FAST, SO WATCH CLOSELY!!!). If necessary, using a knife dipped in water, spread the melted marshmallows evenly over cake. Cool.
3. For topping, combine chocolate chips, peanut butter and butter in a small saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until melted and well blended. Remove from heat; stir in cereal. Immediately spread over bars. Chill.
**NOTE- Make sure these bars are completely chilled before cutting**
