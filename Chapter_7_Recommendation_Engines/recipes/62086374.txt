Ingredients:
Meat Filling
2 lbs lean ground beef
12 potatos
1/2 cup milk
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large onion, minced
dash of salt and pepper
Varenyky Dough
8 cups flour
4 tsp salt
4 eggs
1 cups water

Directions:
Meat Filling
1. Boil potatos until soft.
2.  Fry ground beef.  Drain beef well in a seive or colander.  Rinse off excess fat with hot water.
3. Mash cooked potatos with milk until smooth.  Add garlic, onions, salt and pepper.  Mix well.
4. Mix ground beef with potato mixture.  Set aside.
Varenyky Dough
1. Mix flour and salt in a deep bowl.  Add the eggs and water to make a medium soft dough.
2. Knead on a floured board until smooth. (Too much kneading makes the dough hard)
3.  Divide into 4 equal parts.  Cover and let stand about 10 minutes.
4. Roll dough thin on a floured board.  Cut dough into rounds (use a large-mouth cup or large cookie cutter).
5. Place a spoonful of filling into the round.  Fold to form 1/2 circles.  Press edges together.  Use water, if necessary, to seal edges closed.  Cover with a tea towel.
6.  Bring large pot of salted water to a boil.  Drop a few at a time in water for 4 minutes or until well puffed.
** The Varenyky freeze very well.  Just be sure to allow the varenyky to dry before freezing.
