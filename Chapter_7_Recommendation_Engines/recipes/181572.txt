Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 bay leaf
2 cups shredded cooked turkey
2 cups white kidney beans (cannellini), undrained
2 fresh jalapeno peppers, chopped
1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
2 tablespoons lime juice

Directions:
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, cumin, and ginger; cook for another minute. Pour in chicken broth and white wine, and then add the bay leaf. Cook uncovered until slightly reduced, about 5 to 8 minutes.
Stir in turkey, beans, and jalapeno. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Using back of spoon, mash 1/4 of beans to thicken sauce. Reduce heat to low, and begin stirring in cheese 1/2 cup at a time. Stir until cheese is completely melted. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and stir in lime juice. Serve hot.
