Description: 
When we went over to Edinburgh for Hogmanay, our friends made this for us, along with a slice of haggis! This is a traditional Scottish side dish, and goes well with a beef roast or chicken. It is also a great way to use an often overlooked vegetable: the swede (aka the yellow turnip, the rutabaga, or the Swedish turnip).
