Ingredients:
DRY INGREDIENTS
1 C. rice flour
2/3 C. buckwheat flour
1 t cinnamon
1 t baking soda
1 1/2 t baking powder
3/4 C. white sugar
1/2 C. brown sugar
WET INGREDIENTS
3 Large eggs
1 t gluten free vanilla
1/4 C. melted butter
1/3 to 1/2 C. fruit juice
TOPPING
2 diced pears
1 diced granny smith apple
2 T butter
1 t cinnamon

Directions:
Butter a 9X12 pan, set aside. Heat oven to 350.
In a saucepan mix diced fruit, butter, and cinnamon. Heat on medium to sizzling, cover, reduce heat and let simmer until soft but not mushy (around 5 minutes).
Mix all of the dry ingredients in a medium sized mixing bowl. Mix eggs with a fork in a small dish until scrambled, add to dry ingredients along with all other wet ingredients. Stir well. Pour into buttered pan.
NOTE: a pinch of ginger would give this cake a nice kick. The more juice you use, the further the fruit will sink into the cake. Using 1/3 cup left some fruit on top. Add juice until it's cake batter consistency and more fruit will sink into batter as it's baking.
Spoon fruit mixture evenly onto cake batter, covering the entire surface. Pour pan juices on batter.
Put in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Turn off oven and let the cake sit for 10 minutes without opening oven door.
Remove from oven, slice and serve while still warm.
Serve with fresh whipped cream or gluten free ice cream.

After making a simple pear dessert with fresh pears and a boxed cake mix for my husband's birthday, I decided to make something I could eat and it had to be from scratch. This recipe is my first attempt.
