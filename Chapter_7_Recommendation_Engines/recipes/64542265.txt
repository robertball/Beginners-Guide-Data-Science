Ingredients:
For the donuts:
3/4 cup pumpkin puree
1 cup brown rice flour
3/4 cup coconut flour
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1/3 cup coconut oil
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp all spice
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/2 cup Truvia brown sugar baking blend
1 large egg white room temperature
1/2 tsp sea salt
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp baking powder
For the glaze
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup powdered sugar or icing sugar
cinnamon for sprinkling

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 F degrees
Spray a donut pan with nonstick cooking oil
In a small bowl, combine pumpkin puree, egg white, coconut oil, vanilla extract & milk
Be sure egg white is room temperature, if it is too cold it will harden coconut oil
In a separate bowl combine flour, salt & spices
Gradually fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients to combine
Fill donut cavities with batter to the top of cavity
You will need to press the dough into the cavity a bit & smooth with you fingers
Coconut flour will bake the way you place it so be sure it is level & even
Bake donuts 13-15 minutes
Remove donuts from oven, plan pan upside down on a baking rack so the donut will fall out right side up
While the remaining batch is cooking, combine the ingredients for the glaze in a bowl
Dip each donut into glaze & place on baking rack to harden
Sprinkle the donuts with a pinch of cinnamon each
Store in the refrigerator up to one week
