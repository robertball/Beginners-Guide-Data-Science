Ingredients:
3/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk
8 miniature chocolate covered peanut butter cups, unwrapped
1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Whisk sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves together in a small bowl. Beat eggs together in a large bowl; stir in pumpkin and sugar mixture until just combined. Slowly pour evaporated milk into pumpkin mixture and stir until combined.
Arrange peanut butter cups, up-side down, into the graham cracker crust. Pour pumpkin mixture over peanut butter cups in pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until a knife inserted in the center of the pie comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, about 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate.

Description: 
My husband and I came up with this recipe the other night since we were having a pumpkin carving party (making the pie for guests) and we also had our Halloween candy out. The pie was a big success. Our daughter's name is Teresa and we nickname her Resa (hence the name of the recipe)
