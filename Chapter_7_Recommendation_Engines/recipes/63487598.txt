Ingredients:
2 (12 ounce) cans whole kernel corn
3 cups vegetable broth
3 potatoes, diced
1 large onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 red chile peppers, minced
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
black pepper to taste
1 3/4 cups soy milk
1/4 cup margarine
1 lime, juiced

Directions:
Place the corn, vegetable broth, potatoes, onion, garlic, red chile peppers, chili powder, salt, parsley, and black pepper in a slow cooker; cover. Cook on Low for 7 hours.
Pour the vegetable mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the mixture in the cooking pot. Once everything has been pureed, return it to the slow cooker. Stir the soy milk and margarine to the mixture; cook on Low for 1 hour more. Add the lime juice to serve.
