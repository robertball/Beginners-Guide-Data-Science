Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1/2 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup finely chopped carrots
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, undrained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil
sea salt and ground white pepper to taste
4 cups water
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup dry polenta
2 cups grated Fontina cheese
aluminum foil

Directions:
Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and carrots and cook until onions are translucent and carrots are just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Add tomatoes and juices, breaking up tomatoes with a spoon. Add parsley and oregano; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until sauce is reduced to 3 cups, about 15 minutes. Mix in fresh basil and season with sea salt and pepper.
While sauce is reducing, combine water and 1 teaspoon sea salt in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Slowly whisk in polenta. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until polenta is thick and cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Spread 1/3 of the tomato sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the polenta over the sauce and sprinkle with 1/2 of the Fontina cheese. Layer with 1/2 of the remaining sauce, the remaining polenta, the remaining cheese, and the rest of the sauce. Cover with aluminum foil and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 25 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
