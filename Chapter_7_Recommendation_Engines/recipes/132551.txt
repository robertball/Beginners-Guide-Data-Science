Ingredients:
8 slices bacon
1 cup quick-cooking hominy grits
4 cups water
1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese, cubed
2/3 cup milk
3 eggs, beaten
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels, reserving 3 tablespoons of the drippings.
Bring the water to a boil and stir in the grits. Cook and stir over medium heat until thick, about 5 minutes. Crumble in about half of the bacon and stir in bacon drippings, processed cheese, milk and eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish and sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and grits are set, about 40 minutes.
