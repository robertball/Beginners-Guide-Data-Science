Ingredients:
2 teaspoons instant coffee granules
2 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur
1 cup butter, softened
3/4 C Splenda packed brown sugar
1 C Splenda granulated sugar
2 eggs
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee crystals into the coffee liqueur; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter, Splenda brown sugar, and Splenda granulated white sugar. Gradually add eggs and coffee mixture while mixing. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto a cookie sheet. Cookies should be at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes. Immediately transfer cookies to cooling rack after baking. These keep well at room temperature or refrigerated.
