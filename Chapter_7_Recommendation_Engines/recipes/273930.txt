Ingredients:
1/4 cup maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
1 pound thick-cut bacon

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Combine maple syrup and chipotle powder in a small bowl.
Place a disposable aluminum pan on the upper rack of your grill or over one burner on indirect heat.
Place bacon strips directly on the hot grate and reduce heat to low. Grill bacon, turning frequently, until evenly browned and crisped to your liking, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer cooked bacon to the prepared pan to keep warm.
Return all cooked strips to grill and brush with maple-chipotle glaze on both sides and cook for 1 minute more. Serve immediately.

Description: 
If you've never grilled bacon before, you'll be amazed by the flavor! Not only does it save cleaning up a mess on the stove, the charred flavor is out of this world! Add to that the sweet-heat kick of maple and chipotle and you've got yourself quite the breakfast treat. You may just want to double the recipe! Using a leaner, thick-cut bacon will reduce chances of flare-ups.
