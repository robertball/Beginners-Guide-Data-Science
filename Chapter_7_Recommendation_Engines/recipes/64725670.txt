Ingredients:
1 medium head cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets (about 6 cups)
1/2 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 large egg
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
Marinara sauce, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425Â°. Process cauliflower in batches in a food processor until finely ground. Microwave, covered, in a microwave-safe bowl on high until tender, about 8 minutes. When cauliflower is cool enough to handle, wrap in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze dry. Return to bowl.
Meanwhile, in another bowl, mix cheeses together. Stir half of cheese mixture into cauliflower, reserving remainder. Combine next six ingredients; stir into cauliflower.
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, shape cauliflower mixture into an 11x9-in. rectangle. Bake until edges are golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Top with reserved cheese; bake until melted and bubbly, 10-12 minutes. Cut into 12 breadsticks. If desired, serve with marinara sauce.

Description: 
These grain-free breadsticks are made with cauliflower instead of flour. Serve with your favorite marinara sauce.   As long as you line your pan with parchment paper, these breadsticks can be made in any shape you like. A round pizza pan works nicely as well.  Customize to your heart's desire by adding toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms and olives before baking
