Ingredients:
1 medium onion, chopped
4 jalapenos sliced, I leave in seeds
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 stick of butter
2 cups chicken broth
1 can cream of chicken
4 (15.5 ounce) cans great northern beans, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon cumin seed
1 teaspoon marjoram flakes
1 teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups cubed, cooked chicken
Monterey Jack cheese, Pepper Jack or Habanero for topping

Directions:
In a large skillet cook chicken in 1 stick melted butter, season with cayenne, cumin seed, marjoram, pepper.  Once chicken is cooked through add garlic, onion, jalapeno, cream of chicken, broth and beans (undrained.)  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  When onions are translucent and jalapenos are soft it is ready to serve.  This can also be prepared and transferred to a crockpot and cooked on low for a few hours until you are ready to serve.
I add Monterey Jack for the kids and Habanero for my bowl.  This is good served with tortilla chips.

Description: 
I had this chili at a restaurant 15 years ago and over the years I have tweaked it until I made it my own.  You can make it kid friendly by leaving out the onions and jalapenos.  We like Spicy so I load it up!!!Modified from: White Chili with Chicken
