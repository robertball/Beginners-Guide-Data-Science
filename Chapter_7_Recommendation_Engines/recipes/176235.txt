Ingredients:
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry sherry
6 boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon crumbled dried red chile pepper
4 green onions, chopped
1 teaspoon hot bean sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 teaspoon sesame oil

Directions:
Stir together the honey, peppercorns, salt, soy sauce, and sherry in a large bowl; add the chicken and toss to coat.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add the ginger, garlic, red chile pepper, and green onions; cook and stir until fragrant, no more than 30 seconds. Stir in the chicken and soy sauce mixture; fry another 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover. Simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes.
Whisk together the bean sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil in a small bowl; pour over the chicken and stir. Turn heat to high and allow to cook 1 minute. Serve immediately.
