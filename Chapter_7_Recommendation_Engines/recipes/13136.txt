Ingredients:
1 pound honeycomb tripe
5 slices bacon, diced
1/2 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
3 leeks, chopped
1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
2 green bell peppers, diced
2 quarts beef stock
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 large potato, peeled and diced
2 large carrots, diced
4 tablespoons margarine
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Directions:
Place the tripe or other meat that you have selected to use in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and  turn off the heat.  Allow the meat  to cool a bit in the water, and then drain and rinse. Cut into 1/4 inch pieces.
In a large heavy kettle, saute the bacon until clear.  Add the onion, celery, leeks, parsley, and green peppers; saute until tender.
Stir in beef stock, thyme, marjoram, cloves, red pepper flakes, bay leaf, and black pepper.  Bring the  kettle to a boil, and turn down to a simmer.  Cook, covered, until meat  is very tender, about 2 hours.
Add the diced potato and carrots, and cook for an additional 20 minutes.
Prepare the roux by stirring the flour into the melted butter or margarine, and cooking for a moment on the stove.  When the soup is done to your liking, stir in the roux.   Simmer, stirring all the while, until the soup  thickens a bit. Correct the seasonings.

Description: 
The authentic version uses tripe.  I have never cared for tripe, myself, and I have always substituted chicken, beef, turkey, sausage or even ham instead.
