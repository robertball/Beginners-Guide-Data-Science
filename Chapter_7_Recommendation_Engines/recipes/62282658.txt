Ingredients:
1 sugar cube
2 1/2 ounces rye whisky
2 dashes Peychaud's bitters
1 dash Angostura bitters
Absinthe rinse
lemon peel

Directions:
In an Old-Fashioned glass (not a mixing glass; it's part of the ritual), muddle a sugar cube with a few drops of water.
Add several small ice cubes and the rye whiskey, the Peychaud's bitters, and the Angostura bitters.
Stir well and strain into a second, chilled, Old-Fashioned glass in which you have rolled around a few drops of absinthe until its inside is thoroughly coated, pouring off the excess.
Garnish with a twist of lemon peel.
