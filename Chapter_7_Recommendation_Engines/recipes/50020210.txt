2 pkgs active dry yeast
1 cup very warm water
1 tsp sugar
2 cups evaporated milk
2/3 cup melted butter

In a small bowl, combine yeast, water and sugar. Set aside to proof.  In a large bowl, combine milk, melted butter, sugar and salt.  Whisk in beaten eggs and yeast.

Place in a well greased bowl, turning over to ensure dough ball is completely greased. Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator overnight.  In the morning remove the dough, punch down and set in a warm place for a second rise-this may take 2-3 hours.  When ready to make rolls, grease cookie sheet and your hands, punch down dough and pinch off balls of dough about the size of a plum. Firmly roll the ball between your hands. place 1 inch apart- will make 24 generously sized rolls, or if preferred, will make 3 loaves of bread.  Cover with tea towel and let rise til doubled, about an hour. Preheat oven to 425 and bake for 15-20 minutes.  Remove from oven and for soft tops, brush rolls with melted butter. If making loaves, bake for 40 mins or until top of loaves are brown and sounds hollow when tapped
