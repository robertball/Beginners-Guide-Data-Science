Ingredients:
6 cups chicken broth, preferably homemade
3 Yukon potatoes, diced
1 pound smoked Polish Sausage, sliced

1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup flour
3 cups milk
1 cup of shredded Gouda cheese
Salt and Pepper, to taste
1/2 cup fresh Parsley, minced

Directions:
In a large soup pot, pour chicken broth and add the potatoes. Bring to a boil and then simmer potatoes till soft.
Add the Polish sausage and sauerkraut to the potatoes and continue to simmer.
In a separate saucepan, melt the butter. Cook the diced onion in the butter till translucent. Sprinkle the flour over the top of the butter and onions. Stir and cook to a very light colored roux. Add the cold milk to the hot roux stirring constantly. When combined, add the milk mixture to the soup pot over a medium heat. Lower the flame after the soup comes to a constant bubble.
