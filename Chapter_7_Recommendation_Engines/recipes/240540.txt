Ingredients:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
2 1/3 cups white sugar, divided
3 eggs, divided
3/4 cup water
2/3 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup butter
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (11 ounce) package butterscotch chips (Nestle® Toll House®)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10x13-inch baking dish.
Beat cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 egg together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth.
Mix water, cocoa powder, and butter together in a saucepan; heat over medium-low heat until melted, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, remaining 2 cups sugar, 2 eggs, sour cream, baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. Beat chocolate mixture into flour mixture until batter is smooth; spread into the prepared baking dish. Spoon cream mixture over batter and run a knife through the cream cheese mixture to spread into a marbled pattern. Sprinkle butterscotch chips over top.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 35 minutes.
