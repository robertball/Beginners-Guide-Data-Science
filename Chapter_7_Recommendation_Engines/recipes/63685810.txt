Ingredients:
3 cups cooked shredded chicken
2 cups cooked and chopped broccoli
2 cans cream chicken soup
1/2 cup sour cream
pepper
2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups bread crumbs
1/2 stick butter, melted

Directions:
Combine chicken, broccoli, cream soup, sour cream and pepper (to taste) in a bowl. Add in 1 cup cheddar cheese. Pour into a 2 qt baking dish. Top with remaining cheese. In a bowl combine butter and and bread crumbs. Sprinkle over casserole. Bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes, until bubbly and cheese is melted.
** I typically serve this over rice, but is just as great by it's self. Last time I didn't make rice, but served it with this bread.

Description: 
Super comfort food, but kinda healthy because it has broccoli in it, right? My grandmother passed this recipe down and it is a family favorite. After the first time I made it, I went on a casserole kick and made it twice a week for 3 months straight!
