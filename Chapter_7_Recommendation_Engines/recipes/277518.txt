Ingredients:
Scones:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
5 1/2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons heavy cream
Glaze:
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
2 teaspoons orange juice
3 drops orange extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a heavy baking sheet with parchment paper.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir in grated orange zest. Cut in cold butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until butter is the size of small peas. Mix in cranberries and walnuts.
Mix 1/2 cup cream and egg in a small bowl until well combined. Add to the flour mixture and stir with a spoon or by hand until just combined and dough comes together. Divide dough in half and form into two 3/4-inch thick circles. Cut each circle in half, and cut each half into 3 triangular-shaped scones. Place scones on the prepared baking sheet and brush with remaining 2 tablespoons heavy cream.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown slightly, 13 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix confectioners' sugar, orange juice, and orange extract together in a small bowl until completely combined. Drizzle glaze over scones and serve warm.

Description: 
The cranberry, orange, and walnut combination is perfect for Christmas morning. These scones can be made ahead but should be warmed in the oven to maintain the shortbread-like texture. Serve with tea or mulled cider.
