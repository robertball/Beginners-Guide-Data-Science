Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 (8 ounce) cans refrigerated crescent rolls

Directions:
In a skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.  Remove from the heat.  Add tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and oregano; mix well.  Separate crescent dough into eight rectangles, pinching seams together.  Place about 3 tablespoons of meat mixture along one long side of each rectangle.  Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side.  Cut each roll into three pieces.  Place, seam side down, 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes or until golden brown.
