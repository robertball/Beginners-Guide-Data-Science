Ingredients:
1 (49 1/2 oz) can chicken broth
32 oz. fresh or frozen broccoli

Directions:
Simmer the broth and broccoli in a large pan until the broccoli is tender. Using a blender with the top slightly ajar, and working in batches, puree the broccoli, cream cheese, and enough broth to liquify. Return all the puree to the remaining broth, stir well and heat through. Ladle into bowls or mugs and enjoy! Salt and pepper to taste.
