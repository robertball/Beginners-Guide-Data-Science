Ingredients:
3 pounds turban squash
salt to taste
1 pound bulk pork sausage
1 cup chopped celery
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, slightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease foil.
Cut the top off the squash using a serrated knife and scoop out seeds. Lightly salt the inside of squash. Place squash, cut-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour.
Cook and stir sausage, celery, mushrooms, and onion in a skillet over medium heat until sausage is browned and vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes; drain excess grease.
Combine sour cream, Parmesan cheese, egg, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Stir sausage mixture into sour cream mixture.
Scoop the meat from the inside of squash, being careful not to tear the skin. Mash squash meat in a bowl.
Spoon some of the sausage mixture into the hollowed squash, making a ring. Spoon a ring of mashed squash over sausage mixture. Continue layering until all the sausage mixture and mashed squash are used.
Bake in the oven until heated through, 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Turban squash is a winter squash that looks like a pumpkin wearing a striped green turban. The texture is similar to pumpkin and butternut squash. This recipe has been a long time favorite at Thanksgiving with my family.
