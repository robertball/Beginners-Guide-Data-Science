Description: 
I CREATED this recipe when my children were small and fussed about eating fruits and vegetables. The slightly sweet dressing makes it a hit.     This salad was part of our Friday meal when I served fried fish and boiled potatoes. My grown children call this 'Mom's Salad'. -M.J. Zimmerman, Altoona, Pennsylvania
