Ingredients:
Filling
3/4 cup Baker's Cinnamon Filling
3 tablespoons water
2 medium bananas
2/3 cup diced dried pineapple

Directions:
4) Pat and roll the dough into a rectangle about 18" x 14".
5) Make the cinnamon filling: Mix the Baker's Cinnamon Filling and water to make a smooth paste.
6) Looking at the dough horizontally (so it's 18" long), spread half the filling down the center third of the dough
7) Slice each banana into about 12 rounds. Space the slices atop the filling.
8) Fold one of the end pieces into the center to cover the bananas and filling.
9) Spread the remaining filling atop the piece of dough you've just folded into the center, and distribute the dried pineapple evenly atop the filling.
10) Fold the other side of the dough over the filling to cover it. Pull the long side seam underneath, and tuck each end underneath, too. You should have a long, flat log with no filling showing.
