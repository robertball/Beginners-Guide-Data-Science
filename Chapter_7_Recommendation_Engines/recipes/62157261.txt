Ingredients:
1 C Butter or margarine
1/2 c light corn syrup
1/2 t. salt
1/2 t. baking soda
1 t. vanilla
1/2 C popcorn kernels
3 of the following, choose your favorites:
4 c. EACH pretzels, Corn Chex, Fritos, Bugles, Salted Peanuts or Mixed nuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
Pop the popcorn and sort out unpopped kernels. I pop into a large bowl then scoop up the popped corn leaving the unpopped kernels behind.
Place the popped corn into a large greased roaster pan.
Add three of your favorite snack items into the popcorn.
Melt butter in a 3 qt heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add sugar, corn syrup, and salt.
Bring to a boil stirring constantly.
Once boiling stop stirring and boil for four minutes without stirring- this is difficult, but it will change the consistency of the caramel if you stir it.
After four minutes remove from heat, and add baking soda and vanilla. The mixture will boil vigorously and change for being clear to very cloudy- this is normal and helps evenly distribute the caramel when stirring. Mix well.
Pour over popcorn mixture and stir well to evenly distribute the candy mixture.
Bake at 200 degrees for one hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
Cool completely before transferring into an airtight container.
