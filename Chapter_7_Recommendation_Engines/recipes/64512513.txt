Ingredients:
2 slices bacon, cut in squares
2 lbs. sirloin tip, or round stead, cubed
1/4 cup flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. seasoning salt
1/4 tsp. dried marjoram
1/4 tsp. dried thyme
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
1 beef bouillon cube, crushed
1 cup burgundy wine
1/4 lb. fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 tbsp. cornstarch
2 tbsp. cold water
1 1/2 cups tomato sauce

Directions:
Cook bacon in skillet until crisp and browned.  Remove bacon, reserve drippings.
Coat beef with flour and brown on all sides in bacon drippings.   (Don't crowd the skillet so the beef browns rather than steams)
Combine steak, bacon drippings, bacon, seasonings and herbs, garlic, bouillon, and wine in slow cooker.
Cover.  Cook on low 4 hours, or until beef is just tender.
Stir in mushrooms and tomato sauce.
Dissolve cornstarch in water in a small bowl.  Stir into slow cooker--if sauce is not as thick as you wish.
Cover.  Cook on high 15 minutes, until sauce thickens.
