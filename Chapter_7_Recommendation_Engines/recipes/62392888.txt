Ingredients:
3 racks of baby back ribs
lemonade, limeade or Margarita Mix
dash of liquid smoke
2 cups pepper sauce (such as Frank's Red Hot)
1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup honey or corn syrup
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Remove the membrane from the ribs if desired and place them in an 18-quart turkey roaster.  Cover the ribs with lemonade, limeade or Margarita Mix and add a dash of liquid smoke.
Cook in roaster on 300 degrees for 4-6 hours.  The longer the ribs cook the more tender they will be.
While ribs are cooking, prepare sauce by combining pepper sauce, brown sugar, honey or corn syrup and butter in a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil over medium heat and allow to boil for 5 minutes.  Reduce heat and simmer.  The longer the sauce simmers that thicker it will be.
Once ribs are cooked to the desired doneness, heat grill to medium heat and transfer ribs to the grill.  Baste the ribs with the sauce while turning them two or three times.  Since the ribs are fully cooked they do not need to spend a lot of time on the grill but this will give the sauce a chance to caramelize and will give the ribs a grilled flavor.

Description: 
These ribs are really easy to make and extremely good to eat.  The slow cooking makes them fall off the bone and the grilling at the end gives them that slight char flavor. I get requests all the time to make these ribs for people after they have had them once.
