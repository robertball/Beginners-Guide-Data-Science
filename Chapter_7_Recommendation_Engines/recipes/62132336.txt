Ingredients:
2 Tablespoons of oil
1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinagar
1 Tbsp Soy sauce
1 tsp honey
1/4 c dry red wine
5 large crushed garlic cloves
1/2 tsp thyme and basil
1 1/2 pounds London Broil

Directions:
Mince and mash garlic to a paste with salt and in a blender blend with remaining marinade ingredients. In a sealable bag combine meat with marinade. Seal, pressing out excess air and put in shallow baking dish. Marinate steak chilled, turning occasionally, at least 4 hours and up to 24.
Bring steak to room temperature. About 1 hour. Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip off and grill or broil on oiled rack 9 minutes on each side for medium rare. Transfer sterak to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Holding knife at a 45 degree angle, cut sterak across grain into thin slices. IF you have leftovers, think about French Dip for the next day!
