Ingredients:
4 slices bacon
4 cups cauliflower florets
3 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/3 cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into small pieces.
Combine cauliflower, heavy cream, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and garlic powder in a pot; bring to a boil. Cook until cauliflower is soft, 18 to 20 minutes.
Transfer cauliflower mixture carefully to a food processor. Add crumbled bacon and smoked Gouda cheese; blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
