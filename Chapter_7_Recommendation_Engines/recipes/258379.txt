Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked white rice
1 large yellow onion, halved
4 large carrots, peeled
1/2 cup vegetable oil
4 chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1/2 cup dried cherries
2 tablespoons ground cumin
2 tablespoons ground coriander
1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups water

Directions:
Place rice in a bowl; cover with warm water.
Slice onion in a food processor fitted with the slicing disk. Transfer to a bowl. Slice carrots using the same blade.
Heat oil in a 12-inch saucepan over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add carrots; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes.
Stir dried cherries, cumin, coriander, garlic, and salt into the saucepan. Press down with a spatula to flatten chicken mixture into an even layer in the bottom of the saucepan.
Drain rice and place over chicken mixture in an even layer. Pour in 3 cups water. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until water is absorbed and rice is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir.
