Ingredients:
20 Coconut macaroons about 10 oz.
1/4 c. toasted slice almonds
1/2 tsp. almond extract
2 tbls melted butter
1 can of Solo Almond Cake and Pastry Filling
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
1 1/2 cups bitterseet chocolate chips
4 tbls. melted butter
1 tsp. almond extract
optional- chocolate frosting or ganache for decorations

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees.  In food processor pulse the macaroons and almonds to fine crumbs.  Add the 2 tbls of melted butter and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  Process until blended.
Press mixture into a removable bottom torte pan.(I have used a regular torte-tart pan as well, it's just easier to take our with a removable bottom.) Press firmly into the edges.  Bake 20 mins. Cool completely.  Once cooled, spread 1/2 can of the almond Pastry filling on the macaroon crust.  Save the rest for the top of the cake.
Boil the heavy cream in the microwave for about 4 minutes.  It must be at boiling stage to melt the chips. Pour cream onto the chocolate chips, add the melted butter and almond extract.  Mix until smooth.  Pour mixture onto the crust.  Chill for about 4 hours.  Once cool spread the rest of the Almond pastry filling on the chocolate filling.  Decorate.

Description: 
When we have a school party for the staff, this is the first dessert that is gone.  I have a friend who waits for me to bring it to school.  It is fairly easy to make.  You don't have to be an expert.
