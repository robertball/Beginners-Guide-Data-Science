Ingredients:
1/2 cup cooked quinoa (see note below for cooking instructions)
1 leaf of kale, hard stems removed, chopped & massaged.
4 cherry tomatoes, sliced in thirds
1 tablespoon diced cucumber
1 tablespoon diced red onion
1 Tablespoon diced bell pepper
1/4 avocado, sliced
1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese
Balsamic Dijon Dressing:
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/4 teaspoon lime juice
Salt & Pepper to taste

Directions:
In a small bowl whisk together the ingredients for the dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
In serving bowl, add cooked quinoa. Then layer with kale (I massage my kale before adding it into the bowl), cucumbers, onion, peppers, tomatoes & avocado.
Drizzle dressing over top. Finish with crumbled goat cheese. Enjoy!
To make quinoa:
Bring 2 cups of chicken broth (or water) to a boil. Add 1 cup of uncooked rinsed quinoa. Simmer for 15 minutes.  This will make enough for 4 servings.
Store extra quinoa in airtight container in the refrigerator to use throughout the week.

Description: 
I love quinoa and my husband loves rice bowls so, I decided to combine the two. I really do not have a recipe but instead I use whatever I have in the fridge. This is so versatile, feel free to add leftover roasted chicken, bacon bits, steak or even roasted vegetables. Generally, I do not measure any of the ingredients so do not hold true to my measurements below.
