Ingredients:
Speculaas Spice Mix:
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice
1/8 pinch ground nutmeg
1/8 pinch ground mace
1/8 pinch ground allspice
1/8 pinch ground cloves
1/8 pinch ground ginger
Almond Paste:
5 ounces blanched almonds
3/4 cup white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
Speculaas Dough:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup butter
2 tablespoons milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
Topping:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 tablespoon water
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup slivered almonds, or to taste

Directions:
Mix cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, mace, allspice, cloves, and ginger together in a bowl to make speculaas spice mix.
Pulse almonds in a food processor until finely ground. Add 3/4 cup white sugar, egg, 1 teaspoon almond extract, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest. Pulse until mixture forms a ball.
Combine speculaas spice mix, flour, brown sugar, orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until dough resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk, vanilla extract, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract; mix until dough forms a smooth ball.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.
Divide dough into 2 pieces. Roll out into circles on a lightly floured work surface. Press 1 circle over the bottom and 1 inch up the sides of the lined pan. Spread almond mixture on top. Cover with second circle and seal edges over filling.
Mix 2 tablespoons white sugar, water, and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract in a small bowl to make a thick paste. Brush paste over top of the dough. Arrange slivered almonds in a decorative pattern on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool before removing the outer ring of the springform pan, about 30 minutes.
