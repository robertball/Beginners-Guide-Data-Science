Ingredients:
6 tilapia fillets, thawed
1lb package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
3/4 tsp of nutmeg
salt and pepper
paprika
2-T butter
3-T white onion, minced
2/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup Half and Half cream
1/2 t garlic powder
1/8 t cayenne pepper
1/4 cup Panko bread crumbs
salt & pepper

Directions:
Season tilapia with salt, pepper and paprika, set aside.
Defrost spinach and drain.  Place butter in a large skillet; saute the onion until soft.  Add the spinach and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and nutmeg.  Cook until the  spinach is hot.  Turn down heat to low and stir in 1/3 cup of the cheese and cream and stir until blended.
Spoon the spinach in an oiled baking dish that fits all the fish (I use an oval dish that's 8X12).  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top and place the tilapia fillets on top, slightly overlap the fish so that a thick edge covers a thin edge.  This will help even cooking.
Melt 2-T butter in a small pan; add the bread crumbs and cook stirring occasionally until light brown then sprinkle evenly over the fish.  Lightly sprinkle the top with Paprika.
Bake at 425 degrees for 20 minutes or until fish is done.

Description: 
This dish is a favorite of my husbands; there's a delicious layer of creamy spinach on the bottom that's covered with mild flavored tilapia and crunchy bread crumbs give it a nice texture and color.
