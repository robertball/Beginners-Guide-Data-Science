Ingredients:
•12 ounces short pasta (like campanelle or fusilli)
•3 sausages
•1/2 cup grated cheese (like aged cheddar or Gruyere)
•1 teaspoon fennel seeds
•1 tablespoon finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
•4 - 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
•Salt
•Pepper

Directions:
1.Boil a large pot of water for the pasta. When the water boils, liberally salt water, then add the pasta. Cook until al dente, according to package directions. Remove pasta from water, reserving water for later use.
2.Meanwhile, prepare the sausages. Poke holes in the sausages with the tip of a knife. Grill on a griddle until all sides are brown. Once cooked, chop into small pieces.
3.Transfer chopped sausages to a large bowl. Add sun-dried tomatoes, fennel seeds and cooked pasta. Mix together. If the pasta seems dry, ladle in a small amount of pasta water.
4.Drizzle pasta with extra-virgin olive oil until the pasta is coated well. Mix in the cheese. Season with salt and pepper, if needed.
