Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups mashed bananas (4 to 5 medium)
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup melted butter
1/4 cup creamy peanut butter
1/4 cup chopped peanuts
1/3 cup jam
For the streusel topping:
3 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped peanuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9x5 loaf pan with baking spray. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Make a well in the center and set aside.
In a separate mixing bowl, beat together eggs, mashed bananas, sugar, butter, and peanut butter. Add egg mixture all at once to the flour mixture and stir until all the flour is just moistened; it should be lumpy. Fold in chopped peanuts.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Drizzle with the jam and swirl slightly to marble.
To make the streusel topping, stir together brown sugar and flour. Use a pastry blender to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in peanuts. Sprinkle this over the bread.
Bake about 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If it starts to get too dark, tent with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking.
Cool in pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes; remove from pan and let cool completely.
