Description: 
'This pretty pie can be whipped up in no time. But it tastes so sweet and creamy people will think you fussed,' assures Sue Blow of Lititz, Pennsylvania. 'My family likes it best when it's made with orange sherbet. It's especially refreshing on a warm summer day.'Modified from: Frosty Freezer Pie
