Ingredients:
6 ounces raw lean filet beefsteak
2 hot dog buns
2 slices American cheese
Sliced onions
Peppers (optional)

Directions:
Slice your filet into thin strips.
Cook onions (and peppers) over medium-high heat in a pan spritzed with nonstick spray for about 5 minutes, until onions are slightly browned. Remove and set aside.
Spritz a little more nonstick spray into the pan and cook filet strips over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, flipping them halfway through cooking.
Place cheese on top of meat (still in the pan) and continue to cook until cheese is slightly melted.
Meanwhile, war or toast you bun. Place meat and cheese in the bun and then top with veggies.
Wrap in foil just like you got it in Philadelphia! Serve with sweet potato fries! Enjoy!
