Ingredients:
1 cup of butter(two sticks) thawed
1 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white granulated sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 and a 1/2 cups flower
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda

12 oz bag of semi sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven at 375 degrees. Mix butter and sugars until pasty. Add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Mix evenly. Sift and add in flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix until the batter is thick and clump free. Gradually add in the oatmeal(1 cup at a time) and stir the batter until the oatmeal is evenly mixed. Lastly add the bag of chocolate chips and stir until the entire batter is evenly mixed. Line your cookie sheet with parchment paper(easy clean up and non-stick). Scoop the cookie dough into tablespoon sizes onto the cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart. Bake for 9-10 minutes at 375 degrees. Let cool before removing them from the parchment paper.
