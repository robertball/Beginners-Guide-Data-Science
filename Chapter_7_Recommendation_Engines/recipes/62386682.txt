Ingredients:
Dressing:
3 Tbs Vegetable or Canola Oil (any light oil)
1 Tbs white sesame seeds (optional)
2 Tbs Dark Sesame Oil
2 Tbs miso paste (I prefer yellow or white for this purpose)
1 tsp fresh minced ginger (fresh- not bottled)
grated orange or tangerine rind (pinch)
1 Tbs sugar
2 Tbs orange juice
1 Tbs rice vinegar
1/4 tsp salt
water to thin
Salad:
1/2 large head of romaine, torn, not cut*
1 seedless cucumber or pickling cucumber thinly sliced
1 carrot thinly shaved or 1/2 cup of pre-packaged grated carrot.

Directions:
Toast (saute) sesame seeds on low heat in vegetable oil until lightly browned.
Remove oil and seeds immediately from the heat and place in mixing bowl.
Add sesame oil to mix.
When cooled, add remaining ingredients.
Thin with water until the consistency is enough to coat lettuce, but not too thin that it runs off of it.
Tear lettuce into serving bowls and top with very thinly sliced cucumbers and shaved carrots.
Dress each serving with 2-3 Tbs dressing.

Description: 
I created this recipe for a cafe in Massachusetts years ago as a summery first course dish to be followed by an equally summery entree.  This light savory Japanese salad with tangy-sweet dressing perfect to start any Japanese-influenced meal.
