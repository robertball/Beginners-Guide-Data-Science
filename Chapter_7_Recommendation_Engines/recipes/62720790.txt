Ingredients:
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup cornmeal
1 tablespoon salt
1/3 cup bacon grease
1 egg
1 cup water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.
In a large bowl, stir together the whole wheat flour, cornmeal and salt. Mix in the oil, egg and water to make a soft dough that is not too sticky. You may add more flour if needed. Roll teaspoonfuls of dough into balls, and place on the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten slightly.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until nicely browned and firm. Cool completely, then store in an airtight container.
