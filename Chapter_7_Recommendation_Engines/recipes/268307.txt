Ingredients:
4 (5 ounce) mild white fish fillets
1 lemon, juiced
salt to taste
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
4 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)

Directions:
Wash fish fillets under running cold water and dry with a paper towel. Drizzle with lemon juice and season with salt on both sides.
Combine flour and Chinese five-spice powder in a shallow bowl. Dip fish fillets into the flour mixture so they are covered on both sides.
Heat canola and sesame oils in a large skillet over medium heat. Add fish to hot oil and pan-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes more.
