Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 pounds beef oxtail, cut into pieces
2 onions, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 green bell pepper, chopped
4 cups dry white wine
1 cup beef broth
1 (1 ounce) square unsweetened chocolate
3 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons paprika
2 carrots, thickly sliced

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until smoking. Brown the oxtail in batches, and set aside. Add onion, garlic, and bell pepper to the pot; cook, stirring constantly, until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
Pour in white wine, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5 minutes. Add browned oxtail, beef broth, chocolate, and bay leaves. Return to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 3 hours.
Season with salt and paprika, stir in carrots, recover, and allow to simmer until carrots are tender.
