Ingredients:
1 large onion, chopped
2 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 baguette {11-12 oz}
1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1/4 cup fresh rosemary, minced
3 cups heavy cream
10 eggs
1 tsp salt
pepper to taste

Directions:
Saute the onion in the butter over medium heat until golden brown.
Cut the baguette into 1 inch slices and toast in the oven at 350 degrees for a few minutes {turning once}.
While the bread toasts, whisk the cream, eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
Once the bread is lightly toasted, layer the bread slices, cheese, onion, and rosemary 1/2 at a time in a buttered 9x14 inch baking dish.
Pour the egg and cream mixture over the layers.
Chill, covered in the refrigerator for 8 to 10 hours or overnight.
In the morning, preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake the Strata, uncovered for 40 minutes or until golden brown and fluffy.
