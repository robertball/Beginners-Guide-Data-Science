Ingredients:
3 cups bite-size honey square cereal (such as Honey Chex®)
3 cups bite-size corn square cereal (such as Corn Chex®)
3 cups bite-size rice square cereal (such as Rice Chex®)
3 cups toasted oat cereal rings (such as Honey-Nut Cheerios®)
3 cups cheese-flavored crackers (such as Cheez-It®)
3 cups pretzels
3 cups cashews or mixed nuts
1 cup butter
2 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 tablespoons hot sauce

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Combine all cereals, cheese-flavored crackers, pretzels, and mixed nuts in a large bowl; set aside.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the cajun seasoning, worcestershire sauce, syrup, and hot sauce until evenly blended. Pour over the cereal mixture, and gently stir until the cereal is evenly coated with the seasoned butter. Spread the cereal mixture onto baking sheets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature before storing in an airtight container.
