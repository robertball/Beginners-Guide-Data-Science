Ingredients:
16 ounces tempeh, crumbled into small pieces
2 Tablespoons canola oil
4 teaspoons tamari
1/2 cup Vegenaise
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons agave nectar
1/4 teaspoon celery seed
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 cup organic seedless red grapes
2 celery stalks, chopped
1/2 cup pecan halves
pea shoots

Directions:
Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the tempeh crumbles for 7-10 minutes, until quite brown. Transfer to a bowl, add tamari, stir and let cool to room temperature. Make the dressing by combining the Vegenaise through salt and pepper in a bowl. Set aside. Toast the pecan halves for a few minutes in a skillet until fragrant, then coarsely chop.
Combine cooled tempeh, dressing, grapes, celery, and pecans. Serve over pea shoots or leafy greens.
