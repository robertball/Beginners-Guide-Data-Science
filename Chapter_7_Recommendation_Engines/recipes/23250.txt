Ingredients:
1 cup uncooked instant rice
4 large firm tomatoes
1 tablespoon finely chopped green bell pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 teaspoon olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
In a small saucepan over high heat, bring water to a boil.  Stir in rice; cover and remove from heat. Let stand covered 5 minutes or until water is absorbed. Fluff with fork.
Slice off the top of each tomato and scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/4 inch thick shell.  Reserve 3 tablespoons of pulp, chopped.  Invert the tomatoes to drain.
In a medium bowl combine rice, tomato pulp, green pepper, onion, parsley, salt, garlic and olive oil; mix well.  Spoon filling into tomato shells.
Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.

Description: 
Tasty and not too hard to make. If you prefer, use 8 small tomatoes, bake in muffin cups and reduce baking time to 15 minutes.
