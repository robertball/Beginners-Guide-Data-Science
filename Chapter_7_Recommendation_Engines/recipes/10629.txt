Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
1 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
In large mixing bowl, combine sugar, butter, peanut butter, milk and vanilla.  Mix by hand about 3 minutes or until creamy.
Thoroughly mix flour into creamy mix. Roll small balls of dough in hand, about 1 inch in diameter.  Place on greased cookie sheet, approximately 3/4 inch apart. Using a fork, make criss cross pattern on cookie  (this will flatten cookie partially). Be careful not to over flatten, dough should not touch each other.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) 18 to 25 minutes.
