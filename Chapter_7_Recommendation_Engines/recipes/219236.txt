1 (13.25 ounce) package dry whole wheat spaghetti, uncooked
1 (20 ounce) package lean ground turkey
1/4 cup Egg Beaters® Original
1/4 cup Italian-style bread crumbs

Directions:
Cook spaghetti according to package directions, omitting salt.
Meanwhile, combine turkey, Egg Beaters and bread crumbs in bowl just until combined. Divide mixture into 18 portions. Cut cheese into 18 equal pieces (about 1/2 inch). Place 1 piece cheese in center of each meat portion and gently shape into ball.
Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs; cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning gently to brown all sides. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more or until meat is no longer pink. Remove drippings. Pour sauce over meatballs; heat until sauce is hot, stirring occasionally.
To serve, divide spaghetti between each plate and top with 3 meatballs and sauce each.
