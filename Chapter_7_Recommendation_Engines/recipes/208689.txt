Description: 
Both corn and avocados are native North and South American foods. This variation on Midwestern corn relish works as a side, a sauce or a salsa. Try with pork or chicken or to liven up leftover sliced turkey. For a south-of-the border taste just stir in 1 teaspoon chili powder. For an Asian variation use curry powder.
