Ingredients:
1 leftover Ham Bone, (or 1/2 pound ham or turkey ham cut into 1/2 inch cubes)
1 pound dried pinto beans
1 tablespoon epazote seasoning, used to lessen gas in beans, chili, etc., (optional)
1 teaspoon baking soda, (optional)
salt
pepper
2 freezer container, quart

Directions:
Rinse and sort pinto beans. Place in large bowl and add water until beans are covered 3 inches deep. Soak overnight.
Next morning, place ham bone (or ham cubes) and soaked, drained beans in crock pot; add water to cover.
If desired, add baking soda, but pay attention as beans cook, to skim off bubbles which form on top. Adding baking soda reduces greatly the amount of gas produced by beans and helps soften them for cooking.
Cook on High for 6 to 8 hours, until beans are tender and meat has separated from bone.
Carefully remove ham bones and fat, returning slivers of meat to beans; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve immediately or freeze.
To freeze: place bone beans in freezer containers. Freeze.
To prepare: thaw beans completely before heating. Heat in saucepan over medium heat until hot. Serve with corn bread and green salad.
