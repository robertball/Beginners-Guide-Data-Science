Ingredients:
2 1/4-2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 eggs well beaten
1 tsp vanilla extract

Directions:
Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Cream butter. Add sugar gradually and cream together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and beat thoroughly. Add flour gradually and blend. Add vanilla extract. Chill until firm enough to roll (2 hrs).
Roll 1/8 inch thick on lightly floured board. Cut into shapes and bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 400° for 10 minutes or until golden at edges.
When cool, decorate with your favorite icing recipe. Divide icing into several small bowls, and color each bowl a different color. Make a pastry bag with parchment paper cones or plastic disposable cones.
