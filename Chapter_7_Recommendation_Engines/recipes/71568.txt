Description: 
This is not your ordinary roast, but a flavorful surprise. Simple enough to put together with ease, but interesting enough to serve to dinner guests on special occasions. Feel free to add your own special touches. Adding sun dried tomatoes and bell peppers works wonderfully. Delicious served over steamed white or Mexican style rice.
