Ingredients:
For the meatballs:
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced small
1 clove garlic, minced
1 egg
1/2 cup Italian flavored bread crumbs
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper
For the sauce:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, cut into a large dice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 32 oz can tomato sauce
1 14 oz can tomato paste
2 cups water
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 cup white granulated sugar
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
Salt to taste

Directions:
Mix all ingredients for the meatballs together and shape into golf-ball sized balls.
Heat olive oil in a frying pan and brown on all sides.  Set aside.
In a dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat and add onion and garlic.  Cook until onions are just softened....do not burn the garlic.
Add tomato paste and cook for 2 or 3 minutes.
Add remaining ingredients, stirring very well after each addition.
Add the meatballs, careful to avoid adding the grease from the frying pan.
Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook 4 hours.
Serve over your favorite pasta with added parmesan cheese on top.

Description: 
These two aunts were born in Italy, and did their houses ever smell heavenly when this was on the stove.  Of course, they had no recipe but this is my translation.  It's a long-simmering sauce, great for a cold, rainy day.  Aw, heck....it's great any time!
