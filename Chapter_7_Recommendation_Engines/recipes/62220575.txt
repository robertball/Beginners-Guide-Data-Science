Ingredients:
* 1/2 bunch to full bunch kale, torn into pieces
* 4 tbs melted butter
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp. pepper
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 3 tsp sugar

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400
2. lay kale out on baking sheet or 2 if needed.
3. Drizzle butter over kale (do not have to use it all if not using a whole bunch of kale)
4. Mix all the spices together in a small tupperware
5. Sprinkle spice over the kale. Don't go over board. If you don't use all the seasoning put a lid on it and store it in the pantry!
6. Now mix around the kale with some tongs and place in oven. Start checking them at about 8 minutes and take out when crispy. It could take up to 12 minutes or so. Enjoy!
