Ingredients:
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed (I used 31-40 count shrimp)
1/2 cup mayo (Hellman's is best)
1/4 cup Thai Sweet Chili Sauce
4-8 drops Sriracha Hot Sauce
1 teaspoon peanut butter
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 cup corn starch
3 eggs
6 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil
1/2 of a green onion, diced and lettuce for garnish, if desired

Directions:
In a large bowl, toss the shrimp with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder
Place corn starch in a shallow dish like a cake pan.
In another cake pan, lightly whisk three eggs together to create an egg wash
Dredge each piece of shrimp in corn starch, then dip in the egg wash to coat
When all the shrimp have been coated in corn starch and dipped in egg, heat 6-8 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet on high heat. When the oil is nice and hot, CAREFULLY add the shrimp to the pan. You may need to cook the shrimp in two batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan
The shrimp cook fast! When the bottoms of the shrimp are crispy, flip the shrimp so that the other side can cook. This should only take about 30 seconds-1 minute per side if the oil is nice and hot
Remove the cooked shrimp to a paper towel lined plate
In a small bowl, whisk together the Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, Sriracha Sauce, Mayo, Crushed Red Peppers and Peanut Butter. When the mixture is smooth, carefully toss the shrimp in it. You may not need all of the sauce, it just depends on how “saucy” you want the shrimp
To present it, place one large leaf of iceberg lettuce on a plate. Place the shrimp on top, then sprinkle chopped green onion on top
