Description: 
Firm tofu breaded with nutritional yeast then sauteed until golden brown. Creates a crispy breading.  Great with hash browns and toast for a weekend breakfast, lunch, whatever!  My daughter likes to dip this in ketchup. Excellent in a sandwich.  For a low fat version you can also bake at 350 degrees on non-stick cookie sheet for 15- 20 minutes.
