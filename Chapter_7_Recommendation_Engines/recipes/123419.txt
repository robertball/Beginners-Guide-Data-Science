Ingredients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/4 cups sugar
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3 eggs
1 1/2 cups milk
1 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 1/2 teaspoons butter flavor or vanilla extract

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, beat eggs, milk, oil and extracts. Stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour into two greased 8-in. x 4-in. x 2-in. loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack.

Description: 
Preparation time's kept to a minimum for Rosemarie Survillo's seeded treat. 'It's a bread that you can make a day ahead of time, and then warm in the microwave moments prior to serving for just-baked appeal,' she hints from her home in Lake St. Louis, Missouri.
