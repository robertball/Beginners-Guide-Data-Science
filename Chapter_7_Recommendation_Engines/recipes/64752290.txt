Ingredients:
1 lb Bacon (Chopped)
1 cup Sugar
1 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
2 tablespoon Rustic Mustard
1 bunch Green Onion (Chopped)
1 teaspoon Black Pepper (Ground)
2.5 lb Russet Potatoes (Boiled, Peeled & Sectioned into Chunks)

Directions:
Chop and fry the pound of bacon (do not drain)
When chopped bacon is fried crisp, reduce heat, add 1 cup sugar and 1 cup apple cider vinegar to the pan and mix until sugar dissolves
Add 2 tablespoons (or more if you love mustard) to the bacon mixture
Add 1 teaspoon ground black better to the bacon mixture
Stir and remove from heat
Boil unpeeled potatoes until they are soft (about 20 minutes)
When potatoes are done, drain and peel them carefully to avoid losing too much potato (a spoon works well for this)
Cut potatoes into chunks and place in a bowl
Pour the bacon mixture over the potato chunks in the bowl and stir to completely cover the potatoes with the bacon mixture

Description: 
I always loved my Mom's German potato salad and thought the recipe was lost when she passed away but found the hand-written recipe card years later. :-)
