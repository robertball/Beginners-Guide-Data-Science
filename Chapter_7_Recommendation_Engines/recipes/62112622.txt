Ingredients:
12 small crisp apples
12 wooden skewers (ask butcher for city chicken sticks)
1 C. butter
1 lb. brown sugar
1 14 oz. (1 1/3 C) sweetened condensed milk
dash of salt
1 C light corn syrup
2 squares unsweetened chocolate
1 tsp. vanilla
1 C chopped peanuts or pecans (optional)

Directions:
Butter a baking sheet and set aside.
Wash and dry apples thoroughly, remove stems.
Insert wooden skewer into stem end of each apple: set aside.
In a heavy 3 quart saucepan, melt butter or margarine.
Stir in brown sugar and salt.
Add corn syrup; mix well.
Gradually stir in condensed milk and blend.
Add the chocolate.
Cook over medium heat stirring constantly, 12-15 minutes or until candy thermometer registers 245 degrees.
Remove from heat; stir in vanilla.
Dip each apple in the chocolate mixture, turning to coat.
With a narrow spatula, scrape excess caramel from bottom of apple and let drip back into pan.
Immediately dip the bottom half of the apple into chopped nuts.
Set on buttered baking sheet to cool.
Makes 12 apples.
Note: Making on a rainy day can be a problem because of the humidity in the atmosphere causing the caramel to be sticky and not harden.  Cook a little longer when the weather is rainy.
