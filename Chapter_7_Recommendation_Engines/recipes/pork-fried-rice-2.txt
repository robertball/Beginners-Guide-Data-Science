Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup chopped carrot
1/4 cup chopped broccoli
1 green onion, chopped
1 egg, beaten
1 cup cold cooked rice
1/4 cup frozen peas
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

Directions:
Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, peas, and green onion in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.
Scramble egg in the skillet until completely set. Return the pork mixture to the skillet. Stir rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the pork mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.
