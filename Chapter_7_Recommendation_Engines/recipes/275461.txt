Description: 
This recipe hardly makes sense for a pressure cooker. All I know is that if I add a 
cube of butter to the pot and set it for 2 minutes, my butter is transformed. This pressure cooker method is gonna give you rock-star status when friends and family just can't figure out how to make cookies taste as delectable as yours. Important to note: This has only worked successfully for me in the Instant Pot®.
