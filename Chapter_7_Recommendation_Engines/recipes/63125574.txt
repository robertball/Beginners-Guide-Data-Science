Ingredients:
5 large eggs
2 Tbl. sour cream
3 Tbl. white sugar
3 Tbl. flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1 Cup fresh blueberries

Directions:
Spray a 1 quart microwavable casserole with non-stick spray.  In a medium bowl beat the eggs by hand, add all of the remaining ingredients, EXCEPT the blueberries and beat the mixture until well incorporated.  Pour the batter into the prepared casserole and sprinkle the blueberries evenly over the batter.  Microwave on high 4 to 5 minutes (depending on the microwave) turning the casserole every minute so that the Dutch Baby cooks evenly.  When the batter is not liquid in the center, the Dutch Baby is done.  Immediately divide into serving dishes and dust each with powdered sugar.  Serve hot.
