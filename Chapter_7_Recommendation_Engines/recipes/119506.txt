Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pear halves
6 (3/4 inch) thick bone-in pork chops
3 tablespoons butter or margarine
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon prepared mustard

Directions:
Drain pears, reserving the juice; cut pears into slices and set aside. In a large skillet, brown the pork chops in butter. Transfer to a greased 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, mustard and reserved pear juice. Pour over chops; top with pear slices. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F for 40-45 minutes or until a meat thermometer reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
