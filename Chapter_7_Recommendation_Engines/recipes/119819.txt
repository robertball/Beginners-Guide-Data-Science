1 cup cold water
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, diced

Description: 
My mother shared this recipe with me soon after I was married. Most everything I know about cooking, I learned from her. This recipe has always been a family favorite, and it's a time-saver as well because it uses spaghetti sauce and gravy mix.--Christina Takacs, West Springfield, Massachusetts
