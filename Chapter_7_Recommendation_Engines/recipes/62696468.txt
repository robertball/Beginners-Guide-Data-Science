Ingredients:
NO CARB! Crust:
1.5 cups cauliflower (fresh or frozen)
2 eggs
1.5 cups of Mozzarella cheese
1 Tbsp fennel seeds
2 tsp oregano or Italian seasoning mix
2 tsp parsley (dried works better but fresh is fine)spray oil

Directions:
Preheat oven at 450.
Cook cauliflower until tender but not soggy.  Drain excess water and cool at room temp.  In food processor (or blender), process cauliflower until finely shredded.  It should have the consistancy of mashed potatoes.  Combine with eggs and cheese.  Spray pizza pan with oil and evenly spread cauliflower mixture onto pan to make crust.  Spray lightly with oil and sprinkle seasonings evenly across crust.
Bake at 450 for 10-15 min (should be lightly browned).
Remove from oven and spread with pizza sauce and desired toppings.  Top with a layer of shredded cheeses and bake until cheese is golden brown.  (for an even lower calorie option, eliminate the extra cheese on top and add another layer of pizza sauce instead for a sauceless pizza).  Voila!

Description: 
I am always looking for ways to insert vegetables into my family's diet without their knowledge.  It's also a great way for me to cut unnecessary calories.  Since pizza is a staple to my two teenagers, I wanted to find a way to cut carbs out.  I decided to try using a variety of vegetables but realized that cauliflower is a great way to make pizza crust. Honestly, they prefer this pizza crust over store bought pizzas simply because of the freshness the cauliflower crust brings to a pizza.  And, it tastes great (seriously)!
