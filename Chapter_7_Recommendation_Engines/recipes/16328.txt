Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can green beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can carrots, drained
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 (15 ounce) can peas
1/2 pound processed cheese food, sliced
4 cups prepared instant mashed potatoes

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the beef and onion for 5 to 10 minutes, or until meat is browned. Drain excess fat and place this mixture in the bottom of a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.
Layer the green beans, carrots, corn and peas over the beef mixture. Place the cheese over the vegetables.
Prepare the potatoes according to package directions, but add some extra milk or water to make it a little runny. Cover the entire casserole with the potatoes.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until potatoes get slightly crusty and the sides of the dish are bubbly.

Description: 
This has also been called shepherds pie. I love the colors, and it's easy. Another family pleaser. Ground beef layered with mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes.
