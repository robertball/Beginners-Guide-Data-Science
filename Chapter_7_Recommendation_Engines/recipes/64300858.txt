Ingredients:
80g of uncooked rigatoni pasta (this was 8 jumbo rigatonis)
few handfuls of chopped kale
2 cloves of garlic crushed (I used the Gourmet Garden garlic)
3 heaped tablespoons of goats cheese
2 tablespoons of milk
black pepper
olive oil
some grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Add the rigatoni pasta to a saucepan of boiling water and cook until al dente, drain and set aside to cool slightly.
Add a drizzle of olive oil to a frying pan over a medium high heat. Add garlic and saute for a minute or so, just to release the flavour.
Add kale (or spinach or chard/silverbeet or whatever greens you have) and saute until soft or wilted.
Add goats cheese (or cream cheese or whatever soft cheese you want), milk and a little sprinkling of black pepper into the greens and stir constantly until the cheese is melted and covers the greens in a thick smooth sauce.
Carefully stuff your rigatoni pasta tubes with the greens/cheese mix (it was easy with the jumbo rigatoni, but use a chopstick for the normal rigatoni) and serve topped with some grated Parmesan.
