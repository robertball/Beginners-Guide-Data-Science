Ingredients:
1 cup diced fresh mango
1/4 cup hot water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup yogurt
1/2 cup sunflower oil
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan.
Place the mango, water, sugar, milk powder, yogurt, and oil in a blender. Blend until smooth, then pour into a bowl. Sift together the wheat flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.  Fold the flour mixture into the mango puree. Pour resulting mixture into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 30 to 45 minutes.

Description: 
This basic mango bread uses milk powder instead of eggs. You can even use any leftover baby formula powder in its place. This bread is delicious when served hot out of the oven, but can be kept for 2 to 3 days.
