Ingredients:
1 lb. sausage (Eckrich is the brand the I prefer to use either their smoked sausage, Kielbasa or turkey sausage.)
1 lb. fresh green beans, ends trimmed, string and washed
1 lb. red potatoes, washed and scrubbed (do-not peel)
water

Directions:
Place the sausage in the bottom of a heavy pot, add water to approximately 3/4inch into the pot - about half way up the sausage.
Top with the green beans then the red potatoes.
Bring water to a boil; reduce to a simmer with lid on.  Continue on a simmer until the potatoes are fork tender.  (approx. 30 minutes or more)

Description: 
This is the easiest & best home cooked meal in one pot that you can make.  No need to add anything else.   I like to serve it with cornbread, it's a real comfort meal.
