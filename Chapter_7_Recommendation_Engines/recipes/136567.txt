Place yogurt in a paper coffee filter, paper towel or 4 layers of cheesecloth set in a strainer or colander, and then set over a bowl to catch the liquid. Allow yogurt to strain for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
Peel and grate the cucumber, squeeze out excess water; place into a bowl. Add strained yogurt, garlic puree, lemon juice, mint, and olive oil; mix until combined. Season to taste with salt; chill before serving.

Description: 
I've made tzatziki loads of times, but this is my best recipe yet! The two keys are the roasted garlic, and straining the yogurt for 24 hours to make it like soft cheese. Tzatziki is great with crusty bread, french fries, pita bread, baked potatoes, or with any sort of wrap such as gyros, souvlaki, falafel or kebab.  Also, I traditionally use fresh garlic, but this time I used ROASTED garlic. This made the tzatziki so much more flavorful, without that overpowering 'bite' that can come with lots of fresh garlic.
