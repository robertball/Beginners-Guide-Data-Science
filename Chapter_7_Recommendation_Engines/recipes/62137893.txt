Title:
Bread Machine Challah for Shabbat & Festivals Recipe
Image:
https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 cup warm water
1-1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup margarine
1 egg
3 cups bread flour
2-1/4 teaspoons bread machine yeast
Glaze:
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1/8 teaspoon vanilla
Sesame or poppy seeds for Shabbat
Sugar for Rosh Hashanah
Chocolate or Rainbow Sprinkles for Simchas Torah

Directions:
Place ingredients in bread machine in order given.  Be sure to remove the baking pail and close the lid of the bread machine before adding ingredients.  Trust me ... it's easy to put the ingredients into the machine without the pail!!!
Set the bread machine to the dough/pasta setting and start the machine.
When the cycle is finished (2 hours), remove the dough (should be slightly sticky) and braid.
Place braided dough on non-stick or greased cookie sheet, cover with a plastic bag and allow to rise for an hour or until doubled in bulk.  The bread rises best when you're also making a soup at the same time - the warmth and moisture in the kitchen helps!
Mix together first 3 glaze ingredients and brush onto loaf.
Sprinkle with seeds, sugar or sprinkles
Bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

Description: 
A perfect recipe for arthritic hands that can't knead dough easily anymore!  Recipe is written for a bread machine that makes 1.5 lb (700g) loaves.  NOTE:  Do NOT bake this dough in the machine.  Use only the dough/pasta setting - there is too much fully-risen dough for the machine to accommodate.
