Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup white rice
¼ cup broken pieces vermicelli pasta
3 cups water
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
2 teaspoons dried parsley
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder

Directions:
Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook rice and vermicelli in hot butter until browned, about 3 minutes.
Pour water over the rice mixture. Stir chicken bouillon, parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder into the water; bring to a boil, place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to low, and cook until the water has absorbed into the rice and pasta, about 25 minutes.

Description: 
Years ago, I came up with my clone of a dish my children really enjoyed. I wanted to use the freshest ingredients that I usually have on hand. Many years later, I find myself still making it. If serving a beef dish, substitute chicken bouillon with beef bouillon. Angel hair pasta can be broken into small pieces in place of vermicelli.
