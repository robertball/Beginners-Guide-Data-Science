Ingredients:
5 small eggplants
3 fresh green chile peppers
4 cloves garlic, peeled
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1 small onion, quartered
3 teaspoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 ounces tofu, diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Preheat the grill for high heat.
Oil the grill grate, and cook the eggplants on all sides until charred and black, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and place on a rack to cool. Peel, slice diagonally, and set aside.
In a food processor or blender, combine the chile peppers, garlic, cilantro, onion, sugar, and lime juice. Process until smooth.
Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat, and add the chile mixture. Reduce heat to medium, and cook for 1 minute. Gently stir in the tofu, 1/4 cup of basil, and the eggplant. Cook until heated through. Remove to a serving dish, and garnish with the remaining basil.
