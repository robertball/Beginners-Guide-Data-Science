Ingredients:
2 Packages of Biscuits
1/2 C Melted Butter
2 Tsp Parsley
2 Tsp Rosemary
2 Tsp Basil
7 Cloves crushed garlic

Directions:
1. Melt the butter, herbs and garlic in a small saucepan.
2. Coat a Bundt pan with non stick spray and preheat the oven according to directions on biscuit package.
3. Dip each biscuit into the butter mixture, making sure to get some of the herbs and garlic on it, layer them in the bundt pan. With two packages I got two layers.
4. Pour any remaining butter/ margarine over the top of the biscuits when finished. Bake for however long the package specifies. I left mine in an extra 2 min.
5. Place the pan upside down on a cutting board and the pull apart bread will just fall out leaving a slightly golden brown bread. We served it straight out of the oven, but you can let it cool some if need be.

Description: 
This was fantastic with spaghetti, my family loved it... in fact my husband tried to eat the whole thing. Keep in mind though, we love garlic at our house. If you are not a fan of strong garlic streamline the amount until you are comfortable with it.
