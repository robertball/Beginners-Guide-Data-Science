Heat oven to 400 degrees F.  Place one pastry into a 10-inch deep pie plate.  In large saucepan, cook onion in butter until tender.  Stir in flour, bouillon, thyme and pepper.  Add water and milk all at once.  Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.  Stir in mixed vegetables, chicken, pimento and parsley.  Pour mixture into a 10-inch deep pie plate.
