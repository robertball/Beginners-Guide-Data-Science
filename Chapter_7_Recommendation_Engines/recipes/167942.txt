Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
20 peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 30 per pound)
4 teaspoons soy sauce
4 teaspoons rice wine
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup vegetable oil, divided
4 cloves garlic, minced
16 dried red chile peppers, cut in half
2 teaspoons Szechuan peppercorns (optional)
1 red bell pepper, sliced
1 green bell pepper, sliced
1/4 cup dark soy sauce
2 tablespoons rice wine
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 cup salted peanuts
4 green onions, cut into 3 inch lengths
2 dashes sesame oil, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Combine the chicken and shrimp in a mixing bowl along with 4 teaspoons of soy sauce, 4 teaspoons rice wine, and 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Sprinkle with cornstarch, and mix until evenly combined. Set aside to marinate for 25 minutes.
Heat half of the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in the chicken and shrimp, and cook until the chicken has turned white on the outside and is still a bit pink in the center; about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken and wipe the wok clean.
Heat the remaining vegetable oil over high heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook for a few seconds until the garlic begins to turn brown. Stir in the dried chiles and Szechwan peppercorns; cook and stir a few seconds until the peppers begin to darken. Add the red and green bell peppers, dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of rice wine, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a boil, stir in the chicken, and cook until the peppers are nearly tender, and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Stir in the peanuts and green onion until the green onion becomes limp. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil to serve.
