Description: 
I was greedy and bought the big box of waffles at Costco. The kids got tired of it and I just had to come up with a recipe to get rid of them. What do you know,the kids ate this easy to make dessert in no time, and the waffles were gone! I have used homemade waffles for this recipe, works just as well. We have tried adding fresh strawberries, chocolate chips, or raisins on top, delicious! Be creative and add your own toppings!
