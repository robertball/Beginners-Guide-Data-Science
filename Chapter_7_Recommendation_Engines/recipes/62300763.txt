Ingredients:
2 cups chicken broth (preferably your own)
1 cup water (or three cups' less strong chicken broth. I make mine quite concentrated to save freezer space.)
1 onion
1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup finely diced kale
3 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 broccoli stem, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup diced chorizo sausage
2 cloves garlic
1/4 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup cream

Directions:
Simmer diced potatoes in chicken broth until they are soft. Mash or blend them into the broth.
Meanwhile, sautee the onion, mushroom and broccoli until soft. When almost done, add chorizo and turn heat down to low. Add garlic.
Add sauteed vegetables to pureed potato and broth. Simmer on medium low. Add kale in handfuls until each wilts.
Salt and pepper to taste.
Turn heat down to low. Add in cream. Let warm for a minute, then remove from heat.
Garnish with spring onion and serve.

Description: 
I invented this soup with what I had in my fridge. I live alone, so this version only makes two servings. Scale up for more deliciousness!
