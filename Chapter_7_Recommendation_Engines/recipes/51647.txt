Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
6 (3/4 inch) thick pork chops
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup chopped celery
2 tablespoons minced onion
2 cups soft bread crumbs
1 (8 ounce) can cream-style corn
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Brown chops, turning once, and transfer to a shallow baking dish. Add water, and cover.
Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
When chops are almost done, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and onions until onions are translucent. Stir in bread crumbs, corn, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, then spoon stuffing over chops and return to the oven. Bake, uncovered, for 15 minutes more, or until no longer pink in the center.

Description: 
This is a family favorite that we often had when company came for dinner. This recipe has gone home with many invited dinner guests. Mom never follows a recipe when she cooks, so this is my best guess of how she makes them! You may have to tweak things a bit, as all values for ingredients she uses are approximate. I still have not been able to replicate hers exactly!
