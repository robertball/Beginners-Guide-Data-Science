Ingredients:
2 pounds lean ground beef
2 eggs, beaten
1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (10 ounce) can beef broth
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Mix ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs, dry soup mix, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; add about 1/2 the can of beef broth and continue mixing until beef mixture is thoroughly moistened. Divide mixture into six portions and shape into patties.
Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown patties in the hot pot, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Spoon excess grease from the pot.
Stir remaining beef broth with cream of mushroom soup and dry mustard in a bowl until smooth; pour over the browned patties.
Bake in preheated oven until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
