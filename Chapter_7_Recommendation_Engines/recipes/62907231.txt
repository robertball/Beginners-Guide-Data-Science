Ingredients:
1 pkg. Burrito size flour tortillas (I use 12" that I get from GFS)
1 pkg. Charras Corn Tostadas (They sell these for sure at Save-a-lot)
1 lb. ground beef or can use shredded chicken
1 pkg. Taco Seasoning
Fresh Cilantro
Green Onion
1 15 oz. can Refried Beans
Tomato
Lettuce
Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Sour Cream
Taco Sauce is optional if you want it

Directions:
Brown the ground beef and drain.  Add taco seasoning as per pkg directions.  Then stir into the beef mixture chopped cilantro and green onions to taste.  Set aside.
Lay the burritos out flat and spoon about 1/2 c. or so of refried beans in the center of the tortilla and spread or spoon them into a circular shape the same size as the corn tostada.  Then do the same with about the same amount of the beef mixture and top that with shredded cheddar cheese.  Place a corn tostada on top.
Place a layer of sour cream on the tostada and taco sauce if desired.  Then layer lettuce and tomatoes over that.
Start at about 12 oclock and pull the flour tortilla up over the center mixture and continue the same way at 1, 2, 3 until its closed.
I use my George Foreman grill to grill these since it can do both sides at the same time.   it only takes about 2 minutes or so.  Just so they are nicely heated and have grill marks.  These taste awesome and one will fill you up!!
I serve these with spanish rice on the side and it makes a great meal.
