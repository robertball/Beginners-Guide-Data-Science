Ingredients:
6 or 8 potatoes, cubed
2 or 3 ribs of celery
1 small onion, chopped (more or less as you like - I use onion powder, as my husband doesn't care for onions)
1/2 cup shredded carrots
milk - to desired consistency, about 1/2 gallon

Directions:
cover potatoes with water, salt lightly and cook until tender.
skim off the funny looking stuff that forms on top of the water.
when the potatoes are tender, stir a few times to moosh up some of the potatoes.
add milk ... to the amount of soup you need.
if you like it thin, get a bowl and serve. if you like it thick, add some instant potatoes to the desired thickness.
Get a bowl and enjoy.
