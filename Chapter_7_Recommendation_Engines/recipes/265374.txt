Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 pound peppered bacon
7 (28 ounce) cans baked beans (such as Bush'sÂ® Original)
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can light red kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can great northern beans, drained
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup prepared yellow mustard
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Set aside.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Crumble into small pieces.
Transfer beef-onion mixture and bacon to the slow cooker. Add all the beans, sugar, mustard, and soy sauce. Cook on Medium until flavors meld, about 4 hours.

Description: 
This is the best baked bean recipe I've ever known. Great with any main dish but more especially with barbeque beef, pork, or chicken. The slow cooker does an amazing job with these beans.
