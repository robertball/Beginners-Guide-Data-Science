2 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place carrots in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Scrape down the sides of the food processor a couple of times to make sure all of the carrots are finely chopped. Add tahini, olive oil, cumin seeds, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; process until smooth.
