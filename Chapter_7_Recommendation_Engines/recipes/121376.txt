Description: 
The tangy dressing for this refreshing salad has the right sweet-tart balance to suit my taste--and others who try it agree! Orange sections are a pretty contrast to the greens, and the bacon adds a crisp accent.                                                         --Kathy Schrecengost                                                                 Oswego, New York
