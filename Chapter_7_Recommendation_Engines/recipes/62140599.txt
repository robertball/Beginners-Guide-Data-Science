Ingredients:
2 lb. veal loin (or pork loin)
1/4-1/2 C. Vegetable oil (rapeseed is my favourite)
1/2 C. Flour
1 t. salt
2 t. freshly ground White pepper
1 T. Smoked paprika
3 eggs
3 T. Milk
3/4 C. coarse Matzo crumbs

Directions:
1. Cut the loin into 4 even pieces.  Between sheets of plastic wrap or waxed paper, beat with a wooden mallet (as gently as you can) until very thin (about 1/2-1/4 inch).
2. Set up a dredging station: Place flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in one bowl, and mix.  In a second bowl, mix eggs and milk thouroughly.  In a third bowl, place matzo crumbs.
3. Place Oil in a frying pan or saucepan, and heat to medium heat.
4. Dredge each escalope first in flour, then egg, then matzo.  Place in oil, and fry at medium heat for four minutes per side.
5. Allow to drain on draining rack, then place on plate.  Serve with a favoured gravy, and you have gastronomical heaven!

Description: 
Contrary to popular belief, Wienerschnitzel is NOT German!  In fact, the name gives it away: Wiener, the German word for Vienna.  It is an Austrian dish, and one that relies on true simplicity to work.  This is the recipe as found at Schnitzelwirt in Vienna.  It can be made with almost any meat, but below I give instructions for a veal or pork schnitzel.
