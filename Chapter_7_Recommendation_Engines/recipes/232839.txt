Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
6 (7 inch) flour tortillas
1 (16 ounce) package coleslaw mix
1/2 (10 ounce) package carrots, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Season pork with salt and pepper and arrange on a large baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until pork is slightly pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Shred pork.
Mix hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch in a bowl.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shredded pork, ginger, green onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until vegetables are fragrant. Add hoisin sauce mixture; stir. Cover and simmer under pork is very tender and sauce is thickened, about 20 minutes.
Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel.
Heat in microwave until warm, about 30 seconds. Scoop about 1/2 cup pork mixture in the center of each tortilla. Top with coleslaw mix and shredded carrots; fold tortillas in half.
