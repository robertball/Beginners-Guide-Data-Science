Ingredients:
1/8 cup coffee flavored liqueur
1/4 cup water
1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil
3 cups bread flour
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Place all ingredients, except for the semi-sweet chocolate chips, into the bread machine in the proper order for your machine.
Use dough cycle.
At end of dough cycle, remove dough, and place on lightly-floured board.  Cover and let rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten.
Roll out dough into a rectangle, sprinkle with miniature chocolate chips, and roll up into a loaf.  Place dough into greased loaf pan, cover and let rise for 45 minutes.  Slash loaf with a razor or a lame.
Bake in preheated 375 degree F (190 degrees C) oven for 25-30 minutes.  Remove loaf onto a cake rack and let cool.
