Description: 
This vegan French toast is similar to a non-vegan dish we had years ago at a little Mediterranean cafe. This is our version of the dish made vegan. Yum yum yum.

 Agave nectar is the vegan substitution for honey and has a sweeter, yummier taste. Drizzle agave nectar over the top of the toast, and dust with a little powdered sugar. Cappuccino tastes great with this dish!
