Ingredients:
2 tsp unflavored powdered gelatin
2 3/4 cups whole milk
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 tsp salt
6 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped
Vegetable oil
3/4 cup salted roasted pepitas
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp freshly ground nutmeg
1/2 tbsp unsalted butter

Directions:
In a small bowl, sprinkle the powdered gelatin over 1/4 cup of the milk and let stand until the gelatin is softened, about 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 2 1/2 cups of milk with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and the salt and bring just to a simmer over moderately heat. Remove the milk from the heat and whisk in the softened gelatin until dissolved.
In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the chopped chocolate at high power in 10-second intervals. Gradually whisk in the hot milk mixture until creamy. Strain the panna cotta mixture through a fine sieve into a large measuring cup.
Lightly brush six 1/2-cup ramekins with oil and set them on a baking sheet. Carefully fill the ramekins with the panna cotta mixture and refrigerate them for about 2 hours, until the panna cottas are firm.
Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or lightly oiled parchment paper. In a small bowl, toss the pumpkin seeds with the cinnamon and nutmeg. In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining 3/4 cup of sugar with 1/3 cup of water and cook over high heat, swirling the pan gently, until a medium amber caramel forms, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and swirl in the butter and spiced pumpkin seeds. Pour the brittle onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it in a very thin layer. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes, then crack it into shards.
Run a knife around the panna cottas and invert onto plates. Garnish with the brittle shards and serve.
