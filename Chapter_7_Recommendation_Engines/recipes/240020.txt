Ingredients:
1/2 pound ground beef
1 pinch ground cardamom, or to taste
1 pinch dried basil, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 large parsnip, peeled and cut into chunks
1/2 cup frozen corn
1/2 cup frozen peas
4 cups boiling water, or as needed to cover
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Mix ground beef with cardamom, basil, salt, and pepper.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot skillet until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
Mix corn and peas in a bowl. Pour enough boiling water over the corn and peas to cover completely; soak until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Cook parsnip in boiling water until fork-tender, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and transfer parsnip to a bowl. Pour butter over parsnip and mash with a fork.
Divide beef, peas and corn mixture, and mashed parsnips between two plates.

Description: 
Thought of this when I only had a few minutes to whip up dinner, and no potatoes. The parsnips really add to the flavor. All measurements are approximate.
