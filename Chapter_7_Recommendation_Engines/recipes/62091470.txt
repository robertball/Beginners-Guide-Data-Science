Ingredients:
1/2 c. reduced fat butter (eg. Blue Bonnet Light)
1/3 c. brown sugar
3 T. white sugar
1 T. cornstarch
1 T. water
1/2 T. vanilla extract
1/2 t. salt
1/2 t. baking soda
1&1/4 c. all-purpose flour
1 c. semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees and spray a large cookie sheet with cooking spray.
In a medium mixing bowl cream butter and sugars with a rubber spatula until well mixed.
Add the cornstarch, water, vanilla, salt, and baking soda, and mix until blended.
Add flour and stir like you would stir muffin batter (fold the flour in).  When flour is almost completely incorporated, add chocolate chips and finish stirring.  Be careful not to overstir, as this will create a tough cookie.  The dough will be soft and stickier than typical cookie dough, but resist the urge to add more flour.
Drop by rounded teaspoon-fulls onto cookie sheet.
Bake for 9 minutes in preheated oven or until edges are just golden brown - do not overbake or the cookies will be tough.
Remove from oven and let sit for 2-3 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
I have been experimenting with recipes for over a year, trying to find a good low-fat and egg-free cookie, but they always come out tough or too chewy.  Out of my research, trial and error, and LOTS of thrown away batches, I think I have found the perfect cookie!
