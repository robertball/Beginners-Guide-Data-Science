Ingredients:
1 Tablespoon unsalted butter
1 cup red seedless grapes
2 bay leaves
1 lb. cranberries (thawed, if frozen)
1-3/4 cups granulated white sugar
1/2 cup grape juice
kosher salt

Directions:
1. Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add grapes and bay leaves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the grapes begin to split, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add cranberries and stir to coat. Add sugar, grape juice, 1/2 cup water and a pinch of salt.
2. Bring mixture to boil then reduce to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. (If the berries aren't bursting after 15 minutes, smash gently with a spatula.)
3. Discard bay leaves. Transfer sauce to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain through fine mesh sieve into a 2-quart dish. Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate until set, at least 3 hours. Shelf life up to one week.
