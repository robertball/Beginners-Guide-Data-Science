Description: 
Kumquats are a small citrus fruit grown in Florida from about November through March. After the seeds are removed, the entire fruit is eaten, skin and all. The skin is sweet while the flesh is sour. The unique, bright flavor of this fruit makes for a refreshing and delicious ice cream.
