Ingredients:
1 frozen puff pastry-thawed
1/3 cup triple berry jam/preserves
8 oz round baby baked brie
1/4 cup chopped pecans or hazelnuts
1 large egg
1 Tbsp water

Directions:
Heat over to 400 degrees. Unfold pastry on a lightly floured board.  Roll gently to seal any cracks.
Spoon preserves onto center of pastry. Place cheese on top of preserves. Sprinkle evenly with nuts.
Fold pastry up over the cheese to cover. Trim excess pastry and press to seal seams. Reserve pastry scraps.
Whisk egg and water in a small bowl.  Brush seams with egg mixture. Place seam-side down on baking sheet.
Cut pastry scraps into decorative shapes and arrange on top, if desired. Brush with egg mixture.
Bake 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let stand for 20 minutes before cutting.
