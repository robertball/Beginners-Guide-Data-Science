Description: 
'I won a community recipe contest several years ago with this spicy dish,' relates Jackie Selover of Sidney, Ohio. 'I make it often for my family, but it's pretty enough to serve guests.' Red pepper flakes put a little zing in the shrimp, and the lightly sauteed veggies are crisp-tender and colorful.
