Ingredients:
24 jalapeno peppers
1 pound sausage
2 cups all-purpose baking mix
1 (16 ounce) package Cheddar cheese, shredded
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon garlic salt
1 (16 ounce) package Monterey Jack cheese, cubed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.
Cut a slit in each jalapeno pepper. Remove and discard seeds and pulp.
In a medium bowl, mix sausage, baking mix, Cheddar cheese, crushed red pepper, and garlic salt.
Stuff jalapenos with the Monterey Jack cheese cubes. Shape sausage mixture around the jalapenos to form balls.
Arrange jalapeno balls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned.
