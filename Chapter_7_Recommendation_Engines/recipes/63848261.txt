Ingredients:
Large stock pot Â– big enough for the turkey to have a little wiggle room (a canning pot works great)
Space in your fridge to place the pot
10 to 18 pound turkey, thawed
4 cups water
2 cups apple cider
1 cup Kosher or sea salt (canning salt can also be used but table salt may make turkey a little too salty)
1 handful each of fresh sage, rosemary, and thyme
1 tablespoon black pepper corns
4 cups ice cups
Additional water to cover turkey

Directions:
Start the brine by combining 4 cups water, the cider, salt, herbs and pepper corns in large stock pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat stirring and cooking just until salt is dissolved. Remove from heat and add ice cubes. Rinse turkey inside and out. Submerge the turkey into the cooled brine. Add water until turkey is completely covered making sure the cavities are filled. Stir around the outer edges to make sure additional water has combined well with the rest of the brine. Place in refrigerator for a minimum of 12 hours. Remove turkey from pot and discard the brine. Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Season and roast according to any of your favorite recipes. Brined turkeys tend to shorten your roasting time by about half an hour. But be sure your bird cooks to an internal temperature of 180 degrees when tested through the thigh.
