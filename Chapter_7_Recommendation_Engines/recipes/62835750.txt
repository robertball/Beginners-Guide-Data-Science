Ingredients:
1 8 oz. package of cream cheese softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 standard package of 6 milk chocolate Hershey Bars
1 12 oz. container Cool-Whip, thawed

Directions:
Beat cream cheese, powdered sugar, and granulated sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until mixture is creamy.
Chop candy bars finely.  Fold into cream cheese mixture with Cool-Whip.
Spread icing between layers and on top and sides of chocolate cake.  It makes a lot of icing so it's best on a three layer cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

This cake is always a huge hit.  It's simple but decadent.  The cream cheese icing is light and refreashing without being too sweet.
