Description: 
This dressing is made of tofu, yogurt, sesame, soy sauce, and vinegar. This is superb when drizzled over a salad or grilled meats, and is an excellent dip for toasted bread. Tofu can be soft or firm, but do not use extra firm tofu. For a spicy kick, try adding a small amount of wasabi before blending.
