Ingredients:
1 cup whole milk
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon lavender honey
1/2 cup soft goat cheese
2 cups heavy cream
2 1/2 cups fresh blueberries
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon lavender honey

Directions:
Heat milk, sugar, and 1 tablespoon lavender honey over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir until honey and sugar have dissolved, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool briefly.
Place goat cheese in a bowl and pour lukewarm milk mixture on top. Stir until smooth. Mix in cream. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Combine blueberries, water, and 1 tablespoon lavender honey in a saucepan over medium-low heat and slowly bring to a boil. Simmer for 15 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Mash berries with a wooden spoon until mixture resembles chunky jam. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
Pour goat cheese mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions until it starts to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add blueberry mixture a little at a time; continue freezing, about 10 minutes more. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
Remove from freezer 20 minutes before serving.
