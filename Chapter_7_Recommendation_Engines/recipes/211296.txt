Ingredients:
3 pounds quince, peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup honey
1 1/2 cups water
1 pinch salt
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter

Directions:
Combine the sliced quince, honey, water, and a pinch of salt in a pan (you should have about nine cups of sliced fruit). Cover the pan and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to very low. Simmer, covered, until the fruit is tender, about 8 minutes, stirring carefully once or twice to avoid breaking the fruit.
Put a strainer over a saucepan and pour the cooked quince into a strainer, reserving the cooking liquid. Set the quince aside to cool.
Roll out the pastry and line a 9 inch pie plate. Refrigerate the dough while you prepare the filling.
Combine the white sugar, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and flour in a small bowl and mix well. Add the sugar mixture and the butter to the reserved quince cooking liquid and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the sauce to cool.
Place a sheet pan on the lowest rack of the oven. Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Pour the cooled quince into the pastry-lined pan and cover with the sauce. Add the top crust, crimping the edge to seal. Cut vents or prick the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape.
Put the pie on the preheated sheet pan and immediately reduce the oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake until the edges of the crust are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until the juices are bubbling and the crust is brown, about 45 minutes more. Cool on a rack at least two hours before serving.

Description: 
Quince is a very aromatic, almost floral-tasting fruit that resembles a cross between an apple and a pear. It's quite tart, and when cooked it turns a lovely blushing pink. Quince needs to be cooked before you use it, so this recipe takes a little longer to prepare than other fruit pies. This recipe also works well using half apples, half quince: just add sliced raw apples to the cooked quince before baking. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
