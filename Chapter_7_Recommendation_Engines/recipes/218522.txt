Description: 
This Caesar salad dressing is always a hit! Prepare at least 4 hours in advance for best taste. No raw egg means you can make this dressing and keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days, and it only gets better with time! For extra presentation serve with croutons, cubes of avocado flesh, and grated Parmesan cheese. Leftover dressing makes good dip for fresh veggies as a snack (Just maybe not at work due to the awesome amount of garlic!)
