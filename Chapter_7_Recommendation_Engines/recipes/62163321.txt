Ingredients:
1 package Goya frozen discos (empanada dough)
1 package guava, mango or papaya paste or jelly
-you can find these at most grocery stores in the
international foods aisle
1 8 oz. packag cream cheese
powdered sugar for dusting

Directions:
Slice cream cheese into cubes. For fruit paste, also cut into cubes. In prepared, thawed empanada rounds stuff with cream cheese and fruit paste cubes, or spoon in fruit jelly along with the cream cheese cubes. Fold dough over on itself like you were making a turnover. Pinch together edges and crimp with a fork for decoration.
Traditional empanadas are fried in oil, but I prefer baking.
For Frying:
If you don't have a deep fat fryer, like me, heat 2-3 inches of vegetable oil, depending on your pot, in a cast iron skillet or other heavy pot that will retain heat. Heat oil to 375 degrees, checking temperature with a candy thermometer. Fry empanadas until golden brown and crispy. Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy!
For Baking:
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Place empanadas onto the baking sheet and brush with melted butter. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Dust with powdered sugar and enjoy!
