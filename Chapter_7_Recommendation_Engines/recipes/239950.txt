Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
3 eggs
3/4 cup water
1/3 cup canola oil
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Beat cake mix, eggs, water, and canola oil together in a bowl using a hand mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin and beat until batter is smooth; pour into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Place cupcakes on a wire rack to cool completely.
Beat cream cheese and butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; add vanilla extract and beat until smooth. Beat confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, into cream cheese mixture until frosting is smooth and creamy. Refrigerate frosting until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
Spread frosting onto cupcakes and refrigerate frosted cupcakes until chilled, at least 1 hour.

Description: 
These delicious cupcakes are a nice alternative to traditional pumpkin spice muffins and have a much sweeter, lighter pumpkin flavor. They are made with a yellow cake mix and have a nice fluffy texture. Topped with cream cheese frosting and served cold, they are a wonderful fall treat!
