Ingredients:
2 tsp Olive Oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 ½ cups zucchini, diced into matchsticks
3 large eggs
5 large egg whites
¼ cup of low fat cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
2 medium vine ripe tomatoes, cored and thinly sliced crosswise

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in onion and cook until slightly golden, about 8-10 minutes. Add zucchini, increase heat to medium-high, season with salt and pepper and cook 2-3 minutes or until the moisture dries up, stirring occasionally.
In a medium bowl whisk eggs, egg whites, cheese, salt and pepper.
Pour the eggs into the skillet making sure they cover all of the vegetables. Arrange tomatoes in an overlapping pattern on top and season with salt and pepper to taste.
When the edges begin to set (about 2 minutes) move the skillet to the oven (make sure that you use an oven safe skillet). Cook about 16-18 minutes. Serve warm.
