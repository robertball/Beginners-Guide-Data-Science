Ingredients:
3 cups chicken broth
1 cup wild rice
cooking spray
1 (26.5 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 pound cubed cooked chicken
½ cup diced carrot
¼ cup diced onion
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
4 large red bell peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded

Directions:
Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan; add wild rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, 55 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
Mix mushroom soup, chicken, carrot, onion, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; fold in wild rice.
Arrange red bell pepper halves in the prepared casserole dish. Fill each half with chicken-rice filling. Cover casserole dish loosely with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and bubbling, about 45 minutes.
