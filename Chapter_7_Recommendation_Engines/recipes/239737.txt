Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 pounds beef tips, trimmed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, minced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 (32 ounce) carton beef stock
12 fluid ounces Burgundy cooking wine, divided
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®)
2 cups water, or more as needed
2 tablespoons cornstarch, or more as needed
2 tablespoons water, or as needed

Directions:
Heat an electric skillet for 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C); add vegetable oil. Cook beef tips in the hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion mixture, beef stock, 1 cup cooking wine, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and browning sauce to beef tips.
Cover electric skillet, reduce temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beef is tender, about 1 hour. Add 2 cups water as needed to maintain moisture in the skillet.
Pour remaining cooking wine into beef tips mixture. Stir cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water together in a bowl until smooth; stir into liquid mixture in the electric skillet and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes more.
