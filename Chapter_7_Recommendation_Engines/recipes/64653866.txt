Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2-1/2 tsp baking powder
1-3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp salt
1-1/2 cups buttermilk
TOPPING:
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cold butter
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
6 cups thinly sliced peeled Gala or other sweet apples (about 6 medium)
18 caramels, unwrapped
1 Tbsp buttermilk
Vanilla ice cream, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each addition. Pour into a greased 12-in. ovenproof skillet.
For topping, in a small bowl, mix brown sugar and flour; cut in butter until crumbly. Stir in pecans and oats; sprinkle over batter. Top with apples. Bake 60-70 minutes or until apples are golden brown. Cool in pan on a wire rack.
In a microwave, melt caramels with buttermilk; stir until smooth. Drizzle over cake. Let stand until set. If desired, serve with ice cream.

Description: 
My grandma used to make a version of this for me when I was a little on her farm with fresh apples from her tree in the back yard. I've adapted her recipe because I love the combination of apple, pecans, and caramel
