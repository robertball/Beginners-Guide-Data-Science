Ingredients:
1 store-bought round pound cake
1 (16 ounce) package vanilla frosting
1 (14 ounce) bag shredded coconut, divided
1 cup jelly beans
2 strands black shoestring licorice, cut into 3 pieces
4 drops green food coloring
pink construction paper

Directions:
Cut pound cake in half down the middle. Spread a layer of frosting over 1 half; cover with the other half. Place cake upright on a cake platter with the flat side facing down. Cut a triangular notch from the top to form the neck of the bunny. Attach the cut-out notch onto the back of the cake to form the tail.
Frost the entire surface and cover evenly with shredded coconut. Add 2 jelly beans for the eyes and a red jelly bean for the nose. Stick 3 licorice pieces on each side of the nose to form the whiskers.
Cut out 2 ears out of pink paper and fold in the middle. Push into the cake, above the eyes.
Mix 1 cup of shredded coconut with green food coloring until coconut is an even shade of green. Sprinkle around the bunny to make grass. Add extra jelly beans to the grass to resemble Easter eggs.

A tradition in our home every year. This cake can be made entirely with store-bought ingredients if you are short on time or you can of course make everything from scratch. Kids can help, as well!
