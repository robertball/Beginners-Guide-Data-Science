Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup white sugar
3 large eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sour cream
1 1/4 cups crushed chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®), divided
1/3 cup white chocolate chips
1 tablespoon powdered sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x4-inch loaf pan. Line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium mixing bowl.
Whisk sugar, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together in another bowl until well combined. Whisk in the sour cream.
Pour the sour cream mixture over the flour mixture; mix together with a rubber spatula. Fold in 1 cup crushed cookies. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Immediately top with white chocolate chips and remaining crushed cookies.
Lift loaf out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang. Allow to cool before dusting with powdered sugar.
