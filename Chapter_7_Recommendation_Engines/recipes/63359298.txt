Description: 
When I bake a beef roast, I elevate it above the bottom of my roasting pan/Dutch oven and then I pour in about 3/4 of a cup of water before I season the roast with salt and pepper. I rarely sear my roasts anymore because they are plenty juicy when I use this method, (e.g., 275-degrees F. for 4 1/2 hours for a 2# roast, covered). This yields about 1 cup of drippings at the end which I use to make my au jus. I generally freeze the au jus in portions for making hot beef sandwiches.
