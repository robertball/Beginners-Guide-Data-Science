Ingredients:
1 quart heavy whipping cream
1 lb goat cheese
1/3 tsp of basil
1/3 tsp of chives
1/3 tsp rosemary
1 Tbs salt
1 Tbs pepper
corn starch to thicken

Directions:
Before we get started, when picking the goat cheese you want the cheese to be firm yet soft enough to poke a finger and don't get goat cheese that is in liquid.  Also, I like to use fresh herbs, but you can use dried ones.
-In a small pot heat the whipping cream until a layer of skin is on the top and there are bubbles on the side of the pot.
-Add the goat cheese and stir with a whisk until all cheese is completely melted.
-Add all the spices and herbs and mix thoroughly.
-If needed, add corn starch to thicken to a desired consistency.
-Serve warm and creamy.
