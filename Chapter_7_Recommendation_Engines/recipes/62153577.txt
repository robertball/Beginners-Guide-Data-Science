Ingredients:
1 whole roasting chicken
1 can Beer
1/3 cup brown sugar
2 tbsp. chili powder
2 tbsp. paprika
2 tsp. dry mustard
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. fresh ground pepper

Directions:
Rinse and pat dry the chicken.
Open the can of beer, pour about half into a glass for the cook to enjoy while preparing dinner.
Mix the brown sugar, chili powder, dry mustard, salt and pepper in a small bowl.
Place the half full beer can inside the cavity of the chicken (a stand can be purchased for about $4 at most kitchen stores). Keep upright.
Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of the dry rub inside the chicken. The beer may foam up when the rub falls inside the can.
Sprinkle the remaining rub on the outside of the chicken, being sure to coat the entire surface of the chicken.
Place on the barbecue on medium-high heat for approximately 1.5 hours or until the internal temperature reads 190 degrees.
Remove the chicken from the beer can.
Let it rest for about 10 minutes before carving.
