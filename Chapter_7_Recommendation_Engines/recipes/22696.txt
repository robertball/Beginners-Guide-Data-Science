Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls
4 slices mozzarella cheese
4 teaspoons tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Unwind the roll dough, and separate into 4 rectangles. Pinch together perforations to seal. Place 2 rectangles on a 9x13 inch baking sheet. Moisten edges of rectangles with water. Place 2 slices mozzarella on each rectangle. Top each with 2 teaspoons tomato paste. Sprinkle each with 1/4 teaspoon oregano. Cover each with remaining dough. Press the edges firmly with a fork to seal.
Bake in the preheated oven 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.
