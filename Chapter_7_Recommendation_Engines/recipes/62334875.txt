Ingredients:
2/3 cup pecan pieces (up to 1 cup if you're a nut lover)
1 tbs butter
1 1/2 cups fresh button mushrooms, quartered
1 medium onion, chopped
1 tbs fresh garlic, chopped fine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tsp butter
1 - 5.8 oz box couscous
1 - 8.5 oz jar sun dried tomato pesto with pine nuts
1/3 cup REAL parmesan, chopped fine
optional:
1/4 cup pine nuts, roasted (if tomato pesto doesn't have pine nuts)

Directions:
Immediately place pecans on cookie sheet and put into a cold oven set to 350 to begin roasting. (They'll be done when you finish the rest of the dish.) Nuts become aromatic when they are about done. Approximately 20-30 minutes, ovens vary.
Saute` onion, mushroom and garlic in butter til soft and tender. Set aside in separate bowl.
Use same pot to boil water and butter and prepare couscous according to package directions. (Check on nuts to avoid over roasting.) Fluff couscous with fork.
Stir pecans, sun-dried tomato pesto, parmesan and mushroom-onion mixture into couscous. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you may add more parmesan.

Description: 
Roasted pecans, sauteed onion, mushroom and garlic marry beautifully with parmesan, sun-dried tomato pesto and couscous. If you wish, stir in cooked chicken and more veggies to make it a complete meal. I regularly add shelled edamame for a boost of meatless protein.
