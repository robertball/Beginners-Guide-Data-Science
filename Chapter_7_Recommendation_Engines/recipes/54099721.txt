Ingredients:
7 cups chicken stock
1 tablespoon butter
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked
1 medium zucchini, diced
10 sun-dried tomatoes, softened and chopped
1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves, or to taste (optional)
freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring chicken stock to a boil in a medium stock pot, then reduce heat to a low simmer.
Melt butter in a large, heavy bottomed stock pot over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook for 2 minutes, or until softened. Add the rice and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted. Gradually ladle in simmering chicken stock, stirring continuously. Risotto will become creamy and slightly sticky, yet still firm in the center, or al dente.
When almost finished, stir in the zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and thyme, adding stock as needed and stirring continuously. Stir in basil and 6 tablespoons cheese just before serving. Divide risotto among 6 bowls, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and season with pepper to taste.

Description: 
This creamy main dish gets a splash of color with the addition of zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil. With much less butter than in a typical risotto recipe and no wine, there's no running around for ingredients you don't have on hand! The result is a lovely, light flavor in a very filling meal.Modified from: Zucchini Risotto
