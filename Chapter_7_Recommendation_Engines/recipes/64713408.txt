Instructions
Whisk the dressing ingredients together and taste to adjust any of them. Add more vinegar if you want a tangier flavor. Set aside.
Put the beans in a large salad bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients and toss with a generous amount of the dressing.
The salad will keep, well covered, for several days in the refrigerator.

Notes:
Those delicious cannellini beans are delicate!  Be gentle when you rinse and toss them.
This is a great salad to store in mason jars for grab and go lunches, like I did with my LAYERED 7 BEAN SALAD IN A JAR recipe.
