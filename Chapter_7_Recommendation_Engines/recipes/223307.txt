Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups peanut butter
2/3 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or more to taste
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
Beat peanut butter and butter together with an electric mixer until creamy and blended. Add white sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix on low speed until just blended.
Whisk flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Fold flour mixture into peanut butter mixture until blended. Pour batter into prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges of the brownies are crisp and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean, 35 to 45 minutes.
