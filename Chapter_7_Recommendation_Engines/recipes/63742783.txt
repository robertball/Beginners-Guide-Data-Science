Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 onion, chopped
1 cup cooked brown rice
1 cup raw almonds
1 cup raw cashews
1/2 pound mushrooms, chopped
1 (2.25 ounce) can black olives
1 large clove garlic, chopped
1 cup Parmesan cheese
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/4 cup ground flaxseed
1 teaspoon vegetable bouillon base (such as Better Than BouillonÂ®)
1 dash Worcestershire sauce

Directions:
Process pinto beans, onion, brown rice, almonds, cashews, mushrooms, black olives, and garlic in batches in a food processor until completely chopped; transfer to a large mixing bowl.
Mix Parmesan cheese, egg, flaxseed, vegetable bouillon, and Worcestershire sauce into the bean mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Form bean mixture into 12 patties and arrange onto a non-stick baking sheet.
Bake burgers in preheated oven for 10 minutes, turn, and continue baking until cooked through, about 10 minutes more.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers in hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
