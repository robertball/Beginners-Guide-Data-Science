Ingredients:
3 Medium Ripe Avocados
1/4 Teaspoon Garlic Salt
1 Tablespoon Minced Onion
1 Teaspoon Creole Seasoning
1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice

Directions:
Cut the avocados into half and remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado and place into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Mash the avocado pulp using a fork. Add garlic salt, minced onion, creole seasoning and mix with fork for about one minute. Add lemon juice and mix with fork until lemon juice has completely blended with the avocado mix. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
Side Notes: Add 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and a dash of Tabasco sauce prior to chilling to kick it up a notch.
For larger servings multiply the ingredients X2. Prepare the same way.
