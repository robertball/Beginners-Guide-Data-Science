Ingredients:
Pastry for single-crust pie (9 inches)
4 eggs
1-1/3 cups half-and-half cream
1 cup mashed cooked butternut squash
1 cup mashed cooked sweet potato (about 1 medium)
1/2 cup honey
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Dash ground cloves
Whipped cream, optional

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll pastry dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. deep-dish pie plate. Trim pastry to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; flute edge.
In a large bowl, whisk eggs, cream, squash, sweet potato, honey, flour, salt and spices. Pour into pastry shell.
Bake 50-60 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cover edge loosely with foil during the last 15 minutes if needed to prevent overbrowning. Remove foil. Cool on a wire rack; serve within 2 hours or refrigerate and serve cold. If desired, top with whipped cream. Yield: 8 servings.
