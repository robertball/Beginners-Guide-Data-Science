Ingredients:
1 pound small new potatoes, halved
1 head garlic, cloves separated but not peeled
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Arrange potatoes and garlic cloves in a 9x13-inch pan. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and garlic cloves are soft, 30 to 40 minutes.
Remove from the oven. Squeeze garlic cloves to release roasted garlic onto the potatoes; discard garlic skins. Mix potatoes and garlic together.
