2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup water
4 large egg yolks
2 cups milk, heated
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Wisk together sugar, cornstarch, flour, water and yolks in a medium saucepan until blended. Wisk in milk; whisking constantly bring to a boil on medium-high heat (it may become thick before reaching a boil, if so turn to low and continue as directed). When reach a boil turn heat to low and cook for 2 minutes whisking constantly. Remove from heat and add vanilla, stirring until blended. Pour in dish, cover surface with plastic wrap (to prevent a skim) and let cool slightly then chill in refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight. Add to any recipe that requires custard.
