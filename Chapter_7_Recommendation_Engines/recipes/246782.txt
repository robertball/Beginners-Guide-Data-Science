3 tablespoons soy sauce
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
1 cup (1-inch) slices green onions
1 cup thinly sliced red cabbage
2 cups thinly sliced button mushrooms
1 zucchini, thinly sliced
2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles, cooked al dente
Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Mix together the gochujang, soy sauce, water, sesame oil and sugar in a large bowl until combined.
Place the sliced chicken, green onions, cabbage, mushrooms, zucchini and cooked ramen noodles into the large bowl with the gochujang mixture and toss until coated.
Place a 1 1/2 to 2 feet long sheet of Reynolds Wrap(R) Aluminum Foil on a table and place 1/4 of the ramen noodle mixture into the center of the foil. Fold up the ends and then the outside to create a foil packet.
Repeat the process 3 more times and place the foil packets on a cookie sheet tray.
