Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) can BUSH'S速 Pinto Beans, drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
8 small eggs, lightly beaten
8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 cup fresh tomato salsa
1 avocado, diced
1/2 cup sliced green onions
Salt and pepper, to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
Heat beans in a medium sauce pot. Set aside.
Heat a nonstick large pan over medium heat. Add olive oil and eggs. Using a spatula, cook and stir until eggs are scrambled. Season with salt and pepper.
Spread the pinto beans in the lower section of the tortilla; top with cheese and eggs. Place salsa and avocadoes on top. Garnish with sliced green onions.
Fold the outer 1/2-inch left and right sides of the tortilla in.  This will help keep the filling inside once you roll your tortilla into a burrito.
Warm completed burritos in the oven for 5-10 minutes.
