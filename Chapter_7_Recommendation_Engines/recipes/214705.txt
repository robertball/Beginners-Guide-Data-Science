Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 cup water
3 eggs
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant coconut cream pudding mix
1 tablespoon rum-flavored extract
1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, undrained
2 tablespoons flaked coconut
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant coconut cream pudding mix
1/2 cup milk
1 (8 ounce) container extra-creamy frozen whipped topping, thawed
1/4 cup flaked coconut
1 tablespoon coconut extract
1 teaspoon rum-flavored extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray, or butter the pan well and coat inside with flour to prevent sticking.
Beat the cake mix, water, eggs, vegetable oil, 1 package of coconut cream pudding mix, and 1 tablespoon of rum extract in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the crushed pineapple. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the cake has risen, turned golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the cake to room temperature in the pan on a wire rack, about 30 minutes.
While the cake is baking, spread 2 tablespoons of flaked coconut onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Remove the coconut, allow to cool, and set aside.
To make frosting, whisk 1 package coconut cream pudding mix with milk until the mixture turns thick and creamy, about 2 minutes. Gently fold in the whipped topping, 1/4 cup flaked coconut, coconut extract, and 1 teaspoon of rum extract. Frost the cake, and sprinkle toasted coconut on top. Keep refrigerated.

Description: 
I know there are a lot of variations for this kind of cake, but I experimented a little and found a recipe that my family really likes. I hope yours does too. It's flavorful without being overpowering like some other recipes I've tried like this. It doesn't last long in our house!
