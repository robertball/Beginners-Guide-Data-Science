Ingredients:
1 pound of sausage
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 cups crusty bread, cubed
2 cups grated Cheddar cheese
14 eggs
2 1/2 cups milk
1 bell pepper (any color), diced
6 mushrooms, sliced
1/2 onion, diced
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Sautee vegetables for a few minutes.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Melt butter in the microwave, or in a small pan on the stove over low heat. Spray a 9x12 inch baking dish with vegetable spray. Place bread cubes in the bottom of the dish, and drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.
Crack the eggs into a bowl, whisking to break up the yolks. Add milk, peppers, mustard, salt, and pepper, and beat until well-combined. Pour over the bread and cheese, and sprinkle with crumbled sausage.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to stand 10 minutes before serving.
