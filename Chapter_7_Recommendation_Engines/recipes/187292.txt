Orange Cracker Apricot Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons orange juice
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup whole-wheat cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1/4 cup apricot preserves

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
Whisk together the orange juice, mustard, and salt in a small bowl. Mix together the cracker crumbs, orange zest, and black pepper on a plate. Coat each chicken thigh in the orange juice mixture and then press into the cracker crumb mixture to cover both sides completely. Place the breaded thighs on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes; flip and continue baking until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Switch the oven setting to 'Broil.'
Top each thigh with 1 tablespoon of the apricot preserves and place beneath the oven's broiler until the preserves begin to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. When the chicken looks like it is starting to burn it is done.

Description: 
This recipe makes very moist chicken thighs breaded with cracker crumbs and coated in apricot preserves.  I make this at least once every two weeks.
