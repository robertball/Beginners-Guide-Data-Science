Ingredients:
4 palm-sized charcoal steaks
2 large tomatoes
3 stalks celery with leaves
1/2 white onion
2 T. worchestershire
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black peppercorns

Directions:
Chunk your tomato, celery and onion into 1" pieces and place in a non-reactive bowl.  Mince your garlic, sprinkle your salt and pepper over top and use the back of your knife to crush it against the cutting board, turning it into a paste.  Put garlic paste into a small bowl and combine with worchestershire sauce, sprinkle over vegetables and set in the refrigerator to marinade overnight.
The next day, place half of your vegetable mixture in the bottom of a crockpot.  Place steaks on top of that, and pour rest of vegetable mixture on top.  Set on low for 8 hours.

Description: 
It's called fresh because there is nothing out of a can about this recipe, and it's a nice change of pace from the normal swiss steak.  To keep this GMO-free, use organic veggies and grass fed beef.
