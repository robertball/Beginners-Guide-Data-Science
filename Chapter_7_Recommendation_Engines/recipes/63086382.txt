Ingredients:
3 lbs onions (or more, see note*)
1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil
1 c. dry white wine
1 tbsp sugar
4 cloves fresh garlic, minced
1 lb spaghetti or linguine
salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
1/3 c. fresh flat leaf parsley, chopped
romano (or parmesian) cheese, grated

Directions:
slice the onions as thin as you can.  Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions.  The onions will nearly fill the pan.  Cover the pan.  Turn onions every 3-4 minutes and continue to cook until very tender; about 30 minutes.  Pour in the wine.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Add garlic.  Turn heat to low. Simmer uncovered until the onions are golden, about 45 minutes.  About 15 minutes before onions are done, put water on to boil for cooking pasta.  Cook spaghetti according to package instructions.  Drain.  When onions are a deep golden hue and the wine has cooked off add salt and pepper and cooked spaghetti., parsley and cheese.  Serve immediately with garlic bread, cooked spinach and a fresh fruit salad.
