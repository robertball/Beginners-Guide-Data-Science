Ingredients:
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 bullion cube (beef or chicken)
1/2 cup bacon drippings
4 cups whole wheat flour
1 cup wheat germ
1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or whatever you and your dog prefer)
6 strips cooked, crumbled bacon

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
Heat water in glass bowl or measuring cup in microwave until boiling. Add bullion cube and stir until dissolved to make a broth. Allow to cool slightly.
Beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in milk. Add broth and bacon fat and mix until well blended.
Gradually stir in flour until just mixed. Add wheat germ, shredded cheese, and crumbled bacon and mix well.
Scoop dough by rounded tablespoons and form into balls. (It helps to wet your hands for this step.) Place 2 inches apart on cookie sheets. Press to flatten with your hand.
Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes.
Cool on racks. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator or freeze.
