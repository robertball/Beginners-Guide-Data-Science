3 eggs
1 large can cherry pie filling
1 batch cocoa butter cream frosting

Preheat oven to 350.
Combine cake mix, eggs and cherry pie filling.  Most cake mixes will call for oil, but you should leave it out.
Bake cake in two 9 inch pans for 30-35 minutes.  Cool cakes and remove from pans.
Frost one cake.  Dice cherries and sprinkle on top.  Place the second cake on top.  Frost top and sides.  Decorate with whole cherries.
