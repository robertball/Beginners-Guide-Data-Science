Ingredients:
Dinomite's Fluffy Bites! (Vegan!)
Created for Team SubTextuals GIsHWheS Team!
2 Cups Unbleached All Purpose Flour
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/2 tsp Sea Salt
1 Cup *Vegan Sugar
1 Cup **Unsweetened Almondmilk
1/2 Cup Coconut Oil, melted too room temp. (or preferred cooking oil)
1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
1 tsp Vanilla
1/2 cup ***Vegan Chocolate Chips
Chocolate Frosting:
1 cup vegan chocolate chips.
Optional:
Vegan marshmallow fluff (Ricemallow, Dandies, or Sweet n' Sara.. or homemade if you're brave enough!)

Directions:
* I use Florida Crystals, but most organic unrefined sugars are vegan (not processed with animal bone char). Other popular brands are Wholesome, Trader Joe's Organic sugar, and Sugar in the Raw.
** Use any milk substitute. I use unsweetened for less sugar overall.
*** Many store brand semi-sweet chocolate chips are vegan, check the labels for dairy. Popular vegan brands are Equal Exchange, Enjoy Life.
Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Mix 1 tsp apple cider vinegar with 1 cup of milk substitute and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients together including sugar.
In a separate bowl, mix all wet ingredients including "milk" mixture.
Combine just mixed so there's no powder left but stop mixing as soon as it's all combined as not to over mix.
If you have a mini muffin pan, rub a little more coconut oil in pan so you don't have to use wrappers, fill each spot and pop in the oven for 15 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean in the center muffin.
If you don't have a mini muffin pan you can line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and spoon batter into little cookies! They are "bites" after all :) Also bake for 15 minutes.
When the cookies are done and cooling, melt 1 cup of chocolate chips using double boiler method (google it, it's easy!).
If you want, add the marshmallow fluff on top of each bite, then spoon dollops of chocolate over each bite so and spread with the back of the spoon. :)
Let cool and enjoy!! Happy Gishing!
