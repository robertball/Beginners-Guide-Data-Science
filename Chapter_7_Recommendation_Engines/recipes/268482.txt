Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
6 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 stick unsalted butter, frozen
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 egg
1 tablespoon rose water (such as Nielsen-Massey)
1 cup frozen raspberries
2 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed
2 tablespoons raspberry-flavored sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.
Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl.
Grate in 1/3 of the butter using the large holes of a box grater. Toss lightly with your fingertips until coated with flour. Repeat twice more with remaining butter.
Whisk 1/2 cup cream, egg, and rose water together in a small bowl with a fork. Pour over the flour-butter mixture. Mix with a fork just until large clumps of dough form. Gently mix in raspberries.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Bring together and gently pat into a round about 3/4-inch thick. Cut into 8 wedges with a sharp knife.
Arrange wedges on the baking sheet. Brush tops with 2 tablespoons cream and sprinkle with raspberry sugar.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

Description: 
I love the combination of raspberry and rose! I've tried it in cookies and turnovers and recently decided to adapt a scone recipe to include both. These are lovely with a cup of floral tea. Sprinkle dried rose petals on top for a pretty presentation.
