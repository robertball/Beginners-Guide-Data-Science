Ingredients:
1 egg
2 teaspoons water
12 frozen puff pastry shells, thawed
1/3 cup strawberry preserves
2 pints fresh strawberries, sliced
4 kiwis, peeled and seeded
2 tablespoons honey
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar

Directions:
Beat together the egg and water in a bowl. Brush the puff pastry shells with the egg mixture, and bake shells according to package directions.
Melt the preserves in a saucepan over low heat.  Remove from heat, and stir in the strawberry slices.
In a food processor, blend the kiwis and honey until smooth. In a large bowl, beat together the cream and sugar until stiff peaks form.
Fill each puff pastry shell with strawberries, drizzle with kiwi sauce, and top with whipped cream to serve.

Description: 
Glazed strawberries in puff pastry shells, topped with kiwi sauce and home made whipped cream. I always see strawberry and kiwi paired together in drink mixes and candies. I wanted to make something that used the actual fruits together. This worked perfectly. Rave reviews!
