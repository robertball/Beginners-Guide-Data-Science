Ingredients:
12 lemons
2 750-ml bottles 100 proof vodka, divided use
2 cups water
2 cups sugar

Directions:
Remove the yellow part of the lemon peel with a sharp peeler or fine grater, carefully avoiding the bitter white pith.
Put yellow peels in a jar, add one bottle vodka, and seal tightly.
Steep until the peels lose their color, at least two weeks.
Boil water and sugar in a saucepan until liquid turns clear; cool.
Strain vodka from the peels and mix it with remaining vodka and syrup.
Let flavors marry one week.
Store in freezer or dark pantry.
