Ingredients:
1 tsp celery seeds
1 Tbsp coarse sea salt
2 Tbsp sweet Hungarian paprika
1 tsp granulated garlic
2 1/2 lb baby back ribs
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp liquid smoke

Directions:
Mash the celery seeds and salt together with a mortar and pestle until the celery seeds looked pretty powdery. Add the paprika and garlic powder, and stir together well.
Lay each rack of ribs on a large, rimmed baking sheet (I put them on parchment for easier clean-up), then sprinkle them all over with the rub, massage it into both sides. Refrigerate them for a few hours (overnight is better).  Place in a 275 oven to bake for 3-4 hours (or 4-5 for St. Louis). The longer the better: you want all the fat and connective tissue melted so that the ribs are falling apart. If at any point the ribs seem to be browning excessively, turn the heat down to 250.
In a small bowl, combine vinegar, salt and liquid smoke.  About 1 hour before ribs are done, brush basting mixture over ribs every 15 minutes.  Cut ribs into serving pieces and give them one last brush and finish 15 minutes.  Allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.
When the ribs are truly and totally falling apart (try to lift the rack with a pair of tongs and see if it wants to come apart) theyâ€™re done. Use a sharp, heavy knife to cut the racks into individual ribs, give them one last brush with the remaining vinegar mixture, and serve with lots of napkins.
