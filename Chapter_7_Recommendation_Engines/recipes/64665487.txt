Authentic Pork Carnitas Recipe

Ingredients:
4 pounds boneless pork butt (or shoulder)
3-4 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon dried oregano (or Mexican oregano)
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 large brown or white onion, cut into wedges
8 cloves garlic, smashed
2 limes, juiced
2 large oranges, juiced (or 3/4 cup natural orange juice)
3/4 cup Coke (Mexican Coke is ideal)*
2 bay leaves

Directions:
Rinse and pat pork dry  with a paper towel before cutting into chunks.
Coat chunks of pork in a rub of salt, pepper, oregano and cumin.  I usually add a tablespoon of my favorite season-all fajita type spice mix to the rub as well.
In the bowl of a 6-quart slow cooker, add pork, onion, garlic, lime juice, orange juice, coke, and bay leaves.
Cover and cook on low heat setting for 8-10 hours, or high heat for 5-6 hours (until the meat falls apart).
Remove pork and shred with two forks (DO NOT DISCARD THE LIQUID!)
Transfer the pork to a baking sheet lightly sprayed with cooking oil spray (or lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper).
Pour 1 ladle full (about 1 cup) of the liquid from the slow cooker over the pork to season. Broil for 5-10 minutes on high heat until the meat becomes golden browned and crispy on the edges.
Season with a little extra salt and pepper if desired. Pour over more of the slow cooker juices once the meat has crisped for added flavor, just before serving! Serve in Tacos, Burritos, or in a salad!
