Ingredients:
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, de-seeded and minced
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1/2 green bell pepper, chopped
1/2 orange bell pepper, chopped
1/3 cup finely shredded fresh cilantro leaves
1 1/2  cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced (feel free to use up to 2 cups)
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions:
Mix all ingredients and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.  This salsa is exceptional the day after, so if you have patience, make it the night before you plan to serve :)
