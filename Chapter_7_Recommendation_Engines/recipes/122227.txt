Directions:
Separate crescent rolls; spread with butter.  In a bowl, combine coconut, sugar and orange peel.  Set aside 2 tablespoons for topping.  Sprinkle remaining coconut mixture over butter.  Roll up and place, point side down, on a greased baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees F for 16-18 minutes or until golden brown.
Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil; boil for 3 minutes or until mixture is glossy.  Cool slightly; pour over warm rolls.  Sprinkle with reserved coconut mixture.
