Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package orzo pasta
1 small red bell pepper, chopped
1 small yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 bunch green onions, chopped
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 (8.75 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 cup chopped cilantro leaves
salt to taste
pepper to taste
5 limes, juiced
6 tablespoons canola oil

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Place the drained orzo in a large salad bowl, and fold in the red pepper, yellow pepper, green onions, red onion, chickpeas, kidney beans, black beans, corn, cilantro, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the lime juice and oil over the salad, toss to coat, and refrigerate at least 2 hours to chill before serving.
