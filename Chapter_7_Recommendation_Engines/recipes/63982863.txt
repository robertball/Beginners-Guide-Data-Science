40 Cloves of Garlic Soup Recipe

Ingredients:
50 cloves of garlic, unpeeled + 30 garlic cloves, peeled
4 tbsp. olive oil
2 tbsp. butter
4 1/2 cups sliced onions
3 tsp. fresh thyme
6 cups chicken broth
1 cup heavy whipping cream
kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
shredded Parmesan cheese
lemon wedges

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the tops off of your garlic bulbs and separate out the cloves, making sure each clove has an end chopped off (this will help with squeezing out the roasted garlic later on).
Place the 50 cloves in a glass baking dish.  Pour the olive oil over the top, sprinkle with salt and pepper and toss to coat.  Cover the dish with foil and bake about 45 minutes.  Let cool.
Squeeze the roasted garlic between your fingertips to release the garlic and discard the peel.  Set the garlic aside.
In large saucepan, melt the butter and add onions and thyme.  Cook about 5 minutes until onions are soft and translucent.  Add both the roasted garlic and raw garlic and cook, stirring about 3 minutes.
Add stock and continue cooking until it boils.  Reduce heat and simmer uncovered about 20 minutes.  Remove and let cool slightly.
Puree soup in blender until smooth.
Return soup to pan and stir in heavy cream.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Sprinkle parmesan cheese into each bowl and ladle the soup over the top.  Squeeze one lemon wedge over each bowl and sprinkle with more thyme if desired.
