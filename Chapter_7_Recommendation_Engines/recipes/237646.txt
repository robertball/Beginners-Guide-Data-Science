Ingredients:
2/3 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon vinegar
1 cup white sugar
10 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 cup oats
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup mashed bananas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Mix milk and vinegar together in a bowl.
Stir white sugar, vegetable oil, milk mixture, brown sugar, and butter together in a bowl; add baking soda and baking powder and stir. Mix oats into sugar mixture. Stir flour, 1 cup at a time, into sugar-oat mixture until batter is evenly combined; fold in bananas. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
My mom made this cake for Mother's Day. The cake was in the oven baking. When she realized she didn't add the eggs or salt the recipe called for, she thought it would screw up the cake. But the cake came out so moist and yummy I made her write down the recipe, skipping the eggs and salt. She frosts it with vanilla frosting while the cake is still warm to give it a glazed effect. My family loves this cake.
