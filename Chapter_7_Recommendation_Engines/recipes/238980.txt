Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter
6 cups crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)
1 (11 ounce) package butterscotch chips
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 (11 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Grease bottom and the lower 1 inch of the sides of a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter. Pour cereal into the prepared dish.
Mix butterscotch chips and peanut butter together in a bowl and melt in a microwave oven, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes; pour over cereal and stir until cereal is coated. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to compact mixture into the dish.
Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 10 minutes.
Melt the chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Spread over the top of the bars with a spatula.
Refrigerate bars again until the chocolate is firmed, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This is what I grew up with in lieu of 'scotcheroos'. They are simpler to make and pack a much richer flavor which means when I bite into similar recipes (hoping for this flavor), I am disappointed and want my homemade version!
