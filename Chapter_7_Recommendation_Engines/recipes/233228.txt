Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 head cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped
4 cups water
1 (26 ounce) can tomato soup (such as Campbell's®)

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer beef mixture to a bowl.
Put cabbage and water into the skillet; bring water to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook cabbage at a simmer until soft, about 30 minutes.
Stir beef mixture and tomato soup into the cabbage mixture; cook until hot, about 5 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a restaurant in Michigan. For tastier soup use chicken broth instead of water, but I don't; it costs more. I use Campbell's® soup because it has a better flavor.
