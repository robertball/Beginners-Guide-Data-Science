Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups Safeway Mayonnaise
2 teaspoons finely shredded lemon peel
4 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced fresh dill weed
4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
1 tablespoon Safeway Dijon Mustard
1 O Organicsâ„¢ Large Egg
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
3 cups soft bread crumbs
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1/4 cup finely chopped green onion
4 (6 ounce) cans well-drained shelled cooked crab

Directions:
To prepare aioli, combine 1 cup of mayonnaise, lemon peel and juice, dill, and garlic. Cover and refrigerate.
For crab cakes, combine remaining mayonnaise, mustard, egg, cayenne, 1 cup bread crumbs, and chopped vegetables in a large bowl. Gently stir in crab.
Place 2 cups bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Shape crab into small cakes (about 1 1/2-inch diameter); coat with bread crumbs, pressing gently to adhere. Place apart in two oiled 12- by 17-inch rimmed baking pans. Baked in a 500 degrees F oven for 7 minutes, switch pan positions, and continue baking until golden brown, about 7 minutes longer. Serve hot with aioli.
