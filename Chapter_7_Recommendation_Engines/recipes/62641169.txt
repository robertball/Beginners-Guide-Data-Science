1 16-oz can of pork & beans, undrained
Salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Put dry navy beans in a large bowl, cover with water, and soak overnight.
Drain water from the navy beans, put beans into a dutch oven, add the ham bone, and fresh water to cover the meat and beans.  Add carrots, celery, onion, and can of tomatoes.
Cook over medium heat until beans soften and soup starts to thicken.  Add the can of pork and beans, salt and pepper to taste.  Remove the ham bone from the soup, pull off the meat and add the meat back to the pot.  Let soup simmer for about another 15 minutes.

Description: 
Hearty bean soup with a burst of tomato flavor.  May sound odd, but adding a can of pork and beans to this homemade soup really kicks up the flavor.  This is the way my mother-in-law made her bean soup, and we've continued her tradition.
