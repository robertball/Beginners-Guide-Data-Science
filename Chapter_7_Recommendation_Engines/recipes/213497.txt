Ingredients:
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 pork chops
1 cup water
1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix
2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons vinegar
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork chops on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
Whisk together the water, brown gravy mix, brown sugar, vinegar, and garlic powder in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Pour the gravy mixture over the browned pork chops. Cover the skillet, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the chops are tender, about 30 minutes.
