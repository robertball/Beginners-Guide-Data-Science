Ingredients:
8 medium baking potatoes (about 8 ounces each)
1/2 C  butter, cubed
2/3 C  sour cream
2/3 C  milk
1 tsp salt
3/4 tsp pepper
10 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled, divided
2  C (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese, divided
4 green onions, chopped, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Scrub potatoes; pierce several times with a skewer.  Bake 45-60 minutes or until tender.  Remove from oven; reduce oven setting to 350°.
When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut each potato lengthwise in half. Scoop out pulp and place in a large bowl; discard shells. Mash potato with butter; stir in sour cream, milk, salt and pepper.
Reserve 1/4 C crumbled bacon for topping. Gently fold remaining bacon, 1 C cheese and half of the green onions into potato mixture (do not overmix).
Transfer to a greased 11x7-in. baking dish. Top with the remaining cheese and green onions; sprinkle with reserved bacon. Bake 15-20 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Yield: 12 servings (2/3 cup each).
