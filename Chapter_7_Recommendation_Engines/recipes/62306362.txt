Ingredients:
4 4oz fish fillets (I used orange roughy)
1 T. dijon mustard
1 T. lite mayo or Miracle Whip
1/4 c. panko (I used seasoned panko)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place fish fillets on a baking sheet.
Stir together the mustard and mayo in a small bowl.  Brush the mustard mixture on the top surface of the fillets.  Sprinkle with the panko.
Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the fillets are firm to touch.  Turn on the broiler and broil the fish about 8" from the heat source until the panko is browned, about 3 minutes.
