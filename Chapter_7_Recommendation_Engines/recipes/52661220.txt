Description: 
These are the biscuit's that were handed down to me by my Mom, Alma. She learned it from her Mom, Dora. Alma was only 6 years old when she made them for the first time on the ranch. She made them for her Father, Gordon and 14 ranch hands. They all loved them. This recipe doubles and triples very nicely, for large groups.Modified from: Mom's Buttermilk Biscuits
