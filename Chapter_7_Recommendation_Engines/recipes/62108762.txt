Ingredients:
1 whole chicken, cut up
1 cup milk
1/4 cup Franks Red Hot Sauce
2 cups flour
salt to taste
pepper to taste
1 tbsp paprika
1 medium sized onion, sliced
Oil for frying

Directions:
Mix milk and Franks Red Hot Sauce together.  Set aside.  Mix together flour, salt, pepper, & paprika.  Dredge chicken in flour, then dip in milk mixture, and dredge again in flour.  You can double coat if you like a thicker crust.
Heat oil in pan over medium high heat.  When hot, add onion slices.  After the onion slices start to brown, add the chicken.  Do not remove onions from oil!  Cook until brown, and juices run clear - about 10 minutes on each side over med-high heat.  Remove from oil, and place chicken on paper towel lined plate.  Salt & pepper to taste.  Let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
To make chicken gravy, reserve 2 tablespoons oil from frying.  Add 2 tablespoons flour, and stir over medium heat for 2 minutes making sure you scrape the brown bits off the bottom of the pan.  Add 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup milk.  Continue cooking on medium/high heat til thickened.  Salt and pepper to taste.

Description: 
The secret to this recipe is what frys with the chicken! I created this recipe some years ago - and it has been my recipe for fried chicken since.  It is the only way my husband will eat fried chicken, and everyone that comes over for dinner and has it raves on and on about it.
