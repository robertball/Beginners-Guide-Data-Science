Ingredients:
1 Devil's Food cake mix
1 jar of Smuckers Carmel ice cream topping
1 can of sweetened condensed milk
1 tub of Cool Whip
5-7 Heath candy bars

Directions:
Bake Devil's Food cake according to package direction in a 9 x 13 baking dish.
Remove from oven.  While cake is still hot, punch 5-8 holes in the cake using the handle of a wooden spoon.  Immediately pour the ice cream topping and sweetened condensed milk over the cake, allowing them to seep into the holes.
Allow cake to cool completely (approximately 1 hour).
Once cake is cool, spread cool whip over top of cake.  Crumble Heath candy bars over top of cake (use as many as desired).  Refrigerate cake until time to serve, as well as any leftovers.
