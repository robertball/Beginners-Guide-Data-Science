Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) standing beef rib roast
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
1 cup red wine
2 cups beef stock

Directions:
Allow roast to stand at room temperature for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the salt, pepper and garlic powder, and rosemary in a small cup. Place the roast on a rack in a roasting pan so that the fatty side is up and the rib side is on the bottom. Rub the seasoning onto the roast.
Roast for 1 hour in the preheated oven. Turn the oven off and leave the roast inside. Do not open the door. Leave it in there for 3 hours. 30 to 40 minutes before serving, turn the oven back on at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) to reheat the roast. Remove from the oven when internal temperature reaches 120-125 degrees F and let rest for 15-20 minutes. Temperature will rise 10 degrees as it rests, more if a larger roast.  130 degrees is rare at the center.
Place the roasting pan on top of the stove over 2 burners set on high heat. Add the wine to the pan drippings in the pan and cook over high heat until reduced, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Transfer to normal sauce pan once drippings recovered.  Add the stock and cook until reduced by half.
