Ingredients:
2 ripe bananas, mashed
3 cups chunky applesauce, divided in half
1 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup oil
3 eggs
1-1/2 tsp vanilla
1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 cup quick cook whole grain oats
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 cup golden raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  Prepare 2 miniloaf (8 loaf per pan sized) pans (spray with nonstick spray).
Mix together 1-1/2 cups of the applesauce, the peanut butter, mashed bananas, vanilla, eggs, and oil.
Add 1 cup of the flour.  Mix well (lumps should still be visible though.)
Add the remaining flour and the oats.  Mixture should be between a cake batter and biscuit dough.  Add additional applesauce as needed for consistency.  (Wheat flour can vary in absorption, so just add until it's like a very thick cake batter with lumps.)
Add sugar, salt, and baking powder, mixing as added.
Fold in the dried fruit and nuts.  Mix until distributed well.
Fill prepared pans about 2/3 full.
To avoid potentially burned bottoms - place pan on cookie sheet.
Bake for 20 minutes, rotate, and bake for another 15-25 minutes (my air bake cookie sheets and a temperamental oven make for longer times for me.)
Loaves are done when toothpick comes out clean, and top springs back to touch.
Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before turning out of pans.
