Ingredients:
6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
⅓ cup butter, melted
⅓ cup honey
2 tablespoons prepared mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon curry powder

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk butter, honey, mustard, salt, and curry powder together in a bowl until smooth; pour sauce evenly over chicken.
Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and chicken is no longer pink inside, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
