Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
2 cups self-rising flour
1/4 cup white sugar, plus more for topping
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup heavy whipping cream, plus more for brushing
4 pints fresh strawberries, hulled and quartered
1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon white sugar
3 drops vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Melt butter over medium heat in small saucepan. Stir continually, letting foam dissipate, just until butter begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Whisk together self-rising flour and 1/4 cup white sugar in a bowl. Add milk, 1/4 cup cream, and toasted butter. Mix just until ingredients come together. Wad up dough and transfer to floured surface. Press or roll dough into a rectangle about 1-inch thick. Cut in half lengthwise, and then cut each half into 3 portions. Place shortcake pieces on prepared baking sheet. Brush with cream; sprinkle with sugar.
Bake in preheated oven until gold brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer shortcakes to a rack to cool completely.
Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; stir until sugar begins to dissolve. Refrigerate until juice from berries is extracted, about 1 hour.
Whip 3/4 cup cream with 1 tablespoon sugar and a few drops of vanilla in bowl with an electric mixer.
Split biscuit in half. Place bottom half in a bowl. Spoon strawberries and juice over shortbread half. Top with shortbread top and spoon on more strawberries and juice over the shortbread. Finish with a dollop of whipped cream.

Description: 
For this strawberry shortcake recipe, I modified the way my grandfather made his and used self-rising flour and toasted butter for a nutty flavor. I'm hoping Armand Cianfoni would approve.
