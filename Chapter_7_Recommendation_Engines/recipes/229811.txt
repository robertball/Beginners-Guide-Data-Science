Ingredients:
1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed
1 (16 ounce) bottle zesty Italian-style salad dressing
3 dashes hot sauce, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook Brussels sprouts in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Pour Italian dressing and hot sauce over Brussels sprouts; toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally, for 4 hours.

Description: 
Very simple but delicious way to serve Brussels sprouts. If you have time, you may want to make your own Italian dressing; if not, the bottled kind works just fine. We like them as a side dish or even mixed into a tossed salad.
