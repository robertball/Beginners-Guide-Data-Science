Description: 
My family loved this recipe and it helped that it was a bit easier to prepare. I did have to double the recipe for my family and I also added  one half of a medium onion, diced and added to the butter in the saucepan. Cook the onion until clear and then proceed with the original recipe directions. I also melted an additional  2 tablespoons butter before baking and mixed with aprox. 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (until crumbly) and sprinkled on top of casserole. It adds a little flavor and gives it a finished look. My family loved it! (Add a dash of paprika for an extra flair!)Modified from: Traditional Macaroni and Cheese
