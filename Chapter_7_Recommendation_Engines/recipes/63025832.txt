Ingredients:
4 C Self Rising Flour
1/2 Cup yellow cornmeal
1 Cup butter, cold, but cut into pieces
2 C buttermilk
1/4 Cup sweet milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees
Combine flour and cornmeal.
Cut butter into the flour until it looks like very fine crumbs.  Do not leave any large pieces of butter.
Add milk, a bit at a time, until flour mixture is just moistened--do not make dough "wet".
Pat or roll dough 1/2 to 1" thick.
Cut with a 2" biscuit cutter; bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or til golden brown.
