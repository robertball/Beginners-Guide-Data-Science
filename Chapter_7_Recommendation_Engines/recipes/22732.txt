Ingredients:
1 cup butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 onions, minced
1 green bell pepper, diced
3 cloves garlic, diced
16 ounces cleaned crawfish tails
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/8 teaspoon hot sauce
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
In a stock pot, melt butter over medium heat. When butter is bubbling, add flour to make a roux, stirring constantly to prevent or remove any lumps. Cook the roux for 5 minutes. Do not brown.
Stir in onions and bell peppers; saute 10 minutes, or until onions are translucent. Add garlic, and saute for 3 minutes. Stir in crawfish tails. Slowly pour in enough water to reach a little thicker than soup-like consistency. Season with cumin, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce,  and salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
