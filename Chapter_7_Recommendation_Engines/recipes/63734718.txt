1-1/2 cups sliced carrots
1-1/2 cups frozen green peas
1-1/2 cups frozen corn
1     cup sliced celery
1     cup butter
1     cup all-purpose flour
1     teaspoon salt
1     tbsp black pepper

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)
In a saucepan, combine chicken broth, chicken, and veggies. Boil until chicken is fully cooked (15 minutes or so). Remove from heat, drain and set aside chicken and veggies while keeping chicken broth.
In the saucepan over medium heat, melt butter (add mushrooms to butter if desired). Stir in flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper italian seasoning and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and heavy cream. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Add in chicken and veggies and stir everything together. Cover bottom of dish with pie crust and add filling. Cover with top crust and seal edges. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
