Ingredients:
1 loaf Italian bread, cubed
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 cup pine nuts
1 cup sun-dried tomatoes
2 (16 ounce) packages mixed salad greens
4 green onions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Toss 3 cups cubed Italian bread with olive oil. Season with seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Spread out in a single layer in a well oiled 9x13 inch baking dish. Broil until toasted, turning to brown evenly.  Set croutons aside to cool.
Spread pine nuts on a baking sheet, place on bottom rack  of the oven, and toast under broiler. This should only take a few minutes, so watch carefully to prevent burning. Set aside to cool.
Soak sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, or until soft.  Drain, and slice.
In a large salad bowl, toss mixed greens with green onions. Top with croutons, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and feta.
