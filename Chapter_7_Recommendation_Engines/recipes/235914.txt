Ingredients:
1 pound boneless pork chops, thinly-cut (1/2-inch thick), cut into strips
1 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper (or smoked or plain paprika)
8 small corn tortillas, warmed
1 cup romaine lettuce, shredded
1 cup pico de gallo*
Light sour cream or crema, to taste

Directions:
In a medium sized bowl combine the honey, olive oil, lemon juice, soy sauce and ground chipotle pepper and whisk to combine. Add the sliced pork to the marinade and let it sit for 15 minutes.
Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the slices of pork to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, flipping with tongs in the middle of the cooking process. Once cooked, remove the pork to a plate and reserve.
Arrange 8 corn tortillas on a platter. Sprinkle each with equal amounts of shredded lettuce and pico de gallo. Arrange a few pieces of pork on top of each taco, and top with sour cream or crema if desired.
