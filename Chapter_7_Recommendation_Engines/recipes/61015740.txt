Ingredients:
1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck
1 (12 oz) package pork chorizo
2 (15 ounce) cans chili beans, in Mexican sauce
2 (15 ounce) cans black beans
2 (14.5 ounce) cans fire roasted diced tomatoes with juice
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 bottle of dark beer
2 green chile peppers, seeded and chopped
1 (1.5 ounce) package chili seasoning
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon hot sauce

Directions:
In a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck and sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.
Pour in the black beans, Mexican chili beans, fire roasted diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add the chile peppers, and beer. Season with chili powder, garlic powder, hot pepper sauce, and package of chili seasoning.  Stir to blend, then cover and simmer over low heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
After 2 hours, taste, and adjust salt, pepper, and chili powder if necessary. The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.

Description: 
This recipe is a condensed version of the original but equally satisfying. I switched the Italian sausage from the original recipe to pork chorizo which gives the chili a smokey flavor.  The chili tastes best if you make it a day before you plan to serve it.  This recipe cost me under $10.00 to make and feeds a hungry crowd.  Leftovers can easily be frozen.Modified from: Boilermaker Tailgate Chili
