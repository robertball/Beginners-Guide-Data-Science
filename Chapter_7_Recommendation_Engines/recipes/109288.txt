Ingredients:
6 1/4 cups water
1 cup condensed chicken broth
2 pounds dried pinto beans
5 cloves cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 red onion, chopped
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
salt, or to taste
1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese (optional)
1 (16 ounce) container pico de gallo (optional)

Directions:
Combine water, condensed chicken broth, beans, garlic, onion, and crushed red pepper flakes into a large saucepan; season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are soft, about 3 1/2 hours. You may need to add additional water to keep the beans from drying out.
Mash cooked beans with a potato masher to desired consistency. Stir in mozzarella and pico de gallo before serving.
