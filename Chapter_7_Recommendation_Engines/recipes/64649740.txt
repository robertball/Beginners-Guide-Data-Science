Zucchini Noodles Recipe

Ingredients:
6-8 medium zucchini (1-2 medium zucchini per person)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 215 degrees F.
Peel zucchini and remove stems.
Using the vegetable peeler, scrape strips off the entire length of each zucchini. For easier peeling, insert a metal shish kebab skewer down the center and hold the skewer while scraping "noodles" from the zucchini. Keep peeling until the entire zucchini is in shreds or, if zucchini seeds are a problem, stop when you reach seeds and freeze remaining chunks for broth.
Pile zucchini "noodles" on a buttered baking sheet and cook in preheated oven for about 25 minutes.  The low temperature cooks the zucchini while evaporating as much excess water as possible.
Serve topped with plain butter and a little salt or with any of your favorite sauces.
