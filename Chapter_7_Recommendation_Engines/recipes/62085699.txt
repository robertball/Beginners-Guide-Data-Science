Ingredients:
2 lbs. ground beef
1/2 teaspoon Cavender's Greek Seasoning
1/2 teaspoon Fiesta Brand Fajita Seasoning
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pkg. 8 hotdogs
16 slices uncooked bacon
24 toothpicks

Directions:
Cavender's and Fajita seasoning can be found at Wal-Mart, also come salt-free.
Combine ground beef and seasonings, mixing well.  Roll beef out into a log shape on waxed paper and cut into 8 equal pieces.  Flatten each piece into thin 'burgers' large enough to completely surround the hotdog.
Pat hotdogs dry with paper towels; this will allow the ground beef to better seal around them.  'Mold' the beef completely around the hotdogs while forcing the air from between the burger and dog.
Wrap each dog with two slices of bacon, usually one slice will go around the dog about 1/2 way; continue with second slice, secure with toothpicks.
Grill until the bacon is crisp turning often, remove toothpicks and serve on soft hoagie buns with your favorite condiment.
We usually eat ours with mayonnaise topped with saut√©ed onions.

Description: 
I got this idea from watching the Bill Cosby show years ago.  Mr. Cosby often mentioned he wanted a Bacon Burger Dog, sounded interesting and fun to me so came up with this recipe.  These are very filling and not many people can eat more than one.  They take a little while to assemble, however time well spent.  This is a Dog full of flavor and like no other!
