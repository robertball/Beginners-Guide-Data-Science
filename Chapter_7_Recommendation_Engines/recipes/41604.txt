Ingredients:
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
4 pounds pork shoulder roast
1/2 cup white wine
3 cups water
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
3 tablespoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 (28 ounce) cans tomato puree
6 cups water
1/4 cup white sugar

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large stock pot over medium heat. Saute onions and garlic until lightly browned. Place pork shoulder in pot, and pour in 1/2 cup white wine and 3 cups water. In a small bowl, combine oregano, parsley, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Sprinkle 1/4 of spice mixture over pork. Cover, and cook for 30 minutes turning occasionally. Add water periodically if needed.
Pour in tomato puree. Fill cans with water, and pour in (about 6 cups). Stir in remaining spice mixture and the sugar. When liquid starts to bubble, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 4 to 5 hours. Stir occasionally, and adjust seasonings to taste.

Description: 
This recipe is a homemade spaghetti meat sauce that has been passed down to 4 generations of Sicilians. The recipe has been altered by each person to fit personal preference and taste. Fresh tomatoes can be put in the place of the puree but not recommended, due to the high acidity of the fresh tomatoes.
