Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks
1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 pound boneless beef round steak, cut into thin strips
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 medium sweet red pepper, thinly sliced
1/2 cup cut fresh green beans
1 tablespoon chopped green chilies
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 green onions, sliced
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
Drain the pineapple, reserving 1 cup pineapple and 3/4 cup juice. (Cover and refrigerate remaining pineapple for another use.) In a small bowl, combine the cilantro, soy sauce, ginger and reserved pineapple juice; mix well. Remove 3/4 cup; cover and refrigerate. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the beef and remaining marinade. Seal bag and turn to coat; refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Drain and discard marinade. Combine cornstarch and reserved juice mixture until smooth. In a skillet, stir-fry beef in oil for 5-6 minutes. Remove beef with a slotted spoon and keep warm. Add the red pepper, beans, chilies and garlic in skillet; stir-fry for 5 minutes.
Stir juice mixture; stir into skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute or until slightly thickened. Add onions, beef and the reserved pineapple; heat through. Serve over rice.
