Ingredients:
2 cups amaranth flour
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch dried basil
1 pinch rubbed sage
1 pinch dried thyme leaves
1 1/2 cups sparkling water
2 tablespoons olive oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a pizza pan.
Mix amaranth flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, sugar, salt, oregano, basil, sage, and thyme together in a large bowl. Pour in sparkling water and olive oil; mix until a sticky dough forms.
Spread dough over the prepared pan, using moistened hands to keep from sticking.
Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 20 minutes.
