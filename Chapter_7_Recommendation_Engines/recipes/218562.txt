Ingredients:
2 (10.5 ounce) cans cream of chicken soup
3 (14 ounce) cans chicken broth
3 cups shredded cooked chicken meat
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough

Directions:
Stir the cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, and shredded chicken meat together in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until it begins to simmer. Cut each biscuit into quarters, and gently stir into the simmering soup. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the biscuits are no longer doughy in the center, 10 to 15 minutes.
