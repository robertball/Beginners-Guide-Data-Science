Ingredients:
3/4 Cup 10 grain hot cereal blend (See cooks notes)
1 1/3 Cup boiling water
2 T honey
1 1/2 tsp yeast
1 1/2 T non- fat dry milk powder
2 T. Vital Wheat Gluten
2 - 2 1/4 Cup Whole Wheat White Flour
1 T Kosher salt
2 T Butter - melted and cooled to room temperature
1/4 C whole oatmeal, for topping

Directions:
Measure 10 grain hot cereal mix into your mixing bowl.  Add the boiling water.  Stir and allow the water to absorb and the cereal mix to cool to about 100 - 110 degrees.  The mixture will look like porridge.
Whisk together 2 cups of Whole Wheat White Flour and 2 T Vital Wheat Gluten - set aside.
When cereal has cooled, add honey and yeast and powdered milk - mix.
Add 1 1/2 cups of flour mixture and mix for 5 - 8  to develop the gluten.  Add another 1/2 cup flour and the salt - mix for another 5 -8 minutes.
Allow dough to rest for about 20 minutes to fully hydrate the flour.
Add the butter and mix until incorporated.
Add the remaining 1/4 cup flour a bit at a time if needed and knead until stretchy and smooth.   Add a little bit more flour if the dough is still too sticky and doesn't pull away from the sides of the bowl.  The dough should be tacky - not dry.
Turn dough into greased bowl and allow to rise until almost doubled in size.  ( 1 hour )
Preheat oven to 375
Dump dough onto work surface and shape into one big loaf (9 x 5) for sandwiches or one or two free formed loaves.  Score top of loaf.  Brush with water and sprinkle the loaves with oatmeal.
Cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with cooking spray and allow to rise until doubled in size.  30 - 40 minutes.
Bake bread at 375 for 25 - 30 minutes rotating once during baking or until the bread reaches 200 degree internal temperature.
