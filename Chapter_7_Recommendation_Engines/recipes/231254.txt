Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 (20 ounce) can apple pie filling
2 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)).
Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix apple pie filling, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract into dry ingredients to make a batter; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into prepared tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean or with moist crumbs, about 1 hour. Cool cake thoroughly in pan, at least 1 hour, before removing pan.
