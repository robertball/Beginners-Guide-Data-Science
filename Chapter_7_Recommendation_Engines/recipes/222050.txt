1 (14 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 teaspoon salt

Bring chicken broth, tomatoes, and salt to a boil in a medium saucepan; add rice. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until rice is cooked and liquid is absorbed, about 1 hour. Stir before serving.

Description: 
I like to use brown rice whenever possible, but Spanish rice recipes seem to all call for white. This recipe is the result of many attempts to come up with an easy yet spicy (Tex-Mex) version.
