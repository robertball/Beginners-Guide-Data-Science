Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
3 whole cloves
1 white onion, halved and thinly sliced
3 ounces tomato paste
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 pinch ground allspice
1 pinch salt
3 cups warm water, or as needed
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), drained
1/3 red bell pepper, chopped
2 cups fresh green beans, trimmed
1 cup frozen peas
1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and cloves; saute until cumin seeds swell, about 30 seconds. Discard cloves. Add onion to the pot and saute until lightly golden, about 5 minutes.
Combine tomato paste, curry powder, flour, turmeric, garlic powder, ginger, basil, allspice, and salt together in a bowl. Stir in 1 cup warm water.
Pour tomato mixture over onion in the pot; stir until combined and thick. Stir in additional water until curry reaches a saucy consistency. Stir in garbanzo beans and bell pepper. Reduce heat and simmer curry, 5 minutes. Add green beans and peas; season with rice wine vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Simmer curry, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Add additional water if curry appears too thick.
