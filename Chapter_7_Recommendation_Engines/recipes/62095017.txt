Description: 
This is my mothers summertime classic pasta salad, one bite of this takes me back to childhood...this is a good basic base recipe that you can make your own with additions like diced peppers or diced ham. I like to add crumbled bacon to mine when serving, for a Bacon wrapped shrimp salad!
