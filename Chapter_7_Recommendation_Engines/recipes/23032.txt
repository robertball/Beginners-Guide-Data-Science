Ingredients:
1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup pumpkin
2 eggs
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 (9 inch) unbaked deep dish pie crust

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually mix in 1/4 cup light corn syrup and vanilla extract, blending until smooth.
In a medium bowl, mix the pumpkin, eggs, evaporated milk, 1/4 cup light corn syrup, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and salt. Beat the mixture until smooth.
Place pie crust on a medium baking sheet and fill with the pumpkin mixture. Drop the cream cheese by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the pumpkin mixture. Using  a knife, swirl the mixtures, creating a marbled effect.
Bake 50 to 60 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.
