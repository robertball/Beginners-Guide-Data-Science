Ingredients:
2-3/4 tsp. allspice
1/4 cup and 1 TBL salt
3 TBL and 1-1/4 tsp garlic powder
2-1/2 TBL white sugar
1-3/4 tsp chipotle chile powder
1 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp dried thyme leaves
1 TBL and 3/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 TBL cayenne pepper (from 2-1/2 TBL)
1-3/4 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Place allspice, salt, garlic powder, sugar, chipotle powder, cloves, thyme, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon into a very large bowl. Mix together until well blended. Store in airtight containers.
To use, rub spice mix onto the meat of your choice, about 1 1/2 teaspoons per serving. For best results, marinate for at least an hour to allow the flavors of the rub to penetrate the meat.

Description: 
This is a dry Jamaican Jerk seasoning I use mostly on grilled chicken! You may want to give some away to friends because this recipe makes a lot! Use it as a dry rub on grilled chicken, fish, steak, or just about anything else.Modified from: Jamaican Jerk Dry Rub
