Ingredients:
3 lbs ground beef or other ground meat
1 bunch cilantro, chopped
3 onions, chopped
1/4 tsp white pepper
1/2 tsp cummin seeds
4 cloves garlic
1 finger fresh ginger
oil for frying
spring roll wrappers
lemon juice or fresh lemon (optional)

Directions:
Fry the meat with the onions and the next 6 ingredients in a little oil.  Drain and remove from heat.
Cut each spring roll wrapper in half.  Place a couple of spoonfuls of the meat mixture on each half, and fold the edges up around it to make a triangular shape.  Pinch the edges together so the filling doesn't leak out (if need be, make a paste from a little flour and water to use as glue).
Deep fry the meaty packets in hot oil until golden brown on both sides.
Drain oil on paper towels and serve samoosas warm.  If desired, sprinkle finished samoosas with lemon juice before serving.

These East African snacks (pronounced sum-OH-suz) are like deep-fried meat pies.  Spicy and delicious!
