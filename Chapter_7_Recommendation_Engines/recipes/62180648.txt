Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups corn flake crumbs
2-3 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 cup evaporated milk
12 bone-in chicken thighs, about 4 pounds total

Directions:
Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil.
In a pie dish or shallow bowl, whisk together the corn flake crumbs, chili powder, cumin and garlic salt.  Pour evaporated milk into a second pie dish.
Dip a chicken thigh into the milk and shake off excess.  Roll it around in the corn flake crumbs until completely coated.  Shake off excess. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.
Bake chicken at 375 degrees for 50 to 55 minutes or until golden and crispy and internal temperature registers 160 degrees on an instant read thermometer.
May be served warm or at room temperature.
