Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) container refrigerated pizza dough (such as PillsburyÂ®)
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large red onion, sliced
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
1 cup crumbled goat cheese
1 cup shredded provolone cheese
1 tablespoon herbes de Provence

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Unroll pizza dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten into desired thickness.
Bake crust in the preheated oven until slightly cooked, 5 minutes.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant and sizzling, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat; season with salt and black pepper.
Brush pizza crust with leftover oil and garlic from skillet. Distribute onion, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and provolone cheese onto pizza crust. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence.
Bake pizza in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
This vegetarian pizza is simple but mouth-wateringly delicious. Any combination of cheese can be substituted, but I recommend using either goat cheese or feta as one of the cheeses. You can use any crust, but I suggests a thin crust.
