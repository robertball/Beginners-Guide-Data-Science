Ingredients:
Tofu:
3/4  pound  firm water-packed tofu, drained
2  tablespoons  fresh lime juice
1  tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
1  tablespoon  chili garlic sauce (such as Lee Kum Kee)
1  teaspoon  sugar
2  teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
1/2  teaspoon  crushed red pepper
2  garlic cloves, minced
1  tablespoon  peanut oil
Noodles:
3/4  pound  uncooked rice vermicelli
Dressing:
1/4  cup  fresh lime juice
3  tablespoons  chili garlic sauce (such as Lee Kum Kee)
2  tablespoons  low-sodium soy sauce
2  tablespoons  peanut oil
1  tablespoon  Thai fish sauce (such as Three Crabs)
2  teaspoons  sugar
2  teaspoons  grated peeled fresh ginger
1/4  teaspoon  salt
1/4  teaspoon  crushed red pepper
Remaining ingredients:
2  cups  thinly sliced romaine lettuce
1  cup  shredded carrot
1/2  cup  chopped fresh cilantro
1/4  teaspoon  salt

Directions:
1. To prepare tofu, cut tofu into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Arrange tofu slices in a single layer on several layers of paper towels. Top with several more layers of paper towels; top with a cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan. Let stand 30 minutes. Remove tofu from paper towels; cut into 3/4-inch cubes. Combine tofu, 2 tablespoons juice, and next 6 ingredients (through garlic) in a zip-top plastic bag. Seal and marinate at room temperature 2 hours, turning bag occasionally.
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil to pan, swirling to coat; heat 30 seconds. Remove tofu from bag; discard marinade. Add tofu to pan; saut√© 5 minutes or until crisp, carefully turning to brown all sides. Remove from heat.
3. To prepare noodles, while tofu marinates, place vermicelli in a large bowl. Cover with boiling water. Let stand 20 minutes or until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water; drain well. Set noodles aside.
4. To prepare dressing, combine 1/4 cup juice and next 8 ingredients (through 1/4 teaspoon red pepper), stirring with a whisk.
5. Combine vermicelli, lettuce, and remaining ingredients in a large bowl. Add dressing; toss well to combine. Top with tofu.
