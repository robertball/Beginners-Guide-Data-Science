Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups water
1 red onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1/4 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons whole mustard seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch cayenne pepper
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Directions:
Stir the brown rice and whole wheat flours together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the water to make a thin batter. Add the onion, garlic, cilantro, sugar, turmeric, cumin, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, coriander, ginger, cayenne pepper and rice vinegar until evenly blended. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour, or overnight.
To cook the dosas, heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, spreading it over the bottom in a thin layer. Cook 1 minute, turn, and cook 1 minute more. Remove from the pan. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
Dosas are a thin, savory crepe-like Indian pancake traditionally eaten for breakfast, but I like them anytime. These may not be very authentic, but they are a tasty alternative that appeals to the typical American pancake.
