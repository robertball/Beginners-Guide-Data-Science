How to make croutons Recipe

Ingredients:
French or Italian loaf bread, or a French baguette
3-4 Tablespoons butter

Directions:
Cut the bread into even-sized cubes, about 3/4-inch to an inch wide. A loaf will yield about 8 cups of cubed bread depending on the size of the loaf.
The bread should be a little dry, at least a day old if you are using French or Italian loaf or a baguette.  If the bread isn't just a little dry, spread the cubes out on a baking sheet and put them in a warm oven for about 10 minutes.  You don't want them to be all dried out, just a little dry on the surface so that they get lightly coated.  Spread the croutons out in a single layer in the pan.  Then don't stir them until they start to brown on one side.  Once they start to brown, use a spatula to lift them up and turn them over, so more sides brown.  When the croutons are at least a little toasted on a couple of side, remove from heat.
