Ingredients:
6 cups cubed French bread
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup vanilla soy milk
3 eggs
1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup raisins

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Toss the bread cubes with the cream and soy milk in a large bowl until the liquid has been absorbed; set aside.
Beat the eggs in a separate bowl; whisk in the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Pour the pumpkin mixture and raisins over the bread cubes. Toss gently until evenly combined. Refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes.
Divide the mixture between 8 6-ounce ramekins. Bake in the preheated oven until the pudding has firmed and the top has turned golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and allow to stand 30 minutes before serving.
