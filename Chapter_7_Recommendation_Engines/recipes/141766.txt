Ingredients:
1 unbaked pie crust
1/2 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons chopped walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup apple juice
3 ripe bananas, sliced
1/4 cup honey
1 cup chopped fresh strawberries
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the prepared pie crust into a 9 inch pie pan and set aside.
Combine the butter, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and nuts in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it has the texture of oatmeal. Refrigerate this crumble topping until ready to use.
Pour the apple juice into a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat; add the sliced bananas and honey and stir until the honey melts. Mix in the chopped strawberries and white sugar. Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Pour the warm fruit mixture into the prepared pie crust; evenly distribute the cold crumble topping across the top of the pie.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, about 20 minutes. Cool the pie on a wire rack for 30 minutes before serving.
