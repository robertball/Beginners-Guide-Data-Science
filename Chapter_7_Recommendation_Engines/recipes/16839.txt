Ingredients:
½ cup raisins
1 tablespoon chopped peanuts
½ cup honey
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
⅓ cup maple syrup
¼ cup butter
3 tablespoons brown sugar
1 (3 pound) whole chicken

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a medium saucepan over low heat combine the raisins, peanuts, honey, mustard, syrup and butter; stir all together until a medium thick glaze has formed, then leave on burner to cook slowly. Stir occasionally to keep from burning.
Bake hen at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)  for about 1 hour or until bird is cooked through and juices run clear. Baste hen thoroughly with prepared glaze every 10 to 15 minutes while baking; when hen is cooked through and ready to serve, garnish with orange zest.

This is a recipe I put together one evening after a long day at school and work, and it's really quite good. I have made it for years, and everyone who has ever tried it has asked for seconds...more Chicken Easy Delight, please! It should make everyone smile - it is so different, and really is good!
