Ingredients:
4 (6 ounce) bison top sirloin steaks
Salt and black pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 ounces dried bow tie (farfalle) pasta
1/2 cup purchased basil pesto
2 cups halved grape tomatoes
1 cup cubed fresh mozzarella
Extra-virgin olive oil
Chopped fresh basil

Directions:
Season bison sirloin steaks with salt and pepper. Heat the 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat in a large heavy skillet. Cook bison sirloin steaks in hot oil for 16 to 18 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer registers 145 degrees F, turning once. Top each bison steak with 1 tablespoon of the pesto. Cover skillet and let stand for 3 minutes. Remove bison sirloin steaks from skillet and thinly slice.
Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions; drain. Toss the cooked pasta, the remaining pesto, the tomatoes, and mozzarella in a large bowl. Serve with the sliced bison sirloin steaks. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with basil.
