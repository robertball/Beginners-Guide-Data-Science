Ingredients:
1/2 c soy sauce
1/2 c honey
1/4 c molasses
2 T chili sauce
1 tsp ground ginger
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Mix well. You can marinate cauliflower bites for 1 hour (you may need more sauce if you do) before battering them. Pour remaining marinate over "wings" after they are baked 30 min (or put in the bowl and toss) and bake for 10 min. more. Set aside for 20 min after baking.
