In a small saucepan, combine the first 10 ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes or until sauce is reduced to 2 cups. Set aside.
Cut ribs into serving-size pieces. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in a 5- or 6-qt. slow cooker. Pour sauce over ribs. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or until meat is tender. Place on broiler rack and broil for about 3 min per side to crisp up (optional).  Serve with sauce.
