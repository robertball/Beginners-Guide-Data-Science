Description: 
I always think of spaghetti squash as a winter dish, but it is great year-round. This microwaveable side dish is a terrific time saver and a fantastic veggie that is just cheesy-good. Great served as a side with lemon grilled chicken or served atop some garlic pasta noodles with a choice glass of wine. Your choices are unlimited, so start creating and bon appetite!
