Ingredients:
1 box yellow cake mix
1 stick butter
1 egg
1 can pumpkin (1 pie size)
3 eggs
1/2 C brown sugar
1/4 C sugar
2/3 C milk
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 C sugar
1/2 butter
1 C dry cake mix (reserved from above)

Directions:
Measure 1 C dry cake mix and set aside.
Combine melted butter, egg and cake mix in medium bowl.
Spread into a GREASED 9X13 glass cake pan.
In a deep bowl combine pumpkin, 3 eggs, 1/2C brown sugar, 1/4 C sugar, milk, & cinnamon.  Spread over cake mixture in cake pan.
In a small bowl, combine 1/2 C sugar, 1/2 stick butter (NOT melted), and 1 C dry cake mix.  I always use a fork.  Mixture should be crumbly.
Spread over pumpkin mixture in cake pan (I find it easiest to hold bowl over pan and tap it out).
Bake at 350 for 50-55 minutes.
