Ingredients:
4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
Almond and Raspberry Relish
1/2 pint raspberries, divided
1/2 teaspoon lime juice
1/2 teaspoon finely minced or pressed garlic
1/2 teaspoon honey
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/3 cup sliced California Almonds
1/3 cup chopped scallions

Directions:
For chicken, season chicken with salt and pepper. Place in a large zippered plastic bag with olive oil, and marinate refrigerated for 1-24 hours.
Preheat grill or broiler, and cook chicken 3-4 minutes each side, or until cooked throughout.  Sprinkle with lime juice and top with relish.
For relish, combine about half of raspberries with lime juice, garlic and 1 teaspoon honey in a small bowl, stirring well and mashing up raspberries so that mixture becomes saucy.  Taste and add more honey if mixture is too tart. Add salt and whisk in vegetable oil. Gently stir in remaining raspberries, keeping them whole. Stir in almonds and scallions just before serving.
