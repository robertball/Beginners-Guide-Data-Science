Ingredients:
3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk beverage (such as So DeliciousÂ®)
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
4 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup coconut flour
1 teaspoon coconut oil, or more as needed

Directions:
Whisk coconut milk, applesauce, eggs, honey, vanilla extract, cinnamon, sea salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Slowly stir coconut flour into coconut milk mixture until flour is just moistened. Set aside until coconut flour absorbs some of the batter moisture, 3 to 5 minutes.
Heat coconut oil on a griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
