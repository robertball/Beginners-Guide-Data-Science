Ingredients:
1 Onion, chopped
4 Garlic Cloves, crushed
1/3 C Fresh Cilantro, coarsely chopped
2 lbs Tomatillos, husked
1 Jalapeno, chopped
1 C Chicken Stock
3 C Monterey Jack Cheese, shredded
1 C Cotija Cheese, crumbled
Corn Tortillas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 Degrees
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the tomatillos, reduce heat and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Transfer the tomatillos to a food processor along with the onion, cilantro, garlic, and jalapeno. Process until smooth. In a large saucepan, heat 2 Tbs of oil over medium-high heat. Add the tomatillo sauce and the chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce has reduced slightly, about 10 minutes.
In a medium sized casserole dish, spoon a thin layer of tomatilla sauce, followed by a layer of corn tortillas (slightly overlapping), layer pan with alternating layers of tortillas, cheese, and sauce, until you reach near the top of the pan, and finish with cheese and sauce.  Bake dish for 30-35 minutes, or until cheese is browned and bubbling
