Ingredients:
1/2 pound andouille sausage, diced
1/4 onion, diced
1/4 cup diced celery
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
1/4 teaspoon dried sage
1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined

1 (1.6 oz) package dry Alfredo sauce mix (such as Knorr®)
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
2 teaspoons minced garlic, divided

Directions:
Combine sausage, onion, celery, red bell pepper, Cajun seasoning, and sage in a skillet; cook and stir until sausage is cooked through and celery and bell pepper are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until cooked through and bright pink, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.
Whisk milk, Alfredo sauce mix, and butter together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until smooth and thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir Parmesan cheese and garlic into sauce until cheese is melted. Stir shrimp mixture into sauce.

Description: 
Spicy and creamy....a great combination! Homemade Alfredo is always best, but the Knorr® mix plus Parmesan is a quick easy alternative. Serve over angel hair pasta.
