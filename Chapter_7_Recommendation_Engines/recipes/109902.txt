Ingredients:
1/2 cup raisins
2 cups boiling water
1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
3/4 cup milk
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
8 apples, peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans. Soak the raisins in boiling water while the oven preheats.
Cream together 1/2 cup butter or margarine with 1 cup sugar until fluffy.  Beat in the eggs one by one, then add the almond extract and milk.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder; stir into the creamed butter to form a loose dough.
Divide the dough in half and press each half into the bottom of a prepared cake pan, bringing it slightly up the sides.  Drain the raisins and scatter them over the dough.  Arrange the apple slices in a spiral pattern over the raisins, overlapping slightly.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar and drizzle with 1/2 cup of melted butter or margarine.
Bake in preheated oven until apples are soft and the dough is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
