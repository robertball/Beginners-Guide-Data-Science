Ingredients:
8 passion fruits
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
2 cups cream

Directions:
Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.
In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Description: 
This is Brazilian favorite (and an old family recipe), and takes no cooking at all.  It's a little tart and tangy for those of you who don't like your desserts to be too sweet.
