Ingredients:
Candied Bacon Ingredients
8 slices center cut thick bacon
1/2 c. brown sugar
Cookie Ingredients
2 1/3 c. flour
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 c. white sugar
1 c. brown sugar
1 whole egg
1 egg yolk
3/4 c. butter, melted and slightly cooled
1 T. vanilla
2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Make Candied Bacon:  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Place bacon in a single layer on a foil-lined sheet.  Sprinkle brown sugar on top of bacon strips.  Bake for 15 minutes, turn each piece over and bake another 15 minutes.  Remove bacon from the oven and place on a wire rack for cooling.  Once bacon has cooled, chop it up.
Make cookies:  Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees.  Sift flour and baking soda.  In a medium bowl, cream butter with white and brown sugar.  Add vanilla, egg and egg yolk.  Beat until light and creamy.  Add flour mixture and mix well.  Add diced bacon and chocolate chips.  Stir until combined.  Place golf ball sized balls of dough on a parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake for 13-15 minutes or until edges are brown.  Remove from oven and let cookies sit on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before placing on a wire rack to cool.

Description: 
Thanks to Joan from Albion for sharing this recipe with us.  Everyone loved the little bit of saltiness that the bacon added.

NOTE: Dave liked the candied bacon so much, we ended making another pound of it just to share with our friends.
