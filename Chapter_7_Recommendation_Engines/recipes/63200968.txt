Ingredients:
Meatloaf
1 lb lean ground beef
1 large carrot, grated
1/2 medium sweet onion, diced
1/4 bell pepper, diced
1 small rib celery, diced
1 large clove elephant garlic, minced
1/2 T. dried parsley
2 T chia seed
1 large egg
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp Kitchen Bouquet
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs
3 T. cornflake crumbs
1/2 to 1 t. seasoned salt
Sauce
1/4 c. catsup
1 t. soy sauce
1 pinch ground ginger
2 t. cider vinega

Directions:
Mix the vegetables and chia seeds, add raw egg and other wet ingredients. Work in bread & cornflake crumbs, seasoned salt, and finally ground beef, until thoroughly blended. Place in a 1 lb. loaf pan and push down to remove air pockets, then smooth the top.
Stir together the ingredients for the sauce and spread over the top of the loaf.
Place in a preheated 350 degree oven and bake for 1 hour.

Description: 
I started with a good, basic meatloaf recipe, and added a couple of ingredients to add fiber and additional nutrients (chia seed is nutrient-dense and does not affect flavor). Unlike many high-fiber meatloaf recipes, this one does NOT contain any oatmeal or oat bran, which I think add an unwanted texture and dampen flavor.
