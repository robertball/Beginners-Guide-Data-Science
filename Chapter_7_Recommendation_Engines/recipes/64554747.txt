Ingredients:
1 ounce dried shitake mushrooms
10 sun dried tomato halves (not the kind packed in oil) snipped into quarters
3 T. onion powder
1 T. garlic powder
2 T.  sea salt
1 T. raw sugar
1/2 t. ground black pepper
dash cayenne
1 t. dried thyme
1 t. dried oregano
1 t. paprika
1/2 t. turmeric
1 T. dried parsley
1 t. mustard powder
1/2 t. celery seeds
1 C. nutritional yeast

Directions:
Method: In a  high powered blender dump everything  and run it until the result is a powder as fine as cornstarch. The powder stuck to the jar like crazy, so I emptied it out as best as I could, then added a quart of water and whizzed it all up to clean the jar. Viola. A quart of stock in my fridge for dinner tonight.
