Ingredients:
10 heirloom carrots, stems removed
2 tablespoons coconut oil
3 tablespoons maple syrup
3/4 cup orange juice, or more as needed
Salt to taste
Fresh sage leaves, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Toss carrots with coconut oil and place on a baking pan. Roast carrots for 10 minutes.
Combine maple syrup and orange juice and pour over carrots. Roast for another 10 minutes or until carrots are tender. Remove from oven and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Transfer carrots to a blender, and blend until smooth. Add salt to taste. Add more orange juice if the carrot mixture is too thick. Transfer dip to a bowl. Garnish with chopped sage leaves.
