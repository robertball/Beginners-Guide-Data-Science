Ingredients:
-11-13lb. pound turkey (thawed).
-Your favorite injection marinade.
-Emeril's chicken rub seasoning blend.
-Cayenne pepper.
-1lb. butter
-vegetable oil

Directions:
-Bring smoker up to 300-325 degrees using pecan wood.
-While smoker is coming up to temp,  coat turkey with vegetable oil, apply generous amount of rub and cayenne, and  inject bird with marinade (when applying rub I prefer not actually rubbing it in, instead a just cover all areas by shaking the bottle of rub over it).
-Throw bird on smoker breast side up and smoke at 300-325 degrees.
-Smoke for about 1-1/2hrs. or until bird has desired color
-After about 35-40min. brush some of the injection marinade on.
-Place bird in foil pan and throw cubes of butter all over the top of it and in the pan.  Insert thermometer into breast.
-Wrap entire pan and bird with foil to where it's sealed fairly tight.
-Once temp. reaches 165 in the breast remove from pit and let rest for at least 30min.
-Use melted butter remaining  in pan to make roux/gravy.
