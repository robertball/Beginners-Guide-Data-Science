Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls
1 (7 ounce) package garlic herb cheese spread
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Split crescent dough in half along center perforation. Flatten one rectangle, sealing perforations. Spread with 1/4 of the cheese spread and sprinkle with spinach. Starting with long side, roll dough up, rolling back and forth several times to seal edges. Cut into 3/4 inch slices (about 15 slices per roll). Arrange the slices one inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Continue making the crescent roll ups until all of the ingredients are used.
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Serve immediately or keep warm on a warming tray.
