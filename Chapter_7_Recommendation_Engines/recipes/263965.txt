Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch ground black pepper
6  boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders
1 cup dry Chardonnay
1 (7 ounce) can portobello mushrooms, drained
1 (6 ounce) jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained
1 (2.5 ounce) can black olives, drained
½ teaspoon capers

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Sprinkle salt-free seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper over both sides of the chicken. Add chicken to the hot skillet; cook for 2 1/2 minutes per side.
Stir Chardonnay, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and olives into the skillet. Cook and stir, turning chicken periodically, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Add capers to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer 3 minutes more.
