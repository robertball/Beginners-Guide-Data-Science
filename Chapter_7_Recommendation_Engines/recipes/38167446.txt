Ingredients:
1 small pumpkin (up to 1 lb.)
3 tbsp. butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 tsp. cinnamon
3 tbsp. butter
1 granny smith apple, peeled, cored and finely chopped
1/2 cup amaretto
2 cups arborio rice
4-1/2 cups milk
3 tbsp. butter
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1/2 tsp. nutmeg
1/2 cup toasted, sliced almonds

Directions:
Place whole pumpkin on a foil lined baking sheet.
Bake at 350Â° F for about 90 minutes or until tender, turning sheet occasionally.
Remove from oven. When just cool enough to handle, peel pumpkin. The peel and stem should come away easily, sort of like a roasted pepper. Remove the seeds and stringy pulp with a large spoon. Place flesh into a food processor with 3 tbsp. butter, sugar, and cinnamon, and process until smooth. Set aside.
In a large saucepan, heat 3 tbsp. butter over medium-high heat.
Add apple. Cook until apple is just golden brown.
Add rice, stirring constantly, and cook 5 minutes more, making sure rice does not brown.
Add amaretto, stirring constantly, and let totally evaporate.
When amaretto is evaporated, begin adding milk 1/2 cup at a time, letting each addition evaporate before adding the next addition.
After fourth addition of milk is added, begin tasting rice. Rice should be al dente when done. You need to keep tasting rice, because, depending on rice, you may or may not have to use all of the stock.
When fourth addition of stock is absorbed, add pumpkin puree.
After last addition of stock is absorbed, remove from heat, and stir in butter, cream, nutmeg and almonds. Serve warm.
