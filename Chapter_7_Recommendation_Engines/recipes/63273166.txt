Ingredients:
4-5 Large whole dill pickles
2 cups  little smokies diced fine
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
½ lb smoked bacon
1 cup of a sweet BBQ sauce mixed with ¼ cup of apple juice or a sweet white wine

Directions:
Slice the pickles end to end in ½ and then use an apple corer to scoop out the seeds leaving a pickle “canoe”
Mix the diced smokies and shredded cheddar cheese to make the stuffing.
Stuff the pickle “canoes” with the stuffing and wrap the bacon strips around the stuffed pickle from one end to the other. The finished product should have a spiral effect. If you would like to use less bacon, ½ strips work well also but require the use of a toothpick to keep in place. Always use caution when using toothpicks as the person eating can become injured if they are unaware of the toothpick.
Lightly dust the bacon wrapped stuffed pickle with a simple light salt BBQ dry rub.
Grill with indirect heat at 350 F for 20-30 minutes or until the bacon begins to crisp. Dress with the thinned sweet BBQ sauce and let stand for 1 minute.
