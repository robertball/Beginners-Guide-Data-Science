Ingredients:
4 ears fresh corn, husked and kernels cut from cob (3 1/2 cups)
1 1/2 Tbsp vegetable oil
Salt
1/3 cup chopped red or green onion (if using red run under water and drain to remove harsh bite)
1/3 cup slightly packed cilantro leaves, chopped
1 jalapeno pepper, stemmed, seeded and minced
1 clove garlic, minced
3 oz Cotija cheese, finely crumbled (Feta cheese is a good substitute)
3 Tbsp mayonnaise (light or regular)
1 1/2 Tbsp fresh lime juice, divided
1/2 tsp ancho chili powder, then more to taste
1 1/2 medium avocados (semi-firm but ripe) peeled, cored and chopped small

Directions:
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet until shimmering. Add corn, season with salt to taste and toss, then let cook, tossing only occasionally (about every 2 minutes) until corn is well charred all over (about 6 - 10 minutes total). Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
Add corn to a medium bowl along with, onions, cilantro, jalapeno, garlic, 3/4 of the Cotija, mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp lime juice and chili powder and toss. Pour remaining 1/2 Tbsp lime juice over diced avocados then add to bowl with corn mixture and gently toss. Top with remaining Cotija and additional chili powder to taste.

Description: 
What’s not love about the classic vendor style, Mexican take on corn on the cob? It’s creamy, it’s cheesy, it’s perfectly spiced and that charred flavor just takes it over the top--but it's messy to eat..  That’s where this easy Mexican Street Corn Salad comes in--and because it's a salad, you can add avocados for a delicious upgrade!
