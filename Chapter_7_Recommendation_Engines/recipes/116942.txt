Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 cup ketchup
3/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1 envelope onion soup mix
2 pounds ground beef

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the eggs, ketchup, oats and soup mix. Crumble beef over mixture; mix well. Shape into a round loaf.
Cut three 20-in. x 3-in. strips of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Crisscross the strips so they resemble the spokes of a wheel. Place meat loaf in the center of the strips; pull the strips up and bend the edges to form handles. Grasp the foil handles to transfer loaf to a 3-qt. slow cooker. (Leave the foil in while meat loaf cooks.)
Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours or until a meat thermometer reaches 160 degrees F. Using foil strips, left meat loaf out of slow cooker.
