1 cup water
1 tsp corn starch
1 cup aborrio rice
2 tbs olive oil
1 tbs onion powder
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp dried parsley

In a crock pot,  place onion soup mix, 1/4 C jelly and 1 cup water, mix.  Place beef on top of mixture and spread sriracha or chili paste on top of beef. Cook on low 8 hours or on high 5 hours. Turning meat occasionally.
When beef is finished cooking- remove from crock pot and trim fat.  Cut beef across grain into small one inch pieces. To juices in crock pot add corn starch and whisk vigorously to avoid lumps.  Place trimmed meat back into crock pot-turn to low heat and cover.
In a medium high sided sauce pan heat olive oil over medium heat. To the oil add onion powder, black pepper, reserved grape jelly and parsley; mix well.
Add rice and coat with oil mixture.
Add wine, stir until  liquid is absorbed.
To the pot add beef boullion cubes and one cup water.
Stirring often cook over medium heat and continually add water in one cup intervals as water is absorbed by the rice.  Add water until rice is cooked to desired softness.
Place risotto in half a serving bowl and add beef and gravy on the other side.

Description: 
This main dish meal can be cooked on a week night- the beef can cook all day while you are at work and the risotto can be made when you get home.  It is really easy and tastes delicious. The grape jelly adds a hint of sweetness that makes this dish- don't leave it out. You can sub any flavor of jelly.   A quarter cup of sriracha makes this spicy-adjust accordingly to your taste.
