Ingredients:
Sponge:
12oz whole-wheat flour
3/8t instant yeast
9oz cool water
Soaker:
3oz whole-wheat flour
9oz whole-wheat flour OR
9oz combined total cooked and uncooked grains
3/4t kosher or sea salt
6-7oz buttermilk or yogurt
1.5oz (3T) orange juice
Final Dough:
All of Sponge
All of Soaker
1.5t salt
3 1/3t instant yeast
1.5T unsalted butter, softened
3T honey
Extra flour and water for adjustments

Directions:
Make Sponge: Mix ingredients. With a dough hook, knead for about 2 mins, rest for 10 mins, knead again for about a min. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours (up to a few days).
Make Soaker: Mix ingredients to form a loose, wet ball. Cover and leave at room temperature 6-24 hours (refrigerate if longer).
Make Loaves: Remove Sponge and Soaker from refrigerator. Let come to room temperature for an hour.
Cut or tear Sponge into a dozen pieces, roll in Soaker, add to mixing bowl.
With dough hook, mix together on low speed for 2 mins. Add remaining ingredients except honey and butter. Mix on first speed for 2 mins, increase to second speed for 2 mins. Add honey and butter and mix for another 2 mins. Let dough rest 10 mins.
On floured surface, knead dough by hand a few minutes until it is a soft, slightly sticky dough that is strong enough to resist pulling yet it malleable. Form into ball and transfer to oiled bowl. Cover loosely and let rise 45 mins until it has increased size 1.5 times. (If you have to interrupt process, refrigerate and add 20 mins to rising time.)
Form into two loaves and transfer to two 9x5 or 8.5x4.5 loaf pans. Cover and allow to rise 45 mins until it has increased size 1.5 times.
Preheat oven to 450F with baking stone on bottom rack and cast-iron pan on top rack. Mist or brush top of loaves with water.
With serrated knife, make 1 or 2 small cuts on top of loaves.
Place loaves on baking stone and 1/2c water in pan. (You may also mist the oven with water.) Lower temperature to 350F and bake 20 mins. Rotate pans and bake for another 15-20 mins. (For crisper crust, prop open door with wooden spoon for last 5 mins.) Allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.
