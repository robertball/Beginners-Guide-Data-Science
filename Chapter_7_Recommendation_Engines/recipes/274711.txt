Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup melted butter
1/4 cup finely ground pecans
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1 (14 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 (8 ounce) jar caramel sauce, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, pecans, and cinnamon in a bowl. Pat into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Set aside.
Beat cream cheese, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Add eggs and egg yolks all at once; beat just until combined. Carefully fold in pumpkin and heavy cream, marbling but not mixing completely. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until center appears nearly set when shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before chilling in a refrigerator 8 hours to overnight. Drizzle caramel sauce over each serving.
