Ingredients:
5 pounds chicken parts
1 cup water
6  potatoes, quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons crushed dried rosemary
2 teaspoons crushed dried thyme
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the chicken pieces in a large baking dish; pour the water into the bottom of the dish. Arrange the potatoes around and over the chicken pieces. Drizzle the olive oil over the mixture; season with the rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).
