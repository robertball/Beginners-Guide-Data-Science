INGREDIENTS
1 cup (125 g) flour
3.5 oz (100 ml) milk
3.5 oz (100 ml) water
2 tsp (10 g) sugar
1/2 tsp salt
5 1/2 tbsp (80g) unsalted butter
4 eggs
Filling
2 cups (480g) heavy cream
1/3 cup (40g) powdered sugar
1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract
Fresh strawberries, cut into slices
LET'S GET COOKING...
In a saucepan bring the milk, water, sugar, salt and butter to a boil.
Remove from heat and add flour all at once and incorporate mixing energetically with a wooden spoon until homogenous.
Return the saucepan over low heat and while stirring cook for 1 minute or two to pull out the moisture from the batter and until it pulls away from the sides of the pan. You will see some of the dough sticks to the bottom of the pan.
Transfer batter to a large bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the eggs one at a time, carefully incorporating each into the batter using the wooden spoon or even a stand
mixer. It will result in a smooth, homogenous batter which still holds its shape.
Fit a pastry bag with a large 1/2 inch (1cm) round tip and pipe the dough into 1­ 1 1/2 inch (3­4 cm) circles on a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Bake for 25­30 minutes until browned and puffed.
Prick each with a skewer to release steam and allow to cool on a wire rack.
In a large bowl whip the cream with an electric mixer until it forms stiff peaks. Add sugar and vanilla extract and mix to combine.
Split the cream puffs in half and fill them with cream mixture and strawberry slices. Dust with powdered sugar and serve.
