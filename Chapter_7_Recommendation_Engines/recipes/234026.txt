Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter, divided
3 red onions, thinly sliced
5 cups water
2 beef bouillon cubes
1 chicken bouillon cube
1 (12 ounce) bottle Canadian beer (such as Steam Whistle PilsnerÂ®)
1 garlic clove, crushed
1 bay leaf (optional)
freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup garlic croutons, or as needed
1 1/2 cups shredded Italian three-cheese blend

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1/4 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onions and saute until onions are tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove onions with a slotted spoon; set aside.
Pour water into the saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil. Stir remaining butter, beef bouillon cubes, and chicken bouillon cube into water until dissolved. Stir in beer, garlic, bay leaf, and sauteed onions; season with pepper. Reduce heat; simmer for 15 minutes.
Fill oven-proof bowls 3/4 full with soup. Place bowls on a baking tray; top with croutons and shredded cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove baking tray from oven.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Return soup to the oven; broil until cheese is browned, about 3 minutes.

Description: 
I decided to make French onion soup one day but after I started, I realized I didn't have any wine on hand - but I did have beer! You get a hint of beer but still a rich onion flavor. Give it a try - you'll love it!
