Ingredients:
1 Ripe, medium-sized Melon, halved, seeds and strings discarded. I prefer a Charentais melon.
100 gms (4 oz) Strawberries.
1 Tablespoon cane sugar.
Chilled Sparkling Wine.

Directions:
Whizz the strawberries with the sugar (you may need a touch more sugar if the wine is particularly dry) to make a Purée.
Slice a small piece off the waist of the melon (without making a hole in the skin) so that the melon half does not wobble about when set in a serving dish, cut side uppermost.
Pour half the Purée into the hollow of one of the melon halves and top off with Champagne/Sparkling Wine.
Repeat with the other half-melon.
Serve and eat while the wine still fizzes.
