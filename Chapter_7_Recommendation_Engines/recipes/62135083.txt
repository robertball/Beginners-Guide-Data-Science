Ingredients:
1-2 box(es) elbow macaroni-or the shape you are in the mood for
1 4 cup bag shredded cheese-Colby and Cheddar Blend or any kind of cheese that you enjoy (an additional 2 cup bag can be included later if so desired)
1 Stick Butter
2 TBSP Flour
4 C Whole Milk
Garlic Salt and Pepper to taste
Italian Bread Crumbs

Directions:
Cook macaroni according to package directions, or to al dente & drain when cooked.
Put in a well greased baking dish (9x13 works best) and add all but 2 tbsp of butter to macaroni and stir until melted.
Melt 2 TBSP of butter in saucepan, stir in flour to make a paste (or a roux). Almost to make a ball with flour & butter.
Add milk slowly making sure to whisk at same time. After adding the milk, add garlic salt, pepper & shredded cheese. Mix with your whisk until cheese is melted. It should be somewhat thick, if not you may add more flour to thicken it up.
Pour cheese sauce over cooked macaroni. (Additional shredded cheese can be added at this time if so desired. I would add 2 cups at this point.)
Mix all ingredients together with the macaroni until well blended.
Sprinkle bread crumbs over top, place in oven and bake at 350 approximately 45 minutes- 1 hour *depending on your oven* until bubbly.
