Ingredients:
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth

Directions:
Heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Cook chicken until golden brown and juices run clear.
To the skillet add the butter.  When the butter has melted, sprinkle thyme over the breasts and pour in the broth.  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer breasts, turning occasionally.  Cook until desired liquid consistency is reached, and chicken is no longer pink and its juices run clear.
