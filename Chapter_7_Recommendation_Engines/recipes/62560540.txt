Ingredients:
8 cups hot cooked elbow macaroni (about 16 ounces uncooked)
2 cups sour cream (16oz container)
2 eggs (lightly beaten)
3 cups cottage cheese (24oz container)
1 cup milk
3 teaspoons butter (melted)
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup Swiss cheese, shredded
4 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees
Boil elbow macaroni according to directions on package.
In a large mixing bowl combine sour cream, eggs, cottage cheese, milk, butter, salt, garlic salt, black pepper, sharp cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese and cooked elbow macaroni. Mix well. (It's okay if it seems a little soupy)
Add macaroni mixture to a greased 13x9-inch baking dish.
Bake for 45 minutes or until heated through.

Description: 
This is my combination of a few recipes with a few of my own adjustments.  This quick and easy recipe can be made with the full fat ingredients or they can be substituted for half or non fat ingredients.  Either way, the taste is amazing!  I get asked for this recipe every time I make it.
