Ingredients:
3 dried ancho chiles
1 small jalepeno pepper
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/4 cup corn oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3 cups beef broth

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Arrange the ancho chiles on a baking sheet and toast in the preheated oven 3 to 4 minutes; remove the stems, pulp, and seeds from the toasted peppers.
Place peppers in a bowl and pour enough hot water into bowl to cover completely; allow to soak for 1 hour.
Combine the ancho chiles, sliced jalepeno, tomato paste, corn oil, garlic, salt, oregano, cumin, and about 1 cup of the beef broth in a blender; blend until smooth.
Pour the mixture into a saucepan with the remaining beef broth and place over medium heat; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes
