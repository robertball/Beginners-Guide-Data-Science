Description: 
A mix of spices and salt. I prefer to use fresh garlic, onions and parsley. But if you like, you can add 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon dried minced parsley to the mix. I also use 1 teaspoon of lemon juice for every teaspoon of seasoned salt to really bring out the flavors.
