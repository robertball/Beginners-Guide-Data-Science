Ingredients:
5 very thin pork chops-total about 3/4 lb
3 large slices Jewish seeded rye bread
Eggwash made of one egg plus 1 T water
2 Tablespoons vegetable oil plus 2 T butter
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 slices 2% Pepperjack cheese

Directions:
Preheat broiler. Salt and pepper chops.
Toast rye bread in a toaster until crisp about 4 minutes and pulverize it in a processor until coarse crumbs form. Put crumbs on a large plate. Beat egg with water in a separate bowl. Dredge porkchops through eggwash and then through bread crumbs. Heat oil and 1 T butter in large frying pan. Saute chops in the hot oil/butter mix for 5-6 minutes total, turning once. Place chops in broilproof pan. Deglaze frying pan with the wine, add 1 T butter and pour around chops in broilproof pan. Fit slices of the cheese on chops and place under broiler. Cook until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Serves 5.

Description: 
This is a fine recipe to use stale Jewish rye bread and combine it with very thin porkchops and cheese to create a delicious and fast entree. The taste of jalapeno and rye is a particularly felicitous one. To reduce the cholesterol use an egg substitute.
