Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dried lima beans
2 (16 ounce) cans chopped tomatoes with juice
1 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
sea salt to taste
1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill

Directions:
Place the lima beans in a large saucepan. Pour enough water to fill to 2 inches above top of the beans. Allow to soak overnight.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place the saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes; drain. Pour the beans into a 9 x 13 baking dish. Add the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt, and dill; stir.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally and adding water if the mixture appears dry.

Description: 
This is a family recipe. In Greek, it's called 'Gigantes' which translates as 'Giants.' Try to find the largest dried lima beans possible. My aunt adds small canned sausages, but I prefer this meatless. Serve with feta cheese and a crusty bread. You can also substitute 2 teaspoons parsley for the dill if you prefer.
