Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 pound ground venison
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
2 teaspoons seasoned salt, divided
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
15 1/4 ounces peas, drained
1 1/3 cups water
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup cold milk
1 1/3 cups dry potato flakes
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and venison in the hot skillet with green bell pepper, onion, 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, and garlic powder until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine water, butter, and salt in a pot. Bring to a boil over high heat; remove from heat and stir in milk. Stir in potato flakes gently and let stand until moist. Whip lightly using a fork.
Place meat mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour corn and peas on top. Spread mashed potatoes on top to cover vegetables. Sprinkle with remaining seasoned salt. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil pie in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is browned, 1 to 3 minutes.
