Ingredients:
1/4 cup butter
1 (8 ounce) package fat free cream cheese
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 cups non-fat milk
6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat.  Add cream cheese and garlic powder, stirring with wire whisk until smooth.  Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps.  Stir in Parmesan and pepper.  Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency.  Sauce will thicken rapidly, thin with milk if cooked too long.  Toss with hot pasta to serve.

Description: 
This alfredo is great just a little lighter than before. Not as rich but still so tasty. Great when served with whole wheat noodles.Modified from: Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce
