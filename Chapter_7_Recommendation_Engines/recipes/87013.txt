Description: 
This is my family's recipe that has been handed down through the years.  We've always used the maple flavored pork sausage but any kind is good.  This casserole is a nice and cozy breakfast or brunch meal that everyone will enjoy.  It's got the perfect taste with lots of cheese. Yum! Be sure to use a baking dish that is deep enough to cover with aluminum foil.
