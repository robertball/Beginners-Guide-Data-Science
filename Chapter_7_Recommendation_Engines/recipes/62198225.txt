Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon white sugar or splenda

3 (14.5 ounce) cans French style green beans, drained very well
Grated black pepper to taste
Garlic powder to taste
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup crumbled Ritz crackers, divided
1 tablespoon butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat and cook onions until caramelized. Stir in flour until smooth, and cook for one minute. Stir in the sugar (or splenda), sour cream, green beans, black pepper, garlic powder, 1 cup of cheese, 1/2 cup crumbled Ritz crackers, and stir to coat.
Transfer the mixture to a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. Spread 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese over the top. In a small bowl, toss together 1/2 cup crumbled Ritz crackers and 1 tablespoon butter, and sprinkle over the cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top is golden and cheese is bubbly.
