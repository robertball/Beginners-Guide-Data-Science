Ingredients:
1 pound okra
2 large potatoes
1 medium white onion
1/2 cup of corn meal
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup camellia or other low trans fat cooking oil

Directions:
Wash the okra and cut off the top and tail ends. Cut into 1/2 inch pieces. You may peel the potatoes or leave the peel on according to your choice. I do not peel the potatoes. Dice the potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces. Finely chop the white onion. Season the corn meal with salt and pepper to taste. Place the corn meal in a large plastic bag, add the okra, potatoes and onion. Shake the bag, making sure the vegetables are coated well with the cornmeal.
Heat cooking oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat, until the oil is shimmering but not smoking. Place the vegetables in the skillet or pan and fry until the potatoes are done and the okra and onions are browned, usally 10-12 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the vegetables and drain on a paper towel. Serve hot as a side meal or a breakfast treat.

Description: 
This dish orginated in Africa but my mother and her relatives prepared it in Alabama. Kingombo is the name of okra in the African Bantu Language and patata is the name of potato in Spain. I combined the two words together to name my dish.This is a wonderful okra and potato dish that can used as a side dish or it can be eaten for breakfast. Enjoy kingombo patatas!
