Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed
4 tablespoons butter or margarine, divided
1 large sweet red pepper, chopped
2 medium leeks, chopped
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon paprika
4 cups chicken broth
2 medium potatoes, cubed
4 cups frozen corn
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 cup half-and-half cream

Directions:
In a soup kettle or Dutch oven, saute chicken in 2 tablespoons butter until lightly browned; set aside and keep warm. In the same pan, saute the red pepper in remaining butter until tender. Add the leeks; cook for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and paprika until blended. Gradually stir in the broth. Add the potatoes; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
Stir in corn, Worcestershire sauce, salt, hot pepper sauce and reserved chicken; bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Cook, uncovered, for 5-8 minutes or until corn is tender, stirring occasionally. Stir in cream and heat through (do not boil).
