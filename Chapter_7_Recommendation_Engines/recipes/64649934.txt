Description: 
This is a filling and flavourful stew my boyfriend's nana would always make for him as a kid.  She made him learn how to make it so the recipe wouldn't go with her.  You can change the ingredients to taste but it's all about the low and slow.   I make a huge pot and freeze individual servings
