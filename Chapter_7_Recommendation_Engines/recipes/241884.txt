Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt (such as FageÂ®)
3/4 cup fat-free buttermilk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 15 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Lightly spoon 2 cups flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl using a whisk; make a well in the center.
Stir yogurt, buttermilk, butter, eggs, poppy seeds, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add to flour mixture, stirring just until batter is moist. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 18 minutes. Remove muffins from cups immediately and place on a wire rack.

Very moist and delicious! Try replacing poppy seeds with nuts, fruit, chocolate chips...this batter is a great muffin base.
