Ingredients:
8 ounces broad egg white noodles (such as No YolksÂ®)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons minced garlic
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
1/2 cup milk
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
15 frozen beef meatballs, or more to taste
3/4 cup sour cream
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is almost soft, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in cream of mushroom soup, milk, and Worcestershire sauce; stir until blended.
Stir meatballs into the skillet. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Stir in sour cream, salt, and pepper. Cook until flavors combine, about 2 minutes.
Serve meatballs over noodles.
