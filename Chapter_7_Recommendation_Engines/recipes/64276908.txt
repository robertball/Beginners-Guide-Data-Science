Ingredients:
1 onion, peeled and halved
3 cups dry pinto beans, rinsed
1/2 fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
3 tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons salt
1 3/4 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, optional
9 cups low salt chicken broth
4 slices bacon

Directions:
Place the bacon on the bottom of the crockpot.  Add onion, rinsed beans, jalapeno, garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin into a slow cooker. Pour in broth and stir to combine.  Cook on High for 8 hours, adding more water as needed.  Note: if more than 1 cup of water has evaporated during cooking, then the temperature is too high.
Once the beans have cooked, strain them, and reserve the liquid.  Mash the beans with a potato masher, adding the reserved water as needed to attain desired consistency.
