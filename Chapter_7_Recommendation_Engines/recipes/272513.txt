Ingredients:
2 Roma tomatoes, diced
1/2 cup diced white onion
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1/4 jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 pound lean ground beef
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
1/2 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
12 frozen empanada wrappers, thawed
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Mix tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, and garlic salt together in a mixing bowl.
Cook and stir beef in a saute pan over medium-high heat until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat and return beef to the pan. Add water and taco seasoning; stir thoroughly until fully incorporated and water has been absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tomato mixture and pepper Jack cheese,
Lightly flour a work surface. Roll each empanada wrapper out to a 6-inch circle. Scoop 1/3 cup beef filling onto the center of each wrapper. Fold each wrapper in half to enclose the filling. Crimp edges with a fork to seal. Pierce the top of each pie twice with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Whisk egg and water together to make egg wash. Brush egg wash over the tops of the pies.
Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
These taco pies are easier to handle than those regular tacos you need two hands to keep the the shells from cracking and the fillings from falling out. Pico de gallo and pepper Jack cheese round out the flavors of the taco beef. Taco hand pies are perfect for parties and on-the-go meals. Serve with picante sauce for dipping.
