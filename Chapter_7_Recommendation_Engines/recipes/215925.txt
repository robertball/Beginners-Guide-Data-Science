Ingredients:
2 cups milk
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup Parmesan cheese
2 cups Classico® Tomato and Basil Sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch square baking dish.
In a large pot, combine the milk and chicken stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it is at a rolling boil, gradually whisk in the cornmeal, making sure there are no lumps. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly until thick, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese.
Pour the polenta into the prepared baking dish, and spread pasta sauce over the top.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until sauce is bubbling.
