Ingredients:
1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed
1 jalapeño pepper
1 serrano pepper
2 unpeeled garlic cloves
1 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup chicken stock
1/3 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves and tender stems
1 Tbsp lime juice, or more to taste
1/2 tsp salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place the tomatillos, jalapeño, serrano pepper, and garlic into a baking dish. Bake 30 minutes, turn over and bake 30 more minutes, until they’re blackened in spots.
Remove the baking dish and add chicken stock then use a wooden spoon to scrape any bits stuck to the bottom. Let tomatillos, peppers, and garlic cool.
When they are cool enough to handle, remove the charred skin from the peppers and remove seeds. For a spicier salsa, leave in some or all of the seeds. Remove the softened garlic from peel.
Add roasted tomatillos, peppers, garlic flesh, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and the salt to a food processor. Pour about half of the liquid from the baking dish then pulse 3 to 4 times or until the salsa is mostly smooth and no big chunks of tomatillo remain, scraping down the sides as necessary. Adjust with more liquid, lime juice, or salt based on consistency and taste.
Cook's note: I often serve this over white rice for a easy weeknight meal or as a salsa on tacos or sandwiches.  It also makes a great soup stock!
