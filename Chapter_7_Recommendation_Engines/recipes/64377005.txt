Ingredients:
1 can of chickpeas (drained, I hold some of the liquid to the side)
1 can of either butter beans or white cannallini beans (drained)
4 cloves garlic (smashed and peeled)
1 tsp. cumin
juice of 1/2 lemon
1/2 tsp. salt (optional)

Directions:
Place everything in a food processor or good blender. Blend until very smooth. If too thick, add a little water or some of the liquid from the beans. I blend until its almost fluffy.
