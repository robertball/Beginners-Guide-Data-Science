Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs. veal scalloppine
Salt, pepper and flour
2 Tbsp butter
3 Tbsp olive oil
3/4 cups beef stock
6 paper thin slices of lemon
1 Tbsp lemon juice
2 Tbsp butter

Directions:
Season veal with salt and pepper, then dip in flour.
In skillet, melt butter with oil over medium heat. When foam subsides, add veal and saute about two minutes per side or until golden brown. Transfer veal to a plate.
Pour off fat, leaving thin film on bottom. Add 1/2 cup stock and boil briskly for 2 minutes, stirring constantly and scraping bottom. Return veal to skillet and arrange lemon slices on top. Cover skillet and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes, or until veal is tender.
To serve, transfer veal to platter and surround with lemon slices. Add 1/4 cup of stock to skillet and boil briskly until reduced to syrypy glaze. Add lemon juice and cook, stirring for 1 minute. Remove from heat and swirl in two Tbsp of butter and pour sauce over veal.

Description: 
My husband cooked this for me on one of our very first dates, and six years later it is still one of my favourite dishes.  I have also substituted the veal with turkey and chicken cutlets with excellent results.
