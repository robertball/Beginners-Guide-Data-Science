Ingredients:
1 cup dry potato flakes
1 cup boiling water
1 egg, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

Directions:
Place potato flakes in a medium-size bowl.  Pour in boiling water; stir until blended.  Let cool.
Stir in egg, salt, and pepper.  Blend in enough flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Turn dough out on a well floured board.  Knead lightly.
Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a long thin roll, the thickness of a breadstick.  With a knife dipped in flour, cut into bite-size pieces.
Place a few gnocchi in boiling water. As the gnocchi rise to the top of the pot, remove them with a slotted spoon.  Repeat until all are cooked.

Description: 
An easier version of an Italian favorite, using instant mashed potatoes.  This recipe can easily be double, tripled, etc.  I make multiple batches, and freeze. To freeze, put on cookie sheets until frozen, and then put into plastic bags.  Serve with your favorite spaghetti sauce.
