Description: 
I grew-up with this dish, My mom's mom was German, and came from Germany before the second World War II, And cooked this for my mom when she was growing up. My dad didn't like it much but when he was away from home she would cook it. My wife got the recipe from my mom, and has cooked it since. I do most of the cooking now so this is simple and unchanged other than the fact I am cooking it in a crock pot.

Note: Please Do not use the Bavarian style Sauerkraut, that is nasty stuff.
