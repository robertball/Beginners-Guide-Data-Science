Ingredients:
2 pounds bulk mild pork sausage
1 cup soft bread crumbs
1/3 cup finely diced onion
1 (5 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped
1 egg
2 tablespoons dry sherry
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
6 sesame seed burger buns
1 cup bean sprouts
3/4 cup sweet and sour sauce

Directions:
Mix together the pork sausage, bread crumbs, onion, water chestnuts, egg, sherry, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a bowl until evenly combined. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to make the mixture easier to handle, then form into 6 patties.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil grate.
Cook the burgers on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Lightly toast the buns on the hot grill. Serve the burgers on the toasted buns, and top with bean sprouts and sweet and sour sauce.
