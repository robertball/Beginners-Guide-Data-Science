1 bag of flaked coconut 14 oz
1 can sweetened condensed milk 14 oz
1 tsp of vanilla extract
zest of one orange aprox 1 tbs
2 tbs of freshly squeezed orange juice
3 lg egg whites
pinch of salt
8 oz of semisweet chocolate

Turn oven to 325 degrees f.
Mix the flaked coconut with the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, orange zest and juice.
Beat the egg whites with the pinch of salt till stiff peaks.
Fold into coconut batter.
Drop by tbsp onto parchment paper lined cookie sheet.(parchment paper is a must so the cookies do not stick to cookie sheet and they maintain their shape)
Cook for aprox 30 minutes or till golden brown.
cool cookies on a wire rack.
While the cookies are cooling place your chocolate in a glass microwavable bowl and melt the chocolate. It takes aprox 1 1/2 minutes stir after 1 min. When chocolate is smooth and glossy it is done.
You can dip the bottom of the cookies into the chocolate and place back onto the parchment paper. Then drizzle some chocolate on top.
Cookies are done once the chocolate hardens. Store in covered container room temperature for 2-3 days. They won't last that long!

Description: 
This is a match made in heaven fresh orange zest in coconut macaroons with chocolate! I made these with citrus in thoughts of spring and it was for my passover dinner since there is no leavening in them. It was a big hit!
