Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 cups raw bulgur
1 teaspoon dill seeds
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds

1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt
1/3 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1/3 cup chopped cilantro

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute bulgur, dill seeds, bay leaf, and cumin seeds until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add broth and soy sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer until liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chickpeas until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Combine bulgur mixture, chickpeas, yogurt, parsley, cilantro, and chives in a bowl. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
