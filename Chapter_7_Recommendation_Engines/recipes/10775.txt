Ingredients:
1 cup margarine, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups packed brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
3 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
2 cups vanilla baking chips
1 1/2 cups pecan halves

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Cream together margarine, butter and sugars until fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time.  Blend in vanilla, salt and baking soda.  Add flour, semi-sweet chocolate chips, vanilla chips, and pecan halves and mix until all ingredients are moistened.
Drop by spoonful (I use a large soup spoon to make a large cookie) onto ungreased cookie sheets and bake for 12-13 minutes.
