Description: 
Succulent boneless pork roast stuffed with fresh dill and garlic. The trick is to allow the roast to come to room temperature before roasting;to sear the meat at a high temperature and to not cook longer than 1.5 hours total or the pork will dry out. This is a favorite of family and friends and is requested quite often.
