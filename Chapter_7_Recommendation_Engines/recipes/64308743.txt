Ingredients:
1 crusty loaf of bakery bread
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 stick of butter
2 tsp minced garlic
1 Tbsp parsley

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Melt butter and then mix in the garlic and parsley.
Cut the bread 2 directions into diagonal diamonds.  Do not cut all the way through.
Use your fingers to pry open each crack and drizzle in a teaspoon of butter and stuff in a pinch of cheese.  Drizzle the remaining butter on top of the loaf.
Wrap in foil and bake for 15 minutes.  Unwrap and bake for 5 more minutes to make the crust nice and toasted.
