Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup old-fashioned oats
3/4 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 tablespoons butter
2 cups sweetened, flaked coconut
2 cups sliced almonds
2 cups dried cherries
2 cups dried apricots, coarsely chopped
1 1/2 (14 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk

Directions:
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a 13-by-9-inch Pyrex baking pan with vegetable cooking spray. Set aside.
In a medium bowl, mix flour, oats, brown sugar and salt. Stir in butter with a fork until well mixed and clumps have formed. Spread 1 1/2 packed cups of oat mixture over the bottom of the pan, pressing to form a thin crust.
Mix coconut, almonds, cherries, apricots and milk in a large bowl. Pour over crust, using a rubber spatula to evenly distribute and press down. Sprinkle remaining oat mixture over dried fruit filling.
Bake until lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Cool to room temperature. (You can cover and store at room temperature up to 2 days.)
To serve, cut into generous 1 1/2-inch squares.
