Ingredients:
2 small skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 ½ tablespoons goat cheese
1 pinch dried parsley
1 pinch garlic powder
1 pinch dried thyme
1 pinch dried oregano
1 pinch salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place chicken breasts on prepared baking sheet.
Stir goat cheese, parsley, garlic, thyme, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl.
Bake chicken in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Spread goat cheese mixture over the top of each breast and continue to cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 to 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
