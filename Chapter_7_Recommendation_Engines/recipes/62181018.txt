Ingredients:
9 lasagna noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pound ground beef
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
salt and pepper to taste
1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
3 eggs, beaten
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese

Directions:
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2.Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
3.Cook the ground beef in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.
4.Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.
5.Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.
6.Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

Description: 
Make this classic lasagna recipe zestier by using hot Italian sausage or a little milder with regular Italian sausage. Don't be scared off by the long cooking time. The wait is well worth it. It's a great dish to make for a crowd and easy to adjust for varying tastes. The leftovers are even better when reheated the next day.
