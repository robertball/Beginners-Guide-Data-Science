3. Add additional cayenne pepper and brown sugar to taste, if desired.
4. Serve topped with shredded cheddar cheese, chopped green onions, strip tortilla chips and sour cream as desired.

Description: 
This is a combination of a modified version of the fantastic Homemade Baked Beans recipe (found here: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232677/homemade-baked-beans/) and a recipe from the 4th Annual Whole Foods Grass Fed Beef Chili Cook Off in Baton Rouge, LA in 2013. It's a favorite of our family and is a good balance of spicy and sweet. 

This recipe is best cooked with a 5-quart french or dutch oven, but you may improvise with an oven safe baking dish for the baked beans and a pot for the chili.
