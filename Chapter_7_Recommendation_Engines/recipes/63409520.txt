Ingredients:
1 3/4 cups fresh cranberries
1/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup raisins
1/4 cup pineapple juice
2 tablespoons candied ginger, minced
1/2 teaspoon orange peel, grated
1/3 cup pineapple, crushed, well drained

Directions:
Combine cranberries, sugar, raisins, pineapple juice, ginger and orange peel in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan or microwave-safe container.  Bring to boil on stovetop and simmer for about 5 minutes or microwave at high, uncovered for 5 minutes or until cranberry skins begin to pop, stirring after 3 minutes.  Add crushed pineapple.  Let cool.  Serve over poultry or meat at room temperature or slightly warm.
Variation:  For a delicious variation, try pitted, chopped cherries as a substitute for cranberries.  When using cherries, reduce sugar to 3 tablespoons.
