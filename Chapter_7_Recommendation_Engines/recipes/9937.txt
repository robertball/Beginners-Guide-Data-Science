Ingredients:
1/2 cup shortening
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter
1 egg
2 tablespoons milk
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in peanut butter, egg and milk.
Sift together flour, soda and salt.  Stir into creamed mixture.
Place dough on floured waxed paper.  Roll into 15 x 18 inch rectangle (just pat it out and don't measure).
Melt chocolate chips over hot water; cool slightly.  Spread over cookie dough.
Roll up like jelly roll, rolling the long side, lifting wax paper off with each turn.  Chill about 15-20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Dough should be fine, but chocolate should be hard.  Slice cookies 1/4 inch thick.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake for 8-10 minutes.
