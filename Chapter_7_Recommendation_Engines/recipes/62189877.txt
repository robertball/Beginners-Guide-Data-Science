Ingredients:
2 cups flour*
3 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
2 cups milk** or water
1/4 cup oil***

Directions:
In a medium bowl, put flour*, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together to get rid of any lumps. This also 'sifts' the dry ingredients.
Then, put in eggs, milk**, and oil***. Whisk all together until well mixed. Batter may seem runny/thin. It's perfect and does not need refridgeration.
In a preheated, non-stick pan, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, pour in your desired size of pancake(s).
Turn once you see bubbles and cook some more. Press the pancake with your turner gently to make sure the middle is cooked.
