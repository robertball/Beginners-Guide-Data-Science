Ingredients:
3/4 cup flour
2 1/2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 large potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
2 carrots, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
2 large yellow onions, quartered
1 sprig fresh thyme, or more to taste
2 cups Irish stout beer (such as GuinnessÂ®)
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Directions:
Place the flour in a resealable plastic bag. Add the beef, a few pieces at at a time, and shake the bag to coat.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the beef, cooking until browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the browned beef to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
Place the beef, potatoes, carrots, onions, and thyme into a slow cooker, and pour the stout beer on top. Cover and cook on Low until the meat is very tender, about 8 hours. Season with salt, then remove thyme. Garnish with parsley before serving.
