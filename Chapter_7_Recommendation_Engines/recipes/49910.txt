Ingredients:
2 tablespoons butter, melted
7 (1 ounce) slices day-old bread, torn into small pieces
3/4 cup chopped fresh strawberries
3 eggs
1 1/4 cups milk
3/4 cup light cream
1/4 cup strawberry preserves
3/4 cup white sugar, or to taste
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter the bottom and sides of an 8 inch square baking dish with the melted butter.
Toss bread with the chopped strawberries, and place into the prepared pan.  Beat the eggs, milk, cream, strawberry preserves, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl until frothy.  Pour over the bread and lightly press down with a spatula until the bread has absorbed the milk mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly tapped.

Description: 
I love all things strawberry so when I was asked to make bread pudding I decided to try adding strawberries.  The results were heavenly.  I have never liked bread pudding... until now that is.  I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorites.
