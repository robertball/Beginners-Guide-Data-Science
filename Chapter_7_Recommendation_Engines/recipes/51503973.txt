Ingredients:
For the salmon
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon minced ginger
1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
5 ounces mango nectar
2 6-ounce salmon fillets, about 1 inch thick
For the spinach salad
1 bunch fresh spinach
1 thinly sliced Bosc pear
Shredded carrots
Asian bean sprouts
2 tablespoons toasted sliced almonds (optional)
For the dressing
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ginger (freshly grated)
1 tablespoon orange juice

Directions:
To make the salmon: Stir together first 5 ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes or until reduced by half. Pour mango mixture through a wire-mesh strainer; discard solids. Return mango mixture to saucepan; keep warm.
Place salmon on a rack in a broiler pan coated with cooking spray. Broil 5 1/2 inches from heat 5 minutes. Brush fish with half of mango mixture. Broil 3 more minutes or until fish flakes with a fork. Spoon remaining mango glaze evenly over fish.
To make the spinach salad: Chop the spinach roughly, thinly slice the Bosc pear into strips, shred the carrots on a grater, add bean sprouts and toss in sliced almonds if desired. Lightly toss the ingredients all together in a mixing bowl with the dressing.
