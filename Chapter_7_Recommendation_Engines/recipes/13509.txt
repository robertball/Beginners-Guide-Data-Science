Ingredients:
8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions
1  egg, beaten
1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1  egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a small bowl, blend feta cheese, green onions, and egg. Cut pastry into 12 (3 inch) squares. Place a mounded tablespoon of feta mixture in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle.  Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal. Lightly brush pastries with the egg yolk mixture.
Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
