Ingredients:
6 tablespoons butter, very soft
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup applesauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until creamy; beat in applesauce, brown sugar, and egg until smooth.
Mix flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, into butter mixture until dough is sandy but shapeable. Roll dough into balls. Pour 3 tablespoons white sugar into a bowl and roll dough balls in the sugar until coated. Flatten dough balls onto a baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven until edges are crisp and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a cooling rack and cool for 3 minutes.

These cookies are delicious. I made these for Christmas and a bake sale and they were sold out by the end! So thin and chewy! They're a MUST HAVE!
