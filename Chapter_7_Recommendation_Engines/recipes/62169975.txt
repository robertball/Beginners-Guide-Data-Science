Ingredients:
2 medium onions sliced thin and seperated
2 cups flour
1 t salt
1 cup milk
Oil to fry in - I use a Fry Daddy
Other seasoning to taste when cooked

Directions:
Place seperated onions in a tupperware type container with shaking room.  Start by adding about 1 cup of flour mixed with salt, put lid on and shake.  Check to make sure they are all covered and if needed add a little more flour and repeat.  Then add about 1/2 cup milk, shake again.  Again check, all the rings should be wet.  If not, add more milk a little at a time.  Then add the rest of the flour and shake again.
That's it! Pull out one at a time and cook in hot oil in the method of choice but don't crowd, you will have to do a few batches and fry until turning brown and then season to taste. Serve hot. We just like salt but feel free to spice them up if you want with whatever you like.  We like them a little browner, not the light tan but try to see what you like better.  Try with Ranch dressing too.

Description: 
My mom used to make these and since there is no dipping required it's less messy and everyone that has tried them says they are the best onion rings they have tasted.  I don't know about that but they are good and easy.
