Ingredients:
1 pound stew meat (or a roast)
2 Cans cream of mushroom soup (undiluted)
1 can of water (use soup can)
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 small can of mushrooms (optional)
one small bag of baby carrots
1 large onion
3-4 celery stalks cut up
1 12 oz can of ginger ale (any brand)
2 pkg lipton beefy onion soup mix
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Place stew meat or roast in crockpot on low, if using a roast I reccommend rubbing it down with salt and pepper first, let it sit about 20 minutes, then pour gingerale over the roast. In a seperate bowl mix all other ingredients together, pour over and around stew meat or roast, then place all vegetables in pot. Cook on low 6-8 hours. If oven method is preferred, bake in a casserole dish, covered at 350 degrees for 3-4 hours.
