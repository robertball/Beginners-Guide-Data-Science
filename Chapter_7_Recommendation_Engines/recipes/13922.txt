Ingredients:
2 1/4 cups water
2 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/4 inch cubes
1 tablespoon light miso paste
2 teaspoons barley miso paste
1/2 cup fresh spinach, washed and chopped
1 green onion, thinly sliced

Directions:
In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Ladle out about 1/2 cup of the boiling water, and reserve.  Add tofu.  Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add spinach or bok choy; simmer about 1 to 2 minutes, or until the greens are tender.  Remove soup from heat.
Blend white miso and barley miso into reserved hot water.  Stir into soup.  Ladle into bowls, and garnish with scallion.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
I am a big fan of miso soup, and this one is fairly straight forward with ingredients that are easy to find. Plus, it tastes great. If you prefer, you can replace the spinach with bok choy.
