Ingredients:
2 (8 ounce) cans water chestnuts, drained
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 pound bacon, halved crosswise
20 toothpicks, or as needed
1/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup mayonnaise
1/3 cup chili sauce

Directions:
Soak water chestnuts in a bowl with soy sauce for at least 3 hours; drain.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Wrap each water chestnut with a piece of bacon; secure with a toothpick and arrange on a shallow baking dish. Repeat with remaining water chestnuts.
Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp, 25 to 35 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, mayonnaise, and chili sauce in a bowl until dipping sauce is smooth. Serve bacon-wrapped water chestnuts with dipping sauce.

Description: 
This is the way my mother made them when I was growing up. And they were always a treat. The sauce is from another recipe on here but I found that it perfectly balances out the saltiness of the bacon and soy sauce.
