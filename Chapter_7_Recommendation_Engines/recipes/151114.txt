Ingredients:
1 cup bulgur wheat
2 cups hot water
2 apples - peeled, cored and diced
1/2 cup chopped pitted dates (optional)
4 green onions, chopped
3 cups chopped romaine lettuce
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
3 tablespoons plain yogurt
1 tablespoon honey
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup diced Muenster cheese
2 cups toasted slivered almonds

Directions:
Place the bulgur wheat into a bowl, and pour the hot water over it. Let it soak for 20 to 30 minutes, until tender. Drain off any excess water.
In a serving bowl, combine the apples, dates, green onion, lettuce, cilantro and parsley with the bulgur. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, yogurt, honey, salt and pepper in a small bowl; pour over the salad and stir to coat. Refrigerate until serving. Just before serving, stir in the Muenster cheese and slivered almonds.
