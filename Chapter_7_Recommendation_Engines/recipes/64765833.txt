Add the stock, water, cauliflower, and the bay leaf, then bring to a boil.
Simmer 30 minutes or until the florets are tender, then discard the bay leaf.

Description: 
Potato leek is a classic, but I am carb-conscious, so I ditched the potato and used cauliflower instead, and it was awesome! It is smooth and creamy. You don’t even miss the potatoes. So, during the holidays, if you are looking for recipes that won’t make you gain 5 lbs this works great!
