Ingredients:
6 (20-ounce) Cornish game hens
1 cup lemon juice
3/4 cup butter or margarine, melted
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, divided
1 1/4 teaspoons seasoned salt, divided
1 1/8 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Place the hens on a wire rack in a large roasting pan. In a bowl, combine lemon juice, butter, paprika and 1 teaspoon each of thyme, seasoned salt and garlic powder. Pour half over the hens; set the remaining mixture aside for basting. Combine salt, pepper and remaining thyme, seasoned salt and garlic powder; sprinkle over hens. Bake, uncovered, at 375 degrees F for 30 minutes. Baste with reserved lemon juice mixture. Bake 30 minutes longer, basting occasionally, or until the meat is tender and juices run clear.

Description: 
The refreshing sauce Mom makes with thyme, lemon juice and butter gives these hens savory flavor throughout. The seasonings in this recipe also work great on a whole roasted chicken. Either way, the result is a mouth-watering feast. -Maria Costello, Monroe, North Carolina
