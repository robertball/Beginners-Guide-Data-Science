Ingredients:
1 (2 pound) rabbit, cleaned and cut into pieces
3 cups red wine vinegar
3 cups water
1/2 cup white sugar
1 onion, sliced
2 carrots, peeled and sliced
1 tablespoon salt
1 cup pickling spice
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
3 tablespoons rendered bacon fat
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Put rabbit into a deep bowl and cover with a mixture of the vinegar, water, sugar, onion, carrots, 1 tablespoon salt, pickling spices, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 days to marinate, turning pieces frequently.
Drain rabbit; strain and reserve marinade.  Dry rabbit with absorbent paper.  Coat pieces with a mixture of 1/3 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Heat the fat in a Dutch oven or saucepot.  Add the rabbit and brown slowly on all sides.  Add 2 cups of the marinade.  Cover and cook slowly about 45 minutes, or until meat is tender.
Thoroughly blend 1/2 up of the reserved marinade and the 1/4 cup of flour.  Slowly pour on half of the mixture into cooking liquid, stirring constantly.  Bring to boiling.  Gradually add only what is needed of remaining mixture for consistency desired.  Bring to boiling after each addition.  Finally, cook 3 to 5 minutes.
Arrange rabbit on serving platter.  Pour some of the gravy over the rabbit and serving remaining gravy in a gravy boat.

Description: 
Have the skin removed and rabbit opened and drawn. Disjoint as you would a chicken.  If the 'wild' flavor is unfavorable, cover with cold water in a saucepan, add green celery tops, 1 onion, 3 whole cloves and 3 whole allspice and cook slowly for 10 minutes. Drain immediately and then proceed with recipe.
