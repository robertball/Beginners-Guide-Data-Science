Ingredients:
1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated pizza crust
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1/4 cup reduced-fat mayonnaise
1/4 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 cup (4 ounces) shredded reduced-fat Mexican-blend cheese
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 pound thinly sliced deli turkey, julienned
3 bacon strips, cooked and crumbled
2 small tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Swiss cheese
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions

Directions:
Unroll the pizza crust onto a 15-in. x 10-in. x 1-in. baking pan coated with nonstick cooking spray. Flatten dough and build up edges slightly. Prick dough several times with a fork; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 425 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned.
Combine the mayonnaise and lemon peel; spread over crust. Sprinkle with Mexican or mozzarella cheese and basil. Top with turkey, bacon, tomatoes and Swiss cheese. Bake for 7-9 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. Sprinkle with onion.
