Ingredients:
4 cups quick cooking or rolled oats
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
1/4 cup butter, room temperature
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup apple sauce
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, stir together oats, flours, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and the sugars until fluffy. Beat in the eggs, then the applesauce and the vanilla extract. Stir in the oat/flour mixture until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop 1/4-cupfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, flattening each cookie slightly. Bake for about 12-15 min. Cookies will be light brown at the edges when done.
Let cool on sheet for 3 or 4 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Store in an airtight container or the freezer.
