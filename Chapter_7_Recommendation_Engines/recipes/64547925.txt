Description: 
This is my gluten free knock off of Classic Bisquick速 Baking Mix. This replaces cup-for-cup any recipe calling for Classic Bisquick速, not recipes calling for the gluten free version of Bisquick速. Classic Bisquick速 has fats in the mix whereas, the gluten free version does not. My recipe contains oil and needs to be refrigerated after being mixed. It will last up to one week in an airtight container in the fridge.The addition of gluten free cereal mimics the enriched flour aiding in the baking process as well as adding vitamins.
