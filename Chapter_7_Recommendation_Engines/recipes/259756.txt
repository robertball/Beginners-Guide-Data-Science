Ingredients:
3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
1/2 orange, peel cut into thin strips
1 pastry for a 9-inch pie crust
2 eggs
1 tablespoon pineapple juice
1 tablespoon salted butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch salt
1 cup white sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream

Directions:
Place sweet potatoes and orange peel into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain well and let cool. Discard orange peel.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust.
Mash cooled sweet potatoes with a potato masher or fork. Mix in eggs until well blended. Add pineapple juice, butter, and vanilla extract; mix until combined. Mix in flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt. Mix in sugar until dissolved. Blend in heavy cream using a whisk.
Pour sweet potato mixture into the pie crust.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Place on a cloth on a table or window sill to cool down.
