Ingredients:
15 graham crackers, crushed
2 tablespoons butter, melted
4 (8 ounce) packages neufchatel
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3/4 cup low-fat (1%) milk
4 eggs
1 cup reduced-fat sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.
In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.
