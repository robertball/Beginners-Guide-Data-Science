Ingredients:
1 cup of sifted white all purpose flour
2 Tbs sugar
4 eggs
1 cup of milk
1 cup of water
1/2 cup of vegetable oil for pan coating

Directions:
Beat the whole eggs until well incorporated.Add the flour and sugar, alternating with the milk and water until you have the consistency of a light cream. Sift the mixture into a bowl and let rest for 20 minutes.
Heat one 8" or 9" non-stick pan until hot (one drop of water will sizzle). Add 1 teaspoon of oil to the pan and swirl to coat the whole bottom (add a bit more if needed). Add 1/4 cup of batter to the pan and swirl around very quickly to coat the entire bottom with the batter. Keep on medium-high heat until the sides of the crepe start to lift.
Turn the crepe with a flat spatula.Keep in the heat for around 30 second or until the bottom looks pale yellow and cooked. Slide onto a plate and keep warm until you finish the rest (stack them one on top of the other to keep warm)
Spread the crepe with your favorite sweet filling - fold and serve. Fillings: jam/fruits/creams/sugar and butter, melted chocolate/ Ice cream /Dulce de leche, etc. Toppings: Powder sugar /cinnamon/chocolate shavings/whipped cream, etc.

Description: 
While these are called crepes in France, in my home country, Chile, they are called panqueques (pancakes) but not the thick American type - just very thin and ideal for filling with fruits, ice-cream, or just butter,sugar, orange juice & zest and Grand Marnier (flambe)to make the famous French Crepes Suzette!
