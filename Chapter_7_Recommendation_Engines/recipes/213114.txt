2 tablespoons milk
3 eggs

Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Whisk the eggs, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Pour in eggs and cook without stirring for 1 minute. Add the pizza toppings to the eggs; cook, stirring constantly, until eggs reach the desired consistency.

Description: 
Working at a pizza joint, I bring home pizza a lot. Most of it gets tossed or friends eat it. I made this recipe growing up making changes as I go. I believe it is good enough to share now! Try with your favorite pizza! Top eggs with shredded Cheddar cheese if desired.
