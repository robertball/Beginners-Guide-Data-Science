Description: 
This is a wonderful thirst quenching drink on a hot summer day and is a definite crowd pleaser. Very easy to make and everyone will want the recipe. For a limier taste, you can use a beer that has lime already in it (i.e.. Bud Light Lime). You can make this recipe ahead of time, just pour over ice when ready to serve. Delicious!
