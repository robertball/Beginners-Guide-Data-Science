Ingredients:
ground beef
sharp cheddar cheese
cooked bacon
hotdogs

Directions:
Handmade ground beef patties, topped with sharp cheddar cheese, wrapped in a bacon weave
Add hotdogs as the heads, legs with slits for toes and tail.
Next step.  Place on an oven rack, covered loosely with foil and baked for 20-30 minutes at 400 degrees.  A little crispy, not too crunchy...just how a turtle should be, no?
