Ingredients:
8 oz dried Deglet Noor dates
Hot water
1 cup chopped walnuts
2 tbsps vegetable oil
1 egg
1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
1/4 cup rolled oats
1/4 cup dark cocoa powder, such as Hershey's Special Dark
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Place dates in a small bowl. Add enough hot water to cover the dates. Allow to sit for 10 minutes to soften.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. Remove dates from water, reserving soaking liquid. Place dates, walnuts, and vegetable oil into the bowl of a large food processor. Pulse several times until mixture forms a paste, and no large chunks of dates remain. This may take several minutes. If mixture is too dry, add in 1 tbsp of reserved soaking liquid at a time until paste consistency is reached. Add in egg and vanilla, pulse to combine. Add oats, cocoa powder, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda to food processor bowl. Pulse until combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Fold in chocolate chips. Dough will be very sticky.
4. Use a medium cookie scoop to place rounded balls of dough 1-inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Press tops of dough down with damp fingers to flatten slightly. Bake in preheated oven for 13-15 minutes, or until cookies are just set. Allow to cool 5 minutes on pan before removing to wire rack to cool completely. Keep stored in refrigerator until ready to serve.
