Ingredients:
Cupcakes:
1 cup superfine sugar
2/3 cup butter, softened
2 large eggs
4 tablespoons milk
1 1/2 cups self-rising flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 cups frozen cranberries
Icing:
3/4 cup butter, softened
3 cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 lemon, zested (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Place sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in eggs, then stir in milk. Sift in flour and baking powder; use a metal spoon to fold into the batter. Gently fold in frozen cranberries.
Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until well risen and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to a wire rack to cool. Do not ice until completely cooled.
Beat butter in a bowl until fluffy. Sift in confectioners' sugar, then add lemon juice and zest; beat icing until smooth and creamy. Spread or pipe icing over the cupcakes.

Description: 
Even though I often substitute with healthy ingredients in my baking, there are some things that you just don't change! A little treat never hurt...and these are good! I made them for Mother's Day and got rave reviews from the family. The icing is sweet (what icing isn't?), so if you prefer, you can serve them without it. They taste wonderful both ways!
