Ingredients:
2 cups milk, divided
1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves
2 cups whipping cream
1 cup sugar, divided
7 egg yolks
1 teaspoon mint liqueur (optional)
Garnish: fresh basil sprigs

Directions:
COOK 1 cup milk in a heavy saucepan over low heat until bubbly.  Stir in 1 cup basil leaves, and remove from heat.  Cover and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes.
PROCESS basil mixture in a blender until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides.  Pour mixture through a wire-mesh strainer into a bowl, discarding solids.  Set aside.
COOK remaining 1 cup milk, whipping cream, and 1/2 cup sugar in saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, just until mixture is bubbly.  Remove from heat.
BEAT egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until thick and pale.  Gradually stir about one-fourth of hot milk mixture into yolks; add to remaining hot mixture, stirring constantly.  Stir in basil mixture and, if desired, liqueur; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, 6 minutes or until mixture thickens and coats a spoon.  Cover and chill 4 hours.
POUR chilled mixture into freezer container of a 1-gallon electric ice-cream freezer, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
Pack with additional ice and rock salt, and let stand 1 hour.  Serve in frozen lemon shells, and garnish, if desired.
