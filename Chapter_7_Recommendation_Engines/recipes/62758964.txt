Ingredients:
2	cups  panko  bread crumbs (see note)
1/4	cup  polenta , instant (see note)
1 1/2	teaspoons  paprika
1/4	teaspoon  cayenne  pepper
Salt
1/4	cup  vegetable oil
2	cups  potato chips  (about 2 ounces), crushed to fine crumbs
3/4	cups  all-purpose flour
2	large  eggs
1 1/2	pounds  large shrimp , peeled and deveined

Directions:
1. Adjust oven rack to upper position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Toss bread crumbs, polenta, paprika, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt, and oil in microwave-safe bowl until well coated. Microwave crumb mixture until golden brown and crisp, 1 to 3 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time. Stir potato chips into crumb mixture, then transfer to shallow dish. Spread flour in second shallow dish. In third shallow dish, whisk eggs until evenly combined.
2. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels and season with salt. One at a time, coat shrimp lightly in flour, dip in egg mixture, then dredge in crumbs, pressing gently to adhere. Arrange breaded shrimp ½ inch apart on wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
3. Spray shrimp with cooking spray and bake until crumbs are deep golden brown and shrimp are just cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve.

Description: 
Oven-frying means fewer batches and less mess than deep-frying. But can you get a “fried” crust in the oven before the shrimp turn to rubber
