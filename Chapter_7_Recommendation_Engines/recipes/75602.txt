Description: 
My grandmother gave me this recipe earlier today. I am not crazy about Apples, but loved this salad. I told my husband to hurry up and eat it before I eat too much. My grandmother told me it is like the candy apples at a fair, which I also am not crazy about, but this was the best salad ever! Hope you all enjoy.
