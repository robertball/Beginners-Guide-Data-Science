Ingredients:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 tablespoon butter
1 onion, finely chopped
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 (14 ounce) bags frozen chopped broccoli, thawed and drained
salt and pepper to taste
1 large sugar pumpkin, top removed, seeded
3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
1 (16 ounce) package herb seasoned stuffing mix
1/2 cup melted butter

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place the almonds in a skillet over medium heat, and cook 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted.
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender.
In a bowl, mix the onion, eggs, mayonnaise, cream of mushroom soup, and broccoli. Season with salt and pepper. Scoop 1/3 of the mixture into the pumpkin. Layer with 1 cup cheese and 1/3 stuffing, and drizzle with 1/3 melted butter. Sprinkle with 1/3 toasted almonds. Repeat layers. Place pumpkin on a baking sheet.
Bake pumpkin 1 hour, or until filling is hot and bubbly. Cover pumpkin with aluminum foil if it begins to brown.

Description: 
My sister and I devised this recipe when we were new vegetarians looking for a Thanksgiving main dish in place of turkey. It tastes great and makes a beautiful presentation. We even take the kids on a 'Pumpkin Hunt' in advance of Thanksgiving - so much more humane than a turkey hunt!
