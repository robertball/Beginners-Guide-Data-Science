Ingredients:
6 medium green bell peppers
1 pound ground turkey
1/3 cup chopped onion
Pepper to taste
2 medium tomatoes, chopped
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup uncooked rice
1/2 cup water
1 cup shredded reduced fat or no fat cheddar cheese
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed tomato soup
water as needed

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cut the tops off the peppers, and remove the seeds. Cook peppers in boiling water for 5 minutes; drain and set aside. In a large skillet, saute turkey and onions for until turkey is browned and onions are translucent. Drain off fat, and season with pepper. Stir in the tomatoes, rice, 1/2 cup water and Worcestershire sauce. Cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until rice is tender. Remove from heat, and stir in the cheese.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (175 degrees C). Stuff each pepper with the turkey and rice mixture, and place peppers open side up in a baking dish. In a medium bowl, combine tomato soup with just enough water to make the soup a gravy consistency. Pour over the peppers.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.
