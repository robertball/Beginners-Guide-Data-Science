Ingredients:
4 TBSP EVOO
4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
1/2 cup bread crumbs
8 cloves minced garlic
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp salt
½ cup fresh chopped basil
1 cup grated Fontina cheese
½ cup grated Fontina cheese
½ lb Champanelle noodles

Directions:
Chop chicken and place in Ziploc storage bag. Add bread crumbs, shake and use your hands to press crumbs into chicken until completely coated and most of the crumbs are no longer loose.
Boil pasta per package directions.
Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large frying pan. Add chicken, cook until browned on all sides (about10-15 minutes). About ¾ of the way through, add the garlic and toss. Remove from pan. If there is a ton of oil left in the pan pour it out, if not, turn heat to low and add chicken broth, cream, pepper, salt and basil and 1 cup of Fontina cheese. Scrape up any bits left in the pan and bring to a boil.
Boil and stir until sauce thickens, about 10-15 minutes.
Add 1/2 cup of cheese and mix until melted. Garnish with basil.
