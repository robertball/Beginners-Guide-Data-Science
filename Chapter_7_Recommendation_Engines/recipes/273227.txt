Ingredients:
2/3 cup vegan shortening (such as CriscoÂ® All-Vegetable Shortening)
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup soy milk
1/2 cup molasses
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
5 teaspoons ground ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 3 baking sheets.
Mix shortening, brown sugar, white sugar, and soy milk together in a bowl using an electric mixer. Add molasses and blend until smooth.
Combine flour, ginger, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Pour into the bowl with the shortening mixture; mix dough by hand until thoroughly combined.
Pour 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow bowl. Roll dough into balls and roll in sugar to coat. Place on the prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart and flatten slightly.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden and set, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cookies cool completely on the baking sheet.
