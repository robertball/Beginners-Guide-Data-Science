Ingredients:
1 loaf pumpkin bread, cut into 2-inch cubes
3 cups milk
2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant pumpkin pudding mix (such as Jell-O®)
1 (16 ounce) package frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), divided
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
1 cup powdered sugar

Directions:
Layer 1/2 of the pumpkin bread cubes in the bottom of a glass trifle bowl.
Whisk milk and pudding mixes together in a bowl. Let stand until thickened, about 5 minutes. Fold in 1 cup whipped topping.
Blend remaining whipped topping, cream cheese, and powdered sugar together in a bowl.
Spread 1/2 of the pudding mixture over the bread cubes. Cover the pudding with a layer of the cream cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving, or up to overnight.
