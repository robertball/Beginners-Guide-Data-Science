Ingredients:
1 box cornbread mix
1 lb ground beef
1 pkg taco seasoning
1 can black beans
1 sm package frozen corn
1 jar salsa(14 oz)(any kind works I like it spicy so I buy the hot kind!)
1 sm  onion
1/3 cup cilantro chopped
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
1 cup chili corn fritoes ground up like bread crumbs
sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Mix cornbread according to package directions,and bake in casserole dish(sprayed with cooking spray) half the time (approx 7-10 min). While cornbread is cooking brown ground beef with diced onion,drain fat and add taco seasoning (per directions on package).Layer the ground taco meat onto the cornbread. Mix the (thawed)corn and drained black beans with the jar of salsa and cilantro, layer on the beef, Then add the cheddar cheese and finish with the chili corn chip crumbs...place in oven and cook about 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted...and then dig in! I like to finish mine off with a dollop of sour cream!
