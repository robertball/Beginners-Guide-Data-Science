Ingredients:
1 (6 inch) turkey sausage, diced
1 tablespoon light olive oil
1 (6 ounce) can mushroom stems and pieces, drained
1 cup diced red onion
1 cup diced red bell pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
ground black pepper to taste
12 eggs
1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 cup chopped fresh spinach
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup chopped fresh chives

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook sausage until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
Heat oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and red bell pepper with 1/2 the salt and pepper until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
Whisk eggs with remaining salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add shredded Mexican cheese blend, spinach, milk, chives, and the sauteed sausage and vegetables.
Fill each muffin cup no more than 3/4 full with the egg mixture using an ice cream scoop.
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
