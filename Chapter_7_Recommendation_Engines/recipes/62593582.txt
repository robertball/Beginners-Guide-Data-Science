Ingredients:
250 g/9 oz  pappardelle (wide fettucine noodles)
1 medium eggplant(~ 400 g/1 lb)
1  medium onion (80 g)
3  garlic cloves
3 Tbsp. olive oil
2 tsp oregano (or 2 Tbsp fresh, if available)
1 can crushed tomatoes (500 g/~18 oz)
1 Tbsp  red wine or balsamic vinegar
1 tsp  salt
1 tsp  sugar
1/2 tsp  freshly ground black pepper
220 g/1/2 lb  Mozzarella di Bufala (or good quality fresh mozzarella)
1/2-1 cup fresh basil
Parmesan (grated or sliced from a block)

Directions:
To prepare eggplant, slice 3/4-inch thick, salt, and let drain in a colander for 10 minutes. Rinse and pay dry with paper towels. This step can be skipped, but will ensure that any bitter taste is removed and will remove bitter taste and will reduce the amount of oil absorbed during frying. It's not necessary to peel the eggplant.
Cook pasta according to directions on the package and drain.
Cut the eggplant slices into cubes. Finely chop onion and garlic cloves.
Brown the eggplant in a frying pan in a small amount of hot olive oil. Add more oil as needed. Set aside. Saute onion and garlic until golden in a small amount of oil. Add the cooked eggplant and oregano.
Saute for an additional minute.
Add the crushed tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar and pepper. Cover and simmer sauce for about 10 minutes, or until eggplant is soft.
Rip mozzarella into small pieces and slice basil while sauce simmers.
Mix sauce with drained pasta. Scatter mozzarella and basil on top. Serve with slivered or grated parmesan.
