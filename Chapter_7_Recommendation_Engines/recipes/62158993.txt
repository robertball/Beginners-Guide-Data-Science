Ingredients:
2 lb. lean stew beef (large cubes)
3 tb. vegetable oil
2 tb. flour seasoned with salt, freshly ground pepper and a pinch of cayenne
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 large clove garlic, minced
1 6 oz. can of tomato paste
1 1/2 to 2 pints Guinness
3 or 4 medium-sized carrots cut into large chunks
1 c. fresh button mushrooms, halved
1/2 tsp. thyme
Fresh parsley, roughly chopped for garnish

Directions:
Toss the meat in a bowl with 1 tb. oil, then sprinkle the seasoned flour mixture over the meat and toss to coat with the flour.
Heat the remaining 2 tb. oil in a large stewing pot over high heat.
Brown the meat well on all sides.
Add the onions, garlic and tomato paste; reduce heat to medium, cover the pot and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add the carrots, mushrooms and thyme, then pour in enough Guinness to cover everything.
Stir well, gently scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot and simmer gently for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is very tender.
Salt and pepper the stew to taste.
Top the stew with a little fresh parsley to garnish. Serve with roasted or mashed potatoes and a hearty bread to sop up the gravy.
(This is also great to make in a crock pot â€“ just throw everything in and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours.)

Description: 
My husband is from Ireland and for several years, has been perfecting his beef stew recipe. The Guinness cooks down to make a delicious savory gravy. On a cold wintry day when you need something hearty to warm up with, this is as good as it gets!
