Ingredients:
3 cups dry black-eyed peas
12 cups water
3 pounds smoked ham hocks
1 1/4 cups chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 bay leaf
1 (10 ounce) package frozen sliced okra, thawed

Directions:
Pick over the peas, rinse them, and place them in a large Dutch oven or soup pot with the water. Bring the beans to a boil for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 1 hour.
Stir in the ham hocks, onion, celery, salt, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf; bring to a boil, cover the pot, and simmer until the ham hocks are tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the okra and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf before serving.

Description: 
This country recipe combines black-eyed peas and okra for a down-home country taste.  We like to make this recipe in the winter with fried chicken and mashed potatoes.
