Ingredients:
1 cup butter or margarine, softened
3 eggs
1 cup maple syrup
3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped dates
1 cup chopped pecans
3/4 cup flaked coconut
FROSTING:
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 cup confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons whipping cream
1 tablespoon maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon maple flavored extract

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, cream butter. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in syrup (mixture will appear curdled). Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; gradually add to the creamed mixture. Stir in dates, pecans and coconut. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until easy to handle. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls 2 in. apart onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F for 9-11 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks.
In a small mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Beat in cream, syrup, vanilla and maple flavoring until smooth. Frost cooled cookies.
