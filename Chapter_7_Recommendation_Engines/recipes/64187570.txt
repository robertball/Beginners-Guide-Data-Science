Ingredients:
10-12 medium apples (of your choice), peeled, cored and sliced
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup water
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon cloves
D

Directions:
After peeling, coring and slicing apples, place them in a large bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice to keep them from browning.
In a bowl, mix your brown sugar and spices together.
Place your apples in slow cooker and add in water, sugar and spices. Mix well so that all apples are submersed and coated evenly.
Cook on high for 3 hours, occasionally mashing down apple chunks with a potato masher.
Taste and adjust seasoning accordingly.
Turn heat down to low and continue to cook for 2 hours, mashing occasionally.
