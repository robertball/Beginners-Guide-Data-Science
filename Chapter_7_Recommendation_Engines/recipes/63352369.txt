Ingredients:
1 smoked pork butt or 3-4 smoked turkey legs
1 lb of white northern beans(pre soaked)
1 small onion chopped
3/4 bag med or wide egg noodles
4-6 cups of water
garlic powder to taste
black pepper to taste

Directions:
After soaking the beans overnight put them to boil in a large pot with the water(start out out with 4 cups but add more as needed), smoked meat of your choice(pork or turkey), chopped onion and spices.
Once it starts to boil, lower and simmer until beans are almost tender.  If using smoked turkey legs remove them and take the meat off the bones and add back into the soup.  If using smoked pork there is no need to do this.
Add the egg noodles, no need to cook them first they will cook in the soup.
