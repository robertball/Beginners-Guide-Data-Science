Ingredients:
5 cups water
1/2 cup dried apples, finely chopped
1/2 cup raisins or currents
1/2 cup dried apricots, finely chopped
1/2 cup pitted prunes, finely chopped
1 heaping tablespoon pearl tapioca
1 cinnamon stick
1 star anise
1 cup fruit juice (apple or cranberry, or even lingonberry if you can get it. I used apple)

Directions:
In a large pot, boil the water and add the dried fruit, the tapioca, the cinnamon stick, and the star anise. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir in the fruit juice and continue to warm for an additional 5 minutes. Remove the cinnamon and the star anise. Serve with pie crust croutons (see below).
For the Pie Crust Croutons
Roll out your leftover pie crust, or scraps of any rolled cookie, use your smaller cookie cutter to cut out little croutons. Brush them with a little water or egg white and sprinkle with cinnamon and pearl sugar if you have some of that laying around as well. Bake in an oven preheated to 350F for 5-10 minutes (depending on the size of your croutons). They should be a light golden brown. Serve floating atop a bowl of søtsuppe.

You can serve this warm or cold and both have their charms. Add some pie-crust croutons sprinkled with cinnamon or cardamom and you're all set!
