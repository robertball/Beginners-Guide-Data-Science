Ingredients:
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs (cut into bite size pieces)
3 T fat (coconut oil works well here)
juice of 2 oranges*
zest from 1 orange
1 t fresh ginger
3 T coconut aminos or wheat-free soy sauce
1 t chili garlic sauce or sriracha
3 green onions, chopped

Directions:
n a medium size sauce pot, add the orange juice, zest, ginger, coconut aminos and chili garlic sauce or sriracha. Set over medium heat and let simmer to reduce and thicken while the chicken cooks. In a saute pan, heat 3 T of the fat of your choice, over medium high heat. Add the chopped chicken thighs and cook until a nice brown crust has developed on the chicken pieces, about 6 minutes. Add the chicken to the sauce pot and stir to coat with the orange sauce. Serve topped with sliced green onions. *Taste your oranges. If they don’t taste orange-y, then neither will this dish. Use tangerines if you gotta or add a teaspoon of sweetener until you’re satisfied with the flavor.
