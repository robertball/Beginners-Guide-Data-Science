Ingredients:
2 cups chopped onion
1 1/2 cups chopped green pepper
1 14.5 oz. can chopped tomatoes (tomatoes with spices or chopped chiles are great, too!)
3/4 cup picante sauce
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp. ground cumin
1 tsp. chili powder
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, optional
2 15 oz. cans black or red kidney beans, drained
12 6" corn tortillas
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese (low fat, non-fat, or regular)
Optional ingredients for serving:
2 medium tomatoes, sliced
Bunch green onions, sliced
Sliced pitted ripe olives
1/2 cup sour cream or plain yogurt

Directions:
In a large skillet, combine onion, green pepper, undrained tomatoes, picante sauce, garlic, cumin, chili powder, and cayenne pepper.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes.  Stir in beans.
Spray a 13x9x2 baking dish with non-stick spray.  Spread 1/3 of the bean mixture over the bottom of the dish.  Top with half of the tortillas, overlapping as needed, and half of the cheese.  Spread another 1/3 of the bean mixture and the remaining tortillas and bean mixture over top.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until heated thru.
Remove foil and sprinkle remaining cheese over top.  Cook an additional 5 minutes to melt cheese.  Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
If desired, top with tomato slices, lettuce, green onion, black olives, and a dollop of sour cream or yogurt.  Cut into squares to serve.
