Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles
3 1/2 cups vegetable stock
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
1 teaspoon Asian chile sauce
1 garlic clove, chopped
5 1/2 ounces frozen spinach, thawed
1 1/2 cups frozen green soybeans, thawed
1 red bell pepper, sliced

Directions:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; cook until tender yet still firm to the bite, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain and divide among 4 large soup bowls.
Combine vegetable stock, soy sauce, ginger, chile sauce, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
Squeeze spinach to drain out excess moisture; coarsely chop. Add to stock with soybeans and red bell pepper; cook until heated through, about 1 minute. Ladle over noodles.
