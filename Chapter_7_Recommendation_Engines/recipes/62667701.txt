Ingredients:
4 skinless boneless chicken breast cut in half. 1 cup salsa (Fresh is best-Rojo's Pico De Gallo,all natural, available at Costco is great).   Ranch Dressing (fat free if you are watching fats).  3 Garlic Cloves, minced. Juice of 1 to 1 1/2 limes. 1 cup finely shredded cheddar cheese (plus a enough extra for garnish).  Chopped fresh Cilantro for garnish.

Directions:
Spray Skillet with cooking spray.  Brown chicken in skillet.  Add Garlic. In a bowl mix lime juice, salsa, and ranch dressing together. Smooth on top of chicken.  Top above with shredded cheddar. Cover and simmer until chicken is tender (cooked to internal temp of 160 degrees and chicken juice runs clear). Watch heat closely to prevent cheese from burning. Garnish with remaining shredded cheese and fresh chopped Cilantro just before serving.  Serve with Mexican Rice and Re-fried beans as side dishes.
