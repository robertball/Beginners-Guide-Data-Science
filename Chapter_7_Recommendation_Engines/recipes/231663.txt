Ingredients:
2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts
1 pound cubed ham
1 stick pepperoni, finely diced (optional)
3 pounds ricotta cheese, drained
1 1/2 cups shredded Romano cheese
6 eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon chopped parsley, or to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Fit crusts into bottoms of 2 9-inch pie dishes.
Cook and stir ham and pepperoni in a skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain grease and set ham and pepperoni aside to cool.
Stir ricotta cheese, Romano cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until well mixed. Add ham and pepperoni to the mixture and stir to combine. Pour half the filling into each pie crust.
Bake pies in the preheated oven until filling is set and lightly browned, 35 to 40 minutes.
