Ingredients:
6 T. butter
1 tsp. parsley flakes
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. tarragon
12 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced (4 c.)
1 c. water
1/3 c. dry white wine
1 envelope brown gravy mix
1 clove garlic, minced (or 1/8 tsp. powder)
2 T. parmesan
4 slices Ital. bread (or more depending on size)
4 thin slices mozzarella
1 to 1 1/4 # boneless chicken breasts or turkey cutlets
flour
1/4 c. oil

Directions:
Melt 4 T. butter in skillet over medium heat until bubbly; stir in parsley, salt, tarragon, pepper to taste, and mushrooms.  Cook about 5 minutes, then stir in water, wine, and gravy mix.  Simmer, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Combine 2 T. melted butter with the garlic.  Spread on one side of each slice of bread and top with parmesan and mozzarella. Place on cookie sheet and bake at 300 degrees for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese is melted.
Meanwhile, pound cutlets, then season with salt and pepper and lightly dust with flour.  Brown in hot oil in skillet until golden and nearly done.  Remove from skillet and add to mushroom gravy mixture.  Cook over low heat five minutes.  Arrange cheese-topped bread slices on platter; top with cutlets.
