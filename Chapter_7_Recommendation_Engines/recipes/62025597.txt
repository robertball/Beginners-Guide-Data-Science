Ingredients:
1 cup peanut butter (chunky style is yummiest)
1 cup white sugar
1 egg

Directions:
1.Using a hand mixer or sturdy wooden spoon, mix all ingredients until just blended. If using a spoon, it's helpful to blend the egg and add the sugar, then the peanut butter - otherwise, the egg just coats the peanut butter and is difficult to mix in.
2. Shape into balls and flatten slightly with the traditional criss-cross fork pattern.  No need to grease the cookie sheet - peanut butter has plenty of oil in it!
3. Bake at 350F for approx 7 minutes. These are best if they're a little underdone. Cool for 1 minute on cookie sheet before removing to wire rack.  Get a huge glass of milk and enjoy warm!
Scaling is also a no-brainer - pick a number, then use that as your quantity - 4 cups peanut butter, 4 eggs, 4 cups sugar etc.
** This is a fairly sweet cookie.  If you prefer a peanuttier flavor, and/or if your peanut butter contains sugar, it's best to star with a portion of the sugar and gradually add more to your taste.  Enjoy!!
