Ingredients:
2.5 cups whole wheat flour
0.5 cup buckwheat flour
0.25 cup sunflower seeds
3 tablespoons flaxseed
3 tablespoons wheat germ
3 tablespoons olive oil
0.25 nonfat milk
0.5 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons dry active yeast (for whole grain breads works best)
0.25 honey
1 egg
1.25 cups warm (not hot) water

Directions:
Dissolve honey and yeast in warm water and let set for about 10 minutes or until creamy looking.
On low stir, add salt, egg and olive oil. Once mixed in, add all other ingredients except for flour.
Add flour about a half-cup at a time until it's all mixed in. Dough should be firm but still slightly sticky.
Cover bowl with a damp cloth or oiled piece of plastic cling wrap and put in a warm place to rise. Let rise until doubled in bulk-- about one hour.
About halfway through the rising process, preheat oven to 375.
Lightly grease (with cooking spray or olive oil) 2 regular sized loaf pans.
Punch down risen dough, separate into two balls and place in pans
Bake in preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.
Let cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans and cooling completely on a wire rack.
