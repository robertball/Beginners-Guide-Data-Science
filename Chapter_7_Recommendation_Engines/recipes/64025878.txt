Ingredients:
(2) 32 oz. containers Swanson Thai Ginger Flavor Infused Broth
1 (14 oz.) can of Lite Coconut Milk
3-4 chicken breasts
1 red bell pepper, cut into 2-inch matchstick-thin strips
2 cups of carrots cut into 2-inch matchstick-thin strips
2 cups or small package of mixed sliced mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, cremini) (I found a package of mixed mushrooms at Wal-Mart)
1 package Thai Kitchen Thai Lemongrass & Chili instant rice noodle soup
Cilantro for garnish

Directions:
In slow cooker, combine broth, chicken and 1/4 to 1/2 package of thai lemongrass soup seasoning and add the chili packet from the thai lemongrass soup. Cook on low all day or high for 4 hours.  During the last 2 hours of cook time, add veggies so they are crisp/tender. You could also add a few sliced green onions if you like. About 3 minutes before serving, add the instant rice noodles from the soup packet.   Serve with cilantro as garnish.
