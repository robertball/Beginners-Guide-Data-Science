Ingredients:
1 onion diced
1 carrot diced
1 stalk celery diced
2 tbsp. fresh chopped rosemary
1/2 tsp. oregano
2 tbsp. basil chopped
1/2 tsp. turmeric
3 cloves of garlic chopped
2 bay leaves.
salt and pepper
1 can tomotoe paste (5.5 ounces) a small can.
2 cans diced tomatoes (28ounces each) I use the San Marzano  canned tomatoes.
Beef roast 4-5 pounds.
olive oil, about 1/4 cup.
a couple of pinches of white sugar.

Directions:
Put olive oil in a roaster or oven proof dish, and heat on top of the stove. When the oil is warm add the onion, carrot and celery, saut√© for 5 minutes, add the turmeric stir one minute. Add your herbs and stir 1 minute. Add your tomatoes(I put mine through the blender cause I like a smooth sauce). Bring to a gentle boil, turn down heat and add the tomatoe paste. Add salt and pepper and a pinch of white sugar.. Let simmer about 1/2 hour uncovered. Add your beef, put it in the oven covered at 325 degrees for 2 and 1/2- 3 hours. Uncover the 15-20 minutes to let any water evaporate. Your meat will be nice and tender and you will also have a very good pasta sauce.
