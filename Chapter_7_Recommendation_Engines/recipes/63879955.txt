Ingredients:
Baklava:
1 1/2 cups Pistachios, coarsely ground
1 1/2 cups Walnuts, coarsely ground
1/2 tsp Ground Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Cardamom
3/4 cup Bread Crumbs
1 1/2 cups Butter, melted (salted or unsalted)
1 lb. Phyllo Dough sheets
Syrup:
1 1/2 cups Sugar
4 oz. Honey
3/4 cup Water
1 Cinnamon Stick
1 tbsp Lemon Juice
Garnish:
1/2 cup Pistachios, finely ground
1/2 tsp Cardamom
Tools:
9" x 13" pan
Pasty Brush

Directions:
1. Start by laying the phyllo dough down flat on a clean working surface covered by plastic wrap and a damp towel to prevent the dough from drying up.
2. Using the pastry brush spread butter on the bottom of the 9x13 pan.
3. Place 10 sheets of phyllo dough on the bottom of the baking pan brushing melted butter over each sheet before placing the next one down so each sheet is covered in butter.
4. On top of the 10th buttered sheet spread 3/4 cups of nut mixture evenly on top.  Place 4 sheets of phyllo dough on top of nuts brushing melted butter on top of each before placing the next sheet down.  Repeat 3 times adding nuts on top of the 4 buttered sheets of phyllo dough until the last 3/4 cup of nuts are used up. (You should use a total of 12 sheets in this process)
5. After adding the last of the nuts top the dish with 10 more sheets of phyllo dough brushing butter over each sheet until the last sheet is spread on top.  Brush the top sheet with an extra amount of melted butter.
6. Slice the baklava into strips that are about 1 to 1 1/2" wide then again diagonally making diamond shapes.
7. Bake in the oven until the top of the dough is a golden brown (not too dark), about 45 minutes.
8. While baklava is in the oven, bring water, sugar, cinnamon stick and honey to a boil over medium heat.  Boil for 10 minutes.  Add lemon juice and boil for 2 more minutes.  Remove from heat and cool until baklava is done baking.
9. Once baklava is out of the oven, spoon honey syrup over the top, letting it seep into the scoring.  Let soak in for 4 to 6 hours before serving for best results.

Description: 
This is by far one of my favorite desserts!  Sweet, buttery, nutty, crispy goodness that literally melts in your mouth.  It's highly addictive so be careful!
