Ingredients:
1 c butter
1 1/3 c ghirardelli bittersweet (60%) chocolate chips
5 eggs
2/3 c sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp instant coffee granules
4 tsp flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 450F. Prepare a muffin pan with liners and cooking spray.
Melt chocolate and butter together in the microwave (on medium power) or in a double-boiler. Set aside to cool.
In a separate bowl, beat eggs and sugar together to dissolve sugar. Add vanilla and (crushed) coffee granules; stir. Combine (cooled) chocolate and egg mixtures. Stir in flour.
Divide batter into prepared muffin pan. Bake 12 standard muffins for about 8-10 minutes. They are done when the batter puffs around the outside, but the middle is still jiggly. Serve warm.

Description: 
Pure chocolate bliss! These are rich and delicious and warm and gooey and... mmmm... Cold and creamy vanilla ice cream goes perfectly with these, and salted caramel sauce is another great addition. Sometimes I serve them with just fresh berries and whipped cream. It doesn't matter really, it is all about the chocolate!
