Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups Borden® Triple Cheddar Natural Shreds
1 cup Borden® Colby Jack Natural Shreds
2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
2 tablespoons Borden® Butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup Borden® Vitamin D Milk
1 cup Borden® Half & Half
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
Salt to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray.  Combine Cheddar and Colby Jack cheeses in a medium bowl and set aside.
Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to package directions; drain well and set aside.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Blend in flour, stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly. Gradually whisk in milk and half & half. Stir constantly, until mixture boils and thickens (about 2 to 3 minutes). Remove from heat and add cayenne and black peppers, and 2 cups of the reserved cheese mixture; stir until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.
Stir cooked macaroni into the sauce and season to taste. Place in the prepared casserole dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and dot with additional butter, if desired. Bake 25 to 30 minutes or until heated through and lightly browned.
