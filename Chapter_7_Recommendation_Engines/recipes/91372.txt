Ingredients:
2 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat
3 pounds Swiss cheese, shredded
2 (11 ounce) cans artichoke hearts, drained
6 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons green onion, finely chopped
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cups whole milk
1/4 cup dry sherry
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce to taste
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
2 cups bread crumbs
1 tablespoon paprika

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large casserole dish.
Layer the crabmeat, Swiss cheese, and artichoke hearts in two layers each into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish.
Melt the butter in a skillet. Cook the green onion in the butter until softened. Stir in the flour until smooth. Slowly add the milk while stirring and continue cooking and stirring until thick. Add the sherry, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the sauce over the layers in the casserole dish. Sprinkle breadcrumbs and paprika over the top.
Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
