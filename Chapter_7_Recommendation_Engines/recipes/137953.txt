Ingredients:
2 chai tea bags
1/4 cup boiling water
1 cup unsalted butter or margarine, softened
8 cups confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup cold milk

Directions:
Prepare a very strong tea by steeping the tea bag in boiling water for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cream the butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer until fluffy. Add confectioners' sugar, and continue creaming until well blended.
Pour tea into cold milk; beat milk into frosting until incorporated. Continue beating frosting until fluffy.
