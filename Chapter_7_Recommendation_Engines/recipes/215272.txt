Ingredients:
1/2 cup masoor dal
1 red onion, minced
1 cup water, or more as needed, divided
3 tablespoons canola oil
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons berbere spice blend, or to taste
1 cup plain tomato sauce
1 cup diced zucchini
1 cup diced carrots
salt to taste

Directions:
Soak masoor dal in 4 cups water; swish with your hands to clean. Drain; repeat twice.
Combine onion and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan over medium-low heat; simmer until water is absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Add oil and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes. Add bebere powder; cook and stir for 3 minutes more.
Mix tomato sauce and 1/2 cup water into onion-spice mixture; bring to a boil. Add masoor dal and carrots; reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally and adding water as needed to maintain a soupy consistency, until carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add zucchini; cook and stir until lentils are tender, about 5 minutes more. Add salt to taste.
