Ingredients:
•1 lb shrimp, 25 count to a pound
•4 large cloves of garlic, finely minced
•1 tsp sweet Spanish paprika
•1 tsp red pepper flakes
•2-3 oz (60-89 ml) cognac (or substitute dry sherry)
•4 oz (125 ml) virgin olive oil
•3 tsp chopped fresh parsley
•1 lemon for juice
•1 fresh baguette, sliced

Directions:
This recipe makes 4 servings as an appetizer. If preparing for a main course, double the recipe.
In a sauté pan or heavy frying pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and sauté for about one minute or until they just begin to brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic!
Raise the heat to high and immediately add the shrimp, lemon juice, sherry or cognac and paprika. Stir well, then sauté, stirring briskly until the shrimp turn pink and curl – about 3 minutes.
Remove from heat and transfer shrimp with oil and sauce to a warm plate or serve right from the pan. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with fresh bread.
