Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
2 tsp hot sauce
1/4 cup Old Bay Seasoning
6 catfish filets
2 cups self-rising cornmeal
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tbsp Cajun seasoning
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp garlic powder
Canola oil to cover pan 1 1/2 inches
1 tbsp fresh parsley chopped
2 lemons, sliced

Directions:
Combine buttermilk, hot sauce and Old Bay Seasoning in shallow pan or casserole.
Add catfish so they are covered by buttermilk mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
Meanwhile, combine cornmeal, flour, Cajun seasoning, salt, pepper, and  garlic powder in shallow bowl, mixing well.
Heat oil in cast-iron skillet until 350 degrees.
Remove each catfish from buttermilk and dredge in cornmeal mixture until well-covered. Carefully add to skillet, making sure not to over-crowd the pan.
Fry 4 minutes on each side until golden brown.
Remove to paper towels and keep warm until ready to serve.
Garnish with parsley and lemon slices. Serve with tartar sauce.
