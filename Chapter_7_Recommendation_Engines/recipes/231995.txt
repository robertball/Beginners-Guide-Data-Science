Description: 
Low on ingredients? This is quick, easy, and surprisingly filling.
 This recipe capitalizes on the wonderful taste of avocado, so make sure yours is in season and ripe. The idea of this snack is that avocado will overwhelm the cheese, but the cheese will add an additional taste into the mix.
