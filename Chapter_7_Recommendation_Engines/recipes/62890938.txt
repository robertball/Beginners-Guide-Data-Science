Ingredients:
1 TB vegetable oil
2-3 pounds boneless, skinless fajita-seasoned chicken thighs, cut into 2" chunks. ***See NOTE***
1 large sweet onion, chopped coarse
1 yellow squash, cut into 1" cubes.
1 zucchini, cut into 1" cubes
1 calabaza squash, cut into 1" cubes. Another zucchini can be used if you don't have a Latin market in your area.
1 medium tomato, chopped coarsely.
1 8 oz can tomato sauce
1 cup chicken broth.
1 16-oz bag frozen baby white and yellow corn. Sweet corn will do, if there isn't baby at your market
3 TSP garlic powder
3 TSP Cumin
2 TSP Fresh Ground Pepper
2 TSP salt, or to taste.

Directions:
In a large skillet (largest you have), heat oil over medium heat.
Put in chicken and cook until just golden.
Put in onions and squashes. Cook until the squashes are slightly tender.
Put in remaining ingredients, and stir well.
Cover pan, reduce heat to medium low, and let simmer for 15 minutes. Stir and let simmer another 15 minutes, covered.
Serve with refried beans, rice, avocado slices and tortillas.
