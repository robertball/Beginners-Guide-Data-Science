Ingredients:
Crust - pre-purchased graham crust (or make your own)
Filling:
1/2 cup whipping cream
1 pkg (8 oz/250 g) cream cheese, cubed
1 cup (250 mL) smooth peanut butter
2 tbsp (30 mL) butter, softened
1 tbsp (30ml) vanilla
1 cup (250ml) icing sugar
Topping:
6oz (120grams) semi sweet chocolate
1/2 cup whipping cream
2 tbsp roasted peanuts, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C)...if making own crust
In bowl, toss crumbs with butter. Pat into 9-inch (23 cm) pie plate, without covering rim. Bake in centre of oven until firm, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
Filling:
In bowl, whip cream; set aside. In large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth; beat in peanut butter, butter and vanilla. Beat in icing sugar until fluffy. Fold one-quarter of the whipped cream into filling; fold in remaining cream. Spread over crust. Cover loosely and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Topping:
Meanwhile, chop chocolate finely; place in heatproof bowl. In small saucepan, warm cream over medium-low heat until bubbles form around edge; pour over chocolate and stir until melted. Let cool. Drizzle over filling; sprinkle with nuts. Cover loosely and refrigerate until set, 2 hours. (Make-ahead: Refrigerate for up to 2 days.)
