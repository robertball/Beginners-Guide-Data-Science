Description: 
I deployed with the U.S. Navy on the USS Enterprise, and it was there I had the best mac and cheese of my life. I've spent a number of years trying new recipes to produce the mild, thick and creamy version we were served. After numerous attempts and fails I came up with this. It's so simple and just like we got weekly while we were haze grey and underway.
