Description: 
My grandmother, in the Depression, had five children and not a lot of income. So she had to get up quite early in the morning and make loaves of bread and rolls to sell so that she could supplement the income and keep the family going. My mother would deliver them to the neighbors, still hot out of the oven, with a jar of jam. Now I make my living making bread.
