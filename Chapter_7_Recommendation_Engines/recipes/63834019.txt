Ingredients:
Small Buttermilk
1/2 tsp Salt
1 Tbsp Season All
3/4 tsp Pepper
1 cup Flour
2 tsp Paprika
1/2 stick butter
12 chicken tenderloins

Directions:
Soak thawed chicken in buttermilk for 30 minutes
While chicken is brining, mix all the dry ingredients together in a ziplock bag (omitting butter)
Preheat oven to 400F
When chicken is almost finished brining (about 5 minutes left), place butter in 9x13 pan and place in oven until butter is melted.  Remove from oven and spread around evenly--covering all areas.
Shake off excess buttermilk from tenderloin.  One by one, shake in flour mixture
Place each piece in pan-- do not overcrowd, otherwise chicken will not brown
Cook 20 minutes, turn over, cook additional 20 minutes.

Description: 
This tastes similar to KFC if they had a similar baked alternative.  If you are doubling the recipe, you may want to use a 11x15 sheet pan (don't forget to double the butter though).
