Ingredients:
1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice
¾ cup brown sugar
½ cup shoyu (Japanese soy sauce)
⅓ cup ketchup
⅓ cup red wine
¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
4 drops liquid smoke, or more to taste (optional)
3 (3 1/2) pound fryer chickens, quartered

Directions:
Stir pineapple, brown sugar, shoyu, ketchup, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, garlic, and liquid smoke together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer 1 1/2 cups sauce to a bowl and refrigerate.
Place chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour remaining sauce over the top; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from marinade; discard used marinade.
Cook chicken on the preheated grill until caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and cook, turning and basting frequently with reserved 1 1/2 cups pineapple sauce, until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This Hawaiian BBQ is commonly found at roadside fundraisers. This recipe uses crushed pineapple and brown sugar for caramelized texture and wonderful flavor. And, if you are wondering, 'huli' is the Hawaiian term for 'turn.'
