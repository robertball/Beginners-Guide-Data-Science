Ingredients:
4 large russet (baking) potatoes
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
1 tablespoon butter
2 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 (15 ounce) jar Classico® Fresh Four Cheese Alfredo Sauce, divided

Directions:
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Avoid over cooking to prevent skins from splitting. Drain. Refrigerate until chilled through.
Combine paprika, salt, pepper and cayenne.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
Peel the fully chilled potatoes. Grate the potatoes using course box grater or food processor.
Layer half the potatoes into the buttered baking dish, season with a sprinkling of prepared seasoning blend, half the diced green onions, some parsley, and half a jar of the Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers ending with the remaining sauce and a sprinkling of the seasoning. Reserve some green onions and parsley for garnish.
Bake until hot and slightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes.
Garnish with reserved green onions and parsley.
