Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small carrot, diced
1 stalk celery, diced
salt and ground black pepper
3/4 pound broccoli - cut into florets, stems peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick
1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped green olives
2 teaspoons maple syrup
1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until aromatic, about 3 minutes. Stir in the carrots and celery, season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli, recover, and steam until bright green, 4 minutes. Remove the broccoli from the steamer and place in a 8x8 inch baking dish; set aside.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Pour the can of diced tomatoes and green olives into the skillet with the onion and carrot mixture. Stir and cook over medium-high heat until most of the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Mix in the maple syrup, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook and stir for 3 minutes.
Pour the sauce over the broccoli in the 8x8 inch baking dish. Evenly distribute the goat cheese and Parmesan cheese over the broccoli and sauce.
Bake in preheated oven until the cheese begins to brown, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
This dish helps me warm up on a cold winter's day without being too heavy.  It was inspired by a dish from my favorite vegetarian cookbook.  I eat it with rice and chicken for dinner or a piece of brown bread for lunch.
