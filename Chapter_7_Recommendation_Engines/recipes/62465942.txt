Ingredients:
2 pounds turkey/chicken breast
1 tbsp vegetable oil
4 (15oz) cans canellini beans, drained
1 (29oz) can hominy, drained
3 (15oz) cans low-sodium chicken broth
2 onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 serrano peppers, minced (option: seeds/membranes removed for less heat, I did one full pepper and two without seeds/membranes)
1/4cup chopped cilantro
1 Â½ tbsp cumin
1 tsp Cajun seasoning

Directions:
Cook turkey/chicken breasts in the 1 tbsp oil until cooked through.  Remove from heat and shred meat with forks on a separate plate.
In the same pan, cook the garlic and onions on medium about 5 minutes until starting to brown.
Meanwhile, in the crockpot that you will simmer in, combine 1 can of hominy and 1 can of canellini beans with all 3 cans of chicken broth.
With immersion blender, blend ingredients into a smooth base.  If you do not have an immersion blender, blend the mixture in a standard blender in batches.
Once you have a base, add cooked onions/garlic, shredded meat, remaining 3 cans cannellini beans, serrano peppers, cilantro and spices.
Cook on low for 4-6 hours or high 2-3 hours for flavors to combine.
May be thickened with cornstarch if needed.
You could also do this stovetop on low heat instead of in the crockpot.

Description: 
Healthy alternative to other chili. Hearty with just a touch of spice. Got this from my co-worker who got it from her physical trainer. This chili won in our chili competition at work.
