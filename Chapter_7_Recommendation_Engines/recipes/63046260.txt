Ingredients:
1 jar of spaghetti sauce
1 can sliced olives
1 package lean hamburger (use Sausage to spice it up!)
1 Tbs olive oil
1 box pasta
2 tsp sugar
A pinch of salt
2 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp onion powder
oregano to taste
italian seasoning to taste
basil to taste
For extra flavor, add a splash of red wine to the sauce when you add the seasonings!

Directions:
In the 5 quart pot, start about 4 quarts of water boiling. Add a pinch of salt, and a Tbs of olive oil.
In your skillet, top the meat with 1/2 the minced garlic and the onion powder and brown it. Drain the meat on a separate plate lined with paper towels.
When your water starts to boil, add the pasta and boil for the recommended package directions according to what firmness you prefer. Drain and rinse the noodles with your colander. You might want to pat dry the hamburger meat at this point if it seems greasy on top.
While those are draining, pour the sauce into the 5 quart pot, and add the olives, remaining garlic powder, and sugar. Stir in while heating on medium low. Stir in hamburger. Stir in drained pasta, and mix well.

Description: 
This is a quick and easy recipe, one of the best parts about it is how flexible it is. You can use any shape of pasta in it. I like the ones that look like corkscrews. (they're a little more kid-friendly, too!)
