Description: 
I have been using this method called 'cold brewing' during the hot summer months for years. I have not seen a recipe for it on this site so I figure it's time to let the secret out. Requires no coffee pot or fancy equipment either, gotta love simplicity at it's best.

 This makes the perfect cup of iced coffee. The heating of the beans is removed from this process, therefore it also removes the acidity from the coffee. Perfect for sensitive stomachs like mine! Enjoy. Stays fresh for about a week in the fridge. Add ice, simple syrup, or chocolate syrup for sweetness and a touch of cream and you will wonder (like I did) why I haven't heard of this miracle before!
