Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
4 tablespoons guajillo chile powder
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/4 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt to taste

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine water, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and beef cubes. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes.
Combine the chile powder, minced garlic, and oregano in a small bowl. Add enough of the beef cooking water to make a paste. After 30 minutes, stir the spice paste into the beef mixture.
Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook flour, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Take 1 cup of the spiced cooking water and whisk it into the flour mixture until smooth. Stir in the cumin, chopped parsley, and salt.
Transfer the thickened sauce mixture into the saucepan with the beef. Simmer until tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
