Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2/3 cup butter, melted
2/3 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1/3 cup milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup orange marmalade

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch Bundt pan.
Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, set aside. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, melted butter, eggs, milk and lemon juice. Add dry ingredients to the egg mixture, mix until well blended. Finally, stir in the walnuts and marmalade. Pour batter into the prepared Bundt cake pan.
Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until cake springs back when lightly touched. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Description: 
A spicy fragrant Bundt cake with a hint of orange. This is delicious served with a hot cup of tea. When other types of jam are added in place of the marmalade, it's then called a jam cake.
