Ingredients:
2 medium russet potatoes
4 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
4 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese
12 frozen cooked meatballs (such as JohnsonvilleÂ®), thawed
4 (1 ounce) sticks string cheese sticks, pulled into thin strips
8 candy eyeballs

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Pierce potatoes with a fork and microwave for 10 minutes. Let cool until safe to handle. Cut in half lengthwise and scoop out most of the flesh, leaving 1/2 inch around the shell. Discard flesh or save for another use.
Place potato halves cut-side down on a baking sheet. Rub each half with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Flip potatoes over. Sprinkle each with 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon Parmesan cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until shells are crisp, 12 to 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, place meatballs on microwave-safe plates. Cover with paper towels. Microwave until hot, 70 to 75 seconds per batch. Let rest until cool enough to not melt the cheese.
Wrap 1/4 of the cheese strings around 3 meatballs to create a mummy effect. Repeat with remaining cheese and meatballs.
Remove potato skin coffins from the oven and place a mummy in each coffin. Apply candy eyeballs.
