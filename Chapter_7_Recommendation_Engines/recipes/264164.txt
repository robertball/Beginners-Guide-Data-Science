Ingredients:
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons sesame seeds
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon minced onion
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
4 salmon fillets

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Mix honey, green onions, soy sauce, sesame seeds, garlic, onion, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl until blended.
Place salmon in single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon honey mixture evenly on top of salmon; the mixture will run off, but try to coat the fish with a thin layer all over.
Roast salmon in the preheated oven, basting salmon with the sauce at least once, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
I got this recipe from a friend and, as a new cook, it is easy to make and delicious to boot! Even when I make this recipe with fewer pieces of salmon (2 small salmon filets), I still make the same amount of honey glaze, because it is so delicious and I prefer having more sauce rather than not enough.
