Ingredients:
1 cup water
½ cup butter
1 cup 1-1 gluten-free flour
4 eggs

Directions:
Heat oven to 400°.
Heat water and butter to a rolling boil in a saucepan.
Stir in flour all at once.
Stir vigorously over low heat until mixture forms a ball (about 1 minute).
Remove from heat.
Beat in egg thoroughly. 1 at a time.
Beat until smooth.
Drop onto an ungreased baking sheet forming 8 mounds, 3 inches apart (*I generally make them smaller than that. They can be any size).
Bake for 45-50 minutes until golden brown and dry.
Cool in a draft-free area.
Once cool cut off the top third of the pastry
Scoop out the innards (eggy stuff).
Fill with French Custard Filling.
Top with European Chocolate Icing.
ENJOY!
