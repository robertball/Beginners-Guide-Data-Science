Ingredients:
2 cups margarine
6 eggs
1 cup white sugar
2 cups sour cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
12 cups all-purpose flour
2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
1 pound ground walnuts
1 cup white sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 ounces apricot preserves
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 egg yolk

Directions:
Prepare two fillings.  Mix together walnuts, 1 cup sugar, and 1/ 8 teaspoon cinnamon.  In a separate bowl, mix lekvar with lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon.
In a large bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, 2 cups butter or margarine, and 6 eggs.  Mix well.  Add sour cream, milk, flour, yeast, and salt.  Beat thoroughly until dough does not stick to hands.
Form dough into 7 or 8 balls.  Roll out each ball on a lightly floured board to a rectangle.
Brush dough with melted butter.  Fill with fillings.  Roll tight.  Place on greased pans, and let stand for approximately 4 hours to raise before baking.
Brush tops with beaten egg yolk just before placing in oven.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.

Description: 
This is an old Slovak recipe.  In Slovak it is called Roshky.  The rolls are filled with lekvar, a thick, soft fruit spread.  This is an all day project.  This recipe will make 7 or 8 twelve inch loaves, or some dough may be reserved for lekvar squares.
