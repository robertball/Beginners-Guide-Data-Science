Ingredients:
2 large limes, quartered
1/2 bunch mint leaves
7 strawberries, quartered
1 cup white sugar
3 cups carbonated water

Directions:
Squeeze the lime quarters into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss the juiced limes into the pitcher along with the mint, strawberries, and sugar. Crush the fruits together with a muddler to release the juices from the strawberries and the oil from the mint leaves. Stir in the club soda until the sugar has dissolved. Pour into the sugared glasses over ice cubes to serve.

Description: 
While making a pitcher of my Strawberry Mojitos, I had a request for one without any alcohol.  It seemed to be a hit! You can adjust the taste by adding less or more of any ingredient.  Refreshing and light, it's perfect on a hot summer day!
