Ingredients:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup wheat germ
1/2 cup ground pumpkin seeds

1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 ripe bananas
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 egg

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a mini muffin tin.
Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, wheat germ, pumpkin seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
Mash bananas in a separate bowl. Mix in oil, egg, honey, and vanilla extract. Pour into the flour mixture. Stir batter until just combined. Pour into the prepared tin.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 12 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack.
