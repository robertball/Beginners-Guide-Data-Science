Ingredients:
2 cups instant whole-grain brown rice
1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
2 tbsp lite soy sauce
2 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp canola oil
2 tbsp apricot preserves
1 lb. chicken breast cut in bite-size pieces
1 clove minced garlic
2 tsp finely grated or minced ginger
1 cup low sodium chicken broth
2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup sliced carrots
1 cup red pepper, chunked
1 cup green pepper, chunked
1 cup snow peas
1-5 oz can sliced water chestnuts, drained

Directions:
Prepare rice according to package's instructions.
Wisk vinegar, soy sauce, cornstarch and apricot preserves in a small bowl. Set aside.
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, undisturbed, for 2 minutes.
Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink on the outside and just starting to brown in spots, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.
Add remaining oil, garlic, and ginger to pan and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 20-30 seconds.
Add broth and bring to boil, stirring constantly.
Add vegetables, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, 4-6 minutes.
Stir in water chestnuts and the chicken.
Whisk the reserved sauce and add to the pan.
Simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened and the chicken is heated through, about 1 minute.
Serve with the rice.
Each serving consists of 1-1/2 cup stir-fry with 1/2 cup rice.
