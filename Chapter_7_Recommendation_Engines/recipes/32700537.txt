Ingredients:
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cracked pepper or coarsely
Ground pepper
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon V-8 juice
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce, such as
Tabasco
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cracked pepper or coarsely
Ground pepper
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon V-8 juice
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce, such as
Tabasco

Directions:
2 c  All-purpose flour
1/2 ts Salt
1/2 ts Cracked pepper or coarsely
Ground pepper
2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
Margarine, softened
2/3 c  Plus 1 Tablespoon V-8 juice
1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce, such as
Tabasco
The vegetable juice creates an inviting red color that forewarns
of the snap in these spicy crackers, which comes from black pepper
and hot pepper sauce. These are excellent party snacks.
Preheat the oven to 325'F.
Stir together the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl or in the
food processor. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
coarse meal.
In a separate bowl, mix the V-8 and the hot pepper sauce. Add the
V-8 mixture to the flour mixture and blend to form a dough that
will hold together in a cohesive ball.
Divide into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or
pastry cloth, roll thin, 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick. With a sharp knife,
cut the dough into 2-inch squares and place them on an ungreased
baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a
fork.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes. Cool on
a rack. Yield: 70-75.
VARIATIONS: You can substitute or combine tomato juice and other
vegetable juices with the V-8.
For more spice, increase the hot pepper sauce or add celery seed,
cayenne, or your favorite herb.
Substituting 2/3 cup of wheat or oat bran for the same amount of
flour will increases the healthfulness of these crackers.
