Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 small head cabbage, cored and cut into strips
1 (8 ounce) package wide egg noodles
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat until ground beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease.
Cook and stir cabbage into ground beef mixture until cabbage is just tender, about 5 minutes.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
Stir noodles and cream of mushroom soup into the beef and cabbage until heated through; season with salt and black pepper.

Description: 
This is a great quick supper for busy nights, better for you than packaged hamburger meals, and I think it tastes better too! It's really easy to make and my family loves it with biscuits and butter.
