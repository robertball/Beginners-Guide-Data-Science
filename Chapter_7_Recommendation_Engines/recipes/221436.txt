Ingredients:
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1/4 cup minced onion
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained
1 teaspoon salt
4 cups hot water
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
1 red bell pepper, chopped
1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
2 tablespoons butter, divided (optional)
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup dried cranberries
1/4 cup golden raisins

Directions:
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion for 1 minute. Add garlic; cook until golden brown, about 1 minute. Add rice and salt; cook rice until it starts to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in hot water. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
Place carrots in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper and red bell pepper. Cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Combine corn and 1 tablespoon butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in the microwave until heated through, about 2 minutes.
Soak raisins, cranberries, and golden raisins in a bowl of hot water until puffed up, about 10 minutes. Drain.
Remove rice from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large pot. Add carrot-bell pepper mixture, corn, and raisin mixture. Toss to distribute. Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon butter.
