Ingredients:
1 egg, lightly beaten
2 tablespoons quick cooking oats
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1/2 pound lean ground turkey
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup diced peeled potatoes
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
4 (14.5 ounce) cans reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 cup uncooked alphabet pasta

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Crumble turkey over mixture and mix well. Shape into 1/2-in. balls. In a nonstick skillet, brown meatballs in small batches over medium heat until no longer pink. Remove from the heat; set aside.
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, saute the onion, celery, carrots and potatoes in oil for 5 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add garlic; saute for 1 minute longer. Add the broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, basil and thyme; bring to a boil. Add pasta; cook for 5-6 minutes. Reduce heat; add meatballs. Simmer, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
