Ingredients:
5 Roma Tomatoes
1/2 Medium Size Onion
2 Medium Size Jalapeno Peppers
2 Large Cloves of Garlic
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
1/2 Lime's Juice
1/4 Cup Cilantro Leaves
1/2 Tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Cooking Spray

Directions:
Take two of your Roma tomatoes and slice them in very thin circles. Using cooking spray, coat your cookie sheet and place the tomato slices on top.
Pop your tomato slices into the oven on the top shelf and set the oven to broil. Once they become very shriveled remove them. It is extremely easy to burn them so watch carefully!
In your food processor chop up:
1/4 Medium Size Onion
1 Medium Size Jalapeno Pepper
1 Large Clove of Garlic (not bulbs)
(Note: This "half" of the ingredients will be roasted. The other "half" will be used raw)
In a skillet at medium heat pour 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Then place the chopped jalapeno, garlic and onion on top of the oil. Cook this mixture until the onions appear wilted.
Next chop the remaining tomatoes, 1 clove garlic, 1/4 onion and 1 jalapeno.
To this tomato mixture chop in:
Cooked Onion, garlic and Jalapeno Mixture from step four
Roasted Tomato Slices
1/2 Teaspoon Salt
1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
1/2 Lime's Juice
1/4 Cup Cilantro Leaves
