Ingredients:
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1 pound ground beef
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, or more to taste
ground black pepper to taste
1 (14.5 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers
1 (15 ounce) can chili beans in zesty sauce
1 (15 ounce) can black beans
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 pinch chili powder, or to taste
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add garlic and onion and cook until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add beef, crushed red pepper, and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Drain and discard fat and excess oil.
Add tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, chili beans, black beans, and corn to the saucepan and return to low heat. Add cayenne pepper and chili powder. Season with additional black pepper if desired. Add Worcestershire sauce. Blend well and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 20 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
If you like really spicy beef chili, this is a quick and simple recipe to try. I don't include measurements for some of the spices as they should be to taste (the more, the better for me). I taste the chili throughout the simmering process and add more spice as I go.
