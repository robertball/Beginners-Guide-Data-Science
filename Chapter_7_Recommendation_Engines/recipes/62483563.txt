Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 bananas, mashed
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup applesauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 10 muffin cups, or line with muffin papers.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, and baking powder. In another bowl, beat together bananas, sugar, egg and applesauce. Stir the banana mixture into the flour mixture just until moistened. Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups.
Sprinkle with "Basic Streusel Topping" if desired.
Bake in preheated oven for 18 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of a muffin comes out clean.
