Ingredients:
1 egg
3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound lean ground beef
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 cup beef broth
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 medium onion, quartered and sliced
8 oz. mushrooms, sliced
1 stalk celery, chopped

Directions:
In a small bowl, combine the egg, bread crumbs, garlic powder and pepper. Crumble beef over mixture; mix well. Shape into four patties; dredge in 2 tablespoons flour. In a small non-stick skillet, brown patties on both sides in oil; drain. Set patties aside.  Saute onion, celery and mushrooms, adding a little more oil if necessary.
Add the remaining flour to the skillet; whisk in beef broth until smooth. Stir in the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil. Return patties to the pan. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until beef is no longer pink. Serve gravy over patties.
