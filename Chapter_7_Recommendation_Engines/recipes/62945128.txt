Ingredients:
¾ cup milk  room temperature
½ cup margarine or butter
½ cup shortening
1 ¼ cups white sugar
¼ teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Cream the margarine and shortening until very soft and creamy.  Gradually alternate adding the sugar and milk.  Add the vanilla and beat until very fluffy – at least 10 minutes.  Yes, you could beat for about 5 minutes, but the longer you beat it – the fluffier it gets!
