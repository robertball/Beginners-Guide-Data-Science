1/2 cup lard
1 1/2 cups white sugar

Cream butter, lard and sugar.  Add eggs and beat.   Mix sour cream and baking soda together and add to egg mixture.  Add flour and salt and mix well.
Chill dough until firm enough to roll.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
Roll out dough and cut with cookie cutter.  It's wise to keep dough in refrigerator between rolling out batches.  Bake for 5 - 7 minutes.
