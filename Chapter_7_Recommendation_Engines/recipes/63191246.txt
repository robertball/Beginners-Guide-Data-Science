Ingredients:
2 loaves frozen bread dough, thawed and allowed to rise
20 slices provolone
15 slices mortadella
1 jar roasted sweet red peppers, drained, seeded, halved
1 lb mozzarella, either sliced or shredded
20 slices thin sliced deli ham or proscuito
3 egg omelet layer (see note)
1 jar Macedonian mild golden peppers, seeded and halved
1 10 package frozen spinach, thawed and well drained
8 oz sliced salami and/or pepperoni
1 egg white mixed with tablespoon water

Directions:
Spray a 10 inch springform pan with non-stick spray.  Roll one loaf of bread dough into circle large enough to fit in bottom and up sides of pan.  If dough is too elastic to work with, let it rest a few minutes and try again. Press rolled dough onto bottom and sides of pan.
Arrange layers of cheeses, meats and peppers in first 1/3 of pan.  Add prepared omelet layer (see note), then more cheese, peppers and meats, then the drained spinach.  Press ingredients down firmly as you go.  Add more meats and cheeses until level with top of pan, pressing down firmly.
Roll remaining loaf of dough into circle to fit top of torta.  Pinch dough together at sides and brush with egg white mixture.
Bake at 350 degrees 1 hour or until bread is golden and pulls away from sides of pan slightly.
Cool completely before removing from pan.  Cut into wedges to serve.

Description: 
I got this recipe from the LA Times food section over 20 years ago.  It's my go-to party dish when I want to do something spectacular, but surprisingly easy.  You can substitute other deli meats or cheese, or eliminate the omelet or spinach layers according to taste and availability of ingredients.
