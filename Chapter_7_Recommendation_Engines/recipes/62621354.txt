Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 tablespoons butter
2 (10.75 ounce) cans  condensed cream of chicken soup
1 onion, finely diced
2 (10 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough, torn into pieces
some people substituted mushroom or celery soup for one of the cans of chix soup
some added more spices but not more salt; some said use chix broth in place of water
all said cook cut up biscuits for at least the last two hours
someone added a can or two of mixed veggies to the recipe at the start; sounds good to me.

Directions:
Place the chicken, butter, soup, and onion in a slow cooker, and fill with enough water to cover.
Cover, and cook for 5 to 6 hours on High. About 30 minutes before serving, place the torn biscuit dough in the slow cooker. Cook until the dough is no longer raw in the center.
