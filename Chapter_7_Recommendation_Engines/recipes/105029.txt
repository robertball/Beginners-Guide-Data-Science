Ingredients:
1/2 cup margarine
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 cup minced onion
1 tablespoon dried tarragon
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 cups half and half
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cold water
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt the margarine in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.  Stir in the garlic, onion, and tarragon; cook until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.  Add white wine, and cook for 5 minutes.  Pour in half and half and Parmesan cheese; increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.
Whisk the flour into the water, dissolving any lumps.  When the sauce has come to a boil, stir in the flour mixture to thicken to desired consistency.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
