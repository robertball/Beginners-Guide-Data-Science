Ingredients:
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)
1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle apple ale (such as Redd's Apple Ale®)

Directions:
Gently pour half of the apple ale into a tall beer/pint glass.
Place a large tablespoon, dome side up, an inch or so above the apple ale, with the tip of the spoon pointed slightly downhill.
Slowly pour half the stout beer over the tablespoon, so the stout gently pours down the side of the glass in a thick trickle. Allow to stand a few seconds so 2 distinct layers of beer form.
Repeat for second glass.

This is delicious! This can also be made using any hard cider or cider beer, but this is our favorite version. Feel free to experiment, enjoy!
