2 teaspoons cumin seeds
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Description: 
My friend April made this soup for me one afternoon when visiting. I loved it so much, I asked her how she made it and now make it often for myself. It's easy, wholesome, and can be adjusted to personal tastes easily. Enjoy!
