Ingredients:
1 (9 ounce) pouch Progresso™ Recipe Starters™ fire roasted tomato cooking sauce
1 pound extra lean (at least 93%) ground beef
1/3 cup Progresso® Italian style panko crispy bread crumbs
1 egg
2 (1 ounce) sticks string cheese*, each cut into 6 pieces
Hot cooked mashed potatoes

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the cooking sauce, the beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well mixed.
Spray 12 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray. Divide beef mixture evenly among cups (slightly less than 1/4 cup each). Push 1 piece of cheese into center of each.
Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until thermometer inserted in center of loaves in middle of muffin pan reads 160 degrees F. Meanwhile, heat remaining sauce until hot. Immediately remove loaves from muffin pan; spoon heated sauce over loaves. Serve with potatoes.
