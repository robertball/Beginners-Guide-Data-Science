Ingredients:
2 lbs of 80% lean ground beef
½ cup minced onion
¼ cup minced celery
12 oz bottle of Heinz chili sauce (find it in the ketchup aisle at the grocery store)
3 tablespoons dill pickle juice, it adds tang. Do not omit this ingredient
2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard
3/4 cup water
Hamburger buns
American or cheddar cheese slices, optional, kids love sloppy joes with cheese.

Directions:
Brown the beef, celery and onion in a skillet till the meat is nicely browned but still a little pink inside. Drain off any fat and crumble the meat into tiny pieces. Stir in the chili sauce, mustard, water and the pickle juice to the pan. Bring to a slow boil then reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for about 10 minutes, flipping and stirring once in a while. Add more water if the mixture is too dry and heat till warm throughout.
Serve on hamburger buns with optional American or cheddar cheese slices in the sandwich.
A veggie such as corn and potato chips make good sides.
