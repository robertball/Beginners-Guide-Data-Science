Ingredients:
1 lb. thin spaghetti
1 teaspoon Kosher salt
1 tablespoon Sesame oil
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 small English cucumber, julienned
8 thinly sliced boiled ham (such as Oscar Mayer)
6 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
1/2 cup finely chopped green onion

Directions:
Cook spagetti according to package directions.
While pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, white vinegar, sugar, and hot sauce.  Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
Cut the ham slices into long thin strips and julienne the cucumber.  Also, chop the green onions
Drain the pasta; run cooked pasta under cold water until cold, using your hands to pull pasta apart to cool evenly.  When pasta is cold and completely drained, transfer to a very large bowl and add the oils and the salt.  Again, mix with your hands because it helps distribute the oils better than tongs.
Add the soy sauce mixture, green onions, ham and cucumber to the noodles and mix well with your hands.
Cover and refrigerate 1 hour before serving.

Description: 
This is a great dish to pass for family get togethers.  My husband likes them so much he often eats them as a meal.  Even our two little boys (6 years and 3 years) gobble them up!  You'll get your hands dirty, but it's worth it!
