Description: 
This is a twist on pasta tossed in olive oil. It's a quick, easy, and healthy meal that even kids will eat without a fuss. It's really just a jumping off point, you can add in whatever herbs and spices suit your tastes. This is my toddler's favorite dish, and I have to admit, I love it, too!
