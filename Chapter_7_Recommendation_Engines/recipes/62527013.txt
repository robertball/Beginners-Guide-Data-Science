Ingredients:
1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
2 (14.5 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries
3/4 cup Splenda
2 1/2 T cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 egg white
2 tablespoons coarse sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C).
Refrigerate the pastry.
Drain cherries, reserving 1 cup liquid.
In a saucepan combine Splenda, cornstarch and salt.
Stir in cherry liquid and bring to a boil, stirring often.
Reduce heat and simmer for 2 to 5 minutes until it thickens.
When mixture is thickened, add butter, almond extract, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and cherries; cover and refrigerate.
On lightly floured surface, roll out half of the pastry into an 11 inch circle. Put into 9 inch pie dish.
Roll other half of pastry into another 11 inch circle. With a cookie cutter, cut as many stars as you can.
Pour cooled cherry filling into pie dish.
Place stars across the top of the pie and lightly brush with egg white.
Bake 15 minutes @ 425, then lower temperature to 325 and bake for 20 more minutes or until the crust is golden brown, a total of 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove from oven and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
Let cool before serving so filling won't run.
