Ingredients:
Tools:
Kitchen Aid mixer
Plastic Wrap
Non-reactive spoon
9x11 Glass baking dish
Mixing bowl
Sifter
Safety Goggles
Pam pan Spray
Ingredients:
½ cup Organic, Kosher Bacon Grease
2 Cups Marshmallow cream
1 Ostrich Egg OR 37 Quail eggs, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons of Sweat from Misha Collins’s brow
½ cup light brown sugar
½ cup caster sugar
4 cups Red Russian Kale, finely chopped - stems removed
1 Cup Organic Stone Ground Acorn Flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon Pacific Northwest Alder Smoked Sea Salt
1 teaspoon gunpowder
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground clove
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
For Frosting:
½ cup Salty Goat butter
6 oz Mayan chocolate, hand-ground by vestal virgins and gently melted by a trench-coat wearing Angel
1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses
3 Tablespoons fig jam
Sprinkles or ball bearings for decoration

Directions:
- Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees (F)
- Spray Glass pan with Pam and set aside
- Sift together Acorn flour and Baking soda
- then, while wearing your safety goggles, mix in:
1 teaspoon Pacific Northwest Alder Smoked Sea Salt
1 teaspoon gunpowder
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground clove
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
-Set dry mixture aside
-In the mixing bowl of your Kitchen Aid blend until well mixed:
½ cup Organic, Kosher Bacon Grease
3 Cups Marshmallow Fluff
1 Ostrich Egg OR 37 Quail eggs, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons of Sweat from Misha Collins brow
½ cup light brown sugar
½ cup caster sugar
-Once blended, add kale and stir 1 minute more.
-Next, remove mixer bowl from stand and, using your non-reactive spoon, gently fold in your Acorn flour and spice mix. Mix until the flour has been barely incorporated. There will be some lumps, that’s okay, don’t over mix. It angers the gunpowder.
-Pour batter into your greased baking dish and bake in pre-heated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a clean cutting board to finish cooling.  Once cool, cut into 2x1 inch squares, frost and add sprinkles or ball bearings for extra crunch!
To make frosting:
Add fig jam, molasses,  melted Mayan chocolate and goat butter to a clean mixing bowl, using an electric  mixer or your Kitchen Aid whisk attachment, beat the ingredients until well blended and spreadable. Use a small spatula to frost Dinomite’s Fluffy Bites.
Store Dinomite’s Fluffy Bites in an air-tight container in a cool, dry area.
Dinomite’s Fluffy Bites will stay fresh for 3 days.
Dinomite’s Fluffy Bites are a healthy and nutritious snack in name only. Do not believe everything you read and don’t actually eat gunpowder; Misha Collins’s brow sweat is perfectly safe for human consumption…probably.
