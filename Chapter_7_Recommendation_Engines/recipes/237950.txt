Ingredients:
2 pounds baby (1 to 2-inch long) potatoes, halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons onion powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter, cut into small chunks

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Place a 24-inch long piece of aluminum foil on a flat work surface. Spread potatoes onto the middle of the foil. Drizzle vinegar and olive oil over the potatoes; season with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Dot the top of the potatoes with small chunks of butter.
Bring opposing sides of the foil up and around the potatoes. Fold the two edges together at the top to create a seam on the top of the packet. Fold the remaining two edges to seal the packet.
Cook potatoes in the packet on the preheated grill with the seam-side facing up for about 10 minutes, turn and cook another 10 minutes. Turn the packet once again and continue cooking until a fork stuck through the foil and into the potatoes meet no resistance from the contents, about 5 minutes more.
