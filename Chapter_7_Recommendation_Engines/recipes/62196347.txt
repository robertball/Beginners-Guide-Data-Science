Description: 
This recipe is very simple. The spices give it an asia flare, which adds to its unique flavor. By simply adding sesame oil, bacon and fresh parsley and fresh stilton as garnishes, elevates this heart warming soup to another level. The semi-sweetness of the soup and the saltiness from the bacon and cheese, add seasoned/plain coutons with that touch of sesame oil makes it that more phenominal!
