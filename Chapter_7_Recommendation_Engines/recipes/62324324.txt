Ingredients:
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients. Refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours. Roll dough on lightly floured surface, until approximately 1/4 inch thick (for larger shapes, I prefer approximately 1/2" thickness). Cut into desired shape, and place on cookie sheet with parchment paper. Place cookies in freezer for 10 minutes. This will help prevent the cookies from spreading, and will help maintain their shape.
Bake 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until lightly browned. Let stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.
