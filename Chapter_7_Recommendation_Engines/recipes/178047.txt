Ingredients:
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound ground beef
1 green onion, chopped
1 (5 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and diced
1 tablespoon peanut oil

Directions:
Knead together the sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic powder, ground ginger, onion powder, pepper, ground beef, green onion, and water chestnuts in a bowl until evenly combined; form into four patties.
Heat the peanut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook in the skillet until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

Description: 
The nutty smell of the sesame oil permeates the kitchen as these burgers are frying. While not authentically Asian, the taste distinctly hints at the flavors of the East. I created this recipe when I accidentally thawed out ground beef instead of chicken breast. Naturally, burgers were the quickest and easiest option. Serve in burger buns topped with teriyaki sauce SrirachaÂ® sauce as condiments.
