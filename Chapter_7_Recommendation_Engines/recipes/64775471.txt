Ingredients:
3 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 tsps baking powder
1 1/2 tsps baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsps ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 tsp ground allspice
1 1/4 cups mashed overripe bananas (about 3 medium bananas)
1 cup pumpkin puree (NOT PIE FILLING)
1 cup whole milk plain Greek yogurt
3 eggs, room temp
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
3/4 cup dark chocolate chips
3/4 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease a 10-inch Bundt pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together mashed bananas, pumpkin puree, Greek yogurt, eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Pour in half of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mixture until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts.
4. Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan. Bake at 350 for 50-55 minutes, or until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow cake to cool in pan 10-15 minutes. Gently run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen. Invert onto a wire cooling rack and allow cake to cool completely.

Description: 
I came up with this cake as way to use up some extra pumpkin puree and a few really ripe bananas. It's a better-for-you cake that isn't overly sweet, but still chock full of flavor.  Make sure to use really really overripe bananas for the best results. If you're looking for additional sweetness, feel free to add some kind of glaze to the top of the cake as well. And adjust the add-ins (i.e. the nuts and chocolate) and spices to suit your tastes.
