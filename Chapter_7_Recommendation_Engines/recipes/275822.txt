Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter, divided
8 ounces shortcut bacon, chopped
1 yellow onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed
1 head broccoli, chopped
1 head cauliflower, chopped
1 leek, chopped
2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup cream cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat in a large pot. Add bacon, onion, and garlic; cook until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cover the pot. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes.
Stir in broccoli, cauliflower, leek, mushrooms, chicken stock, and garlic and herb seasoning. Replace the lid and cook until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining butter and heavy cream and heat through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cream cheese and cook until melted, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove sauce from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese.
Drain and discard excess liquid from chicken mixture, if necessary. Transfer mixture to a large baking dish. Pour sauce on top and add grated Cheddar cheese.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and browned to your liking, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
This creamy chicken and vegetable is low carb and high fat, everything you want in a keto dish! 
I have only made it once so far and it turned out delicious! If you have any tips or improvements, please let me know! 
This is a large recipe that you can easily get 8 to 10 servings from. I cook most of my keto meals this way, so we can then dish up all the leftovers into meal prep containers for lunches.
