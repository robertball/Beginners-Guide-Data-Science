Description: 
My ex's Mom had the best hand chopped Salsa Fresca I have ever tasted back in college.  Over the years, I have tweaked it to something my friends and family rave about.  The trick for this salsa is marinating the onions and jalapenos in lime juice for about 5 minutes  before adding the tomatoes and cilantro. Hope you enjoy.
