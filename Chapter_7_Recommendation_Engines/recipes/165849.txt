Ingredients:
1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage
4 cups water
1 cup quick-cooking grits
4 ounces shredded Gouda cheese
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
3 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring until the sausage is crumbly and lightly browned. Drain off the grease and place the sausage in a bowl. Meanwhile, bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Stir in the grits, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir constantly for 5 minutes until the grits are tender, or follow package directions.
Stir together the sausage, cheese, butter, hot pepper sauce, and eggs. Fold in the grits until combined, then spread into an ungreased, small casserole dish. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great, flavorful way to prepare grits. You can also use mild sausage and less or no hot sauce if you prefer not to have the extra spice. This can also be prepared up to the baking stage, and refrigerated or frozen until ready to finish.
