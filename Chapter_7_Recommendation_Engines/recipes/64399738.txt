Ingredients:
1 tbsp white vinegar
4 eggs
3 tsp olive oil, divided
454-g pkg baby spinach
2 whole wheat English muffins
130-g pkg smoked salmon
1 tbsp finely chopped chives
Healthier Hollandaise Sauce

Directions:
ADD vinegar to simmering water. Crack an egg into a small dish. Holding the dish close to the surface of the water, slip egg into water. Repeat with remaining eggs (up to 4 per batch). Simmer, uncovered, until whites are set and yolks are done as you like, 3 to 4 min for runny yolks. Using a slotted spoon, remove eggs 1 at a time and dab whites all over with paper towel to absorb excess water.
HEAT a very large non-stick frying pan over medium. Add 1 1/2 tsp olive oil, then half of your spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until spinach wilts, 1 to 2 min. Remove to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 tsp olive oil and second half of spinach. Set aside.
TOAST English muffins. Place half on each plate. Divide smoked salmon between 4 halves, then top with spinach and poached eggs. Whisk hollandaise, then spoon over each egg. Season with fresh pepper. Sprinkle with chives.
