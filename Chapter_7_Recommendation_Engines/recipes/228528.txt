Ingredients:
1 cup fresh elderberries
3 cups water
1 cinnamon stick (optional)
3 whole cloves (optional)
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root (optional)
1 cup honey

Directions:
Place elderberries, water, cinnamon stick, cloves, and ginger in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Use a potato masher to mash berries to release juice; strain the mixture through a fine sieve, retaining juice and discarding the pulp. Let juice cool.
Stir in honey until thoroughly combined and transfer to a lidded jar. Keeps in refrigerator 2 to 3 months.
