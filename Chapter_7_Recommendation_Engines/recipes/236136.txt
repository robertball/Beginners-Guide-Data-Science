Ingredients:
1/3 cup olive oil, divided
1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage
2 carrots, chopped
2 celery stalks, chopped
1 large onion, chopped
3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 quart chicken broth
2 cups water
1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 zucchinis, halved lengthwise and sliced into half-moons
1 bunch kale, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup ditalini pasta
1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese

Directions:
Heat about 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir Italian sausage in hot oil until about half browned, about 5 minutes. Add carrots, celery, and onion; continue to cook and stir until the sausage is completely browned, about 5 minutes more. Drain and discard some of the fat if you find it too greasy.
Stir potatoes into the sausage mixture, season with salt and pepper, and cook until the potatoes begin to soften, about 7 minutes more.
Pour chicken broth and water into the pot. Bring the liquid to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a flat-edged spoon. Add tomatoes and again bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are completely soft, about 15 minutes.
Stir zucchini and kale into the liquid; simmer until zucchini is soft, about 10 minutes.
Stir cannellini beans and ditalini pasta into the liquid; cook until pasta is tender, about 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls and garnish with Parmesan cheese and splash of olive oil.
