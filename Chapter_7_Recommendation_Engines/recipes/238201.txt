Ingredients:
5 ears corn, shucked
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 slices bacon, chopped
1/2 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 red bell pepper, cut into cubes
salt to taste
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook until slightly soft but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Cut corn kernels from the cobs; discard cobs.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir bacon in hot oil until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving drippings in the skillet.
Cook potatoes, stirring occasionally, in the same skillet over medium heat until potatoes are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add red bell pepper and salt; cook and stir until peppers are tender, about 5 minutes more.
Stir corn kernels into potato mixture and cook until corn is heated through, about 5 minutes.
Pour corn-potato mixture into a large bowl. Add bacon, red onion, cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes; toss to combine.

Description: 
This is a great recipe that I've modified over the years. The flavors are terrific and the ingredients and ratios are very flexible. Adapt to make it your own specialty. Great for picnics and pot lucks. This recipe is very flexible. It is a great, clean-out-the-refrigerator kind of dish. It also stores well and actually tastes better the next day. Serve warm or chilled.
