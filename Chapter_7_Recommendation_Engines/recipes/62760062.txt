Ingredients:
2-1/2 cups of dry pinto beans
3 quarts of water
2 tbsp olive oil
1 cup onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp red pepper flakes
1 tbsp paprika
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 cup water
Salt
Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Rinse the dried beans in water making sure to get rid of any dirt that might be hanging out.
Add the beans to a large pot and cover with water. (Make sure there is about 4 inches of water above the dried beans – they will soak up a lot of water)
Cook the beans for 2 1/2 hours. Bring the water to a boil and the cover and reduce to a simmer.
Once the beans are cooked, drain the excess water and set aside.
In a large skillet add the olive oil over medium high heat. Saute the onions along with the red pepper flakes, paprika and cayenne pepper for about 5 minutes. Add in the drained beans and 1 cup of water. Using an immersion blender, lightly blend the beans until they have a consistency of mashed beans. Season with salt as needed.
Serve with shredded cheddar cheese.

My boyfriend and I are absolutely obsessed with this little taco joint down the street from our apartment. It seriously has the best re-fried beans ever. Their burritos and tacos are kinda amazing also. But really it’s all about the beans. And get this  they aren’t made with lard! Say what?!? My kinda beans!
