Ingredients:
½ cup all-purpose flour for coating
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
1 pound chicken livers, trimmed and cut into bite sized pieces
3 slices bacon
3  green onions, chopped
1 cup chicken stock
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup
1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
¼ cup dry white wine

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, salt and pepper. Place chicken livers into the seasoned flour, and toss to coat.
Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp. Remove to paper towels to drain. Shake off excess flour from the livers, and fry  in the bacon grease along with the green onions until lightly browned on the outside. Pour the chicken stock into the skillet, and stir to scrape up any bits of goodness from the bottom.
Transfer the mixture to a slow cooker, and crumble in the bacon. Stir in the golden mushroom soup, mushrooms and white wine. Cover, and cook on Low for 4 to 6 hours. Thicken the gravy with flour if desired before serving.

Description: 
GREAT recipe for chicken livers. I got this one from my ex-wife's recipe box. It's a hit with almost all that try it! It should be cooked in a slow-cooker, but you might try a Dutch oven.
