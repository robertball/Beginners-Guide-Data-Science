Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 pounds haddock fillets, each cut into thirds
6 tablespoons butter, melted
1 limes, juiced (with pulp)
1 tablespoon dried dill weed
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 onion, sliced crosswise 1/8-inch thick

Directions:
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Lay 4 8x10-inch pieces of aluminum foil onto a flat work surface and spray with cooking spray.
Arrange equal amounts of the haddock into the center of each foil square.
Stir butter, lime juice, dill, kosher salt, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl; drizzle evenly over each portion of fish. Top each portion with onion slices.
Bring opposing ends of the foil together and roll together to form a seam. Roll ends toward fish to seal packets.
Cook packets on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 7 minutes per side.

Description: 
Super-fast entree that tastes like you spent time in the kitchen. Light, crisp flavors of lime and dill say 'summertime' even if you grill this in the winter! Don't like spicy food? No problem, just omit the red pepper flakes. Delicious with a side of grilled asparagus! Just pull the packets from the grill and serve. You can even eat out of packets for a hobo-style meal!
