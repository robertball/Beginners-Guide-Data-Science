2 bananas, mashed
1/2 cup (105 grams) brown sugar (optional...I add for kid appeal!)
1/2 cup (78 grams) whole almonds

1/4 cup (40 grams) raisins
1/8 pumpkin seeds
1/8 cup sunflower seeds
1 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease then line 9x9 tin with parchment paper.
In a small pot heat almond butter, brown sugar and mashed bananas. Stir gently until well combined and sugar is dissolved. Set aside.
In a food processor, coarse chop the almonds. Use a knife to coarse chop apricots, raisins and cherries.
Transfer to a bowl. Mix in seeds and oats. Fold in the almond butter mixture. Press the batter into prepared loaf tin. Bake for 20-25 minutes. Let cool before cutting into bars/squares. Wrap individually in cellophane and store in fridge for up to 1 week.
