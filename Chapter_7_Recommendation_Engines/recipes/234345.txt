Ingredients:
2 eggs
3 cups buttermilk, or as needed
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 dash ground nutmeg
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt

Directions:
Whisk eggs in a bowl until pale yellow. Whisk buttermilk, vanilla, butter, and nutmeg into eggs until butter is reduced to small pieces.
Stir flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into egg mixture until just moistened.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-low heat. Drop batter by 1/2 cup portions onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.

Description: 
I have used vanilla and nutmeg in my pancake recipe for 20 years. This is a variation of a recipe I found on Allrecipes when I could not find my old recipe. 

My husband said these were light and fluffy pancakes the first time I made them. It must be the extra baking powder, or the butter instead of oil in the mix. 

Two pancakes per serving here, but a pancake stack is three or more! We use a brand of syrup that is made without high fructose corn syrup. Syrup is important!
