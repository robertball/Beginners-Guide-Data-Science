1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
2/3 cup milk

2 tablespoons butter
5 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
In a large bowl, cream together 1/4 cup butter and 1/3 cup of sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla until well blended. Combine 1 1/2 cups of  flour, salt and baking powder; stir into the creamed mixture alternately with the milk. Spread evenly in a 9x9 inch baking pan.
