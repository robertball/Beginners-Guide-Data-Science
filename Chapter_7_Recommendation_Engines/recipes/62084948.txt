Ingredients:
1 pound hamburger
one small onion, chopped
few dashes Worchestershire sauce
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/2 seasoned salt blend such as Old Bay
1 large can mixed vegetables, drained
1 family size can cream of mushroom soup
2 cups buttermilk baking mix (such as Bisquick)
2/3 cup milk
1 cup shredded cheese

Directions:
Heat oven to 350.
Brown hamburger in a skillet, adding chopped onion and seasoning. Stir and crumble, cook until brown. Drain any grease off.
Add drained mixed vegetables and soup to hamburger, mix until combined. Heat over low heat until warmed through and starting to bubble.
Mix 2 cups of baking mix with 2/3 cup of milk until a soft dough forms, this is the recipe for dumplings on the baking mix box.
Transfer hamburger mixture into a 13 x 9 baking dish or leave in skillet if it is oven safe. Drop large spoonfuls of dough over hot hamburger mixture.
Bake at 350 for approximately 30-35 minutes. Sprinkle shredded cheese over casserole and return to oven to melt cheese and until the biscuit topping is barely brown on the edges. Serve and enjoy!

Description: 
This is the simplest casserole to make. A friend's son gave it the name and now everyone calls it that. It is almost like a shepards pie, but very easy to put together. A good stick to the ribs dish when you don't have a lot of time.
