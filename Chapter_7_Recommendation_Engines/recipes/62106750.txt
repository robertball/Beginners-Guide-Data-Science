Ingredients:
10 Shots Gold Tequila
5 Shots Triple Sec
1 Can (12 Oz.)Frozen Limeade
1 Lime, zested & juiced
4 tsp. Sugar
5 Cups Ice

Directions:
In a blender, add all ingredients except ice and blend until frothy.  At this point you can do one of two things: serve over ice OR add the ice and blend until smooth.  I prefer mine over ice without salt on the rim.
