Ingredients:
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
1/4 cup olive oil
10 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
36 fresh clams, cleaned
2 cups dry white wine
4 tomatoes, cubed
3 (8 ounce) jars clam juice
1 1/2 cups chopped fresh parsley
1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta

Directions:
Soak mushrooms 20 to 30 minutes in cold water to rehydrate. Dry, and coarsely chop.
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms, garlic, and red pepper. Cook until browned. Stir in clams and white wine. As clams open, remove to a medium bowl, discarding those that remain closed.
Mix tomatoes, clam juice, and parsley into the mushroom mixture. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Return clams to the broth mixture and cook until heated through. Thoroughly mix in cooked linguine just before serving.
