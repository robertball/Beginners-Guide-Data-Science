Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package bow-tie pasta
1 tablespoon olive oil
18 ounces sweet Italian sausage, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 red bell pepper, chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until about halfway cooked, 5 to 6 minutes; drain.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir sausage in the hot oil until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add red bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
Stir tomatoes, beef broth, and Italian seasoning through the sausage mixture; bring to a simmer. Add bow-tie pasta to the sausage-broth mixture; simmer until pasta is cooked yet firm to the bite, 5 to 6 more minutes.
