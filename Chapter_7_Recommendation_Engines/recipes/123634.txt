Description: 
WHEN MONEY was short and times were tough, my mother still made this treat for us. We thought it was happiness in a glass. I recall running home from school, hoping to find this delicious drink ready for me.    I made it often for my own children, and I still mix it up today...but now I like to call it nostalgia in a glass. -Jeanne Brown, Buffalo, New York
