Description: 
A mixture of pineapple and coconut with a slight hint of rum flavoring makes this non-alcoholic ice cream a big hit on a hot summer day. I made this recipe up, but I think it's the best ice cream I've ever tasted. But be forewarned - it's very rich! Leftover ice cream keeps very well.
