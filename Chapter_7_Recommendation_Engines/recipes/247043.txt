Ingredients:
1 (1 pound) flank steak
1/2 cup lime juice, divided
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
2 cloves cloves garlic, minced, divided
1 sweet onion, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 jalapeno pepper, diced
2 cups water
1 (5.4 ounce) package Knorr® Fiesta Sides™ - Mexican Rice
1 large ripe mango - peeled, seeded, and cut into cubes
1/4 cup cilantro, minced
salt and pepper to taste
flour tortillas (optional)
sour cream (optional)

Directions:
Place lime juice, 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil and 1 clove minced garlic into a resealable 1-gallon plastic bag.
Pound steak to 1/4 inch thickness; slice into 1/2-inch strips. Place in bag with marinade; seal shut. Turn bag over to distribute marinade. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Remove meat from plastic bag; discard marinade.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Add meat; cook and stir until well-browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions, peppers, 1 clove minced garlic, jalapeno, water, 1/4 lime juice and salt and pepper to taste, bring to a simmer.
Add Knorr(R) Rice SidesTM - Mexican flavored rice, stir, cover and cook until most the water is absorbed and rice is cooked through, stirring occasionally, 7 to 10 minutes. Toss in mango and cilantro to warm. Serve immediately as a skillet meal, or serve in flour tortillas with sour cream!
