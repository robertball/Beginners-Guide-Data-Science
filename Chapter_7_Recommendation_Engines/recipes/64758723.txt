Ingredients:
4 - 4.5 cups oatmeal
1 medium apple
1 egg
1 cup canned pumpkin

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Grind the oatmeal down in a food processor or blender. Transfer to mixing bowl.
Core apple, being sure to remove all seeds. Grate apple, and add to bowl with oatmeal.
Add egg and canned pumpkin to bowl and mix well to combine.  The mixture will be thick and slightly sticky.
On a surface dusted with oatmeal (ground or not, your choice) roll the dough out to approximately 1/2" thick. Use a cookie cutter into shapes, and transfer to lined baking sheet.
Bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Allow to cool to room temperature, then store in an airtight container for up to a week.
