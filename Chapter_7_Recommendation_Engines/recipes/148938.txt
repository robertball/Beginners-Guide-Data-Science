Ingredients:
1 pound ground lamb
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, pressed
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
3 tablespoons mild curry paste
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup fresh or frozen peas, thawed
3 sprigs cilantro, for garnish

Directions:
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the ground lamb, and cook until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain off excess grease, and set meat aside. Heat vegetable oil in the same skillet, and stir in onion; cook and stir until the onion begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking 1 minute more.
Stir the cooked lamb back into the skillet along with the tomato paste, curry paste, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 15 minutes. Stir in peas, cover, and simmer 5 minutes more. Pour into a serving dish and garnish with cilantro.

Description: 
Before my husband and I got married, he found this recipe on the Patak'sÂ® Indian food website. We made it and loved it. But when I went to find it later, I couldn't! So this is a combination of what I remember from the recipe and other Keema Matar recipes that I found on-line. You can substitute chopped tomatoes for the paste, and add 1/4 -1/2 cup water to make the sauce. Serve over rice. Enjoy!
