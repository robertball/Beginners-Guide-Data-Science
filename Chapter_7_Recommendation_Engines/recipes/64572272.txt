Ingredients:
1/2   cup vegetable oil
1/2   cup lime juice
2 Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried basil leaves
2 Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried oregano leaves
2  Tbsp chopped fresh or 2 tsp dried thyme leaves
1   tsp granulated onion
1/4  tsp lemon-pepper seasoning
8   chicken thighs (about 2 lb)

Directions:
In a heavy-duty resealable food-storage plastic bag, mix all ingredients except chicken. Add chicken thighs; turn to coat with marinade. Seal bag; refrigerate, turning chicken occasionally, at least 3 hours or overnight.
Heat gas or charcoal grill. Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Place chicken, skin sides down, on grill over medium heat. Cover grill; cook 11 minutes. Turn chicken; brush with marinade. Cover grill; cook 10 minutes. Brush with marinade; cook 5 to 15 minutes longer or until juice of chicken is clear when thickest part is cut to bone (180Â°F). Discard any remaining marinade.
Cook note:You can use any pieces of chicken.  I like to use the thighs because they tend to be the juiciest, but I cook whatever is on sale! Also works well with thick pork chops.
