method: Brown beef in a skillet and drain off extra fat. Add taco mix according to the directions on envelopes.  Add cream cheese (if you cube it..its easier)simmer until melted and mix well. Cook shells for 10 min in rapid boiling water. while they are cooking, chill the meat mixture in fridge.  The butter is to coat the cooked shells. ( so they don't stick.) Spread salsa in the bottom of a baking dish. Fill shells with meat and put 12 on top of the salsa. drizzle shells with picante sauce. cover and bake at 350 degrees for 30min.  Sprinkle with cheese and bake until its melted.
If you freeze the other 12 half of the shells.. do not add sauces or cheese.
Leave in refridge over night. Before baking add salsa and picante just like above. Bake the shells at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes. Then follow directions and measurement for cheese above.
