Ingredients:
3 Tbsp olive oil
1 Tbsp butter
1.25-1.5 pounds stew beef
1/4 cup flour
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp pepper
1 medium onion, diced
(10 small pearl onions, whole)
4 oz tomato paste
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp herbs de provence
1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
4 cups beef broth
1 cup porter beer
3 medium carrots, diced large
3 stalks celery, diced large

Directions:
Heat a dutch oven to medium-high heat, then pour in the olive oil and butter.
Season the beef with salt and pepper, dredge in flour, then cook in small batches to get a good crispy brown on all sides.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, adding more olive oil if necessary, and saut√© the onions for 2-3 minutes.
Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for another 2 minutes or so.
Add the sugar, herbs, Worcestershire, broth, and beer, then reduce heat to low and simmer covered for 1 1/2-2 hours.
Add the carrots and celery and simmer covered for an additional 45 minutes to an hour or until the carrots are tender.
The sauce should be very thick, but you can splash in additional beef broth until it thins it up to your liking.
