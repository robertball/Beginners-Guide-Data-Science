Ingredients:
Fresh dates.  Preferably pitted.  I got mine at whole foods, they came in a plastic container at about 20 in package.
I small log goat cheese
Smoke house almonds (whole)
bacon

Directions:
Pit the dates if they are not unpitted, just insert the tip of a sharp knife in one and and slit down. Try to leave the date intact instead of creating two halves, but if it breaks open don't worry.  Stuff each date with a small amount of goat cheese, as much as it will comfortably hold.  Push in one whole almond.  Cut your bacon strips in half cross wise.  Wrap each date in the 1/2 strip of bacon.  Secure with toothpicks, can be tricky getting around the almond. Place under a low broiler about 6 inches from heat and broil till bacon looks fairly crisp.  If your oven does not have low broiler option, just move the rack down a notch and watch them carefully.  Turn each date over and repeat the process.  Serve as an appetizer or a desert..............the dates I bought were really sweet.

My best friend is quite well off.  She can and does buy herself most everything she needs and wants.  She has a major sweet tooth.  For her birthday this month I made here these stuffed dates.  I am going to take them to her today along with an eggsalad sandwich and gourmet olives for lunch.  Her Birthday Gift.
