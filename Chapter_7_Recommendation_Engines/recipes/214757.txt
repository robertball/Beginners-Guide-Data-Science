Ingredients:
2 cups self-rising cornmeal
1/4 cup bacon fat, melted
1 pinch salt
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups buttermilk
1 cup cottage cheese

Directions:
Place a 9-inch cast iron skillet into oven, and preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
Mix the cornmeal, bacon fat, salt, eggs, buttermilk, and cottage cheese together in a bowl. With an oven mitt, remove the hot skillet from the oven, and spray it with cooking spray. Pour the corn bread batter into the hot skillet.
Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the corn bread is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Check after 10 minutes. Serve sliced in wedges.

Description: 
My father-in-law had the best, most moist cornbread I have ever tasted. He said he had a secret ingredient that he used and wouldn't tell anybody until a few weeks before he passed away. Serve with lots of butter.
