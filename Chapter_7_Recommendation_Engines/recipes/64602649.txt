Ingredients:
3 pounds beef chuck (chili grind)
1 pound mild italian sausage
1 tablespoon of bacon bits
2 15 ounce cans of light red beans (drained)
1 15 ounce can of ranch style beans
4 14 ounce cans of diced tomatoes with juice
1 6 ounce can of tomato paste
2 yellow onions diced
3 stalks of celery diced
1 green bell pepper seeded and diced
1 red bell pepper seeded and diced
2 ancho chiles seeded and diced
1 bottle of beer
4 tablespoons of Tabasco sauce
1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon of minced garlic
1/4 cup of chili powder
4 cubes of beef bouillon
2 tablespoons of ground cumin
1 tablespoon of dried oregano
1 tablespoon of dried basil
1 tablespoon of kosher salt
1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper

Directions:
Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Crumble the ground chuck and sausage into the hot pan, and cook until evenly browned. Drain off excess grease and add the bacon bits.
Add the beans and the veggies. Season with wet and dry seasonings. Stir to blend, then cover and cook on low heat for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
After 2 hours, taste, and, if needed, adjust dry seasonings.  Let the chili continue to simmer on Warm with the top off to allow it to reduce.  When oil forms on the top, skim it off with a spoon or baster.  The longer the chili simmers, the better it will taste. Remove from heat and serve, or refrigerate, and serve the next day.
