Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups uncooked rotini pasta
5 (1 1/2 inch thick) boneless pork chops, cut into bite size pieces
1 1/2 cups crispy rice cereal
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 (15 ounce) cans green beans
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
Fill a large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the pork and boil for 7 to 10 minutes. While this is cooking, place the rice cereal squares, seasoned salt, garlic powder and onion powder in a resealable plastic bag and crush the cereal to crumbs; set aside.
Place the pork, mushroom soup, green beans, mayonnaise, pasta and 1 cup of the cheese into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix this well, then cover with the remaining cheese. Top off with the crushed cereal mixture, covering everything completely.
Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until heated throughout.

Description: 
This is a simple and filling dish that's easy to prepare. Let the oven do all the work for you. I like to use spirals for the pasta.
