Ingredients:
3/4 cup uncooked white rice
1 1/2 cups apple juice
1 apple, cored and chopped

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In a saucepan, combine rice, apple juice, chopped apple, and raisins. Season with cinnamon and salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover for about 17 minutes. Lift lid, and see if rice is moist enough for your taste; if not, cook another couple minutes.
Mix in fresh parsley. Serve immediately.
