Ingredients:
1 large rutabaga, peeled and cubed
3 cups chicken broth, or as needed
1/4 cup evaporated milk, or as needed
3 tablespoons butter
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place rutabaga in a medium pot and add enough chicken broth to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and cook until tender, about 40 minutes.
Transfer rutabaga to a colander and drain well. Place into a deep bowl; add evaporated milk and butter a little at a time until desired consistency is reached. Use an electric hand blender to get a creamy, non-fibrous texture. Season with salt and pepper.

Description: 
Creamy, slightly sweet, and a great low-carb alternative to mashed potatoes. The broth infuses the mashed rutabaga with wonderful flavor.
