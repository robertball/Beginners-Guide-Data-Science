Ingredients:
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate fudge cake mix
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 1/3 cups water
1 (16 ounce) container prepared chocolate fudge frosting

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan.
In a large bowl, combine cake mix, eggs, oil and water. Beat on low speed until blended. Stir in chocolate frosting. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

Description: 
This is far and away the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Be  very sure to use a 12 cup Bundt pan, anything smaller will make a very messy oven! Serve with ice cream or whipped cream.
