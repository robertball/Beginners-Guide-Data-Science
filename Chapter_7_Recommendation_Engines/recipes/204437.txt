Ingredients:
1 (15.5 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained (reserve liquid) and rinsed
1/2 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed)
3 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Grind the garbanzo beans, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, and Parmesan cheese together in a food processor for 15 seconds.
Add about 1/4 of the reserved liquid; grind another 15 seconds. Pour in enough additional reserved liquid, a small amount at a time, and grind; repeat until the consistency is like chunky peanut butter.
Pour in the olive oil; grind for an additional 15 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
