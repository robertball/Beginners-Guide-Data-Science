Ingredients:
1 (5 pound) boneless pork shoulder
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon safflower oil

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Trim excess fat from pork shoulder and cut pork into 2-inch cubes. Season with salt and pepper on all sides.
Heat a cast iron braiser over medium-high heat. Pour oil into the pot and brown pork on all sides, about 10 minutes. Cover with the lid.
Bake in the preheated oven until pork is crispy on the outside and soft, but fully cooked, on the inside, about 1 hour.
