Ingredients:
Sauce:
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 pound jumbo shrimp
1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
skewers
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (optional)
1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)

Directions:
Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.
Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.

Description: 
These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21-25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.
