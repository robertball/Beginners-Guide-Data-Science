Dip chicken strips in mayonnaise mixture, then in sesame mixture to coat. Place coated strips in a single layer on a lightly greased cookie sheet.

Description: 
Chicken strips dipped in a mayonnaise/mustard mixture, then a sesame seed/cracker crumb mixture and baked. Served with a honey mayonnaise dipping sauce. These chicken strips are very tasty, especially when dipped in the sweet sauce. These go over well at summer get-togethers and make great finger foods.
