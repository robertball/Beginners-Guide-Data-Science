Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
4 cups vegetable broth
1 small head cabbage, chopped
1 (14.5 ounce) can chopped stewed tomatoes
3 carrots, peeled and cut into coins
2 teaspoons paprika
1 bunch kale, chopped
1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (optional)
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add broth, cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, and paprika. Cook until cabbage softens, 10 to 15 minutes. Add kale, cover to trap steam, and cook until soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Pour in chickpeas and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve hot.

Description: 
Many credit soup for being their weight loss secret. I intended to make a skinny soup that could aid by filling me up so I would eat less of my main course. Well, this soup has evolved so much, I don't even eat the main course. So incredibly hearty, wholesome, and filling! It's a beautiful soup with many colors and also freezes well. I hope you enjoy. I would love to know of any modifications so I can try that next time.
