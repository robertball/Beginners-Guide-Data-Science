Ingredients:
1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup dried minced onion
3 tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste
2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, or more to taste
1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 cup beef broth
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease. Mix ketchup, dried onion, brown sugar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, smoke flavoring, and garlic into beef, stirring until brown sugar has dissolved.
Stir beef broth into beef mixture and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
