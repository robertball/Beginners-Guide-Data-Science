Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup shortening
6 tablespoons cold water
FILLING:
6 eggs
1 (29 ounce) can solid pack pumpkin
2 cups packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 cups evaporated milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine flour and salt; cut in shortening until crumbly. Sprinkle with water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Divide dough in half. On a floured surface, roll out each portion to fit a 9-in. pie plate. Place pastry in plates; trim pastry (set the scraps aside if leaf cutouts are desired) and flute edges. Set shells aside.
For filling, beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Add pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, cloves, nutmeg and ginger; beat just until smooth. Gradually stir in milk. Pour into pastry shells.
Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees; bake 40-45 minutes longer or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on wire racks.
If desired, cut pastry scraps with a 1-in. leaf-shaped cookie cutter; place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned. Place on baked pies.
