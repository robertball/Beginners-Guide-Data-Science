Ingredients:
cooking spray
6 slices center-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon butter
3 tablespoons diced onion
1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste
6 eggs
1 pinch garlic powder
salt and ground black pepper to taste
3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
Place bacon on a microwave-safe plate; cook in the microwave until slightly browned but still pliable, 2 to 3 minutes.
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes.
Whisk eggs, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Stir in onion and garlic mixture.
Sprinkle a few pieces of bacon in the bottom of each muffin cup. Cover with half of the egg mixture. Add a few more pieces of bacon; top with remaining egg mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top.

Description: 
This is a great base recipe for a quick breakfast. Customize to your taste with jalapenos, diced green chiles, bell peppers, turkey bacon, a half-egg-white-and-half-whole-egg blend, or avocado, to name a few ideas, just as you would season an omelet!
