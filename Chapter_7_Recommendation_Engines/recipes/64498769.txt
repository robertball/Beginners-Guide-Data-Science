Ingredients:
2 cups uncooked jasmine rice, rinsed and drained twice
3 cups vegetable broth, preferably unsalted
4 scallions, chopped
1-1/2 cups dates, chopped
1-1/2 cups slivered almonds, roasted
1/2 cup dried cranberries or mulberries
1 cup fresh parsley, chopped
1/2 cup salad or olive oil
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon limon omani (optional)
1/4 teaspoon cardamom
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

Directions:
Prepare rinsed rice using vegetable broth, according to rice cooker instructions.  Immediately cool rice by spreading on large tray, quickly bringing it to room temperature.
In a large bowl, combine scallions, dates, almonds, cranberries, and parsley.
Blend dressing ingredients: oil, lemon juice, salt, omani, cardamom, and cinnamon.
Gently toss together rice, fruit/nut mixture, and dressing until blended. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about half an hour.
Will hold for two or three days in refrigerator (though I have never had any leftover).
