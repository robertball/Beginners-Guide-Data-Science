Ingredients:
Three Large Portobello Mushroom Caps, diced
Two Leeks, chopped and diced
One Celery Root, chopped
4 Tbsp Butter
1 Tbsp Chopped Chives
1 Tbsp Chopped Tarragon
2-3 Tbsp Water / 2-3 Tbsp Chicken Broth
1 Cup Gruyère Cheese, grated
1 Cup Panko Bread Crumbs
1½ Tbsp Flour
¾ Cup Heavy Cream

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Rinse and dice the celery root, leeks, and mushrooms. Melt butter in a frying pan and sauté the leek and celery root pieces for about ten minutes.
Add the mushroom pieces and half of the chopped tarragon and chives, and sauté for an additional six minutes (or until they start giving off liquid).
In the meantime, mix the Panko bread crumbs and Gruyère cheese in a mixing bowl.
Once the sauté is done, add flour and heavy cream in a stream. Once the cream is an even color, add half of the Panko and cheese mixture. Turn the heat off when the cheese starts to melt.
Put the sauté mixture into a baking dish and top with the remaining cheese/bread and herb mixtures.
Add a small amount of chicken broth or water to moisten the mixture, then bake for ten minutes (or until the cheese is bubbly).
Use a spatula to scoop a portion out and serve immediately!

Description: 
I designed this gratin as sort of a mix between my Zucchini Gratin and my Bell Pepper Gratin with Fennel and Mushrooms. It's a robust blend of earthy flavors topped with the classic gratin cheese, Gruyère.
