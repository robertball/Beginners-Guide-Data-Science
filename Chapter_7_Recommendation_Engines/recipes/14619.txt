Description: 
This is a baked dish that is great with pasta and some crusty bread to absorb all the great tasting sauce.  This is my husband's favorite dish, and he eats it with steamed rice or potatoes. If you love garlic, you'll love this recipe. This was also my uncle's favorite dish; I cooked for him when I used to visit him in Seattle as a teenager.
