Ingredients:
1 yellow cake mix
1 small instant vanilla pudding
4 eggs
1 cup oil
1 cup water
1 Baker’s German Chocolate bar, grated
1 12 oz. package mini chocolate chips

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Mix all ingredients except the two chocolates. Beat with electric mixer until smooth.
Add grated chocolate bar and mini chocolate chips. Tip: I found the easiest way to grate the chocolate bar is by chopping it with a large knife…it will just shave right off.
Pour in a well greased bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes.
Cool completely and then turn out on your cake pan. Great topped with vanilla ice cream!

Description: 
This amazing cake joined the Walker family traditions when my brother met my sister-in-law. She's a readhead with lots of freckles, and this cake, thanks to the chocolate shavings and chips has lots of freckles too. So, we changed the name. Chocolate Chip Cake (boring!) is now Freckle Cake.
