Ingredients:
1/2 sachet dry yeast
1/2 tsp sugar
1/4 cup milk, cool
1/2 cup milk, warm
1/2 egg
1/4 tsp salt
2 cups plain flour
2 cups cubed stale white bread

Directions:
Mix the first three ingredients, let stand for 10 minutes. Mix the warm milk, egg, salt, yeast mixture and flour. Knead for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Add the bread cubes and knead it into the dough. Place in a large bowl, cover with a cloth and let the dough rest in a warm place to rise. It should double in about 2 hours.
Knead again and divide into 2 sections. Roll each section into a log, each about 1 1/2" thick and 7-8" long. Let rise another 1/2 hour. Drop the logs of dough, one at a time, into a large pot of boiling salted water with a tight fitting lid. Boil gently on medium-low heat for about 10-12 minutes. DO NOT LIFT THE LID!! Remove with slotted spoons and place on a wooden chopping board. Immediately use the sharp point of a knife and poke holes in it to release the steam. Keep warm by draping a cloth over them and to prevent it from drying out. When ready to serve, slice 3/4" thick with a sharp knife.
