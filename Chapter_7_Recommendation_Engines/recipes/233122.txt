Description: 
I have been making fried green tomatoes for over 35 years, taught by my grandmother who is from down south. Over the years I have tried and made fried green tomato recipes and this is the one that is perfect. Cajun ranch sauce goes perfect with this crispy on the outside but smooth and creamy on the inside tomato.
