Description: 
Aviyal is a south-Indian delicacy and seems like no two households make it the same. Essentially, all the recipes use the same ingredients – vegetables, curds(yogurt), coconut , spices – but the details and proportions vary. This is my mother's Andhra recipe for Aviyal. I hope you like it as much as we do.
