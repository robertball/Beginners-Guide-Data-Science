Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
4 1/2 cups water
1 (16 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste
2 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chilies
1 cup instant rice
1 tablespoon white sugar
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons dried oregano
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons salt

Directions:
Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is crumbly and completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir water, tomato sauce, tomato paste, green chilies, instant rice, sugar, chili powder, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt together with the cooked ground beef.
Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook mixture at a simmer until the flavors have blended and the beef is very tender, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
I serve this as a build-your-own taco salad meal. Start with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, shredded cheddar, and crushed tostada chips. Top off with the piping hot meat mixture, kinda toss together, and enjoy!
