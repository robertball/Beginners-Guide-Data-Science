Ingredients:
3 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!Â®)
1 pound ground breakfast sausage
1 (4.5 ounce) can diced green chiles, drained
1 1/2 cups grated Colby-Jack cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Set aside to cool completely.
Open biscuits and cut each into quarters.
Mix biscuit pieces, sausage, green chiles, and Colby-Jack cheese together in a large bowl and pour into a fluted tube pan. Press mixture down slightly to make sure there are no air pockets.
Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, covering with aluminum foil during baking if top browns too quickly.
Remove bread from the oven and let sit about 5 minutes before turning out onto a serving plate. Allow to sit 5 minutes more before cutting.
