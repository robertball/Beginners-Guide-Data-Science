Ingredients:
3 large zucchini
salt to taste
1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon parsley flakes
1/2 teaspoon garlic paste
1/2 teaspoon basil paste
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
2 (15 ounce) containers whole-milk ricotta cheese
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Use a vegetable peeler to create long, thin slices of zucchini, avoiding the seedy center. Lay slices on paper towels and sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit at least 15 minutes.
Place ground beef in a skillet over medium heat; add olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, 1 teaspoon parsley, garlic paste, basil paste, onion powder, and red pepper flakes. Cover skillet, reduce heat, and simmer sauce 15 minutes.
Mix ricotta cheese, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl.
Layer 1/3 of the sauce into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Add 1/2 the sliced zucchini and 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat layering another 1/3 of the sauce, remaining zucchini, remaining ricotta mixture, and remaining sauce. Top with mozzarella cheese. Coat a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray and cover lasagna with it, oiled-side down.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until bubbly and browned, 5 to 10 minutes more.
