Ingredients:
6 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 white potatoes, cubed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 onion, chopped
4 eggs, beaten

Directions:
Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, discarding most of the grease.
Return skillet to the stove and add olive oil; heat over medium heat. Add potatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until browned and somewhat crispy, about 10 minutes.
Mix onion into potatoes and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return bacon to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour eggs over potato mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 5 to 6 minutes.

Description: 
This is a recipe my mother used to make when we were camping. It's warm, hearty, and a good way to start a cold day in the morning, camping or otherwise. Serve in a bowl with toast and coffee for a warming and hearty breakfast.
