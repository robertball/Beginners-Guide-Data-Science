Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika
8 ounces textured vegetable protein
1 green bell pepper, chopped
5 cups vegetable broth
4 large potatoes, diced
2 large carrots, diced
1 tomato, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 egg
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons water as needed

Directions:
In a heavy pot, heat oil over medium heat. Saute onions in oil until tender.
Add paprika, textured vegetable protein, and green pepper; cook and stir mixture until vegetables are coated with paprika.  Stir in broth or water, potatoes, carrots, tomato, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and parsley.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until carrots and potatoes are almost tender.  Add more water if needed.
In a small bowl, mix together, egg, flour, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Mix in enough water to have a smooth consistency; dough should be stiff and sticky.  Spoon onto a flat plate, and slice off small amounts into soup while it is simmering.  Add to soup in such a way that noodles do not land in the same spot every time. Continue until all mixture has been added to pot.  Simmer until done.

Description: 
This is a vegetarian version of a classic Hungarian soup.  For a vegan version, substitute vegan pasta for the noodles. You can choose sweet or hot Hungarian pepper, but we like it hot!
