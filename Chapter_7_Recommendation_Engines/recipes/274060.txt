Image:

Ingredients:
2  boneless chicken thighs
1 (6 ounce) container plain yogurt
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon honey
½ tablespoon olive oil
2 teaspoons curry powder
1 teaspoon grated garlic
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
½ teaspoon salt

Directions:
Pat chicken dry with a paper towel. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
Combine yogurt, ketchup, honey, olive oil, curry powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a bowl. Mix well. Pour mixture over chicken and coat well using your hands.
Divide chicken in half and place each portion in an airtight freezer bag. Close each bag and massage chicken gently by carefully squeezing the outside of the bag. Refrigerate for 2 to 3 days.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the hot pan and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Description: 
This is a recipe for marinating chicken with curry and yogurt. After 2 to 3 days in the fridge, the chicken has already absorbed the spices from the marinade so it's ready for use. You can simply stir-fry it, cook it in the microwave, or do whatever you want. Keeps in the freezer for up to 1 month.
