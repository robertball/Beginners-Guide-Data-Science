Ingredients:
3/4 pound fatty rib-eye steak
3/4 pound top sirloin steak
2 ounces blue cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
4 hamburger buns, split and toasted
2 ounces pickled red onions, or to taste

Directions:
Slice steaks in half, then into strips about 1/4-to 1/2-inch-thick. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Freeze until very cold and firm, but not quite frozen, about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place blue cheese in the freezer as well so it's easier to handle.
Chop the partially frozen steak with a sharp knife or meat cleaver until it resembles coarsely ground meat. Crumble about 1/2 cup (unpacked) blue cheese on top; use the cleaver to fold and chop it into the meat.
Lightly dampen your hands with water and roll the mixture into 3 or 4 patties. Flatten onto individual pieces of plastic wrap; seal and refrigerate until ready to cook.
Unwrap patties and continue pressing them to your desired thinness. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a dry cast iron pan over medium-high heat until very hot. Sear each patty, without disturbing it, until a crust forms on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the surface springs back when lightly pressed, about 3 minutes more.
Spread some mayonnaise over each bottom bun half. Serve patties on the buns, topped with pickled red onions.

Description: 
Why chop up perfectly good steaks to make burgers? Why, for the extraordinary taste and texture, of course; and it's nice to know exactly what you're eating. Most ground meat from the store is too fine, horribly overworked, and a little tough by the time you form it into patties. We avoid that problem by using a sharp knife and partially frozen meat. Plus, the sharp, savory funkiness of blue cheese helps form a glorious crust as the meat sears into it.
