Ingredients:
1 cup loosely packed, coarsely chopped fresh spinach
1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves
1 teaspoon chopped garlic
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
1 (4 ounce) log Montrachet goat cheese, at room temperature
1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and thinly sliced

Directions:
Line a 3-cup bowl with plastic wrap, leaving a 4-inch overhang.
Combine spinach, basil, and garlic in a food processor and chop finely. Add Parmesan cheese and process until almost smooth. Keep processor running while pouring in oil; process until a smooth paste forms. Season with salt and pepper.
Mix cream cheese and goat cheese together in a bowl.
Spread 1/3 of the cheese mixture in the bottom of the prepared bowl. Spread 1/2 of the spinach mixture on top. Top with 1/2 of the walnuts. Add 1/2 of the sun-dried tomatoes. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture, spinach mixture, walnuts, and tomatoes, ending with cheese mixture. Fold plastic overhang on top and gently push down to compress layers.
Refrigerate for 8 hours, or up to 3 days. Unfold plastic top and invert bowl onto a serving plate. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
