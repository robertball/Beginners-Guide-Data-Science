Ingredients:
2 cups white sugar
1/2 cup water
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup strawberry preserves
2 egg whites, stiffly beaten

Directions:
Grease an 8 x 8 inch square pan.
In a medium saucepan combine sugar, water and cream of tartar; bring to a boil.  Heat to 242 to 248 degrees F (116 to 120 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a firm but pliable ball.  Stir in the strawberry preserves;  return to a boil.  Remove from heat.
Slowly pour the strawberry mixture over the beaten egg whites, stirring constantly.  Beat until thick and fluffy.  Pour into prepared pan.  Cool for 2 hours, or until firm, and cut into squares.
