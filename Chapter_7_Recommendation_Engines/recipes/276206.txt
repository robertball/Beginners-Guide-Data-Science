Ingredients:
cooking spray (such as PamÂ®)
1 pound ground turkey
3/8 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
1/2 onion, diced
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
Filling:
3/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1 ounce chopped baby spinach
Glaze:
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray (such as Pam(R)).
Mix turkey, bread crumbs, onion, ketchup, egg, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a large bowl.
Spread meat mixture over a sheet of parchment paper to form a large square or rectangle. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and spinach over 1/2 of the meat mixture. Fold other 1/2 of mixture gently over filled side. Press together and shape into a log. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.
In the meantime, mix ketchup, Worcestershire, Dijon, brown sugar, and garlic powder for glaze together in a bowl.
Remove meatloaf from the oven; pour glaze over. Return to the oven and bake until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
