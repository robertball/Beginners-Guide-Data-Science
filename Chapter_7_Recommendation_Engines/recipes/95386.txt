4 cups liquid non-dairy creamer
2 (5.1 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix

Description: 
I stumbled upon this recipe when trying to make vanilla instant pudding for my daughter, who is allergic to milk. I not only discovered that instant pudding doesn't work with non-dairy creamer, but it DOES create the base for the richest, tastiest, no-cholesterol egg nog I've ever tasted! Because there are no raw eggs, it's also safer that the traditional.
