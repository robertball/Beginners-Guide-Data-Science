Ingredients:
Cookie Dough:
1 cup softened butter
3/4 cup white sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla or almond extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup chopped pecans
Filling:
1(8 ounce) packages cream cheese
1/2 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla until creamy.
Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda.
Mix the flour mixture into the butter/sugar mixture. Fold in the nuts.
Refrigerate dough for one hour.
While dough is chilling, beat together ingredients for the filling until smooth.
On an ungreased cookie sheet, form the cookies with about 1 tbs of dough for each. Start with a ball of dough and form an indention, like a bowl, in each cookie. Fill indention with about a teaspoon of filling.
Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 11 to 13 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool completely before removing from the cookie sheet.
