Ingredients:
1/4-1/2 mashed fresh avocado
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon honey
1 teaspoon rice bran
10 drops of oil of evening primrose

Directions:
Mix together 1/4 to 1/2 mashed fresh avocado, 1 egg yolk, 1 teaspoon honey, 1 teaspoon rice bran, and 10 drops of oil of evening primrose.
Gently massage this treatment onto your hands and feet, and leave in place for 20 minutes.
Rinse.
This natural treatment will revive your dry, wrinkled and rough hands, feet, elbows and knees. The avocado and egg nourish the skin with proteins and oils; the rice bran exfoliates dead skin cells; the oil of evening primrose contains precious gamma linolenic acids, essential for healthy hair, skin and nails.  Consider purchasing a small jar of Oil of Evening Primrose capsules from your health food store. Open one, and voila...you have the ingredient for this recipe.
