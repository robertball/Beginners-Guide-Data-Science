Description: 
An awesome take on macaroni and cheese! Fat-free Greek yogurt and low-fat cream cheese gives the sauce a very creamy and flavorful base--without all the fat found in heavy cream--and shredded cheeses add lots of intense flavor. Fresh spinach and salty prosciutto perfectly complement the dish!
