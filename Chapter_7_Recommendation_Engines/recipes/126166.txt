Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless sirloin steak, about 3/4-inch thick, trimmed
1/4 cup light soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon grated gingerroot
1/4 cup canola oil, divided
1 1/2 cups matchstick-cut carrots
1 large onion, sliced
1 large red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups sugar snap peas or snow peas
1/8 teaspoon dried pepper flakes (optional)
6 cups hot cooked long grain rice

Directions:
Cut beef in half lengthwise and then cut crosswise into thin slices; set aside.
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, cornstarch and ginger. Stir until cornstarch dissolves; set aside.
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Working in 3 batches, add one tablespoon of canola oil, coating bottom evenly. Add one-third of beef slices and cook 1 minute, until browned, stirring constantly. Remove from skillet and set aside. Repeat with remaining 2 batches.
Return skillet to medium-high heat; add remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil. When hot, add carrots, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and garlic, and stir-fry 3 minutes or until tender-crisp.
Add soy mixture, beef, snap peas and pepper flakes, if desired, to vegetables in skillet. Cook 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, or until sauce thickens. Serve over hot rice.
