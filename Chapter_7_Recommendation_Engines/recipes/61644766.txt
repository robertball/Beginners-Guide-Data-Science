1 garlic clove, minced
1 dash ground black pepper

In a small bowl mix together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Place chicken wings in a large nonporous glass dish or bowl and sprinkle flour mixture over them until well coated. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate 1 hour uncovered.
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Bake the wings 15 minutes, turn and bake another 15 minutes or until well browned.
Combine the butter, hot sauce, pepper and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir together and heat until butter is melted and mixture is well blended. When chicken is done, place wings in serving bowl, add hot sauce mixture and stir together. Serve.
