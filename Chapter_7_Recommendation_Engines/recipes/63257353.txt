Ingredients:
-1 2/3 cup flour
- 2 rounded tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- a good pinch salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, chilled
- 125 ml (1/2 cup) plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped nuts or dried fruits, or 1 teaspoon citrus zest, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or 2 teaspoons orange flower water, or the flavoring of your choice (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Dice the butter and blend it into the dry ingredients with a fork or pastry cutter, until no visible lump of butter remains. Add the yogurt, milk, and whatever flavoring ingredient you want to use, and blend them in until the dough forms a ball. Handle the dough as lightly as you can. Avoid overmixing, or the scones won't be as tender.
Pat the dough into a flattish round, a little over an inch in thickness, and cut into eight wedges with a knife or a pastry cutter (alternatively, use a cookie cutter to make eight neat rounds). Place the wedges on the prepared baking sheet, giving them a little space to expand. Bake for 15 minutes, until the top of the scones is set and lightly golden.
