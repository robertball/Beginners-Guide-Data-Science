Ingredients:
2/3 cup skim milk
2/3 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup applesauce

1 apple, finely chopped
7 dried apricots, chopped
8 dates, pitted and chopped
1/2 cup chopped mixed nuts
2 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon baking soda

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.
Mix milk, peanut butter, applesauce, egg, honey, apple, apricots, dates, and nuts together in a large bowl until well-combined. Stir in oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda until evenly distributed. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish.
Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before cutting into 12 bars.

Description: 
I was looking for something I could make ahead on weekends for a quick weekday breakfast and nothing I found was quite right so I made my own, using elements of others and adding things I love. I wrap them individually in foil and freeze, take one out the night before to thaw, then warm it in the toaster oven while I'm getting ready for work.
