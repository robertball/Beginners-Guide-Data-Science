Ingredients:
2 cups peeled and shredded potatoes
2 tablespoons dry onion soup mix
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon salt
cracked black pepper to taste
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chopped green onion for garnish
1 tablespoon sour cream for garnish

Directions:
Place the shredded potatoes in a cloth, and wring as much of the moisture out as possible. Place the potatoes into a bowl, and stir in the onion soup mix, garlic, eggs, flour, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper until well mixed.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, and drop the potato mixture by heaping tablespoons into the hot oil. Press down on the patties to flatten them to about 1/3 inch thick. Fry the patties until golden brown and crisp on the bottoms, 5 to 8 minutes, then flip and cook the other side until crisp and golden. Remove the latkes to paper towels to drain, and serve hot, sprinkled with green onion and a small dollop of sour cream.

Description: 
These potato pancakes are both flavorful and crispy. It is so much easier if you have a food processor with a shredder on it. Either way, worth making!
