Ingredients:
1 cup butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
2 1/4 cups flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup finely chopped nuts, if desired

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.  In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar and vanilla thoroughly.  In a small bowl combine flour, salt and nuts (if desired).  With hands, work flour mixture into butter mixture until dough holds together, add a bit more flour if dough is too soft.  Form dough into 1 inch balls.  Place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake 10-12 minutes until very lightly golden brown.  Cool slightly on cookie sheets.  While still warm, roll in powdered sugar.  Cool completely, and roll in powdered sugar once more.  (If making these for Christmas, I like to roll them in red and green colored sugar.)
