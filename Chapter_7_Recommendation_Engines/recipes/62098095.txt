Description: 
This is an easy recipe that utilizes leftover, aging apples.  It's delicious warm from the oven plain, or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  You will love its simplicity!  You can use as many apples or as few apples as your personal preference dictates.  That goes for seasonings, too!  If you do increase the amount of apples, though, please remember to bake it a few minutes longer.  The dough that you place on top of the apple mixture will filter down through the apples while baking, leaving you with a cobbler type dessert.
