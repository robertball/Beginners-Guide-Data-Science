Ingredients:
Six Whole Eggs
Two Cups Heavy Cream
One Loaf Brioche
Two Tablespoons of Unsalt Butter
Three Cups Fresh Strawberies
Two Tablespoons Water

Directions:
Take the eggs and one cup cream and whisk together. Be careful not to overbeat.
Cut the ends of the brioche off. Then cut the loaf in half. Now cut the two halves in half. You need to cut the four half in half now.
Pre-heat pan or skillet to medium heat.
Soak bread in egg/cream mixture for a five minutes.
Melt the butter on the per-heated pan or skillet.
Place the brioche that has been setting with egg/cream mixture on the buttered pan or skillet for three minutes per side.
Take two cup strawberries and place in a sauce pan with the water over medium high heat.
In a large bowl, whip cream until stiff peaks are just about to form. Reseve to the side.
Take two pieces of the finished brioche and place it overlapping each other on a plate. Laddle the strawberry sauce over the bread. Put on some of the whip cream with the reserved berries.
Enjoy
