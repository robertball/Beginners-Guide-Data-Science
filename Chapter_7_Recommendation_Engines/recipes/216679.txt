Ingredients:
2 cups fresh cherries, pitted and halved
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
1 1/2 teaspoons water
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)
1 pinch salt
1 pinch ground black pepper

Directions:
Heat the cherries, sugar, rosemary, and water in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until cherries are tender and sauce is thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm or cold.

Description: 
This simple compote is a great accompaniment to roasted lamb or beef. We live in Flathead cherry country so that's what I use, but any sweet dark cherry will work. If using frozen cherries, it usually isn't necessary to add the water.
