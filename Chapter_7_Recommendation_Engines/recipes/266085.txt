Ingredients:
4 cloves garlic
1 pound frozen large shrimp (21-25 count) - thawed, peeled, and deveined
kosher salt to taste
1 teaspoon hot smoked paprika (optional)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 tablespoon chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley

Directions:
Slice garlic thinly. Season shrimp with kosher salt and paprika. Mix to coat.
Heat garlic and oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until garlic starts to turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add shrimp and increase heat to high. Toss and turn shrimp with tongs until starting to curl but still undercooked, about 2 minutes. Pour in sherry. Cook, stirring continuously, until sauce comes up to a boil and shrimp is cooked through, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley with a spoon.

Description: 
Every Spanish restaurant serves this dish of shrimp cloaked in garlic-infused olive oil with smoky hints of paprika and a touch of sweetness from sherry. Make sure you have all your ingredients together before you head to the stove since, start to finish, this cooks in mere minutes. It's great for a tapas party, since you can prep everything ahead of time. Just spoon the shrimp and sauce over toasted bread and sprinkle more cayenne and parsley on top to enjoy.
