Ingredients:
Tortillas:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
Filling:
2 cups refried beans, warmed
1 avocado, sliced
1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco (fresh white cheese)
1/4 cup crema fresca (fresh cream)

Directions:
Mix flour, water, vegetable oil, egg, and salt in a large bowl; knead until dough is smooth and no longer sticky.
Form the dough into 8 golf ball-sized balls. Cover and let rest, about 20 minutes.
Stretch each ball of dough into a thick tortilla.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla until browned and lightly puffed, about 1 minute per side.
Layer refried beans, avocado, and queso fresco over tortillas. Drizzle crema on top; fold tortillas in half over filling.

Description: 
In El Salvador there are pupusas. In Mexico there are tacos. In Honduras there are Baleadas. The simple version consists of a thick flour  though sometimes corn  tortilla that has been put on a charcoal grill. It's slathered in refried black beans and a bit of white farmers cheese then folded over like an American-style soft taco.
