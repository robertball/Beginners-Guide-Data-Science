Ingredients:
6 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Set a wire rack inside a broiler pan or baking pan.
Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Lift up skin gently; sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder under the skin. Replace skin. Season skin and underside of the thighs with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Arrange on the rack.
Roast in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Continue roasting until juices run clear, about 30 minutes more. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
