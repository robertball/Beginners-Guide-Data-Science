Ingredients:
8 1/4-inch medium shrimp
?   3 large garlic cloves
?   1/2 tsp. salt and pepper
?   6 tablespoons olive oil
?   6 tablespoons butter
?   1 bunch of broccoli, cut up
?   8 oz. angel hair

Directions:
Marinade:
Toss together: Shrimp, garlic, salt and pepper, 4 tablespoons olive oil. Marinate the shrimp for 3 hours in the refrigerator.
After marinating, remove the garlic pieces. Add 3 tablespoons butter.
Pasta:
In a large saucepan, add broccoli and bring to a boil. Drain and return to saucepan; cover.
Editor's Note: Do not overcook. Broccoli will continue to cook after removed from heat. It should be a bright green color - emerald green, not olive green. Olive green indicates the broccoli has overcooked.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and butter. Add shrimp and saute, tossing often.
Cook pasta. Drain and toss everything together. Serve.
