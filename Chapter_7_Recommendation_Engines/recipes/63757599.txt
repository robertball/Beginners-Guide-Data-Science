Ingredients:
2 small lemons
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 stick of butter, cubed and room temperature
2 large eggs
1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
pinch of kosher salt

Directions:
To make the lemon curd, zest the lemons and pulse the zest with the sugar in a food processor about 10 times.
Transfer the sugar and zest to your mixer bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and cream with the butter.
Add the eggs, one at a time, followed by the lemon juice and pinch of salt. Mix until combined.
Pour everything into a medium saucepan, making sure to scrape all the goodness out of the bowl. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook for about 10 minutes or until the curd thickens. Remove from heat, cover and chill completely.
