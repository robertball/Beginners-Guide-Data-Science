Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 cups (4 sticks)salted butter, softened
1 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp pure vanilla
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
the zest of two lemons

Directions:
In a small bowl sift together flour and cornstarch. Set aside.
In a large bowl cream together the softened butter and the powdered sugar until creamy.
Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest and mix well.
Slowly add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, incorporating a little at a time. If dough seems too wet then add a couple tablespoons of flour. The dough should be stiff, but not dry.
Form the dough into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least an hour.
Remove chilled dough from refigerator.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Lightly flour the surface you will be using to roll the dough. Flour the rolling pin and lightly flour the surface of the dough.
Roll the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake for 10-12 minutes.
Remove from oven when edges are begining to firm slightly. Using a spatula, carefully transfer each cookie to a cooling wrack. If the cookies fall apart then they are underdone. They will remain a buttery color and should not be brown.
