Ingredients:
6 hardboiled eggs
1/2 c. crumbled feta
3 tsp. olive oil
1 tsp. lemon zest
1/2 T. minced fresh oregano
1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
2 T. capers, finely chopped
freshly ground black pepper, to taste
kosher salt, to taste

Directions:
Slice the hardboiled eggs in half lengthwise. Remove yolks and place them in a medium bowl. Add feta, olive oil, lemon zest, oregano, cayenne, capers, and black pepper. Mash thoroughly. Taste and add kosher salt if needed. Depending on the saltiness of the feta and capers, you might not need to add any.
Fill the egg white halves and eat as is. If you like a little more kick, sprinkle with a bit more cayenne.
Or...if you really want a treat...sauté them! Just level off the filling even with the surface of the egg. Then gently sauté cut side down in olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. They're done when the flat edge is crusty golden brown. These are great served atop a plate of spring greens drizzled with a light and zesty lemon vinaigrette. If they last long enough to make it to your salad, that is!
