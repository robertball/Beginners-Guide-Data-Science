Description: 
My grandmother made this when she cooked for our farmhands years ago. I've cut her recipe down to serve fewer people. I like to make this side dish when my garden is bursting with fresh vegetables and into the fall, when the colors and taste blend into the season. -Mildred Sherrer, Bay City , Texas
