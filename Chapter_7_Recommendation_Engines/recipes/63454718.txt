Ingredients:
2 packages active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (about 110 degrees)
4 cups all purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
10 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled
1 egg
1 cup sourdough starter at room temp
1/2 cup warm milk (about 110)

Directions:
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, stir together 2 cups of the flour, the sugar and salt. Then add yeast mixture, 6 tablespoons of the melted butter, the egg, starter and milk.
Beat with a heavy duty mixer or wooden spoon for about 5 minutes until well blended and smooth. Gradually beat in the remaining 2 cups of flour. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled (about 45 minutes).
Pour 2 tablespoons of the remiaining melted butter into a 9x13 baking pan, tilting pan to coat bottom. Stir dough down and drop into pan by large spoonfuls, making about 15 rolls. Cover and let rise in a warm place until light and puffy (about 30 minutes).
Drizzle the remaining melted butter over the rolls. Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven (400 for a glass pan) for 15 to 20 minutes or until browned. Turn out and serve hot. Pull rolls apart to separate.
