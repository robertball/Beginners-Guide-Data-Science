Description: 
This was handed down through the women in my family. We all love it, but I'm always amazed how many guests beg for the recipe saying that they have never tasted anything like it. The cloves and Worcestershire sauce give it a lovely kick. It keeps really well, so can be made days in advance. It is also a great (and easy) holiday gift.
