Ingredients:
4 russet potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices
salt and pepper to taste
5 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups milk
2-1/4 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1 quart casserole dish.
In a medium-size saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Mix in the flour and salt, and stir constantly with a whisk for one minute. Stir in milk. Cook until mixture has thickened. Stir in cheese all at once, and continue stirring until melted, about 30 to 60 seconds.
Layer 1/2 of the potatoes into bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 cheese sauce, salt & pepper. Then add the remaining potatoes, pour remainder of cheese sauce on top and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
Bake 1 1/2 hours in the preheated oven.
