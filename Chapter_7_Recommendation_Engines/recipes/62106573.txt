Ingredients:
1-18.25 oz. pkg. Betty Crocker Cherry Chip cake mix (plus 1 1/4 cups water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, & 3 eggs for baking)
1-12 oz. can Betty Crocker Cream Cheese icing
1-15 oz. jar maraschino cherries

Directions:
Bake cake in a 9x13 pan per directions on box.
Cool in pan, on wire rack 30 min.
Drain cherries and save juice for another use.
Scoop all icing into a medium bowl.
Chop cherries coarsely, and add to frosting.
Mix, and frost cake.  The juice from the chopped cherries will color the icing a pretty pink.
