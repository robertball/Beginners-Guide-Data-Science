Ingredients:
1/2 bag frozen hash browns- thawed on paper towels
0r 1 whole bag hash browns non-frozen -found near eggs or fresh produce
6 precooked turkey sausage patties -diced
1 cup grated Cheddar Cheese or Pepper Jack Cheese
8 eggs - (I use extra large or jumbo)
1 cup half n half
1/4 cup Whole Milk
1/4 cup Heavy Cream
1/2- 3/4 can mild Chopped Green Chiles
1/2 Tsp Onion powder
1/2 Tsp Dry Mustard
1/2 Tsp salt
1/2 Tsp Seasoning Salt
1/4 Tsp pepper
8 slices Havarti Cheese (I prefer Havarti due to it's creaminess)

Directions:
Use a smaller but at least 4 inch deep baking dish. I have a 9L x 7w x 4d.
Spray the dish well, including the sides
Line bottom and sides with the hash browns, pressing to form crust. Pop in oven for 10 min to slightly dry out potatoes, while mixing egg ingredients.
Remove to cool slightly while chopping sausage.
Layer sausage on top of the bottom layer of hash browns , then layer cheese and finally layer green chiles
For the Eggs:
In large bowl, add eggs, beat to loosen.
To the eggs, add next 8 ingredients, mix well.
Pour mixture over potatoes, sausage, chiles.  Cover tightly with lightly sprayed foil and bake middle rack at 425 for 10 minutes, then lower to 375 bake for 20 minutes and finally lower to 300 bake for the remaining 30 minutes. Turn off oven, rest in oven for 10min  Remove foil, add Havarti slices evenly over casserole, return to oven uncovered until cheese is melted.
