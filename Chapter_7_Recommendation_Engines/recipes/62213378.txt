Ode to my AR Friends on Thanksgiving Recipe

Ingredients:
ON THANKSGIVING DAY…
Put this on your counter
And as you cook  today
Remember all the great friends
That AR’s brought your way.
I know that my life’s better
For having you to share
The good, the bad, the funny…
Just knowing you are there -
To answer stupid questions,
To give hints and advice
Has made it so much easier
And added zest to life.
I hope that you will think
Of all of us today
And say a little prayer of thanks
That our paths crossed this way.
So raise a glass and make a toast 
To all our friends online.
I know that you will all succeed:
Your feast will be divine!
Safe travels and happy eating!
