Description: 
This is a quick variation of an Indian okra dish that my mother used to make. My 3 year old daughter simply loves this dish. It can be spiced up to suit your palate...Serve with Indian rotis or pita and plain yogurt for a quick nutritious meal. If amchoor (dried mango powder) is not available, substitute 1 teaspoon lemon juice.
