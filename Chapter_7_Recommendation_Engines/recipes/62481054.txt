Ingredients:
1-2 Tbs olive oil
salt and pepper
6 skinless chicken thighs
6-10 cloves garlic
1/2 onion, chopped finely
2 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1 inch discs
1/2 c sherry
8-12 oz white mushrooms, sliced

Directions:
Heat the oil in a frying pan.  Remove the skin from the thighs, rinse with cold water and pat dry.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the skinless chicken thighs.  Sear the thighs in the oil on both sides until they are browned.  Place the things in a crockpot.  Add the garlic, onion, carrots and sherry and toss until mixed well.  Turn the slow cooker on low.  When the chicken is done, slice the mushrooms.  Saute them in a frying pan and when they are almost cooked, add the liquid from the chicken to the mushrooms.  Allow the mushrooms to simmer 1-2 minutes in the liquid.  Then add this mixture to the chicken.  Serve hot with a side dish.
