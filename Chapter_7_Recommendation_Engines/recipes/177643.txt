Ingredients:
1 sheet Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry
1 egg
1 tablespoon water
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
1/4 cup Pace® Chunky Salsa
5 pitted ripe olives, quartered
Chile powder

Directions:
Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle.  Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Beat the egg and water in a small bowl with a fork.  Stir the cheese and salsa in a small bowl.
Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the pastry sheet into a 15x12-inch rectangle. Cut into 20 (3-inch) squares. Place about 1 tablespoon cheese mixture in the center of each pastry square. Top each with 1 olive piece, if desired. Brush the edges of the pastry squares with the egg mixture. Fold the pastry over the filling to form triangles. Crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Place the filled pastries onto a baking sheet. Brush the pastries with the egg mixture and sprinkle with the chili powder.
Bake for 15 minutes or until the pastries are golden. Serve warm or at room temperature.
