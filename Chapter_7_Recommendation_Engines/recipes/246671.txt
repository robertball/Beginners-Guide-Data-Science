1 tablespoon peanut oil
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 pounds fresh edamame (in shell)
1/4 cup black bean sauce

Heat peanut oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; add garlic. Cook and stir garlic until slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add edamame; cook and stir until glossy and puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir black bean sauce into edamame until evenly coated and warmed, 1 to 2 minutes.

Description: 
A delicious, hot Asian appetizer, great for dinner parties on a budget or a way above-average party dish. Pour edamame onto a platter and serve - it's nice to give each person a small dish to discard the soy bean shells.
