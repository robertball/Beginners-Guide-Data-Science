Ingredients:
1 small banana
1 cup almond milk
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste
1 pinch salt
1/2 cup rolled oats

Directions:
Mash half the banana in a saucepan. Whisk almond milk, honey, almond extract, cinnamon, and salt with the mashed banana until smooth; bring to a boil and stir oats into the mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until the oats are tender and the moisture has been absorbed to your desired consistency, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer oatmeal to a bowl.
Dice remaining banana half. Top oatmeal with banana and more cinnamon, as desired.

Description: 
This oatmeal is warm, sweet, and lusciously filling, and it leaves me satisfied for hours! It is also incredibly versatile. Switch out any of the ingredients for whatever you fancy. I find it works well with some vanilla extract instead of almond and topped with crunchy peanut butter and a drizzle of honey! If you like your oatmeal just a bit thicker, use a little less milk or cook for a little longer.
