Description: 
A chunky chutney like this one makes a great gift for friends and neighbors. I give them the chutney in a decorated jar with a package of cream cheese and a box of crackers. It makes a lovely snack and is just as good alongside a main dish.                                                --Cheryl Lottman                                             Stillwater, Minnesota
