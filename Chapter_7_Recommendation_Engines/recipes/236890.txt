Ingredients:
1 fluid ounce Benedictine® liqueur
1 fluid ounce brandy

Directions:
Pour Benedictine(R) into a snifter or wine glass. Slowly pour brandy over the back of a bar spoon into the glass so that the brandy 'floats' atop the Benedictine(R).

Description: 
Brandy and Benedictine come together deliciously in this simple but complex cocktail. It's just equal parts of each, but there's a trick to layering the ingredients into the brandy snifter. You don't need to serve it in a snifter, of course, but it‘s a great way to enjoy the cocktail's complex aromas. The B and B is a favorite at the R Bar in New Orleans.
