Ingredients:
1 9-inch pie crust (unbaked)
1/2 lb of bacon
2 cups sliced leeks
2 Tbsp butter
2 cups cheddar cheese
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
2 Tbsp flour
5 eggs
1 1/2 cups half & half (or heavy cream)
1 tomato (sliced thinly)
salt & pepper (to taste)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Fry bacon in pan over medium-high heat until brown and crispy.  Drain and reserve fat. Crumble the bacon after it is cool to touch.
Cut leeks into thin slices. Saute them in the bacon fat, or in 2 Tbsp of butter if prefered, until softened.
Place pie crust in a deep-dish glass pie pan. Spread the leeks in the bottom of the pie pan, then sprinkle bacon crumbs on top.
In a medium sized bowl, beat eggs with half & half.
In a small bowl, toss flour with cheeses. Then mix cheese mixture into the egg mixture.
Pour the combined mixture into the pie shell. Top with tomato slices, and season with salt and pepper.  Bake for 60 minutes.  Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.
