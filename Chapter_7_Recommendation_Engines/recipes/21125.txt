Ingredients:
1 large chopped onion
1 large chopped green bell pepper
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
4 thick cut pork chops
salt and pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour for coating
32 ounces canned tomato sauce

Directions:
In a large skillet, saute onion and bell pepper in oil over medium-high heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
Generously season pork chops with salt and pepper. Dredge each chop in flour. Place pork chops in hot skillet and brown on both sides.
Return onions and peppers to pork chops in skillet. Pour in tomato sauce; reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 or 20 minutes, until pork chops are fully cooked. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
