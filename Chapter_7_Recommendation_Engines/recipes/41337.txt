Ingredients:
3 (8 inch) flour tortillas
3/4 cup fat-free sour cream
2 green onions, finely chopped
3 teaspoons minced fresh cilantro or parsley, divided
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 cup fresh or frozen corn, thawed
1 plum tomato, diced
1 tablespoon chopped jalapeno pepper
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 teaspoon canola oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Using a 2-inch-round cookie cutter, cut 12 circles from each tortilla. Coat both sides of circles with nonstick cooking spray. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees for 4 - 5 minutes or until crisp. Cool.
In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, onions, 1 teaspoon cilantro and garlic powder; cover and refrigerate. In another bowl, combine the corn, tomato, jalapeno, orange juice, oil, salt and remaining cilantro; cover and refrigerate.
Just before serving, spread 1 teaspoon sour cream mixture over each tostada. Using a slotted spoon, top each with a teaspoonful of corn salsa.
