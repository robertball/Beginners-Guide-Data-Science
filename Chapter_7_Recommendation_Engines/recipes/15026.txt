Ingredients:
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
2 cups salsa
4  potatoes, peeled

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Place each chicken breast in the middle of a square piece of foil. Pour 1/4 cup salsa over each breast. Slice the potatoes thin and place potato slices on top of chicken and salsa. Spoon another 1/4 cup salsa over each chicken/potato combination. Fold foil up to form 'packets'. Place packets seam side up on a cookie sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Open packets and serve.

Description: 
I love cooking in packets, clean-up is such a breeze.  In order to increase or decrease this recipe, you need 1/2 cup or 4 ounces of salsa for each chicken breast that you make. Serve with a salad for a complete meal.
