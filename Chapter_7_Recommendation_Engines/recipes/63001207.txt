Description: 
This is easy and a family favorite. I am making a cookbook of my recipies for my daughter for Christmas. I use many recipies from this site. However my family cookbook would not be complete without this one. For some reason we always have this Christmas eve as a reprive before the  traditional Turkey, Ham, Cabbage Rolls and Meat Pie come out. Do not expect anything fancy here. This is just easy inexpensive comfort food without a lot of fuss.
