Description: 
This is another wonderful recipe passed on by my mother.  She always prepared this dish when there was a potluck dinner on their entertainment calendar and she made sure there was extra for the kids who had to stay home.  Although we don’t have many potlucks on our social calendar, this recipe is a staple in our home and my kids wait by the oven for dinner to be ready.  I always double the recipe because 1 batch disappears before I get a chance to sit down at the dinner table. Enjoy!
