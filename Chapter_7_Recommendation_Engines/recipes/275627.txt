Ingredients:
2 cups raisins
2 cups whole wheat flour
2 cups wheat bran (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice
1 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 (29 ounce) can pumpkin puree (such as Libby's®)
3/4 cup canola oil
4 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.
Plump raisins by microwaving them in a microwave-safe bowl with water to cover for 2 minutes. Drain water and set raisins aside.
Combine flour, wheat bran, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.
Combine pumpkin, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Blend using an electric hand mixer on low speed. Add flour mixture and blend until combined. Fold in plumped raisins. Divide batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Trying to eliminate added sugar from my diet but still craving a sweet treat, I developed these bran muffins based on some pumpkin muffins I make for my kids. The only sweetness comes from the raisins, which you can increase or omit if you prefer. Enjoy.
