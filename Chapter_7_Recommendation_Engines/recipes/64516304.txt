Note: This recipe is on the more mild side.  It can be spiced up with hotter salsa instead of the tomatoes with chiles.  All families have their own style of cooking so do what works best for yours!
One other silly little tip- I use a pizza wheel to cut my tortilla strips in even, straight lines.  I actually use my pizza wheel to slice thru all kinds of things.  Itâ€™s like my secret weapon in the kitchen.  What are your favorite tips in the kitchen?
