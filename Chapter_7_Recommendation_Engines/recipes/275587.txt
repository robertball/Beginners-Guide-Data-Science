Ingredients:
3 1/2 pounds baby back pork ribs
1 (16 ounce) jar apricot preserves
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
2 teaspoons garlic powder
aluminum foil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place ribs in a large roasting pan. Whisk together apricot preserves, soy sauce, brown sugar, and garlic powder until blended. Pour apricot marinade over ribs, cover, and place in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
Remove ribs from the marinade and shake off excess. Place ribs in the prepared baking pan and season with salt and pepper. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer marinade for 5 minutes; set aside.
Bake ribs in the preheated oven, basting frequently with the cooked marinade, until ribs are tender and meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 1 hour 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
