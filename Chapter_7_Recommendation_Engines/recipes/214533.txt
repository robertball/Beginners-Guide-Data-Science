Ingredients:
1 (1 1/2 pound) beef tri-tip roast
Salt and pepper
Rub:
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Combine rub ingredients in small bowl; press evenly onto all surfaces of beef roast.
Place roast on rack in shallow roasting pan. Do not add water or cover. Roast in 425 degrees F oven 30 to 40 minutes for medium rare; 40 to 45 minutes for medium doneness.
Remove roast when instant-read thermometer registers 135 degrees F for medium rare; 150 degrees F for medium. Transfer roast to carving board; tent loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand 15 minutes. (Temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F to reach 145 degrees F for medium rare; 160 degrees F for medium.)
Carve roast across the grain into thin slices. Season with salt and pepper, as desired.
