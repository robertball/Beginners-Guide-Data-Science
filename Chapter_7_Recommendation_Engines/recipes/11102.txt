Ingredients:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk
10 drops food coloring

Directions:
Sift the confectioners' sugar into a small bowl.  Stir in enough milk to make a smooth but not too runny consistency.  You may need to adjust with some more sugar.  Divide this mixture into small containers, depending on how many colors you want.  Color each small container with colors appropriate for the season, using as much food coloring as needed to create desired hues.
