Ingredients:
Pastry shell or enough pastry dough for one open-faced 'pie', ensure the dough is not sweet, but is salty
3 Large House Tomatoes sliced thinly, or 6 medium size roma tomatoes sliced thinly
6 slices swiss cheese (3x5 inches is good, with a width of 1/4 inch)
1/2 cup mustard with seeds (like a rough mustard or a brown mustard- better flavor)
2 tablespoons Herbes de Provences, or just plain old oregano and basil (one tablespoon of each, mixed)
2 tablespoons olive oil
Pie Dish

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375°F or 200°C
Lay out the pastry dough into the pie pan, if it's a pastry shell with a pie pan attached skip to step 3.
Poke holes all over the bottom of the crust, this will ensure the pie will not bubble up.
Spread the mustard evenly over the bottom of the crust, if need more add more, ensure the pie crust does not show through.
Place slices of swiss cheese along the bottom on top of mustard, it will resemble a pizza
Layer tomato slices clockwise starting from the outside edge swirling to the interior until the bottom is covered. If there is extra, continue to layer to cover spots.
Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil and about 2 tablespoons of the seasoning, plus salt and pepper to taste
Place in oven, cook uncovered for about 20 minutes, or until the tomatoes are curled on the edges, the outside crust is brown, like the photo below:

Description: 
Lyon, France is considered the Gastronomic capitol of the world.  I moved here with the intent to learn this cuisine, and this tart is not only a family favorite but a very typical lyonnaise dish.  There are a lot of tomatoes in the summer time, so this dish became a staple.  Enjoy!
