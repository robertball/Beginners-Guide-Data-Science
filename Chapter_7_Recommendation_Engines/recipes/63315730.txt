Ingredients:
1 whole chicken about 3 1/4 lb.
3 cups buttermilk
2 tablespoons tabasco sauce
1-1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp sweet paprika
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
2 tbsp oil
1 cup Vegetable oil for frying

Directions:
Note: Marinate for 1 hour to 12 hours/overnight. Preheat the oven to 300Â°F.
Cut the chicken into eight pieces. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk with the pepper sauce and season to taste with salt. Marinate the chicken for a least 1 hour, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.
Drain the chicken and pat dry. Mix together the flour, paprika, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt and cayenne pepper in a dish and use to coat the chicken. Shake off the excess and set the chicken aside.
Heat oil in a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, skin-side-down, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until nicely browned. If necessary, cook in batches-do not crowd the pan, and leave enough space between the pieces to ensure even cooking. Turn the pieces over and cook until browned. Transfer to a baking dish or roasting pan, cover loosely with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.

Description: 
Really good, and you can do a brick chicken technique and cut the oven time by 1/2 (20 mins).  Use a 12 cast iron, do 2 batches of frying and then combine for the oven part.
