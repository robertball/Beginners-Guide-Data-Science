Ingredients:
8 (3/4 inch thick) slices sourdough bread
1/4 cup butter
8 slices cooked thick bacon
8 slices pepperjack cheese
1 red onion, sliced and separated into rings
1 avocado, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices

Directions:
Lay bread on a work surface and spread butter on one side of each slice.
Layer bacon, 1 slice of cheese, onion rings, avocado slices, and another slice of cheese on top of the unbuttered-side of the bread; top with second slice of bread, buttered-side facing up.
Cook sandwiches in a skillet over medium heat, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese has melted, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.

Description: 
Not your typical grilled cheese. These flavors go great together. It's great without bacon for my vegetarian friends.
