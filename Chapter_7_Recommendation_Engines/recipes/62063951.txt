Ingredients:
4-6 potatoes, cut into wedges
Salad Supreme
Garlic Salt
Seasoned Salt
Butter

Directions:
Heat oven to 325 degrees.
Once potatoes are cut into wedges, slice the tops of them up a bit, so butter can melt down inside.  Put all seasonings (to your taste) in a large Ziploc bag (we go heavy on the Salad Supreme).  Add potatoes and shake until evenly covered.  Spread potatoes out in shallow pan or large cookie sheet and drizzle with butter.  Bake in oven one hour, or to your desired consistency.  YUM!
