Ingredients:
Sirloin Steak 10 oz
Nectarines 2
Shallot 1
Spring Mix 4 oz
Basil ½ oz
Feta Cheese 1 oz
Pecans 1 oz
Red Wine Vinegar 2 T
Olive Oil 2 T

Directions:
1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Thinly slice the basil leaves. Halve and pit the nectarines, then thinly slice into wedges. Mince the shallot. HINT: If you have a grill, both the steak and the nectarines can be cooked there so fire it up!
2 Heat ½ Tablespoon oil in a large pan over medium heat. Season the steak on all sides with salt and pepper. Sear the steak for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown. Transfer to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until cooked to desired doneness. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes.
3 Char the nectarines: add the nectarines to the same pan over high heat. Sear for 1-2 minutes, or until caramelized and charred. Set aside.
4 Make the vinaigrette: in a large bowl, whisk together the shallot, red wine vinegar, and 1½ Tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.
5 Thinly slice the steak against the grain. Toss the spring mix and basil into the vinaigrette. Top with the steak, nectarines, feta, and pecans. Enjoy!
