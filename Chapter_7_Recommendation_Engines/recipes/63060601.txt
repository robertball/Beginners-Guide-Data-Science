Ingredients:
1/2 c. water
1 1/2 c. frozen blueberries
1/3 c. sugar
1/2 c. cold water
1/4 c. cornstarch
2 1/3 c. all purpose flour or cake flour
1 Tbsp. baking powder
3/4 tsp. salt
1 1/2 c. sugar
1/4 c. coconut oil
1/4 c. butter
3 eggs
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
3/4 cup flaked coconut
3/4 cup chopped walnuts, pecans or almonds

Directions:
In a medium saucepan bring water, sugar and frozen blueberries to a boil over medium heat.
In small bowl whisk cornstarch together with the cold water.
Add cornstarch mixture to the boiling blueberries.
Very gently stir mixture together until it thickens. About 5 minutes. Set aside until cooled down.
In large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt.
Mix in melted coconut oil, butter and 1 egg. A pastry cutter works well for this.
Pat mixture down into buttered 9x13 inch cake pan. Pressing all but the edges down very well. This leaves a nice edge to the pieces.
In medium size bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy; blend in 2 eggs and confectioners sugar. Pour over cake mixture.
Next, pour the cooled blueberry mixture over the cream cheese mixture.
Sprinkle with coconut and nuts.
Bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool for several hours before cutting into bars.
