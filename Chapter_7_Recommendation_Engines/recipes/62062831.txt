Ingredients:
1 lb. flour
2 eggs
1 c. milk (whole)
Salt
¼ lb slab bacon, cubed
2 hard rolls, day old, cubed
¼ lb. Bologna, cubed, not sliced
2/3 lb. dried fruit (prunes, apples, apricots or cranberries), marinated overnight in 1 c. rum or cognac, cut into strips
¾ c. red wine
1 clove
Grated lemon peel
Water, salt

Directions:
Boil drained marinated fruit in red wine with clove and lemon peel for 15 minutes. Strain fruit and set aside to cool. Discard wine and cloves or reserve for other use.
Combine flour, eggs, milk and salt in mixer and beat until dough begins to form air bubbles.
Brown cubed day-old rolls with cubed bacon and Bologna cubes; fry until crisp and lightly browned. Do not drain; set aside and allow to cool.
Combine dough with undrained meat and roll mixture to form elastic dough.
Bring stockpot of salted water to boil, reduce heat to just below boiling.
Using two large serving spoons, make dumplings from the dough (Quenelle technique) and drop them into the boiling salted water. Allow dumplings to simmer in water for 15 minutes, then remove with slotted spoon to pre-warmed, buttered covered casserole. Keep warm until ready to serve.

Description: 
Another recipe comiled out of old recipes used in Pomerania, an ancient Germany region abutting the Baltic Sea, divided between Germany and Poland after World War II. The dumplings are very unusual in that they contain a combination of bread, meat and dried fruit and therefore can be served as an appetizer or as a very rich accompaniment to fowl, game or pork dishes. I like to serve them with turkey at Thanksgiving, making dried cranberries one of the ingredients.
