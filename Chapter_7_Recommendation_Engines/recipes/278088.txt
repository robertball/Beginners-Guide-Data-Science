Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package uncooked orzo pasta
1/3 cup pesto, or to taste
2 teaspoons lemon juice (optional)
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
4 ounces mozzarella cheese balls or pearls
1/4 cup sliced pepperoni, cut into strips
3 large fresh basil leaves, julienned

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
Add pesto and lemon juice to the orzo; toss to coat. Mix in tomatoes, mozzarella cheese balls, and pepperoni strips. Refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.
Mix in basil right before serving.

Description: 
The orzo in this salad is reminiscent of pine needles and when dressed in pesto brings a lovely green hue. Perlini mozzarella balls become ornaments, as do cherry tomatoes and ribbons of basil and pepperoni.
 I do not add salt as I find the pepperoni and pesto to be ample enough.
 Additional toppings to consider are slivers of red onion, black olives, and diced green bell pepper. I don't like balsamic vinegar, thus the lemon juice.
