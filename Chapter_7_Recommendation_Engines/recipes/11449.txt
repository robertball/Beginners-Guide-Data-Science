Ingredients:
8 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
5 tablespoons white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the over to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.
Stir flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in milk and the 1/4 cup melted butter until dough forms.
Turn dough onto a flat, floured surface.  Knead dough 10 times.  Roll dough with a rolling pin or pat with hands into a rectangle, 9x5 inches.  Brush with remaining melted butter using a pastry brush; sprinkle with 3 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon. Roll dough up tightly, beginning at narrow end.  Pinch edge of dough into roll to seal.  Cut into 4 equal pieces with sharp knife.  Place cuts sides up on cookie sheet; pat each into a 6-inch circle.
