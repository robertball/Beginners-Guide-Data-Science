4 (3.5 ounce) links Italian sausage, sliced

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 cups uncooked white rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion and saute for 3 minutes, or until tender. Add the sausage, browning well on all sides, about 5 minutes.
Add the chicken stock, oregano, basil and parsley. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour.
Add the rice and simmer for 30 more minutes. Finally, add the cream, stirring well. Remove from heat and let soup rest for 5 minutes before serving.

Description: 
This is an excellent spicy, rich soup. Simple to make, yet delicious! I whipped it up a couple of years ago for my wife and myself, and now I get numerous requests every year to make it. I hope you enjoy. Use bratwurst or your favorite sausage.
