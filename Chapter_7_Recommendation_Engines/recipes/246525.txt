Ingredients:
4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
3 limes, zested and juiced
1/4 cup honey, plus more for dipping
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed

Directions:
Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally, then cut into thin strips. Place chicken strips in a bowl; stir in lime juice to marinate at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
Place 1/4 cup honey into a bowl; whisk coconut and flour together in another bowl. Dip chicken strips into honey to coat; roll chicken through flour mixture to coat. Discard excess honey and coconut mixture.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; fry chicken pieces until browned, crisp, no longer pink at the center, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lime zest.

Description: 
This was a throw-it-together recipe when I didn't know what to make one night that turned out great. And it was improved with the help of my some of my brilliant fellow Allrecipes Canadian Allstar sisters: Jan, Lindsay, Michele, Debbie, Vera. Thank you, ladies!
