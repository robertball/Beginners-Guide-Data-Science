Barbecue Ribs Recipe

Ingredients:
4 pounds pork spareribs
1 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup ketchup
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup rum
1/2 cup chile sauce
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 dash ground black pepper

Directions:
Fill a large stock pot with water and 3 cans of beer.  (I sometimes use Guinness, but cheap beer does the trick!)  Bring to a boil and add the ribs.  Bring to a medium roll and cook ribs for 10-15 minutes.
In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, chile sauce, garlic, mustard, and pepper. Drain ribs and combine with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, or refrigerate overnight.
Preheat grill for medium heat. Position grate four inches above heat source.
Put the ribs in the pan directly on the grill for 30 minutes to make juicy, carmelized, messy ribs!  If possible, indirect grilling your ribs for 40-45 minutes will create a very tender, fall off the rib meat.  Cleanup is a breeze!
