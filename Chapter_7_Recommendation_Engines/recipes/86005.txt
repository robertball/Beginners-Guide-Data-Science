Description: 
This is a quick, easy, and authentic Thai curry dish that's sweet and very spicy. I became addicted to the dish at a local restaurant and then worked to duplicate it at home. I think I've got the taste and presentation pegged. I'm guesstimating on the amounts since I don't measure much when I cook. Feel free to adjust to taste.
