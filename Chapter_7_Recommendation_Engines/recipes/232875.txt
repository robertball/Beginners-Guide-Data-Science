Ingredients:
cooking spray
3 cups gluten-free all purpose baking flour
2 cups white sugar
1/3 cup cocoa powder
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1 1/2 cups mayonnaise
1 1/2 cups hot water
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray.
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and xanthan gum in a bowl; stir in mayonnaise until well mixed. Gradually pour in hot water and vanilla extract; stir until smooth. Spoon batter into the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean and the cake slightly pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

Description: 
This chocolate cake is an adaptation of a cake I ate as a child. It's easy, moist, and delicious! I have successfully substituted egg-free mayonnaise for the regular mayonnaise, if eggs are off your list, too. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.
