Ingredients:
1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 pound cooked chicken meat, shredded
4  purple plums - pitted, peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons chicken broth
½ teaspoon ground mace
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2  purple plums, pitted and sliced
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 tablespoon light brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the puff pastry sheet into an 8-inch round or square pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until the bottom of the pastry is very lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Mix together the chicken, 4 chopped plums, chicken broth, mace, cinnamon, and cloves in a bowl, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon the mixture over the partially-baked crust, and arrange slices of 2 plums over the top. Drizzle the pie with melted butter, and sprinkle with brown sugar.
Bake the pie in the oven until the crust is golden brown and the plum slices have caramelized, about 40 minutes.
