Ingredients:
1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast
1/4 cup milk, lukewarm
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup butter
4 tablespoons white sugar
6 egg yolks
5 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/3 cups milk
1 cup butter, melted
12 ounces honey
2 cups raisins
1 1/2 pounds walnuts, ground
1 pinch ground cinnamon

Directions:
Dissolve yeast in 4 tablespoons lukewarm milk. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and 3 tablespoons flour. Stir well and set aside.
Blend 1 cup melted butter with 4 tablespoons sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add egg yolks, one at a time. Add yeast mixture and mix well.
Switch to the dough hook attachment. Add 5 cups sifted flour, salt, and 1 1/3 cup milk l. Beat dough on speed 2 for 10 minutes or until dough has good gluten development. Dust with flour, cover bowl with a clean dish towel, and let rise 2 hours.
Cut dough in half and roll out each half as thin as possible on floured board. Keep remaining dough covered with plastic wrap while you work. Spread each thin rectangle of dough with melted butter, honey, raisins, and walnuts, and dust generously with cinnamon.
Roll up like jelly roll, place each loaf on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover with greased plastic wrap, and allow to rise for one hour (for loaf pan instructions, see Editor's Note).
Bake in preheated oven for about 1 hour, or until crust is deep golden brown and the internal temperature of each loaf reaches 185 degrees F.
