Ingredients:
1 pound dried figs
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup butter
1 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Place the stewed figs into a saucepan, cover with water, and simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes. Drain and cool, reserving 1/2 cup of the liquid.
Cut the figs into 1/4 inch cubes; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the reserved fig liquid and buttermilk; set aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves; set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.  Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture. Stir in the chopped figs and walnuts. Pour into prepared 10 inch tube pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool in pan 15 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
