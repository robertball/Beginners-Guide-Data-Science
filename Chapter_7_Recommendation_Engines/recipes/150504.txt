Ingredients:
2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 3/4 cups firmly packed light brown sugar
1 1/2 cups Pillsbury BEST® All Purpose Flour

Directions:
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, combine oats, brown sugar, flour, baking powder and baking soda. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until dough resembles fine crumbs. Stir in peanuts. Set aside 1 1/2 cups crumb mixture.
Stir egg into remaining crumb mixture. Press on bottom of 13x9-inch baking pan. Bake 15 minutes.
In small bowl, stir together sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter until well combined. Pour evenly over crust.
