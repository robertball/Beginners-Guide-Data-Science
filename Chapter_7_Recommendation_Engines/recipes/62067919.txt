Description: 
I've made this for several parties...feeds a crowd.  The shrimp make it somewhat elegant and appropriate for a party.  But really, there's so much more going on in the cream cheese and other toppings that a few shrimp go a long way.  The ranch dressing mix, garlic and green onion really jazz this up!
