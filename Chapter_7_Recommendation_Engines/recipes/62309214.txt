Ingredients:
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup high-quality cocoa powder
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1 cup nonfat plain greek-style strained yogurt
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup applesauce
1/2 cup brewed coffee (can also substitute water)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and coat an 8x8 baking dish with nonstick spray.
Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in a medium sized bowl. Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
Combine the yogurt, vanilla extract, applesauce and coffee (or water) in a separate bowl.
Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and fold gently with a spatula until combined.  Do not overmix or the brownies will end up tough.
Spread in the pan and bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the center is firm to the touch.  Allow to cool slightly before cutting.

Description: 
This ultra-moist brownie is made with whole wheat flour and greek-strained yogurt in place of butter or oil. The calcium and high protein content in the yogurt along with the fiber in the cocoa powder make this a healthy, guilt-free treat!
