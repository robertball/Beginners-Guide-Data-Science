Ingredients:
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper
1 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning
2 ½ pounds chicken wings
⅔ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's <sup>&reg;</sup>edHot(<sup>&reg;</sup>))
½ cup butter
1 ½ tablespoons white vinegar
½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
⅛ teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch salt to taste

Directions:
Heat a smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to manufacturer's directions.
Mix 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl to make dry rub. Sprinkle over chicken wings.
Cook chicken wings in the preheated smoker until tender, 1 to 1 1/4 hour.
Combine hot pepper sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter is melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Transfer smoked wings to a large bowl; stir in 1/2 of the sauce until wings are evenly coated.
Grill coated wings until skin is browned and starting to get crispy, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in remaining sauce until wings are well-coated.
