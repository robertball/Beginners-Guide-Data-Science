Description: 
This has become a family favorite. The prep time is a little long, but my family gathers around the kitchen and helps slice and chat while we get everything ready. Good for a cold, mid-winter night. You may garnish with parsley. Serve piping hot with garlic roasted or mashed potatoes, and stir-fried asparagus.
