Ingredients:
2 pounds boneless beef round steak, cut into 6-ounce pieces
1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as LAWRY'S®), or to taste
1/2 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
1 large green bell pepper, cut into strips
1 large onion, cut into strips
1 large carrot, chopped
1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), undrained
1/2 (15 ounce) can sloppy joe sauce (such as Manwich®)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup red wine

Directions:
Sprinkle both sides of the steak pieces with seasoned salt and paprika. Place the flour in a shallow dish, and thoroughly dredge both sides of the meat with the flour. Pound the meat on both sides with the tenderizing side of a meat mallet, pounding some of the flour into the meat.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the steaks well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Layer the steaks in a slow cooker with the green bell pepper and onion strips and carrot. Mix together the diced tomatoes with green chiles, sloppy joe sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and wine, and pour over the steak and vegetables.
Cover the slow cooker, set the temperature to Low, and cook until the steaks are tender and the sauce is thickened and well blended, 8 to 10 hours.

Description: 
After a search on Allrecipes for Swiss steak resulted in 16 similar recipes, I decided I wanted to create something unique.  It may be a stretch to call my creation 'Swiss,' but the result was a meal the whole family liked.  Even my picky 4- and 7-year-old boys ate a large portion of it!
