In a clean bowl, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add salt and cream of tartar, and beat until slightly stiff.  Gradually beat in sugar until peaks form.  Fold in 2 teaspoons creme de menthe.  Spread meringue over pie, and seal to edges.  Freeze up to 24 hours.
Just before serving, broil until top is golden.

Description: 
This pie has a chocolate cookie crust and an ice cream filling, but the creme de menthe meringue topping is what makes it special. It is a perfect St. Patrick's Day treat. Vanilla ice cream can be substituted for the mint chocolate chip.
