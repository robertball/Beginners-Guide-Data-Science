Ingredients:
4 - 4 oz. salmon filets
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper
2 tsp. minced fresh rosemary, divided
1 clove of garlic, minced
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
1/4 cup plain bread crumbs*
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Lightly grease a 13"x9" baking pan.  Arrange salmon filets in pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter.  Add the olive oil, lemon juice, 1 tsp. of the rosemary and garlic.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 3 minutes.  Remove from heat and drizzle evenly over the salmon.
In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and remaining 1 tsp. rosemary.  Sprinkle on top of the salmon.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily with a fork and top is golden brown.
