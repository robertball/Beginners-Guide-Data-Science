Ingredients:
20-25 limes, juiced (depending on size)
1 cup superfine sugar
1 cup white rum (also known as light or silver)
30 leaves fresh mint
25-35 ounces club soda or sparkling water

Directions:
Squeeze lime juice into a pourable container.  In a pitcher, muddle the superfine sugar with the mint leaves.  Pour lime juice and rum into muddled mint and sugar.  Stir until sugar is dissolved.  Add 25-35 ounces club soda, to taste.  Serve over ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and/or slice of lime.

Description: 
Most mixed drink recipes are for individual drinks but this recipe is great for a small group.  Fresh lime juice and mint really make this recipe but I have substituted mint oil with satisfactory results.  When I need to mix the recipe in advance, I mix everything but the sparkling water, which can be added right before serving.  It's a delicious and refreshing recipe, perfect for a summer dinner party or back yard bar-b-que.
