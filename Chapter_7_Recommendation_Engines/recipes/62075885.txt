Ingredients:
1 250g block of light cream cheese
3/4 cup of mayo
1 1/2 cups shredded mozza and cheddar cheeses (buy the bag of pre-cut - it's easier)
6-8 slices of pre-cooked bacon
1 medium-large tomato
5 sprigs of green onion
4 cloves fresh pressed garlic
1 loaf of baguette bread for dipping or bag of 'Scoops' nachos.

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350
Microwave the cream cheese a little bit to make it soft so it stirs easily.
Mix the block of cream cheese with the cup of mayo.
Use a garlic press, and add the fresh garlic. Stir it in well
Microwave the pre-cooked bacon, chop it up finely, and stir it in.
Dice the tomato and green onion and stir those in too
Stir in one cup of the chedder/mozza cheese. (save the other 1/2 cup for later)
Spread it out in a shallow pyrex dish (corningware or whatever).  The mixture should be about 3/4 inch deep in the dish.
Bake it.  Watch it.  As it starts to bubble on the outer rim, sprinkle the last 1/2 cup of cheese over the top.
Cut up the baguette, (if you choose to use it) and lightly toast it.
When the top layer of cheese is melted, it's ready, about 20 minutes in the oven, total.  Let it cool or you'll burn the roof of you mouth. It's just Awesome!

Description: 
This hot dip is a total crowd pleaser! I've had dinner guests return, to ask that I NOT cook a main course this time, but just make more of this dip as their whole meal!!! Nobody leaves my house without the recipe, and anytime I bring it to a party, I have to email the recipe out afterwards. If you like cheese and bacon, you'll LOVE this!  Serve it with baguette bread, or with 'Scoops', and you'll be the hit of the party!
