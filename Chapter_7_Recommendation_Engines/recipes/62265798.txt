Ingredients:
1 cup rolled oats
1/3 cup margarine or butter
1 cup boiling water
3/4 cup cornmeal
1 T sugar
2 tsp chicken or beef instant bouillon
1/2 cup milk
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
1 egg, beaten
2 cups white or wheat flour

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease cookie sheets.  In large bowl, combine rolled oats, margarine and water; let stand for 10 minutes.
Stir in cornmeal, sugar, bouillon, milk, cheese and egg.  Mix well.
Add flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition to form stiff dough.
On floured surface, knead in remaining flour until dough is smooth and no longer sticky, 3 to 4 minutes.  Roll or pat out dough to 1/2" thickness; cut with cookie cutter.  Place 1 inch apart on cookie sheets.
Bake for 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool completely.  Store loosely covered.  Makes 3 1/2 doze large biscuits.
