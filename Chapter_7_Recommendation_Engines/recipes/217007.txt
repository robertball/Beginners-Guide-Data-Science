Ingredients:
1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced
1/4 cup chopped red onion
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons grapefruit juice
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
1 leaf fresh mint, chopped
1 leaf fresh basil, chopped
2 1/2 cups baby arugula leaves
2 ounces kalamata olives, pitted and halved
2 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved
2 tablespoons freshly shaved Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Place the avocado, red onion, lime juice, grapefruit juice, rice wine vinegar, black pepper, and sea salt in a blender, and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. While the blender is running, drizzle in the olive oil; add honey, cilantro, mint, and basil leaves, and process for a few more seconds to leave the herbs visible as small flecks.
Toss the arugula, kalamata olives, and cherry tomatoes in a salad bowl; sprinkle with shaved Parmesan cheese. Pour vinaigrette over the salad, and toss to serve.

Description: 
This is one of those recipes that takes all of about 10 minutes to prep, but comes off as fancy and sophisticated. Great salad if you want to show off while entertaining guests. For a main meal option add grilled salmon or chicken.
