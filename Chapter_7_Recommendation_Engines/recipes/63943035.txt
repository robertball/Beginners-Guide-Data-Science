Ingredients:
1 pound breakfast sausage (I used low fat); crumbled and cooked with crushed red pepper flakes (if you want it spicy)
1 pound of keilbasa (used turkey); diced into small pieces
2 bell peppers; diced
4-6 large celery stalks, diced
1 onion, diced
5 cups of rice, cooked
cayenne and black pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook and drain the breakfast sausage.  Add a drizzle of olive oil to your pan and cook your veggies for a few minutes.  Remove.  Cook your keilbasa for a few minutes, then add everything to the pan.  Mix together and season with cayenne and black pepper.

My husband is trying to eat out less at lunch time, so we needed something that would make quite a bit and would reheat well.  This definitely fit the bill!
