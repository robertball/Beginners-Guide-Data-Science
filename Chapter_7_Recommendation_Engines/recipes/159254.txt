12 ounces andouille sausage, sliced
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper

1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place the potatoes, sausage, green pepper, and onion into a high-sided roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat. Sprinkle with paprika, Creole seasoning, garlic powder, and black pepper; toss again to coat.
Roast in preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and beginning to turn golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir occasionally during roasting.
