Description: 
These can be made festive by just changing the color M&M;'s for different holidays. Very versitle; the first four ingredients can be varied due to what you have. I've used different types of nuts, omitted the Rice Krispies and used extra Cheerios, and added raisins, all with great results. Do not use chocolate chips though in place of M&M;'s because they will melt and make a mess.
