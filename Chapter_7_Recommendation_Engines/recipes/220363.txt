Ingredients:
1 (7 pound) standing rib roast
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
6 tablespoons red wine
2 cups Swanson® Beef Stock or Swanson® Unsalted Beef Stock
1/4 cup all-purpose flour

Directions:
Heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Season the beef with the black pepper. Place the beef into a roasting pan, rib-side down.
Roast for 2 hours 20 minutes for medium-rare or until desired doneness. Remove the beef to a cutting board and let stand for 20 minutes.
Spoon off any fat from the pan drippings. Stir the wine in the pan and heat over medium-high heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.  Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes.  Pour the wine mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a 2-quart saucepan.
Stir the stock and flour in a medium bowl with a whisk.  Gradually add the stock mixture to the saucepan, stirring with a whisk.  Cook and stir over medium heat for 5 minutes or until the mixture boils and thickens.  Season with additional salt and black pepper, if desired.  Serve the stock mixture with the beef.
