Description: 
When the weather gets hot, we make a big salad for supper several times a week.  This part antipasto, part tuna pasta salad, is my husband’s favorite.  With some crusty bread, it is a meal all in itself.   It is easily adaptable to your family’s preferences.  I sometimes add other kinds of marinated vegetables and/or strips of mozzarella or provolone cheese.
