1 pound Bob Evans® Zesty Hot Roll Sausage
1 pound Bob Evans® Italian Roll Sausage
1 tablespoon oil
1 1/2 cups onion, chopped
3 medium potatoes, diced
8 cups chicken broth
1 bunch kale, chopped
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
12 slices baguette
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese (optional)

Directions:
In large saucepan over medium heat, add oil and onions.  Cook until softened. Crumble and cook sausage until browned and cooked through.  Add potatoes, broth, kale and nutmeg.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and reduce heat to simmer for one hour.
For a creamier texture, some of the soup can be pureed in a blender.  To serve:  brush baguette slices with oil (and parmesan if desired) and broil until toasted.  Place 2 slices in each soup bowl.  Pour soup over bread and serve.
