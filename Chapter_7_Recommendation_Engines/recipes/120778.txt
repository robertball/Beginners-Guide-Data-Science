Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1 1/4 cups quick cooking oats
3/4 cup milk

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the first five ingredients. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in oats and milk just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Roll to 3/4-in. thickness; cut with a floured 2-in. biscuit cutter. Place 1 in. apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until lightly browned. Serve warm.

This recipe has been in the family for generations, and my sister and I make these biscuits often for our families. When I bake them first thing in the morning, the house soon smells delicious.
