Ingredients:
6 very ripe bananas, mashed
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup spiced rum
1/4 cup cognac
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups white sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
2 eggs, lightly beaten
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
3 tablespoons butter
1 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two twelve-cup muffin tins.
In a mixing bowl, mix bananas, 1/2 cup brown sugar, honey, rum, and cognac with an electric mixer until smooth.
In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. In another bowl, cream white sugar, 2/3 cup brown sugar, eggs, and melted butter.  Pour banana mixture and creamed egg mixture into the flour, and stir until just combined. Spoon mixture into muffin tins, filling cups 3/4 full.
In a small bowl, mix together 1 cup brown sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, and cinnamon. Cut in 3 tablespoons butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle over batter in muffin tins.
Bake muffins in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until done.
