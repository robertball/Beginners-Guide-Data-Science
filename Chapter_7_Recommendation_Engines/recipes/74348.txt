Ingredients:
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound boneless pork roast, cubed
1 pound onions, diced
1 pound bananas, peeled and diced

cayenne pepper to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and brown the pork on all sides. Mix in the onions, and cook and stir until tender.
Mix the bananas and tomatoes with juice into the skillet. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until pork is very tender. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.

Description: 
I first had this served over egg noodles, but served with rice is just as nice. This recipe was introduced to me by a Cuban friend when I was seven years old. To this day, (twenty years later), it remains one of my favourites. Don't be frightened by this seemingly strange combination of ingredients; this is brilliant! The nice thing about this recipe is that it doesn't require any measurements. You use an equal amount of each ingredient, so it's infinitely scalable!
