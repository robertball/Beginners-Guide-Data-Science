Ingredients:
- 30 ladyfinger biscuits
- 150 ml (10 tbsp.) orange juice
- 1/2 packet unflavored gelatin
- A little cold water in a smallish bowl
- 60ml (1/4 cup) boiling water
- 400 g (14 oz.) fresh white cheese
- 80 g (1/3 cup) fine granulated sugar
- 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
- 250 ml (1 cup) heavy cream, whipped
- 300 g (10 oz.) raspberries and/or strawberries
- 4 tbsp. raspberry or strawberry jam

Directions:
Quickly dip the ladyfinger biscuits into the orange juice.
Line the bottom and sides of a charlotte mold with the ladyfinger biscuits.
Sprinkle the gelatin over a little cold water. Add the boiling water and dissolve.
In a bowl, mix together the fresh cheese, sugar, vanilla and gelatin.
Gently fold in the whipped cream.
Check over the raspberries (or hull the strawberries)
Pour half of the cheese mixture into the mold.
Top with a layer of orange juice-soaked ladyfingers, then half the berries.
Cover with the remaining cheese mixture.
Garnish with some berries attractively arranged on top of the cheese.
In a small saucepan, dilute the jam with 2 tbsp. hot water; pour over the charlotte.
Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Unmold and serve cold.

Description: 
Quick and simple, but even better if refrigerated overnight. Strawberries can be subbed in place of raspberries, or (better) used as well as the raspberries.
