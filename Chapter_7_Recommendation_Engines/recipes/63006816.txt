Ingredients:
2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2/3 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil (optional substitute 1/4 Cup of Virgin coconut oil)
2 cups whole wheat flour
4 cups unbleached all purpose flour

Directions:
In a large bowl or mixer using the dough hook, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam.
Mix salt and virgin coconut oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. knead the dough for 5 minutes by hand or using the mixer with dough hook. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes (only if you didn't use the mixer with dough hook), and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.
Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.
