Ingredients:
For the "Pasta"
Olive Oil for sauteing
Salt/ Pepper
6 Zucchinis
Sauce
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic, minced
2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
1 cup low-fat (2%) milk
2 tablespoons low-fat cream cheese
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping

Directions:
With a vegetable peeler peel the zucchini into ribbons. Heat the olive oil in a sauce pan on medium heat. Add the zucchini and saute with a little salt and pepper for about 7 minutes until a little soft but still have a crunch. Move the zucchini to a plate and set aside.
For the sauce, melt butter in the same pan and then add the garlic and saute for about one minute.  Add the flour and whisk constantly until light brown, about one minute. Slowly add the milk while whisking. Add the cream cheese. Once the cream cheese is melted then add the parmesan cheese and whisk until well blended.  Pour the sauce over the "pasta" and sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top.

My non-eating zucchini husband loves this dish. It's very low carb and low in calories.  You can feel good eating this.  You can serve as a main dish with a side salad.
