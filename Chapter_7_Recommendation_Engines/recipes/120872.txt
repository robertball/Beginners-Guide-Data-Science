Ingredients:
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)
8 1/2 teaspoons honey, divided
3/4 cup warm milk (110 to 115 degrees F)
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt

Directions:
In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in 2 teaspoons honey; let stand for 5 minutes. Add milk, 2 tablespoons butter, salt and remaining honey; mix well. Add egg and whole wheat flour; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in enough all-purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Knead on a floured surface for 30 seconds. Roll into a 12-in. circle. Melt remaining butter; brush over dough. Combine Parmesan cheese and garlic salt; sprinkle over dough.  Cut into 16 wedges.  Roll up wedges from the wide end and place with pointed end down on greased baking sheets. Curve ends to form a crescent shape. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 20 minutes. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

Description: 
Parmesan cheese and garlic salt give these hearty crescent rolls a scrumptious, savory flavor. Living in wheat country has prompted me to experiment with many whole wheat recipes.
