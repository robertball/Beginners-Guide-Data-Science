Ingredients:
1 pound bacon
1 (24 ounce) bag frozen breaded okra
3 large tomatoes, diced
1 red onion, diced
1 pinch garlic salt to taste
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble into a large bowl.
Heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry okra in the hot oil, turning often, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Add to bacon in the bowl.
Toss tomatoes, red onion, garlic salt, salt, and pepper together in a separate bowl. Stir into the bacon and okra mixture.
