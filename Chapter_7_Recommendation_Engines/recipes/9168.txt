6 sweet potatoes
3/4 cup boiling water
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 tablespoon orange zest
1 tablespoon orange juice
3/4 cup light corn syrup
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 orange slices, halved

Directions:
Pare and halve sweet potatoes.
Combine peel, juice, corn syrup, and brown sugar.
Add sweet potatoes, boiling water, and salt to a large saucepan.  Simmer, covered, until tender; this should take about 15 minutes.  Drain off liquid, leaving 1/4 cup in skillet.  Dot potatoes with butter or margarine.  Pour orange juice mixture over potatoes, and add orange slices.  Cook, uncovered, over low heat until glazed, an additional 15 minutes.  Baste often, and turn once while cooking.
