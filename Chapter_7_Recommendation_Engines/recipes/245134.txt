Ingredients:
1 pint heavy whipping cream
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar (optional)
2 (8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese

1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 cup brewed coffee, cooled
1 tablespoon rum, or more to taste
36 ladyfingers

Directions:
Beat cream and cream of tartar in a bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.
Beat mascarpone cheese in a separate bowl using an electric mixer on low speed; slowly beat in confectioners' sugar until fully incorporated. Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves; beat until well combined. Fold whipped cream into pumpkin mixture.
Mix coffee and rum together in a bowl. Briefly dip each ladyfinger into coffee mixture. Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a trifle bowl or serving dish. Cover layer with about 1/3 of the pumpkin mixture. Continue layering ladyfingers and pumpkin mixture.
