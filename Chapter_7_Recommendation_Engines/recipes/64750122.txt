Ingredients:
3 large, very ripe bananas, peeled, sliced, and frozen
2 tbsps dark cocoa powder (such as Hershey's Special Dark)
3/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
4 tbsps unsweetened almond milk, or as needed
Pinch of salt

Directions:
1. Combine all ingredients in a food processor or high powered blender. Blend until smooth and creamy, making sure to stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender/food processor bowl. If mixture is too crumbly, add more almond milk as needed.
2. Serve immediately as a soft serve, or freeze for about 1-2 hours for a firmer texture.
