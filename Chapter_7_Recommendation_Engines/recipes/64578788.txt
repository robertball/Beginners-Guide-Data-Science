Ingredients:
1 lb Elbow macaroni
2 cups whole milk
12oz can evaporated milk
1/2 tsp salt
2 Tbsp butter
3 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Directions:
1. Add evaporated milk, milk, macaroni, salt, butter and cheese into a large slow cooker. Mix
well.
2. Cook on the lowest setting for about 1 ½­2 hours.
3. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Stir after 30 minutes and check the macaroni after 1 ¼ hours.
Expert Tip: Slow cookers vary so the time it takes for your crockpot to cook the macaroni might be different. The first time we made this, we were using an older crockpot that only had a knob to turn to either high or low. Even on low, the crockpot got way too hot and the milk curdled and the macaroni became mushy. When we switched to a new crockpot with multiple settings and cooked it on the lowest, stirring after 30 minutes and checking on it periodically, we avoided both pitfalls and ended up with creamy, cheesy macaroni!
