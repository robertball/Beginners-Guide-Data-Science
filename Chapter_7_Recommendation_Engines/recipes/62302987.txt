Ingredients:
1 cup of warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
2.25 tsp yeast
3/4 tsp salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
3 cups bread flour
1 tsp vital wheat gluten

Directions:
All all ingredients to your bread machine as directed by the manufacturer.  Select dough cycle.
When complete remove dough to a lightly oiled table.  knead for a few minutes and divide into 12 portions (or whatever fits your liking)  roll dough into balls.  (I do this by cupping my hand over dough with open fingers and letting it roll around while putting just a bit of pressure on the dough.  The oiled table helps the dough form a silky surface)
Place dough balls on parchment lined pans and flatten with your hand until the desired size.  Let rise until doubled.  Bake 350* about 12 minutes or until tops are evenly browned.
