Ingredients:
3 tablespoons butter
1 bulb fennel, diced
2 leeks, white parts only, trimmed and sliced
1 large Spanish onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
6 cups chicken stock
3 large Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and diced into 3/4-inch pieces
2 cups fresh porcini mushrooms
1 teaspoon dried thyme
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1/2 cup cream sherry
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add fennel, leeks, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in chicken stock, potatoes, porcini mushrooms, and thyme. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.
Remove pot from the heat; stir in heavy cream, cream sherry, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth.
Return pot to the heat. Simmer soup until warmed through, about 10 minutes.

Description: 
Porcinis have a deeper, woodsier taste than some other mushrooms. If you can't find them fresh, dried work just as well - just use half as many dried and soak them in water to rehydrate.
