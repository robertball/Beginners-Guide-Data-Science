Ingredients:
1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
1/4 cup sesame oil
1 tablespoon coarse salt

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Toss asparagus and sesame oil together in a bowl until asparagus is completely coated. Season with coarse salt.
Cook asparagus on the preheated grill, turning every 2 minutes, until browned and tender yet still crisp to the bite, about 8 minutes.
