Ingredients:
4 4-ounce chicken breast cutlets (about 1/4" thickness) or 1 pound chicken breast tenders
2 egg whites
2 tablespoons honey mustard or Dijon mustard
1 1/2 cups pretzels, crushed (yields approx. 1 cup)
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
Olive oil cooking spray

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set aside.
In a shallow bowl, whisk egg whites and honey mustard.
In another shallow bowl, mix pretzels, cheese, onion powder, and garlic powder.
Dip a chicken breast in egg mixture.  Then dip the chicken in the pretzel mixture, pressing the coating to help it adhere and making sure both sides get well-coated.  Place on prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining chicken.
Spray tops of chicken lightly with cooking spray.  Bake for 15-18 minutes, until pretzel coating is browned and chicken is thoroughly cooked.  Serve immediately.

Description: 
No oil or butter helps make this a lighter and healthier version of a breaded chicken.  Chicken breast cutlets, or tenders, are dipped in an egg white and honey mustard mixture and then breaded with crushed pretzels.  A little cheese helps the pretzels adhere, and some seasoning rounds out the flavors quite nicely.  Served with a side salad or crudites, Lighter Pretzel-Crusted Chicken is as good, and good for you, as it is easy, and comes in around 200 calories.  Enjoy!
