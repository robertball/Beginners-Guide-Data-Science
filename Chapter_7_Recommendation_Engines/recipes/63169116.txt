Ingredients:
2c all-purpose flour
1/4c granulated sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
¾ tsp salt
1 ½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground cardamom
¼ tsp ground cloves
4 eggs
1 cup milk
6 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
½ cup sour cream
3 tablespoons molasses

Directions:
Heat and oil a waffle iron.
Combine all dry ingredients.
Lightly beat eggs; add milk, butter, sour cream and molasses and whisk to blend.  Stir in dry ingredients and combine until moist, but still slightly lumpy.  Adjust consistency of batter as needed by adding a little more milk or a little more flour.
For extra fluffy waffles, separate eggs and continue as above with egg yolks.  Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold whipped egg whites into waffle batter just until combined.
Cook in heated waffle iron and enjoy!
For pancakes, add milk to thin the batter, if needed, and cook on a hot griddle (325-350 degrees).
Serve with Raspberry-Cranberry Preserves and sour cream or Meyer Lemon Syrup and whipped cream.
