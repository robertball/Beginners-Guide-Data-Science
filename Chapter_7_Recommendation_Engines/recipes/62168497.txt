Ingredients:
1 lb bacon, diced tiny
1 large onion, diced tiny
2 tbsp dry mustard
¼ tsp nutmeg
½ c sour cream
1 c shredded mozzarella
1 tbsp mayonnaise
3 cans of croissants (This recipe uses 2 cans and a little bit of a 3rd, you will have leftover croissants.)

Directions:
Cook bacon, onion, dry mustard, and nutmeg in a skillet on medium low until caramelized, about 20-30 minutes.  Once it’s caramelized, squish the bacon mixture to one side in the pan and set the pan at an angle so the grease drains to the bottom.  Let it cool for 5-10 minutes.
Once the bacon mixture is cool, combine it, the sour cream, mozzarella, and mayonnaise in a large bowl and mix together.  The consistency should be thick like a paste.
Preheat the oven to 350.
Open the first can of croissants (keep the others in the fridge until you are ready to open them) and separate each triangle.  Use a pizza cutter to cut each triangle into five strips by cutting it three times across diagonally, and then cutting the two longer strips in half.
Take about a teaspoon of the filling and wrap a croissant strip around it (you CAN stretch them).  It doesn’t matter if the filling is poking out of the bottom.  Line them up in a baking tray and squish the tops flat so they stay upright.
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.  This recipe makes about 2 ½ baking trays worth of tarts.  If you’re making them the night before, just take them out of the fridge one hour before serving so they can come to room temperature.
