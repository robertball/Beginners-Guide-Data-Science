Ingredients:
1 cup dried unsweetened shredded coconut (use less if needed to meet your dietary needs)
water to make 5 cups of coconut milk
Sweetener (optional.  If using, add a dash of salt as well.)

Directions:
Grind the coconut in your blender or spice grinder until fairly finely ground.  (I love this coffee grinder.  I think you get a better grind in this than in the blender.)
Add 1 cup of water to the ground coconut in a high powered blender (like Vitamix) and blend on high for 1 minute.
Add water to make 5 cups of coconut milk.  Blend on high for 3 minutes.
Enjoy and store in the refrigerator.
