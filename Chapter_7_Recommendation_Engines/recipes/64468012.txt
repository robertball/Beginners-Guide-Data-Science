Ingredients:
6-8 Cups Berry Kix (Or any colorful cereal of your choice)
1 Cup Fresh Blueberries
14-16 oz Mini Marshmallows (1 bag)
4 oz of butter (1/2 stick)
1 Cup Unsweetened Coconut Flakes (finely grated)

Directions:
You will need: 1 Large Microwave-safe Bowl; Non-stick Spray or butter for your hands; Stirring Implement that you coat with butter or non-stick spray; Large Resealable Bag; Wax Paper or Parchment; Large Cookie Sheet.
Line the Cookie Sheet with Wax paper/parchment and have it somewhere easily accessible. Coat stirring implement so it doesn't get overly sticky. It's important to have everything ready before you start because your hands will get very messy!
Melt the Butter in a large Microwave safe bowl, approx. 45 seconds (stir after 30 seconds).
Toss in the marshmallows until they are coated and then microwave again for 30 second intervals until no longer solid. Note: You must stir every 30 seconds to avoid exploding hot goo!
Add Cereal and Blueberries and stir with coated implement!
Now coat your hands and get ready to roll!
Scoop up mixture and roll into evenly-sized balls (Dinomite likes them to be about 2 bites each but that's entirely relative to the size of your mouth).
Place 1 ball at a time into the bag of Coconut and "SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE"!!!!
Place the Fluffy Bite onto your lined Cookie sheet and repeat until all of your Bites are covered in Coconut Fluffiness!
Warning: These Fluffy Bites may cause an abnosome party in your tummy!
