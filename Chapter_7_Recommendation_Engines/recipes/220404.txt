1/4 cup olive oil
1 onion, chopped
1 small garlic clove, crushed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
6 (6 ounce) lobster tails, thawed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until lightly browned, about 8 minutes.
Stir parsley and lobster tails into onion and garlic; cook until shells turn bright red, 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, basil, salt, and black pepper with lobster tails; simmer over low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Remove lobster tails from sauce and shake excess sauce off the shells. If desired, remove lobster meat from shells and stir into sauce or serve lobster pieces separately.
