Description: 
Stuffed peppers without the work of carving out the peppers, stuffing them, trying to get them to stay upright, etc.?? Sounds great to me! That is exactly what this recipe gives you. The taste is that of a stuffed pepper, but the work is that of an easy casserole. Plus, the leftovers store and reheat a lot easier this way!
