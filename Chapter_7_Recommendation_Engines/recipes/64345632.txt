Ingredients:
1 small (Whole) Chicken
Carrots
Celery
Green Onion or Parsley (optional)
Chicken Stock
Chicken Bouillon cubes
Egg noodles

Directions:
Place the Chicken in a large pot or slow cooker, add Chicken stock, six bouillon cubes and water until Chicken is covered. Set heat on high until Chicken is fully cooked. *Note* I do not take out the innards of the bird until it is fully cooked and the meat is ready to be separated from the bones. Also, I usually cook the chicken for approximately 2-2 1/2 hours or until the chicken is falling off the bone(s).
Dice carrots and celery and place in a large bowel, set aside.
After the chicken has cooked and you have separated the chicken from the bones, place the separated chicken back in the pot/slow cooker. Add carrots and celery to the pot and six more bouillon cubes. The soup should be ready in about an hour.
I will sometimes add green onion to my soup about a half hour before the soup is ready to eat and I cook my egg noodles separately so that they do not become mushy.
