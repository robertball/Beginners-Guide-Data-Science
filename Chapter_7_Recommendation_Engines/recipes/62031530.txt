Ingredients:
6 8" flour tortillas
14oz can refried beans
3oz can mild diced green chilies
2 tablespoons dried cilantro
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

dash cayenne pepper
1 green pepper, finely diced
12 black olives, chopped
3 medium tomatoes, finely chopped
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup shredded cheddar
1/4 cup cornmeal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Using a pizza cutter, cut each flour tortilla in half.
In a small bowl, combine refried beans with chilies, cilantro, honey, cumin, chili powder, black pepper, onion powder and cayenne pepper.
Spread bean mixture evenly on one side of each tortilla semi-circle.  Continue topping each semi-circle with green pepper, olives, tomatoes, and lastly the Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses.
Lightly press the toppings into the bean mixture and carefully fold each semi-circle in half.
Scatter cornmeal on 2 cookie sheets and arrange quesadillas on top.  Bake for 20 minutes until edges start to brown.  Serve immediately with guacamole and sour cream (optional).
