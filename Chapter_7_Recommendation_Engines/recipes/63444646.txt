20 fl oz diced frozen butternut squash
2T pignoli
1c roasted salted shelled pumpkin seeds
olive oiil
black pepper

Directions:
Coat a large pan in olive oil and allow to pool.  Put on medium heat and wait for olive oil to warm.
Add the pignoli, with additional olive oil if needed.  Make sure there is excess olive oil.
Allow the pignoli to cook until golden brown on one side.  Add the squash and pumpkin seeds.  Add additional olive oil if needed, keeping in mind that the thawing squash will produce liquid.
Once the squash has thawed & warmed, add the gnocchi and more olive oil if needed.
Add carrot greens liberally, to taste.  Add marjoram, thyme, black pepper, and basil to taste.  Add rosemary and parsley, sparingly.  Remove from heat when everything is hot.
