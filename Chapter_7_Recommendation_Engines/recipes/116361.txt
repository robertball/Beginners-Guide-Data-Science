Ingredients:
1/4 cup olive or vegetable oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary, crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloin
2 medium red potatoes, cut into chunks

Directions:
In a bowl, combine the oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. Place half of the marinade in each of two resealable plastic bags. Add pork to one bag and potatoes to the other bag. Seal bags and turn to coat; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain and discard marinades. Place meat and potatoes in a greased 11-in. x 7-in. x 2-in. baking dish. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F for 20-25 minutes or until potatoes are almost tender. Broil 5 in. from heat for 4-5 minutes or until potatoes are tender and a meat thermometer inserted into the pork reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before slicing.
