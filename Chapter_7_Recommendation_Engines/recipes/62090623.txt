Ingredients:
1/3 cup dijon mustard
1/4 cup liquid honey
3 cloves garlic, crushed, and finely chopped (if the garlic is crushed first, there is more flavor)
1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp curry powder (can be reduced to 1/2 for first time curry eaters)
salt and pepper to taste
3 medium sized boneless, skiness chicken breasts
1/4 cup water

Directions:
Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl, except water.
Place chicken in a casserole dish, and cover with marinade.
Place in middle rack of oven, and bake at 375 for 20-30 mins (depending on ovens)
About 15 mins into cooking time, add water. This ensures that chicken stays moist. It can be left out, but it does thin out the marinade, and mosten the chicken.

Description: 
I found this recipe on a website when I first started University. It is cheap to make, and very, very good. People ask me for it all the time. I have played with spices, and cooking methods - I find that this is the best way. In five years, I have never had a dinner party without it! I make it so often, I can do it with my eyes closed. I serve with couscous.
