https://images.media-allrecipes.com/images/79590.png
Ingredients:
1 Cup Whole Milk
6 slices White Bread
2 lbs Ground Beef
1 CUP Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1 tsp Salt
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 CUP Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
4 Eggs, Beaten
12 slices Thin/regular Bacon
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
Sauce:
1-1/2 CUP Ketchup
1/3 CUP Brown Sugar
1 tsp Dry Mustard
1 tsp Tabasco sauce

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
3. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
4. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain. (Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!)
5. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
MAKE THE SAUCE:
6. Add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together. Pour 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the bacon. Spread with a spoon.
7.Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes. Slice and serve with remaining sauce.
8. Enjoy!
