Ingredients:
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 honey
1/4 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp olive oil
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup (old fashioned) oatmeal

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350.
Mix wet ingredients in a medium bowl together and whisk.
Mix dry ingredients in a stand mixer with paddle attachment. Slowly pour in wet ingredients and mix well.
Remove dough to floured surface and roll out to 1/4" thick. Cut with cookie cutters, or use rim of shot glass or glass cup.
Bake 12-13 minutes, checking the bottoms to make sure they don't burn.
Allow to cool completely.
(I use the rim of a drinking glass  that is only about 2.5" in diameter. Depending on the size of your cookies, you may get more or less than the 40 servings)
