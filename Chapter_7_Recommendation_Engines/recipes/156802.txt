Ingredients:
2 quarts eggnog, chilled
3 cups cold coffee
2 cups bourbon whiskey (optional)
2 cups chilled heavy cream
2 pints coffee ice cream
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, for garnish

Directions:
Whisk together eggnog, coffee, and whiskey in a punch bowl until well blended.
Whip the cream in a large mixing bowl until it forms soft peaks.  Lightly fold the whipped cream into the eggnog mixture.
Float scoops of coffee ice cream in the eggnog.  Sprinkle with nutmeg to serve.

Description: 
Every Christmas, as soon as I put this out, everyone rushes around the punch bowl like a pack of wild animals! It wouldn't be Christmas without it. I usually make a non-alcoholic batch for the non-drinkers.
