Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1 cup shredded zucchini
1 cup shredded carrot
orange, zested
lemon, zested
1/2 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon; set aside.
Combine the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Stir in the brown sugar. Add the zucchini, carrots, and orange and lemon zests.
Stir the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Fold in the walnuts.
Pour batter into prepared loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 to 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool loaf in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
