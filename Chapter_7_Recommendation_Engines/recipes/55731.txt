Ingredients:
1 pound mushrooms (chanterelles, shiitakes, and/or common)
1 (8 ounce) onion
1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed beef consomme
1 cup dry sherry
2 cups chopped cauliflower

Directions:
Rinse mushrooms well; drain. Trim off and discard tough and discolored stem ends, debris, and bruises. Chop mushrooms. Peel and chop onion.
In a 3- to 4-quart pan over high heat, stir mushrooms, onion, and butter often until mushrooms begin to brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
Add flour and mix well.
Remove from heat and stir consomme, sherry, and 1 cup water into pan. Add cauliflower. Return to high heat and bring to a boil; cover pan and simmer until cauliflower is tender when pierced, about 5 minutes.
In a blender, puree soup, a portion at a time, until smooth. Return to pan and stir over high heat until steaming. Ladle into soup bowls.
