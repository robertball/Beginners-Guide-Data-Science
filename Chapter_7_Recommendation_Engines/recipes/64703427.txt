Ingredients:
3 Tbls kosher salt
2 Tsp ground cayanne pepper
1 Tsp fresh ground pepper

1 lemon sliced in quarters

Directions:
Combine ingredients with large stockpot of water on high heat.
Bring to boil.
Add crabs and cook for approximately 4-5 minutes until bright orange/red
Remove crabs with skimmer/tongs and let cool.
Stir together butter and hot sauce; serve on the side with corncobs (opt)
serve with quartered lemon slices
