Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
2 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon orange extract
1 teaspoon orange zest
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup granulated sugar for decoration
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
in a medium bowl, cream sugar and butter until fluffy. Add egg yolks, vanilla, orange extract, and orange zest. Cream well. Sift together the flour, cornmeal, and salt, and stir into the creamed mixture. Refrigerate dough until firm. For refrigerator cookies, roll dough into logs before refrigerating.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Roll out cookie dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out cookies with a cookie cutter and place on ungreased cookie sheets.  For refrigerator cookies, slice logs into 1/4 inch slices.  Sprinkle cookies with sugar and ground nutmeg.  Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Edges should be golden brown. Remove cookies from pan to cool on a wire rack.
