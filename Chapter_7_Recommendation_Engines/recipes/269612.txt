Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 flounder fillets
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoons white wine
3 tablespoons seasoned bread crumbs
1 pinch paprika, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
Rinse flounder fillets, pat dry, and place on the baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk butter and wine together in a bowl; pour over flounder. Sprinkle each fillet with bread crumbs and then paprika.
Bake in the preheated oven until flounder flakes easily with a fork, 25 to 30 minutes.

Description: 
This is a great recipe for a night when you're feeling lazy - only a few ingredients, nothing to chop, easy cleanup, and very yummy! My husband announced the fish was 'excellent,' and he's not usually one to rave about food.
