Ingredients:
1 cup milk
4 eggs
2/3 cup white sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/8 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 slices bread

Directions:
Beat together milk, eggs, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
Heat a lightly buttered skillet or griddle over medium heat.
Dip each slice of bread into egg mixture until well soaked, about 20 seconds per side.  Place in pan, and cook on both sides until they are no longer gooey or shiny in the middle when cut in half, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
NOTE: If you have trouble with cocoa remaining lumpy, put into blender for a few seconds!
