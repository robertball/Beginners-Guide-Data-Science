Ingredients:
1 butternut squash, cubed
2 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup maple syrup
2 tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add squash and boil until almost tender yet still firm, 5 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Stir in maple syrup and brown sugar and cook until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes.
Drain semi-cooked squash and place on a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil and brush with some of the maple glaze; reserve remaining glaze. Fold up foil to close.
Cook on the preheated grill until squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes, brushing with remaining glaze occasionally and flipping halfway through cooking time.
