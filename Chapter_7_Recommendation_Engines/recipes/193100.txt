Ingredients:
3 heads butterleaf lettuce, leaves separated and 6 large outer leaves reserved for use as cups
2 heads radicchio, cut into julienne strips
3 vine-ripened tomatoes, cored and cut into quarters
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
1 (4 ounce) log goat cheese, crumbled
1/3 cup Newman's Own® Lighten Up® Balsamic Vinaigrette or Lighten Up Raspberry & Walnut Salad Dressing

Directions:
Wash and dry butterleaf lettuce.  Save six large leaves for 'cups' and tear the remainder into bite-size pieces. In a large salad bowl, combine the torn lettuce, radicchio, tomatoes, onion, and goat cheese. Add the dressing, beginning with 1/3 cup and using up to 1/2 cup if you like, and toss.
To serve, place a lettuce cup on each salad plate, then fill with tossed salad.  Garnish with cut tomatoes and goat cheese.
