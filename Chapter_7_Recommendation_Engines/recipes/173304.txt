Ingredients:
Dough:
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup mashed potato
1 teaspoon lemon extract
3 tablespoons butter OR margarine
2 eggs
1 teaspoon salt
3 cups bread flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon lemon peel
2 teaspoons Fleischmann's® Bread Machine OR RapidRise Yeast
Glaze:
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup whipping cream
1 teaspoon rum extract
1 tablespoon macadamia nut liqueur (optional)
1 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots

Directions:
Add dough ingredients to bread machine pan in the order suggested by manufacturer. Select dough/manual cycle.  If not using a bread machine, combine dough ingredients in the following manner:  stir together all dry ingredients  (including undissolved yeast), then add remaining ingredients for dough using a mixer.  Mix until a soft dough is formed.  Turn dough out on lightly floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.  Cover with a towel and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine glaze ingredients in medium bowl. Stir to blend. Pour 1/3 of glaze on bottom of greased 12-cup tube pan.*
When bread machine cycle is complete, transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Divide into 36 equal pieces; roll each piece into a smooth ball. Arrange balls in 3 layers in prepared pan; pour remaining glaze in between layers. Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 40 to 45 minutes or until done. Cool in pan on wire rack 5 minutes; invert onto serving tray. Serve warm.
