Ingredients:
Salad:
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1 medium head napa cabbage, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces

3 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup sunflower seeds
1/4 cup sesame seeds
Dressing:
1/2 cup white sugar
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Toast sliced almonds on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes.
Mix toasted almonds, napa cabbage, ramen noodles with seasoning packet, green onions, mayonnaise, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds together in a large bowl. Refrigerate if not serving immediately.
Mix sugar, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and soy sauce together in a separate bowl to make dressing. Pour over the salad just before serving.

Description: 
My sister introduced us to this delicious salad, made with napa cabbage, ramen noodles, and a special dressing. Napa cabbage gives it a firm, crisp texture that is essential. Any flavor of ramen is good--I prefer the chicken or Oriental.
