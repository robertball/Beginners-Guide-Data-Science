Ingredients:
3 cups prepared tomatoes (about 2 1/4 pounds)
1 1/2 tsp grated lemon rind
1/2 tsp ground allspice
1/2 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon (depending on taste)
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1/4 cup lemon juice
4 1/2 cups sugar
1 box powdered pectin

Directions:
Sterilize canning jars.
Wash firm, ripe tomatoes.
Scald, peel, and chop tomatoes.
Cover and simmer 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
Measure 3 cups of the prepared tomatoes into a saucepot.
Add lemon rind and spices.
Place prepared tomatoes into a saucepot and add lemon juice.
Measure sugar and set aside.
Stir pectin into prepared tomatoes.
Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly.
At once, stir in sugar.
Stir and bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down. Then boil hard for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Remove from heat and skim off any foam.
Pour hot soft spread into hot jars. Leave 1/2 inch head space.  Wipe jar rims and adjust lids.  Process 5 minutes in a boiling water bath. Remove from boiling water bath.  Allow to sit overnight to cool.
Check seal by pressing on center of lid.  If it "clicks" it is not sealed and should be refrigerated and used immediately.
Sealed jars can be stored at room temperature until opened.

Description: 
Cinnamon, allspice and cloves make this tomato jam more like a butter than a jam. I actually won a blue ribbon at the Indiana State Fair with this recipe several years ago! My husband enjoyed this often as a child.  I had never heard of it before marrying him. Using firm, meaty tomatoes will yield a thicker jam.
