Ingredients:
1/2 lb puff pastry (1 sheet store bought)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 clove garlic cloves, crushed
3 tablespoons dried herbes de Provence
1 egg, beaten
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 400F.
Roll the pastry dough into a large rectangle, about 15-inches by 12-inches. Using a mortar and pestle, crush the garlic glove into a smooth paste. Mix the garlic paste and olive oil together in a small bowl. Using a pastry brush or spoon, spread the garlic oil in a thin, even layer over the dough. Sprinkle the oiled surface with the herbes de Provence.
Starting at the long ends of the rectangle, loosely roll each side inward until they meet in the middle. To hold difficult pastry together, brush it with the egg, if needed.
Slice the pastry crosswise into 1/4-inch palmiers – they’ll look like little scrolls - and arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle them with the ground black pepper and bake them for 12-15 minutes, until they puff and turn golden brown. Remove them from the baking sheet and serve warm or at room temperature.
