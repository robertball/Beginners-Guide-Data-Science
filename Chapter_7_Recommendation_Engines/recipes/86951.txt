Description: 
This recipe is a great way to use up a can of garbanzo beans or those last few spoonfuls of tomato sauce! It's also very versatile so you can add different spices and vegetables as the mood strikes! You can also experiment with different vinegars and beans in the recipe. Can be served immediately or refrigerated overnight to allow flavors to combine and the vegetables to marinate in the liquid. Pasta sauce may be used instead of tomato sauce.
