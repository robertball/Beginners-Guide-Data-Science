Description: 
After many years of experimenting, I developed this recipe for corn bread. It has become a favorite with my family and often accompanies our meals of chili, soup or meat dishes. You can adjust the 'heat' by the number of jalapeno peppers you use.                                           --Archie Timmons                                                               Milwaukie, Oregon
