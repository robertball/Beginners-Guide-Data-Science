Ingredients:
2 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 can (15 ounces) whole stewed or crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon celery seeds
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped
1 cup vegetable broth

Directions:
Combine ingredients, minus veg broth, add to a gallon Ziploc bag. Freeze.
When ready to prepare – thaw enough to get out of the bag, add veg broth and cook on LOW for 6 to 8 hours or on HIGH for 3 to 4 hours.
**This was a bit on the “italian flavor” side, so I would add your spices to taste. I will NOT add the basil, next time.**
