Ingredients:
Stock Pot Boil:
3 or 4 pounds pork spare ribs, cut into sections every 3 ribs.
6 garlic cloves
1/2 onion cut into 2 chunks
10 black pepper corns
Dry Rub Mix:
1/2 teaspoon each:
Smoked Paprika Powder
Ginger Powder
Garlic Powder
Black Pepper, Ground
1/4 tsp. Cumin Powder
Chipotle Baste Sauce:
3 Chipotle Chiles, smashed with their juices.
1/4 cup Molasses
1/4 cup Honey
1/2 cup Ketchup
1/8  cup Onion, minced.
2 Garlic Cloves, minced.

Directions:
BOIL:
In a very large pot, add the pieces of pork ribs.  Add 6 garlic cloves, 1/2 onion,  and 10 black pepper corns.  Fill pot with enough water to just cover the ribs.  Once brought to a to a boil,  reduce heat to medium low and place lid on pot.  Boil for 1 hour.
PREP:
While boiling, add the dry rub ingredients to a small bowl.
In another bowl, stir together the basting mixture ingredients.
In a large 13 x 20" glass baking dish or baking sheet, line the bottom with baking paper or oil.
DRY RUB:
Remove ribs sections from pot, drip a moment before laying onto the baking dish or sheet.
Coat both sides of ribs with the dry rub, working it into the pork to ensure they are completely covered.
OPTIONAL: Cover ribs plastic wrap or lid and marinate overnight in the fridge.
BASTE:
Gently spoon chipotle mix onto both sides of the ribs.
Arrange evenly onto baking dish or tray.
Bake the under side (meatless side) of ribs first for 15 minutes.
Gently turn over and rebaste the top rounded side of the ribs with the chipotle sauce and any sauce from the bottom of the pan.  Continue to bake another 25 minutes, or longer if a crust is desired on the ribs.
