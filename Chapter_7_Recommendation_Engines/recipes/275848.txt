Ingredients:
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 (3.5 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, sliced
1 (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced
1 small onion, diced
2 cups vodka marinara sauce
1 teaspoon ground thyme
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 (16 ounce) package fresh gnocchi
1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

Directions:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sausage and set aside, leaving residual oil in the pan.
Add mushrooms, onion, and remaining olive oil to the same skillet. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until cooked down, about 15 minutes. Return sausage to the skillet; add vodka sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper and allow sauce flavors to meld, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and season with salt and pepper.
Serve cooked gnocchi with sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
