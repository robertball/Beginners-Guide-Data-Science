Ingredients:
-1 white or golden cake mix
-1 package of jello lemon pie filling
-icing sugar to taste (optional)

Directions:
1. Make cake mix as per box directions, pour into cupcake tins, bake and cool.
2. Using a small paring knife, cut out a round "well" in the top of each cupcake (about 1" wide). Make sure not to cut a hole in the bottom! Keep the tops because you will need them!
3. Make lemon pie filling mix as directed. Leave it in the pot for a little bit longer, so it sets just slightly.
4. Pour lemon filling into center of cupcakes, replacing the tops. Allow lemon mix to cool and harden.
5. Sprinkle a little bit of icing sugar over the cupcakes to make them look prettier! (optional)

Easy and deliciously lemony!! When my mom came up with these, we couldn't get enough! My boyfriend has me make them at least once a month. They are so addictive and will be gone in a flash!
