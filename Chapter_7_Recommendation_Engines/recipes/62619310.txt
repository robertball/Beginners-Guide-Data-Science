Ingredients:
3 cloves garlic minced
1/4 teaspoon cilantro root grated
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large bay leaf
1 bunch of cilantro
1 stem of parsley
1 cup wine
1 tablespoon white vinegar
2 pounds pork loin cut into 1 inch cubes
4 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion cut into chunks
2 dozen littleneck clams in shells, scrubbed

Directions:
Grind together the garlic, salt, paprika, cilantro root and olive oil to make a thick paste
Knead the paste into the pork with (I do it by hand)
Pour the wine over the pork and mix (This will clean your hands a bit), add vinegar, bay leaf, half of the cilantro sprigs, parsley sprig and salt and pepper
Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours turning the pork at least 3 times to ensure even coating
Remove marinated pork and dry with paper towels, reserving the marinade, but discarding the parsley and coriander stems
Heat 4 tablespoons of oil and brown the pork, add the onion and cook for a couple minutes, turning the pork once or twice, add back marinade and simmer for 10 minutes, adding more wine if necessary
Increase heat to medium high and add clams, cover until clams open 7 to 10 minutes
Serve immediately garnished with cilantro leaves

Description: 
I fell in love with this at Pinnochio's in Lisbon... and it translates well into the American kitchen.  Astounding flavors that are well worth the overnight marinade.
