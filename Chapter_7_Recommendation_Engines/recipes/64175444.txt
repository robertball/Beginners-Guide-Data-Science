Ingredients:
Olive Oil Spray (Pure Olive Oil)
4 scallions (or green onions), minced
2 carrots, shredded
1/2 red bell pepper, minced
11 eggs
1/2 tsp basil
1/4 cup shredded cheese (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Coat a 12-muffin tin with a small amount of olive oil spray to prevent sticking.
Combine vegetables in a big bowl. Fill each muffin tin 2/3 full with vegetables.
Whisk eggs and seasonings in a large mixing bowl.
Use a 1/3-measuring cup for the egg mixture and pour slowly into each muffin tin. Egg mixture should fill tin the rest of the way.
Top each cup with a sprinkle of cheese.
Bake for 30 minutes or until muffins have risen and are slightly browned.
Serve or keep in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
