Ingredients:
1/2 cup butter
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 large onion, diced
8 ounces fresh morel mushrooms, sliced
1 tablespoon chicken soup base
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 cups water
2 cups heavy cream
1/8 teaspoon ground dried thyme
salt to taste
2 teaspoons ground black pepper

Directions:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and morels; cook, stirring frequently, until the onions have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken soup base and flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in water and cream; bring to a simmer, and cook 5 minutes.
Puree half of the soup in small batches, filling the blender no more than halfway full each time. Return soup puree to pot. Cook on low 10 to 15 minutes. Season with thyme and salt and pepper before serving.

Description: 
If you are a fan of fresh (or even dried) morel mushrooms, this is the soup for you. Everyone who eats morels knows that they go best sauteed with onions, garlic and butter. This incorporates all of those ingredients to create a magnificently creamy soup, strong with morel flavor, but not too overpowering. This isn't healthy eating, and I don't recommend trying to make it that way. Just eat less of it! Serve with crusty bread or garlic croutons.
