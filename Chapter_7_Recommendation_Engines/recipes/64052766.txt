Ingredients:
1 large butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 3 pounds or 8 cups, cubed)
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Dash cayenne, optional

Directions:
Prepare Squash: Heat oven to 425ยบ F and line two large baking sheets with aluminum foil.  Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.
Toss squash cubes with olive oil, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt and the cayenne until well coated. Tumble coated squash onto baking sheets and spread into one layer. Try not to crowd them too much or else they will not brown.
Roast Squash: Roast squash, turning once and rotating pans once, until edges are lightly browned and centers are tender; 40 to 45 minutes. (Since ovens can often run hotter than you have heated them to, check the squash every so often to make sure they are not roasting quicker than expected).
