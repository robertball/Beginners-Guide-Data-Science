Ingredients:
•    1 cup of gluten-free all-purpose
•    1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
•    1 teaspoon of baking powder
•    1 tsp apple cider vinegar
•    pinch of salt
•    1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice
•    ½ cup coconut sugar
•    1 cup of almond milk
•    1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
•    1/2 cup of pumpkin puree
•    ¼ cup olive oil
Pumpkin Spice Icing:
•    2 cup powdered sugar
•    2 tablespoons milk of choice
•    1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice
•    2 tablespoons Maple syrup

Directions:
1.    Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease donut pan with coconut oil.
2.    In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.
3.    Stir in the milk, coconut sugar, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and pumpkin puree. Stir until well combined.
4.    Using a Ziplock bag as a pipeline tool, pour in your batter into your pan. If the batter is looking a little uneven, you can carefully shake it to avoid having a bumpy donut.
5.    Bake for 18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the donuts comes out clean. Let cool for 15 minutes before removing them from the pan.
Icing:
6.    Pour icing sugar, maple syrup, pumpkin spice, and milk and whisk together until smooth.
7.    Once donuts have cooled, dip away!
8.  	Refrigerate.

Description: 
PSL season is in full force right now, and it seems to be everywhere. But most pumpkin spice products are full of artificial flavoring and mostly just sugar. I made these because I do enjoy the pumpkin spice, but I really dislike the artificial flavorings that are added. These donuts are light and airy, are super healthy, and are enjoyable with or without the icing.
