Ingredients:
3 Eggs
2 cups Sugar
1 cup Oil
1 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 tsp Lemon Extract
Zest of one Lemon
3 cups Flour
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Baking Soda
1/4 tsp Baking Powder
2 cups Grated Zucchini

Directions:
Mix the eggs, sugar, oil, extracts, and zest. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Add this to the egg mixture. When it gets difficult to stir add the zucchini.
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour in greased and sugared loaf pans. Allow to cool in the pans for 10 minutes then remove from pans and place on a rack to cool. Slice and serve. *Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.*

Description: 
This is THE BEST lemon zucchini bread I've ever baked or tasted. The recipe came from a friend of my mom's. She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!!
