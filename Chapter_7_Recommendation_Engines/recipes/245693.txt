Ingredients:
2 eggs
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup ice water
3 tablespoons ice water
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 cups oil for frying
1 sweet potato, scrubbed and sliced into 1/8-inch slices
Dipping Sauce:
1/4 cup rice wine
1/4 cup soy sauce

Directions:
Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy. Stir in salt, 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons ice water, and 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon flour until just incorporated but batter is still very lumpy.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Dry sweet potato slices well. Dip 3 slices at a time in the batter, letting excess batter drip back into the bowl. Fry until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Lift out with a slotted spoon onto a cooling rack set over paper towels. Repeat with remaining slices.
Whisk rice wine and soy sauce together in a small bowl to make dipping sauce.
