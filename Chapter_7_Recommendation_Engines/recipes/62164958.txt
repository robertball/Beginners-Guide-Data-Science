Ingredients:
1 lb ground beef
1 onion
2 TBLS butter
6 slices dark rye bread
3 slices swiss cheese
3 slices american cheese
6 dashes of salt
6 dashes of pepper

Directions:
Preheat grill to medium heat.
Pat out 3 1/3 lb hamburger patties, press the middle of the patty down with your index and middle finger so that you will get a nice flat burger instead of a ball. Season each side of burgers with a dash of salt and pepper. Grill to desired doneness.
Meanwhile, on low heat, melt butter in a sauce pan. Slice onion and add to butter. Sautee onion on medium low until tender.
When burgers are done, lay out three slices of dark rye bread on the grill. Lay 1 slice of american cheese on each bread slice. Place a hamburger patty on each, followed by the sauteed onions and swiss cheese. Lastly place the remaining 3 slices of dark rye bread on the sandwiches and flip the sandwiches over to grill the top of the sandwiches. Grill until cheese mellts, about 1 minute.
