Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon chile powder
2  onions, diced
3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup basmati rice, rinsed
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
1 ½ teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon dried cilantro
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ cup frozen peas

Directions:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
Mix vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons garlic, paprika, 1 tablespoon cumin, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and chile powder in a large bowl. Add onions and chicken; stir to coat.
Transfer chicken mixture to a casserole dish.
Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
Combine chicken broth, basmati rice, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
Bring a small pot of water to a boil; add frozen peas. Cook and stir until bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir peas into the rice. Serve rice alongside chicken.
