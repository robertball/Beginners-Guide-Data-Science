Ingredients:
Pumpkin Cake:
2 cups white sugar
1 cup butter, at room temperature
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups canned pumpkin
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
Tres Leches:
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup half-and-half
1 cup sweetened condensed milk
Topping:
2 cups whipped topping
1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch rectangular baking pan.
Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Add eggs one at a time. Add pumpkin, sour cream, and vanilla extract to the batter while still mixing.
Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger in a bowl. Add 1/2 of the mixture to the pumpkin batter and mix until well combined. Add remaining flour mixture to the batter and mix on medium-high speed for 2 minutes more. Pour batter into the prepared baking pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine evaporated milk, half-and-half, and sweetened condensed milk in a bowl. Set tres leches aside.
Remove cake from the oven and let cool 15 to 20 minutes. Poke a generous amount of holes in the cake using a drinking straw, making sure to get the corners and sides as well. Pour tres leches mixture on the cake, cover with plastic wrap, and cool in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.
Before serving, add whipped topping to the cake and sprinkle cinnamon on top.

Description: 
My birthday is at the end of October and this is my absolute favorite birthday cake. It is not soupy but extremely moist and delicious. I poke the holes with a straw, my daughter uses a pencil. Both work well. Make it the day before, so it can absorb the three milks.
