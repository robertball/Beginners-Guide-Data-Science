Ingredients:
2 Cups Dry Pinto Beans (rinsed not soaked)
1 Large Onion chopped
4 cloves of garlic minced
1 Jalape√±o minced (Leave seeds and veins if you like hot beans)
2 tsp Tomato Bullion (chicken would work as well)
2 tsp Vegatable bullion
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp chilli powder
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 cup salsa of choice (can be left out and beans will still be very good)
Cilantro to taste (We like Cilantro and add about 1/2 cup roughly chopped)
4 Cups water

Directions:
Here is the best part.  Place all ingredients in the instant pot and stir well.  Set Instant pot to 45 min using the Bean/Chili setting.  Let fully natural release.  That is it.  To turn them in to refried beans pull the beans out and use a hand mixer to blend the beans and some of the broth to create the consistency you want.
