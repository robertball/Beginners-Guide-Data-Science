Ingredients:
salt to taste
3/4 pounds beef, top round steak (about 3/4 inch thick), well trimmed
peppercorns, black freshly ground, to taste
1 spray(s) cooking spray to coat skillet
1/2 teaspoon oil, olive, extra-virgin
1/2 large pepper(s), green, bell thinly sliced
1/2 medium onion(s) thinly sliced
1/2 clove(s) garlic minced
3 ounce(s) peas, snow strings removed, thinly sliced
1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, less sodium

Directions:
Season steak with salt and black pepper. Lightly coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook for 4 minutes per side for medium-rare; remove from heat. Transfer steak to a cutting board and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing.
Meanwhile, in the same pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper, onion, and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Add peas and 2 tablespoons of water. Cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Uncover, add soy sauce, and cook 30 seconds longer. Add sliced steak to pan and toss briefly, just to heat through. Serve warm.
