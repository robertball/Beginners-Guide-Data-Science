Ingredients:
½ cup ketchup
½ cup mustard
2 cups chocolate flavored crispy rice cereal
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x9 inch baking dish with nonstick spray.
In a shallow bowl, mix together the ketchup and mustard. Place the cereal in a separate bowl. Dip chicken breasts in the ketchup mixture, then into the cereal until heavily coated. Place into the prepared baking dish.
Bake uncovered for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is cooked through. The internal temperature of the chicken should be at 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) when taken with a meat thermometer.
