Ingredients:
cooking spray
4 cups cornbread mix (such as Marie Callender'sÂ®)
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (optional)
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups water

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 21 muffin cups with cooking spray.
Stir cornbread mix, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Add pumpkin puree and water to cornbread mixture; stir until batter is just-combined. Divide batter between prepared muffin cups.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 20 minutes.

Description: 
Super-easy, fun recipe to whip up in minutes for an October or November breakfast. Love serving this with chili for dinner too. I like spraying the muffin liners so that the muffins don't stick. Just a tiny spray will do!
