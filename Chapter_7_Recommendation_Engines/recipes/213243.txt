Ingredients:
1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
3 tomatoes, sliced
6 (6 ounce) tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon chicken bouillon granules
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup water
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
Layer the sliced red peppers and sliced tomatoes in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the tilapia fillets on top of the vegetables.
Combine the paprika, chicken bouillon, cayenne, salt, pepper, olive oil, and water and mix well. Pour the seasoning mixture over the fish. Sprinkle with parsley.
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the vegetables are tender, about 1 hour.

Description: 
Every Shabbat my mother-in-law makes this fish. I've modified it since the fish she uses in Israel isn't available in the Midwest. When you smell this fish cooking, you know it's Shabbat! Serve this with lots of Challah to soak up the yummy juice!
