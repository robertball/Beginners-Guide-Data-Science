Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 whole cloves
3 black cardamom seeds
6 whole black peppercorns
2 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons water
1 cup frozen green peas, thawed
2 cups uncooked basmati rice, rinsed and drained
4 cups water
salt to taste

Directions:
Heat the oil in a deep heavy skillet over low heat. Add the cloves, cardamom seeds, peppercorns and cinnamon sticks. Cook for a few minutes to bring out the aroma of the spices. Stir the garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of water together to make a paste; mix into the pan with the spices.
Add the green peas to the pan, cover and cook for about 5 minutes.
Add the remaining 4 cups of water and rice to the pan. Season with a little salt. Bring to a boil, then cover, and cook for about 15 minutes, until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed. Taste, and adjust the salt before serving.

Description: 
This is very easy recipe, with basmati rice and green peas. It is very mild and fragrant, and great as a side dish, or for those picky kids who don't like their peas. The word 'matar' means green peas in Urdu.
