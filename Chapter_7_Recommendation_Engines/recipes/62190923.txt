Ingredients:
1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1/2 cup warm milk
1 egg
1/3 cup butter, softened
1/3 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
1/4 cup butter, softened

Directions:
Place water and milk in microwave and heat until very warm.  Pour into the KitchenAid mixing bowl and add sugar and yeast.  Stir well, let sit for 15 minutes until foamy and creamy.  Melt 1/3 cup butter in microwave.  Set aside to cool slightly. Beat the egg with a fork, and add melted butter.  Combine flour, and salt together and add to yeast mixture.  Add egg & butter.  Mix until combined in KitchenAid - about 2 minutes.  Then knead for 6 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic.  Grease a large bowl and shape dough into ball.  Add to bowl, turning to grease the top.  Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until double.  About one hour.  Punch down dough and shape for recipe.
For crescents, divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12 inch circle, spread 1/4 cup softened butter over entire round. Cut each circle into 8 wedges. Roll wedges starting at wide end; roll gently but tightly. Place point side down on ungreased cookie sheet. For regular rolls, divide dough into 16 pieces, roll each piece into a tight ball and place in greased pan to rise.  Brush with melted butter just before baking.  For cinnamon rolls, roll out into a 14 by 14 inch square.  Spread softened butter, 1 cup of brown sugar and sprinkle with 2-3 tsp of cinnamon.  Roll up, slice into 16 pieces and place in greased 9x13 pan to rise.  Cover with clean kitchen towel and put in a warm place, let rise 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden.
