Author: Heather
Recipe type: Appetizer
Cuisine: Mexican
INGREDIENTS
8 ripe medium avocados *see pro tip above
1-2 limes *juiced
1 jalapeno *roasted and diced
½ medium red onion *diced
2-3 medium cloves of garlic *minced or crushed
2 roma tomatoes *diced
2 small or 1 large bunch cilantro *chopped
salt and pepper to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Cut Avocados in half and remove seed. With a small knife, cut squares in flesh of avocado, making sure to not cut through skins. With a soup spoon, remove squares into a mixing bowl by scraping with edge of spoon between skin and avocado flesh.
Squeeze lime juice over avocado squares.
Roasting jalapeno is an optional step but adds a wonderful smoky taste and mellows the heat a bit. To roast, place jalapeño over open flame using tongs and turning once skin begins to darken and pop, roasting all sides. Dice and add to avocado.
Cut and dice remaining ingredients, add to avocado. Stir to incorporate veggies well.
Serve with chips or along side any Mexican meal.
