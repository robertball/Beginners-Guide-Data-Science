Ingredients:
2 sheets of puff pastry, thawed
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese
1/2 cup black olives, pitted & halved
1/4 cup diced onion
1/4 cup diced tomato
1 tbsp. flour
4 eggs, separated.
1 1/2 cups half & half or milk
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Spray mini-muffin tins with cooking spray, set aside.
Lay puff pastry out flat.  Cut 48, 1 1/2 inch circles.  Place a puff pastry circles in muffin tins, press down gently.  Keep puff pastry chilled, while making egg mixture.
Whip egg whites to soft peak stage, set aside.
Mix cheeses, tomatoes, onions, egg yolks(slightly beaten), flour, half & half, salt and pepper.  This egg mixture will be very soupy.
Gently fold the egg whites into the egg mixture.
Pre-bake puff pastry for 3 minutes, remove from oven.
Spoon egg mixture over puff pastry.  (Pastry will rise to the top when baking.)
Lower the oven temp to 350.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Remove from oven and gently press olive halve on top.  Run a knife around the sides to loosen the bites, remove...enjoy!

Description: 
This recipe is inspired by Dinomite, the official GIsHWheS 2015 mascot!  It would make a wonderful brunch item anytime of the year, but it is a must during the hunt!  The black olive on top reminds me of our beloved Dinomite...it must be included to be considered true Dinomite Fluffy Bites.  If let off, they are still delicious, however, Dinomite might shake his oversized head at you.
