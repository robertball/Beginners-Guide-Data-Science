2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in milk, egg whites, and melted butter; mix until smooth.

Description: 
I loved this pancake recipe. Way better than a mix at the store but I wanted to cut a little of the fat. I make them with less butter, egg whites instead of a whole egg, and nonfat milk. They are so fluffy and tasty plus I feel great about giving them to my family.
