Ingredients:
1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
3/4 cup chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper
1 pound ground turkey
1/2 pound mild bulk pork sausage
3/4 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup finely chopped carrot
1 egg, slightly beaten
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ketchup, or as needed (optional)
3 slices bacon, or as needed (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and bell pepper in the hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Combine sauteed onion mixture, turkey, sausage, oats, 1/2 cup ketchup, carrot, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix lightly and thoroughly.
Spoon mixture evenly into the prepared muffin tin using an ice cream scoop, filling each to the top, mounding if necessary. Top each with a drizzle of ketchup and about 1/5 slice of bacon.
Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are browned on tops and no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes.

Description: 
Meatloaf in a muffin tin cooks in about half the time, and this recipe is a little different. I find it easier on the stomach than my mom's meatloaf, because I saute the onions and bell pepper. Seal leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate or freeze. Freezes really well for quick supper later!
