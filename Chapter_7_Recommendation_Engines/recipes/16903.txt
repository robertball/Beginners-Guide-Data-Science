Ingredients:
2 (10 ounce) cans refrigerated pizza dough
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound turkey sausage links, without casings
1 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly oil a 10 inch quiche dish or pie pan.
Place one sheet of pizza dough in oiled pan. If necessary, trim edges of dough to fit pan. Bake dough in preheated oven for 7 minutes. Remove and set aside.
While dough is in oven, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble sausage into skillet and saute for 2 minutes. Add onions and green peppers, and saute an additional 5 to 7 minutes, until sausage is cooked through and onion is lightly browned. Add tomato sauce and stir well.
Pour sausage mixture into baked crust, and cover with second sheet of pizza dough. Trim edges as necessary, gently seal the two crusts together, and cut steam vents in top.
Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
