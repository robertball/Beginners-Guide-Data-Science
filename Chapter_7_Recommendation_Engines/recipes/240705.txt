Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup molasses
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup white sugar

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat butter and 1 cup sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Add egg and beat until smooth. Stir molasses into the butter mixture until completely integrated.
Sift flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves together in a separate bowl; add to the butter mixture and mix until you have a dough. Divide and shape the dough into 36 balls.
Put 1/2 cup sugar in a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange onto a baking sheet.
Bake in preheated oven until beginning to crisp around the edges, 13 to 15 minutes.

Description: 
I was following my mother's recipe for ginger snaps and realized I had used the wrong ingredients right away, so rather than throwing it out and starting over, I made my own recipe, and they turned out even better. I just had to share my 'mistake' with you all because I can't believe how good these are. They turned out so delicious, moist, and chewy. I hope you enjoy them.
