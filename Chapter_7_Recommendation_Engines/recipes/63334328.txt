Ingredients:
2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed, reserve liquid
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed, plus more for garnish
1/2 - full lemon, juiced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon dark Asian sesame oil
1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cumin
12 to 15 grinds black pepper
1/4 cup sesame seeds
Paprika and minced parsley for garnish

Directions:
In a blender combine all the ingredients except the parsley and paprika to be used for garnish. Blend on low speed until smooth. You'll have to stop the blender often to push down the ingredients. If the mixture is too dry and you're having trouble blending it, add a few tablespoons of the reserved bean liquid to help things along.
Scrape the hummus onto a plate. Sprinkle the paprika over the top, drizzle lightly with olive oil, scatter some parsley on top, and serve. You can make the hummus up to a couple of hours before you serve it. Cover the top with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature.
