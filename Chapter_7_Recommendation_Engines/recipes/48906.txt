Ingredients:
3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese (softened to room temperature)
1 cup white sugar
3 large eggs at room temperature
1/4 cup heavy cream at room temperature
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup water
aluminum foil
Topping:
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
Lightly butter a 7-inch springform pan.
Combine cream cheese and 1 cup sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed for 3 minutes. Mix in eggs, one at a time, beating about 2 minutes after each addition. Add cream, flour, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract; mix well. Transfer batter to the prepared pan. Wrap the pan tightly in aluminum foil so no water can get inside.
Pour 1 cup of water into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)) and place a trivet in the bottom. Carefully center the filled pan onto the trivet. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 40 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Carefully remove the foil. The cake should be barely set in the center. Allow to cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, combine sour cream, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in a bowl; mix until smooth. Spread over the top of the cooled cheesecake, cover, and chill for at least 4 hours before serving.
