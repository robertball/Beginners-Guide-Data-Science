Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) package frozen prepared pie crusts, thawed
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup white sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 cup raspberries
4 cups chopped fresh rhubarb

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press one pie crust into a 9-inch deep dish pie pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and sugar. Mix in the egg, and raspberries. Stir in the rhubarb so it is evenly coated. Transfer to the prepared pie crust.  Top with the other crust, and crimp around the edges to seal. Make a few slits in the top crust with a small knife to vent steam.
Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for another 35 minutes, or until rhubarb is tender, and juices are thick.

Description: 
Delicious combo...the reason it's an accident is because I didn't realize I had put in the raspberries until it was too late!  Still, that pie didn't last very long!
