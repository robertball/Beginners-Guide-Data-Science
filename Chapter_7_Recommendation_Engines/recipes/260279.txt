Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Beat cream cheese, white sugar, and brown sugar in a bowl until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add pumpkin puree, yogurt, pumpkin spice, egg replacer, and salt; beat until creamy, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture into the prepared pastry shells.
Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the pies comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.
