Ingredients:
2 cups heavy cream, divided
1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
1 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
1/2 cup Sugar In The Raw®
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
2 tablespoons Sugar In The Raw®, divided
3/4 cup brewed coffee
3 tablespoons dark rum
2 (3.5 ounce) packages ladyfingers
2 ounces shaved white chocolate

Directions:
In a large bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk, combine 1 1/2 cups cream, mascarpone, pumpkin, 1/2 cup sugar, and pumpkin spice. Beat on high speed with a hand mixer or on medium-high speed in the stand mixer until stiffly whipped.
In a medium bowl, beat remaining 1/2 cup heavy cream with 1 tablespoon sugar until stiffly whipped.
In a small bowl, stir together coffee, rum, and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Have ready 6 approximately 4-inch wide cups or ramekins. Dip ladyfingers in coffee mixture and line cups or ramekins with a single layer. Depending on size of cups or ramekins, ladyfingers may need to be cut shorter with a serrated knife.
Top with a layer of pumpkin mixture. Top with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and another layer of pumpkin mixture.
Top each serving with a generous spoonful of the whipped cream and sprinkle with white chocolate. Serve immediately or refrigerate, covered, up to 1 day.
