Ingredients:
4 carrots, washed
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put one rack on the highest level in the oven and another on the bottom.
Peel carrots into thin strips using a vegetable peeler; put into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the carrot strips and toss to coat. Season with salt; toss again. Spread carrots onto 2 baking sheets in a single layer, preventing overlap.
Put one baking sheet on the top rack and the other on the bottom. Bake carrots in preheated oven for 6 minutes, switch racks, and continue baking until the carrots are crisp, about 6 minutes more. Cool chips until cool enough to handle before serving.

Description: 
This is a healthy alternative to potato chips and taste salty and sweet like sweet potato fries. This recipe is inspired by other recipes on the internet that I have played with. The thinner the slices, the crunchier the chips.
