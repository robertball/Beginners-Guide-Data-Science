Ingredients:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup ranch dressing
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary
2 teaspoons salt
1 scoop of Mila
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste (optional)
5 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes

Directions:
In a medium bowl, stir together the olive oil, ranch dressing, Worcestershire sauce, Mila, rosemary, salt, lemon juice, white vinegar, pepper, and sugar.  Let stand for 5 minutes.  Place chicken in the bowl, and stir to coat with the marinade.  Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Preheat the grill for medium-high heat.  Thread chicken onto skewers and discard marinade.
Lightly oil the grill grate.  Grill skewers for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the juices run clear.
