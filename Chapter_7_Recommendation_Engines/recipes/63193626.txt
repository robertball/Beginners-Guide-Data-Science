Ingredients:
Sofrito:
1 tbsp olive oil
6 scallions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped fine
2 tomatoes, diced
1/3 cup diced red bell pepper
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp salt
1 packet sazón or 1 tsp annatto seed powder
For Stew:
8 pieces chicken legs and/or thighs on the bone, skin removed
1/2 tsp garlic powder
6 oz light beer
1 cup water
salt to taste
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped (or to taste)
cooked rice

Directions:
Heat oil in a deep saute pan. Add scallions and garlic, sauté 2 minutes, add tomatoes and peppers. Season with salt, cumin, and sazón or annatto. Set aside.
Season chicken with salt and garlic powder; add to center of the pan allowing chicken to brown slightly on both sides. Combine chicken with sofrito, and add beer, water and cilantro, adjust salt if needed. Cover pan and simmer on low until chicken is cooked through, about 20-30 minutes. Serve over rice.

Description: 
Skinless chicken legs and thighs, slowly stewed in light beer with scallions, tomatoes, cilantro, peppers, garlic and spices. For those of you who already make this, and perhaps have this printed out, I made some slight modifications to this and previously listed the servings for two pieces of chicken, but realistically one piece over rice fills me up perfectly. I based the points off of 1 thigh, a drumstick should be the same. The rice is not calculated here.
