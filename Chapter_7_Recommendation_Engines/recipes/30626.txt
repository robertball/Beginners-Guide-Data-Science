3 oranges, juiced
1/4 cup white wine

2 cloves garlic, crushed

1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Rinse beef, and place in large bowl. Pour in orange juice, wine, oil and pepper sauce. Season with bay leaves, garlic, paprika, allspice, salt and pepper. Mix, to coat beef. Cover, and refrigerate overnight.

Description: 
This is marinated beef, Portuguese style. As a variation to cooking, I place all ingredients in a slow cooker on high, stirring often, and cook for about 3 hours, until meat shreds itself.
