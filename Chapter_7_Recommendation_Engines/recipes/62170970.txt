Ingredients:
1 medium red bell pepper, julienned
1 large carrot, peeled and julienned
4 green onions, white part only. Julienned
1/2 mango, peeled and julienned
1 tbs. cilantro, minced
16 Rice Papers
Boiling water
Dressing
1/2 tsp. minced garlic
1 tbs. grated fresh ginger
1/2 cup cashew butter
1/2 tsp. dried Thai Chillies, minced
1/4 cup sesame oil

Directions:
Julienne all vegetables and place in a bowl with the minced cilantro.
Combine all the dressing ingredients, stirring well to combine.
Place the boiling water in a large bowl.
Place the ricepaper in the bowl one at a time to re-hydrate.
You will use two rice papers per Springroll.
Place the two hydrated Rice Paper wraps on a clean work surface.
Spread a little of the dressing in the middle.
Add some of the vegetable mixture.
Roll up by folding in the sides, then roll upwards.
The hardest part is getting it tight enough.
Try pushing the vegetable mixture downwards while you are rolling it.
Once it is rolled, leave it a couple of minutes.
Slice on the diagonal.
