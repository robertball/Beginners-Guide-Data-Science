Ingredients:
1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 pounds pork spareribs
1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional)
1/4 cup cold water (optional)

Directions:
Place ribs in a large stock pot, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 minutes.
In a mixing bowl, mix together soup, onion, garlic, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. Remove ribs from water, and transfer to a slow cooker. Pour sauce over ribs.
Cover, and cook  on Low for 6 to 8 hours, or until ribs are tender.
If sauce is too thin when cooking time is done, drain sauce from ribs, and pour into a sauce pan. Combine 1 teaspoon cornstarch with a small amount of cold water, stir into sauce, and bring sauce to boil. Cook until sauce has reached desired thickness.
