Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 ½ pounds leftover roast pork, cubed
2 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of celery soup
½ cup mayonnaise
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon curry powder
1 (10 ounce) package frozen broccoli, thawed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender.
In a large bowl, mix together the cubed pork, rice and broccoli. Stir in the cream of celery soup and mayonnaise, then season with pepper and curry powder. Transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish, and cover with aluminum foil.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until evenly heated through. Remove the aluminum foil for the last 5 minutes in the oven.

Description: 
I made this up one night when I had leftover pork roast that I had cooked in my slow cooker and frozen. Pork, broccoli and rice with a hint of curry. It's very homey and easy to make ahead of time.
