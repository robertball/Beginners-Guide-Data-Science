1 cup frozen pearl onions,thawed
1/4 cup flour

2 cups red wine
1 can (5 1/2 oz.) tomato paste

Cut beef into bite sized cubes. In a large skillet heat half of the butter. Add the mushrooms and brown very lightly. Remove and set aside.
Add the remaining butter to the pan and brown the onions. Remove and set aside.
Add beef cubes to the pan in batches, browning on all sides. Remove cubes as done, and continue until all beef has been browned. Remove all beef cubes and set aside.
To the remaining fat in the pan stir the flour, then add the bouillon, wine and tomato paste. Bring to a boil and stir until thickened. Add garlic, salt, thyme, bay leaf and freshly ground pepper.
Mix sauce and meat cubes together in a large casserole dish.
Cover and bake at 350 degrees F. for about 2 hours, until the meat is very tender.
Add the onions for the last half hour of cooking time and the mushrooms for the last 15 minutes.
Remove from oven and remove bay leaf. Sprinkle fresh parsley over top.
