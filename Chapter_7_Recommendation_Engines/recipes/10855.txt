Ingredients:
2 cups butter, softened
3 cups white sugar
4 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon butter flavored extract
7 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs and flavorings and mix well.  Stir flour, baking powder and salt together.  Add to batter and mix well.
Chill 3-4 hours or overnight before using.
Roll cookies out approximately 1/4 inch thick and insert cookie sticks at least 1/3 to 1/2 way into cookie.
Bake cookies at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8-10 minutes.  This dough keeps well in a  covered container in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks.
Decorate as desired.  Display 3-7 cookies in a 6 inch clay pot (depending on size of cookie).  Weigh pot down with dried beans and cut a circle of Styrofoam to fit snugly into top.  Add ribbons and enjoy.

Description: 
I received this recipe at a Cake and Candy store when I signed up for a class. We made fall leaves and put them in a clay pot - they looked great! For best flavor results use pure Mexican vanilla the creme de la creme of vanillas. You will need about 6 dozen dowels, cut to approximately 6 inches (with some longer and some shorter) for cookie sticks.
