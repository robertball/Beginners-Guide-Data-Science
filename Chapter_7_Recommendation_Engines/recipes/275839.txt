Ingredients:
1 loaf French bread, cut into 1-inch slices
8 eggs
2 cups half-and-half
1 cup milk
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Praline Topping:

1 cup chopped toasted pecans
2 teaspoons light corn syrup
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Directions:
Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and arrange bread slices in a row.
Combine eggs, half-and-half, milk, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until blended. Pour mixture over bread slices, making sure all are evenly covered. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine butter, brown sugar, chopped pecans, corn syrup, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl. Spread praline topping over bread mixture.
Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and lightly golden, about 40 minutes.

Description: 
This is an easy, delicious, do-ahead baked casserole brunch recipe that doesn't need any syrup, since the French toast has it's own praline topping. You can microwave the praline topping slightly to help spreadability.
