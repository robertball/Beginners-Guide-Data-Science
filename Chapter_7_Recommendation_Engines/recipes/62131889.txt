Ingredients:
2 oz. fresh ginger
5 cloves garlic
1 small vidalia onion
2 lemons
15 oz. (medium bottle) Kikoman soy sauce
1 cup water
1/2 cup good extra virgin olive oil
1 4 oz. jar prepared horeseradish (not the mayo based sauce)
2 oz. Dijon mustard
2 oz. good Worcestershire sauce
2 oz. A-1 sauce
3 oz. good bourbon or red wine
4 lbs. thick flat iron steak
veggies desired for kabobs (par-boiled red potato, peppers, onion, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, squash, etc.)

Directions:
Crush and chop, medium fine, ginger and garlic and place in a BIG sealable bowl (like Tupperware). Add thinly sliced onion. Quarter lemons, squeeze into bowl, drop in rinds. Add rest of marinade ingredients to bowl and stir. Cube beef into 1 1/2" to 2" cubes. Toss into marinade. Cover, refrigerate, and allow to marinate for 3-36 hours. Stir mixture once or twice during marination. When time to assemble, prepare veggies to be skewered. Drain meat and discard solids from marinade. Alternate pieces of meat and veggies on skewers. Grill over medium coals until desired doneness, turning kabobs occasionally during cooking.

Description: 
This recipe is a version that was passed down through my late mother, it makes a lot so we always served it at large gatherings such as 4th of July cookouts, and it still never fails to be a huge hit. Her recipe originally called for tenderloin or sirloin, but I have used big fat flat iron steaks with equal success... a much more economical choice when feeding a crowd!
