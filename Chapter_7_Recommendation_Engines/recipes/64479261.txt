Ingredients:
2 large beets, trimmed and cut into quarters
5 Tbsp. olive oil, divided
2 whole garlic cloves, unpeeled
3 tsp. lemon juice
Sea salt and pepper

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Place beets in a roasting pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil.
Wrap the garlic in foil and add to the pan.
Bake until tender when poked with a fork, about 55-65 minutes - the softer the beets are, the sweeter they will be.
Let cool slightly, then squeeze the garlic out of the skins. Place roasted beets and garlic in a food processor, add remaining olive oil and lemon juice, and blend until smooth.
Season with salt and pepper to taste and serve.
