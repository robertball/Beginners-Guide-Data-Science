Ingredients:
8 Peaches (prepare directions below)
1/4 cup coconut sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
2 teaspoons arrowroot powder/starch
Coconut oil or unsalted butter, melted
Topping:
1 cup almond flour
1/4 cup coconut sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
1/2 cup pecans chopped
1 teaspoon sea salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
4 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee (cold cut into cubes)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350F.
Take a large pan or sauce pot and fill 1/3 with water and bring to a boil.
Slice each peach in 1/2 and place in boiling water for 10 minutes (keep pit intact – it comes out easier after it boils). Remove from water and let cool pot out the pit then peel and slice.
In a small  mixing bowl combine coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and arrowroot powder/starch and mix using a fork.
Take your baking dish and brush with coconut oil or butter (melted).  Top with peach slices then sprinkle with the sugar mixture.
Combine all filling ingredients together in a large bowl and gently stir to combine.  Use your fingers to press the butter cubes into the ingredients.  That will help make a really nice topping.
Bake for 35-40 minutes.
