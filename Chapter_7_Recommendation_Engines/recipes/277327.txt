Ingredients:
12 ounces whole wheat egg noodles
nonstick cooking spray
1 cup chopped sweet onion (such as VidaliaÂ®)
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh white mushrooms
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh portobello mushrooms
16 ounces seitan, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 tablespoon crushed garlic
1 (14 ounce) can vegetable broth
1 (16 ounce) container nonfat sour cream
1/3 cup tomato paste
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed
salt and ground black pepper to taste

Directions:
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes.
Meanwhile, spray a large frying pan with nonstick cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Add onion, white mushrooms, and portobello mushrooms. Saute until onion is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in seitan and garlic; cook for 1 minute longer. Reduce heat to low and add vegetable broth. Mix in sour cream and tomato paste. Cook, stirring often, about 5 minutes.
Stir in flour, adding more if sauce requires additional thickening. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot over drained egg noodles.
