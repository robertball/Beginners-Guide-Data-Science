Ingredients:
cooking spray
1 pound flat iron steaks, cut into small pieces
1 package taco seasoning mix
2 1/2 cups milk
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
4 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup salsa
1 (12 ounce) bag tortilla chips, or to taste

Directions:
Spray a frying pan with cooking spray. Heat over medium heat. Cook and stir steak until barely any pink remains, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat from pan; add taco seasoning to the steak. Let simmer until desired consistency is reached, 3 to 5 minutes.
Warm milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until small bubbles appear along the sides. Remove from heat.
Melt butter in another medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour once bubbles disappear. Cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in the warm milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in shredded cheese.
Add black beans, salsa, and the steak pieces. Stir and serve with tortilla chips.

Description: 
We made these up when we were in the mood for nachos but didn't have any ground beef defrosted. These steak nachos turned out so much better than their ground beef counterpart! We'll definitely make nachos this way from now on.
