Ingredients:
2 lbs fresh tomatoes, diced (keep juice)
1 lb Chicken thighs (about 6) fat trimmed)
1 cup finely diced celery (about ribs)
2 cup finely diced carrots (about three carrots)
1 small sweet onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)
1 tsp dried oregano or 1 T fresh oregano
1 T dried basil or 1/4 cup fresh basil
4 cups low sodium chicken broth (or unsalted vegetable stock)
½ bay leaf
½ cup flour
1 cup Parmesan cheese
½ cup butter
2 cups half and half, warmed
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp black pepper

Directions:
Add tomatoes, chicken, celery, carrots, chicken broth, onions, oregano, basil, and bay leaf to a large slow cooker.
Cover and cook on LOW for 5-7 hours, until flavors are blended, vegetables are soft and chicken can be shredded with a fork.
3.  About 30 minutes before serving prepare a roux. Melt butter over low heat in a skillet and add flour. Stir constantly with a whisk for 5-7 minutes. Slowly stir in 1 cup hot soup. Add another 3 cups and stir until smooth. Add all back into the slow cooker. Stir and add the Parmesan cheese, warmed half and half, salt and pepper.  Add additional basil and oregano if needed (the slow cooker does a number on spices and they get bland over time, so don’t be afraid to always season to taste at the end).
4.  Ladle into serving bowls and enjoy!
