Ingredients:
3 tbs olive oil
6 boneless skinless chicken thighs
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
1-2 tbs flour
1 large sliced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup brown ale, divided in half
1 Tbspbalsamic vinegar
2 Tbsp honey
½ tsp red chili sauce (such as Sriracha) plus additional if desired

Directions:
In a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat add the olive oil.
Sprinkle the chicken thighs on all sides with salt, pepper and flour.
Cook the chicken thighs until browned on all sides, about 3 minutes per side. Remove, and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium-low, add the onions and caramelize over medium heat until golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in the garlic then add ½ cup brown ale, balsamic vinegar, honey and chili sauce. Simmer until reduced and thickened. Add the chicken back to the pan along with the remaining ½ cup brown ale.
Cover loosely with a lid, lower heat to maintain a simmer and allow to cook until chicken is cooked through, about an additional 10 minutes. Turning once during cooking.
Note: the 6 servings is a guide, most of the time when I make this it gets gobbled down so fast we can't keep track. Great served with a heavy skillet bread for the starch.
