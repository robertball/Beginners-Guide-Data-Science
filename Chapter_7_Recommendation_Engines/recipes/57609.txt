Ingredients:
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons dried rosemary
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
8 ounces turkey Italian sausages, casings removed
8 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
1/4 cup dry vermouth
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons cold water
salt to taste
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Directions:
In a 5 to 6 quart slow cooker, combine onion, bell pepper, garlic, rosemary, and oregano.  Crumble sausages over onion mixture. Rinse chicken and pat dry; arrange in a single layer over sausage.  Sprinkle with pepper.  Pour in vermouth.  Cover, and cook on Low setting for 5  to 7 hours, or until chicken is tender and cooked through when pierced.
Transfer chicken to a warm, deep platter, and cover to keep warm.
In a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and cold water. Stir into cooking liquid in slow cooker.  Increase heat to High, and cover. Cook, stirring 2 to3 times, until sauce is thickened (about 10 more minutes).  Season to taste with salt.  Spoon sauce over chicken, and sprinkle with parsley.
