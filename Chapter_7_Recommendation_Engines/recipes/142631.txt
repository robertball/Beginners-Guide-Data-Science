1 1/2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1/2 cup cracker crumbs
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 tablespoons butter, melted

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Arrange scallops in a single layer in a baking dish. Combine wine and lemon juice in a small measuring pitcher. Add salt and pepper to taste, and pour over the scallops.
Combine cracker crumbs, pecans, and parsley in a small bowl. Spoon evenly over the scallops. Drizzle the crumb topping with melted butter.
Bake in preheated oven until topping is golden and scallops are opaque, 10 to 12 minutes.

Description: 
A touch of toasted pecans makes this version of baked sea scallops special. This is also a great way to prepare fish fillets, such as haddock.
