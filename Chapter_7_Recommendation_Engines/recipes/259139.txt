Ingredients:
7 eggs
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 tablespoons coconut oil
2 cups almond flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
Beat eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer on high until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and coconut oil; continue beating until smooth. Mix almond flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt into egg mixture until dough is well mixed and very thick; transfer to the prepared loaf pan.
Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
Make sure when you make this recipe, that you place baking paper in the tray while baking. The first time I did this was without baking paper. Trust me, this is not what you want to be scraping out of the tin. 

Finding it hard to give up carbohydrates? This keto bread makes the switch much easier, so you can still have sandwiches and toast.
