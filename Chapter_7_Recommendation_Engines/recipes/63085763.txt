Ingredients:
1 envelope active dry yeast
3/4 cup warm water (105-110 degrees)
3 cups Bisquick baking mix
2 tablespoons sugar

Directions:
Combine yeast and warm water in a 1-cup measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes.
Combine 3 cups baking mix and sugar in a large bowl; gradually stir in yeast mixture.
Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead, adding additional baking mix (up to 1/2 cup) as needed, until dough is smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes).
Roll dough into a 12-inch circle, cut circle into 12 wedges, starting at wide end, to form a crescent shape; place point side down, on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Cover and let rise in a warm place, free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.
Preheat oven to 425.  Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden.
