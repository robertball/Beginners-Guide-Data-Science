Ingredients:
cooking spray
2 cups spelt flour
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
4 ripe bananas
1 cup chopped pecans
2 tablespoons finely chopped pecans, or more to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat an 8 1/2x4 1/2-inch loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside.
Combine spelt flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium-sized bowl and set aside.
Beat eggs in a large bowl until light yellow in color. Stir in sour cream, applesauce, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mash 2 bananas and add to the egg mixture. Dice remaining bananas and add to the bowl. Stir in 1 cup pecans. Pour flour mixture into the bowl with the egg-banana mixture and and stir just until flour is incorporated; do not over mix.
Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and sprinkle 2 tablespoons pecans on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes.
Place pan on a rack to cool, about 10 minutes. Turn loaf out onto the rack to cool completely.
