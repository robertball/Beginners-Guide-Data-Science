Ingredients:
1 tablespoon butter, divided, or as needed
1 small onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
1/3 cup salsa
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
4 gluten-free tortillas
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Coat a heavy skillet with 1/2 tablespoon butter and melt over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until onion is soft, about 3 minutes. Add black beans, corn, salsa, cumin, coriander, salt, and chili powder. Cook until reduced to your liking, 5 to 10 minutes.
Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Place 1 tortilla in the pan, top with a layer of Cheddar cheese, and top 1/2 tortilla with the bean mixture. Fold tortilla in half and cook until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese, and bean mixture.

Description: 
Super fast, super easy, healthier, clear-your-pantry recipe! My carnivore husband and six-year-old both love these. You can make them more or less healthy depending on your preference, and they can easily be vegan. I like to reincarnate any leftovers into breakfast burritos!
