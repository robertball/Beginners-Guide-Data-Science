Rhubarb Gelee Recipe

Ingredients:
1 pound rhubarb
2/3 cup sugar
juice of two large oranges (navel, for instance)
2 envelopes knox gelatin, which is 2 tablespoons if you're measuring
Water

Directions:
Cut the rhubarb into bite-sized slices, and put in a pot. Fill the pot with water until it just covers the rhubarb, then add the sugar. Simmer the rhubarb until just tender, then strain out the rhubarb, but reserve the cooking water, in which the rhubarb juice has been rendered. Put the rhubarb aside on a dish.
Return the cooking water to the heat and bring to a boil. Whisk the gelatin into the water until it fully dissolves. Remove from the heat and add the orange juice. Beat the juice mixture with a hand-held beater on low so you don't splatter the hot juices, until the mixture is light, fluffy and foamy.
Arrange the rhubarb on a 9x9" Pyrex container, or really any serving shallow serving bowl you don't mind keeping in the refrigerator for a few hours. Then pour the juice mixture over the top. Refrigerate until set, then serve.

Description: 
From Norwegian National Recipes: Rhubarb stewed until the juices are concentrated with sugar, shot through with fresh-squeezed orange juice, and then held suspended with a little gelatin. It's unbelievably refreshing and just as addicting.
