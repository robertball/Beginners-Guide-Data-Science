Ingredients:
1 (9x9 inch) pan cornbread, cooled and crumbled
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 tbsp butter
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
1 large apple, cored and chopped (I leave skin on)
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 cup apple cider
3/4 cup chicken stock (or as needed)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 1.5 quart casserole dish.
Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan, and saute the celery and onion for 5 to 7 minutes, or until tender.  Stir in apples and pecans.
Add cornbread, thyme, ginger, salt & pepper. Mix in the apple cider and about 1/4 cup chicken stock.  Spoon dressing into prepared casserole dish.  If necessary, pour remaining chicken stock over dressing so it is nice and moist.
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until heated through, and lightly browned on top.

Description: 
Savory, yet sweet, this cornbread dressing will satisfy anyone's appetite. My version is a blend of the original recipe and Momma's Cornbread Dressing - more breadlike stuffing, and I only used cornbread, no stuffing mix.Modified from: Apple Pecan Cornbread Dressing
