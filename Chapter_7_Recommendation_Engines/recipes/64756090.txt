Ingredients:
3 pounds of Atlantic Salmon fillet, boneless and skinless, cut into serving-sized portions.
1 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup white wine (chardonnay or similar)
1/2 cup pesto
1/4 cup olive oil
Fresh lemon slices

Directions:
Cut the salmon and brine in soy sauce, fresh lemon juice and white wine for at least 4 hours.
In the meantime, soak 2 cedar planks in water.
Prepare charcoal grill. Lightly coat the top of the cedar planks with olive oil.
Arrange salmon slices on cedar planks and lightly coat with olive oil. Place planks over charcoal on grill.
Adjust airflow to 50% to maximize smoke and cook for about 10 minutes or until salmon has turned light pink. (The inside should still be reddish-pink. Do not overcook.) The edges of your cedar plank should be charring and the edges of your salmon absorbing the smoke and turning brown.
Add about a tablespoon of pesto to the top of each salmon portion and spread with basting brush. Return grill cover and cook for about 2-3 more minutes or until pesto is evenly melted across top of each piece.
Serve with sliced lemons on top of salmon pieces.

Description: 
Salmon is a Northwest favorite. I spent years developing this savory, smoky approach to an old favorite. I've finally posted it because so many people have told me they loved it.
