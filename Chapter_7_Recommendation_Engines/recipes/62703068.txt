8 uncooked tortillas
2 Cans of Chili
1 Can Black Beans (drained and rinsed)
1 1\2 Cups Frozen Corn
2 Sweet Bell Peppers, thinly sliced, optional
2-3 Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese
Garnish with shredded Lettuce, Salsa, Sour Cream, Ranch dressing, etc.

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Cook tortillas on a skillet while you prepare the chili mixture. If you want a quicker meal, use pre-cooked flour tortillas.
Mix together Chili, Black Beans and Corn.
Grease a 9x13 pan with olive oil.
In each tortilla, put a large spoonful of chili mixture, a small handful of sweet peppers and top with a large pinch of shredded cheese.  Fold the sides in, roll them up and place into pan seam side up.
Pour remaining Chili, Peppers and Cheese over the tortillas once the pan is filled.
Place into preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. Cover with foil after 20 minutes if cheese is starting to brown.
Serve and top with shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream or ranch if desired.
