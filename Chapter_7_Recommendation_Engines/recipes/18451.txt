Ingredients:
3 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
1/3 cup cider vinegar
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup heavy cream
3/4 cup chopped onion
3 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped

Directions:
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the potatoes and let cook until tender. While the potatoes cook, in a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper.  Drain the potatoes, stir them into the vinegar mixture and let them marinate for 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.
In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream and heavy cream.  Fold this creamy mixture into the potato mixture along with the onions and hard-cooked eggs.  Cover and chill before serving if you wish.  (This salad keeps for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.)

Description: 
Our country's birthday on the Fourth of July is traditionally celebrated with parades, American flags waving in the breeze, fireworks exploding in summery skies, and picnics under cool shade trees.  Of course, the picnic has almost always included potato salad, often this creamy old-time version.
