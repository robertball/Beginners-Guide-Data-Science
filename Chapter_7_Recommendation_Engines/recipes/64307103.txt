Ingredients:
1/2 Cup Cold Water
1/2 Cup White Vinegar
1/4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar
2-3 Teaspoons Maple Syrup
3 Cups Cooked Chickpeas OR 2 cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed (SAVE SOME OF THE LIQUID!)
Seasonings:
2 Tbsp leftover bean cooking liquid OR canned chickpea liquid
1/4 Cup Roughly Chopped Fresh Dill
3 Cloves Garlic, Finely Minced
1/2  1 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Mustard Powder
1/4 tsp Ground Coriander
1/4 tsp Celery Seed
1/8 tsp Ground Black Pepper
Pinch Red Pepper Flakes

Directions:
Place all of the ingredients for the brine in a medium-sized jar, including the chickpeas, shake it up, and place it in the fridge. Allow the brine mixture to infuse into the beans for 12 – 24 hours.
drain them thoroughly but do not rinse.
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees while you measure out and prep the seasonings.
Toss the chickpeas into a bowl along with the bean liquid and all of the aromatics, stirring so that every last bean is thoroughly coated.
Transfer to a jellyroll pan or large baking dish (anything with sides) and spread them evenly in one layer.
Bake for 45 – 60 minutes, stirring every 15 or so, until the chickpeas have shrunken in size and are golden brown, should rattle somewhat when you shake the pan.
Remove from heat and let cool completely before snacking and/or storing in an airtight container.
