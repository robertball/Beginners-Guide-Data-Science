Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese with chives
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
6 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
1 1/2 cups finely shredded iceberg lettuce
12 slices thinly sliced deli turkey
3/4 cup shredded Swiss cheese
1 large tomato, seeded and diced
1 large avocado, sliced
6 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled

Directions:
Mix together the cream cheese and Dijon mustard until smooth. Spread each tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture, spreading to within 1/4 inch of the edge of the tortillas.
Arrange about 1/4 cup of shredded lettuce on each tortilla, and press the lettuce down into the cream cheese mixture. Place 2 turkey slices per tortilla over the lettuce, and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of shredded Swiss cheese. Top each tortilla evenly with tomato, avocado slices, and crumbled bacon.
Roll each tortilla up tightly, and cut in half across the middle with a slightly diagonal cut.
