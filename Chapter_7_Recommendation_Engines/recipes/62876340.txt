Ingredients:
~~~CRUST~~~
2 cups AP flour
2 tsp active dry yest
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup water
2 TBS olive oil
~~~Toppings~~~
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated or mozzrella cheese slices
1/4 lb. Italina Sausage, cooked
1/4 lb. ground meat, cooked
1/4 cup onion, chopped and sauteed, or to taste
Minced garlic, to taste
Italian Seasoning or Oregano, basil, and Thyme, to taste.
2 ounces pepperoni slices
1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
2 TBS Parmesan cheese, freshly grated if possible
Salt, to taste, optional

Directions:
Put in automatic bread machine placing ingredients in bread container in following order: water, olive oil, flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Select "Dough" setting and press "Start". You can make the crust without a bread machine just by mixing the dough by hand.
Spray pizza pan with non-stick cooking spray, olive oil flavored cooking spray or brush with olive oil. Gently pull and stretch pizza crust dough to fit your pan, forming a raised edge at the lip of the pan.
If you are stopping here, place crust still on pizza pan into freezer. When completley frozen, remove from pan and wrap in foil and return to freezer.
If you are going to add toppings before freezing, continue with directions.
Sprinkle crust with grated mozzrella cheese or add a layer of sliced mozzrella cheese.
Spread evenly over the cheese the browned sausage, ground meat, pepperoni, garlic and chopped and sauteed onion.
Add seasonings, if you are using them.
Gently spread marinara sauce to cover cheese and toppings.
Sprinkle with remaining cheese and salt if you are using any.
To freeze, flash freeze pizza in pan. When frozen, remove pizza from pan and wrap in foil.
To prepare pizza do not thaw before cooking.
Heat oven to 400* and bake frozen pizza for 20 to 25 minutes, until crust is golden and sauce is bubbly and cheese is fully melted.
You may if you wish, you can change the order of the toppings putting the sauce first, then the fillings and ending with the cheese.

Description: 
A great recipe for pizza to make and freeze for a handy meal when time is short. You can make the pizza and freeze it or you can stop at the crust and freeze just the crust and you're still set to go. This is a recipe from HillbillyHousewife ecookbook, Make Ahead Freezer Meals. HBHW says,  No need to call the pizza delivery. Just assemble a few of these and store them in the frezer. Of Course you can easily change the toppings. Just be sure to assemble your pizza in the order sugested for the best results.
