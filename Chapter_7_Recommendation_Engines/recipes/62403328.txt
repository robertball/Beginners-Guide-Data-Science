Ingredients:
1/2 pound of medium shell pasta (about 3 cups)
3 eggs, hard boiled, yolks removed and set aside, shred the whites
1/2 cup mayonaisse
1 teaspoon mustard
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 green onions, chopped
1 large dill pickle, shredded
2 celery stalk, shredded (strings thrown out)

Directions:
In a large pot, bring water to a boil, add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until pasta is tender. Drain.
In a large bowl,  blend mayonnaise and mustard together first. Add the yolks and blend until creamy consistency then add garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper and parlsey flakes.
Add green onions, dill pickles, celery, eggs and pasta in and stir to blend. It's okay if it tastes salty at first, the pasta will absorb the saltiness as it sits. Cover with saran wrap and refrigerate for a few hours. Stir and serve.
