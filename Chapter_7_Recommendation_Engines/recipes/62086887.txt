Ingredients:
6 oz barlotti/pinto beans, dry
2 onions, roughly sliced
8-10 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped
6 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp sugar
1 can diced tomatoes
2 tbsp dried parsley, or one bunch fresh, roughly chopped
1 cup broth or water

Directions:
Soak beans in water at least 8 hours. Drain beans, put in a pot of water, and bring to boil. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Drain well.
Brown onions and garlic in olive oil. Stir in sugar and half of the tomatoes and half of the herbs. Cook gently for 15 minutes.
Add beans and broth/water and bring to a boil.
Stir in remaining tomatoes and herbs, season to taste with salt & pepper, and simmer 20-25 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated.

Description: 
A nice alternative to canned baked beans.  Be sure that your beans are cooked thoroughly before adding them to the tomato mixture.  Otherwise, the acid in the tomatos tend to toughen the skin of the beans and they will never cook right.  As for the canned tomatos, I prefer using the ones with the jalapenos included.  To save time, chop your veggies and start the tomato mixture while the beans are cooking.
