Ingredients:
4 breasts chicken, boneless and skinless
2/3 cup milk
3 cups cheddar cheese, shredded
2 cups Progresso Italian Breadcrumbs
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1 (18 ounce) can Progresso Creamy Three Cheese cooking sauce
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut each breast of chicken into 3 pieces. Dip each piece into milk, then cheddar cheese, then Italian breadcrumbs. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with foil.
Bake chicken in preheated oven for 25 minutes, then remove foil, baste with melted butter, and cook 10-12 additional minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and coating is golden brown.
While chicken is cooking, place the Progresso Cooking Sauce into a small saucepan and simmer until reduced in half.
Remove chicken from oven and place on platter. Spoon sauce over chicken. Top with fresh parsley. Serve and enjoy!
