Ingredients:
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 (3 pound) boneless turkey breast halves
6 whole cloves
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar

Directions:
In a small bowl, mix together the garlic, basil, and pepper. Rub over the turkey breasts. Insert one clove into each end of the turkey breasts, and one in the center.
In a large shallow dish, blend vegetable oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, and brown sugar. Place the breasts in the dish, and turn to coat. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Discard marinade, place turkey breasts on the grill. Close the lid, and grill turkey breasts about 15 minutes on each side, or to an internal temperature of 170 degrees F (68 degrees C).

Description: 
This recipe came from my mother. These always turn out juicy and tender no matter how long my husband leaves them on the grill! Easy to prepare, but it's always best when marinated for at least 4 hours.
