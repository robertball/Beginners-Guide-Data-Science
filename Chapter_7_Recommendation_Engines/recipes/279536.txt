1 large onion, chopped
1   green bell pepper - stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped
1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 (8 ounce) packages processed cheese food (such as Velveeta速), cubed
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained

Description: 
Using pantry items plus a couple of fresh items, you can create a cheesy, comforting casserole your whole family will love. Though it does include RO*TEL速 and a can of mild green chile peppers, it's not spicy, but if you like the heat, choose hot RO*TEL速 and peppers. This pantry chicken casserole reheats well, too, but I had to hide it, or there would have been no night #2! A crusty bread and a green salad complete this easy pantry meal.
