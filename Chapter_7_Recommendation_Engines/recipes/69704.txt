Description: 
This is the signature drink in the Tabu Ultra Lounge. It is a variation of a classic cocktail called a Strawberry Fizz that was traditionally served in a 6-8 ounce glass filled with fine ice and topped with charged water. The Tabu Cocktail is a great introduction to gin for the non-gin drinker and a must for those that enjoy a gin based cocktail.
