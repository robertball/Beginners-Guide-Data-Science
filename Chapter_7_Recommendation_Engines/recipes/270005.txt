Ingredients:
1 pound bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 medium onions, diced
2 green bell peppers, diced
14 eggs
1 (26 ounce) package shredded hash brown potatoes
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 (12 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Heat a large, heavy-bottomed stainless steel pot over medium heat. Cook bacon until dark brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Add onions and bell peppers and cook until just starting to soften, about 5 minutes.
Crack eggs into the pot; stir to break the yolks and mix eggs evenly. Heat until mostly set but still creamy, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes; toss until evenly distributed. Cook, stirring frequently and scraping the bottom, until potatoes are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Remove from heat and add Cheddar cheese; mix until melted.
