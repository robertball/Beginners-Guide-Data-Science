Ingredients:
1 boneless skinless chicken breast
¼ cup finely diced celery
¼ cup finely diced peeled apple
1 green onion, finely diced
¼ cup light or regular mayonnaise
1 tsp lemon juice
¼ tsp curry powder (optional)
Pinch each salt and pepper
6 thin slices white or whole wheat sandwich bread
2 Tbsp butter, softened

Directions:
Pour water into small skillet to depth of 3/4-inch; bring to simmer. Add chicken; cover and poach over med-low heat until no longer pink inside, about 12 minutes. Transfer to plate; refrigerate until cool enough to handle. Finely dice.
In bowl, stir together celery, apple, green onion, mayonnaise, lemon juice, curry powder (if using), salt, pepper and chicken.
Spread each bread slice with butter; spread half of the slices with filling. Top with remaining bread, pressing lightly. (Make-ahead: Place on rimmed baking sheet and cover with damp tea towel; cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.)
Trim off crusts. Cut each sandwich into 4 triangles or squares.
