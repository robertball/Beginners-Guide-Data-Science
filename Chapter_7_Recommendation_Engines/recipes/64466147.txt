Ingredients:
3 tablespoons of either butter, margarine, or dinomite slobber (dinomite slobber must be stirred thrice under a blue moon to have the proper consistency)
4 cups of marshmallows (PROtip- use the white kind, because the rainbow kind looks pretty in the bag, but will melt to become this epic gray primordial sludge... hmm... use the sludge for more dino-ness)
6 cups of a brightly colored cereal usually associatied with dinosaurs and the stone age, but I'm sure is trademarked (you know, Fruity "Small Rocks")

Directions:
In a large saucepan or cauldron, melt the butter over low heat
Removing cooking device from heat
Add the brightly colored cereal
Mix it all up nicely (give it compliments to help the cooking process)
Use a buttered utensil or wax paper-- or buttered wax paper-- to press the mixture in evenly.
Wait until it's cool enough to touch, then plop it all onto a large serving platter, grab and knife and fork, and dig in!
