Ingredients:
50 clam shell bottoms
Minced clams (about 2 1/2 cups minced)
5 slices bacon
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 cup diced red bell pepper
2 large shallots, minced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 cup dry white wine
Salt and pepper, to taste
3 tbsp grated parmesan cheese + for topping clams before baking

Directions:
Preheat oven to 500.
Line 2 large or 3 medium baking sheets with foil.
In a large skillet, heat oil and cook bacon until crisp (but with still a little bend to it) over medium heat. Remove from the skillet, cool, crumble/chop and set aside.
In the same skillet you cooked the bacon in, add the red pepper, shallots, garlic and oregano. Cook until shallots are translucent.
Add white wine and continue to cook until wine is almost evaporated.
Remove mixture from heat and place into a large bowl. Add the minced clams and 3 tbsp of the parmesan cheese and mix well.
Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the clam/veggie mixture into the individual shell bottoms being careful not to overstuff. Once filled sprinkle/top the clams with more parmesan.
Place in the oven and bake for 12 minutes. Switch the two baking sheets' position in the oven and continue to bake for another 2-5 minutes.
Remove from oven. Carefully transfer clams to a serving platter and enjoy!

Description: 
A request from my uncle turned into one popular dish! I served this at our annual family crab fest and they will now be on the menu every year!

Note about the minced clams: I am fortunate enough to have a fisherman of an uncle who gave me all of the cleaned clam insides in a Tupperware container a day ahead of time which I finely minced when I started cooking.
