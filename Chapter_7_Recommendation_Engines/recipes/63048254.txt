Ingredients:
12 short ribs (about 3.5 lbs)
1 TBL olive oil
salt and ground pepper
1 large onion, cut in to medium dice
3 garlic colves, minced
2 tsps dried thyme leaves
3 TBS flour
1 1/2 cups each: red wine and chicken broth
1 can (14.5 oz) petite diced tomatoes

Directions:
Adjust rack to lower-medium position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Toss short ribs evenly with oil and a light sprinkling of salt and pepper.
Meanwhile heat a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or soup kettle over medium-high heat. Working in two batches to avvoid overcrowding, add short ribs to hot pan. Cook each batch, turning only once, until well-browned on each side, 5 to 6 minutes.
Drain all but 1 TBL of fat from pan. Add onion; saute until lightly brown and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, saute until fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, then wine, followed by chicken broth and tomatoes. Return short ribs to the pot and bring to a simmer.
Place a sheet of heavy-duty foil over the pot. Use a potholder to press down foil so that it touches stew. Seal foil completely around edges. Place lid snugly on pot. Place pot in oven and cook until ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender, about 1 1/2 hrs.
