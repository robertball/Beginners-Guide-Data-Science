Ingredients:
1 cup warm milk (70 to 80 degrees F)
1/4 cup water (70 to 80 degrees F)
2 eggs
1/4 cup butter or margarine, softened
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
5 cups bread flour
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
FILLING:
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
GLAZE:
1 cup confectioners' sugar
4 teaspoons milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
In bread machine pan, place the first eight ingredients in order suggested by manufacturer.  Select dough setting (check dough after 5 minutes of mixing; add 1 to 2 tablespoons water or flour if needed).
When cycle is completed, turn dough onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half.  Roll each portion into a 10-in. x 8-in. rectangle.  Brush with butter.  Combine sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over dough.  Roll up tightly jelly-roll style, starting with a short side.  Pinch seams and ends to seal.  Place seam side down in two greased 9-in. x 5-in. x 3-in. loaf pans.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes.  Cover with foil; bake 5-10 minutes longer or until golden brown.  Remove form pans to wire racks to cool completely.  Combine glaze ingredients; spoon over loaves.
