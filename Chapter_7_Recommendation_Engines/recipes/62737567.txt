1 tablespoon butter, melted
1/2 medium onion, chopped
1/4 cup melted butter

salt and pepper, to taste
4 ounces mild cheddar cheese
4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
dash of hot sauce (optional)

Directions:
Saute onion in butter. Set aside. Cook melted butter and flour using a whisk over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Stir constantly and slowly add the half-and-half. Add the chicken stock whisking all the time. Simmer for 20 minutes.
Add the broccoli, carrots and onions. Cook over low heat until the veggies are tender for 20-25 minutes. Add salt and pepper. The soup should be thickened by now. Return to pot over low heat and add the grated cheese; stir until well blended. Stir in the nutmeg and hot sauce if using and serve.
