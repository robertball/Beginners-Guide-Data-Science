1/4 teaspoon salt
4 slices white bread

Directions:
Preheat your oven's broiler.
In a medium bowl, stir together the onion, tomato, celery, bell pepper, cheese, chili powder and salt. Arrange slices of bread on a baking sheet or broiling pan. Top each one with 1/4 of the mixture, spreading out to the edges.
Broil for 4 to 5 minutes, or until cheese melts. Watch closely to prevent burning. Serve immediately.
