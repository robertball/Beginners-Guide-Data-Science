1 large onion, diced fine
1 cup minus 2 tsp all purpose flour
1 cup minus 1 Tbl and 1/2 tsp cornmeal
1 tsp salt
1 Tbl plus 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 quart oil for frying

Directions:
In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, sugar, and onion. Blend in flour and cornmeal salt and baking powder. Heat 2 inches of oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
