Ingredients:
1 pound carrots, peeled and thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced
3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
1/3 cup apricot preserves
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Directions:
Put carrots, garlic, ginger, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Add 2 cups water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, until carrots are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
Transfer carrot mixture to a food processor along with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, apricot preserves, lemon juice, sesame oil, coriander, and cayenne. Process until almost smooth.

Description: 
Carrot dip may sound unusual, but this Mediterranean-style blend is a perfect balance of sweet and spicy, and a nice change of pace from hummus. It's delicious with pita bread or pita chips.
