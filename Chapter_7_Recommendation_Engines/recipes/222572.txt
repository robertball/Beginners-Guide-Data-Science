Ingredients:
1 1/2 cups dry kidney beans
salt to taste
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 cup shelled walnuts
2 garlic cloves
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 small white onion, minced
2 cooked chicken breast halves, chopped (optional)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
Place beans in a bowl; cover with plenty of water. Soak for 8 hours or overnight.
Drain beans and transfer to a large pot; cover with plenty of water, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until beans are soft, about 90 minutes. Drain and season with salt.
Grind walnuts and garlic to a fine paste in a food processor. Add vinegar, 1/3 cup water, 1 tablespoon parsley, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Process until smooth.
Mix beans, onion, chicken, and dressing in a bowl. Chill in refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. Garnish with 1 tablespoon parsley and 2 tablespoons cilantro.

Description: 
Kidney beans and onions are given a boost by a unique walnut-based dressing. This dish is a great cold side for a warm day. I like to add chicken to mine and make it the whole meal!
