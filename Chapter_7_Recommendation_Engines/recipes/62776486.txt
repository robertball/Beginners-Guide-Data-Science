Description: 
This recipe was originally for Banana-Raisin Bread, but a cousin who didn't like the raisins would pick them out of the bread before he'd eat it. Upon discovering this, my Aunt Mary decided that chocolate chips would be a great substitute for the raisins. Her son sure loved that touch!Modified from: Aunt Mary's Banana-Chocolate Chip Bread
