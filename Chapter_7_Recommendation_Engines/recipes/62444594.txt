Ingredients:
3/4 pound angel hair pasta
4-5 medium garden tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped
1/2 tsp. sea salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 large shallot, thinly sliced
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
4 ounces prosciutto, sliced in thin strips
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
Freshly grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese

Bring salted water to boil for pasta, cook pasta according to package directions.
While pasta is cooking, place chopped tomatoes in a medium bowl, season with salt and pepper. Pour olive oil over tomato mixture and gently toss together, set aside.
Heat a small skillet over medium heat, drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and saute shallots until just becoming translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in garlic and continue to saute another minute, being careful not to let garlic brown. Remove from heat.
Drain pasta, reserving a cup of the cooking water. Place pasta in large pasta dish or serving bowl. Toss hot pasta with tomatoes, shallot mixture and prosciutto. Depending on the juiciness of the tomatoes, you may want to add some or all of the reserved liquid to the pasta dish.Top with basil and grated cheese, serve hot.
