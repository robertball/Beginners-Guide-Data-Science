Ingredients:

1 (12 ounce) package vegetarian burger crumbles

2 cups vegetable broth

1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 tablespoon chopped chipotle chile in adobo sauce
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes.
Stir burger crumbles and browning sauce with the onion until onion and crumbles are coated with sauce; add stewed tomatoes, vegetable broth, chili beans, tomato sauce, tomato paste, chipotle chili, and salt.
Bring mixture to a low boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the tomatoes and beans are softened, 15 to 20 minutes.

Description: 
This recipe is a long-time favorite in my house. It's quick to make and is very healthy. The adobo chili is a must. You can find them in a small can in the Mexican food aisle of most grocery stores. This chili freezes well, so double the recipe if you want.
