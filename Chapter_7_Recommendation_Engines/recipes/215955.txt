2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3/4 cup Progresso® chicken broth
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian (flat-leaf) parsley

1 cup all-purpose flour
4 1/2 teaspoons California chili powder
1 tablespoon coarse sea salt (gray salt)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 cup Progresso® plain Panko crispy bread crumbs
Shrimp Mixture:

4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 small serrano chile, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh whole basil leaves
1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange peel

In small saucepan, heat beans, 2 tablespoons olive oil and the chicken broth to boiling. Reduce heat to low to keep mixture warm. (Lemon juice and parsley will be added later.)

Add shrimp to skillet in single layer. (Do not toss or move shrimp.) Cook about 3 minutes. Turn shrimp over; cook until browned. Remove shrimp from skillet to cookie sheet.
Add garlic to hot oil in skillet; cook and stir until light brown, adding more oil if necessary. Add chile; cook until soft. Carefully add basil (water in skillet will pop). Cook 45 to 60 seconds or until crisp.
Meanwhile, stir lemon juice and parsley into bean mixture in saucepan; season to taste with additional salt and pepper.
Stir orange peel into basil mixture in skillet. Remove from heat. Return shrimp to skillet; toss to combine.
