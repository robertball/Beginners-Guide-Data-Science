Ingredients:
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
4 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 cup hot water

Directions:
In the container of a blender or food processor, combine the flour and salt. Pulse to blend. Add the oil and hot water, and blend until it stops sticking to the sides. Remove from the container, and cut into 4 pieces.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough until fairly thin. Let it rest for a minute if it is difficult to roll. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and spray with a light coating of cooking spray. Fry one piece at a time until the surface begins to bubble. Flip over, and fry until it has brown spots on the other side. Cut each piece into quarters to serve.
