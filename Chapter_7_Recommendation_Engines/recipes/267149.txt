Ingredients:
12 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

Directions:
Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Place green beans in a bowl. Whisk together sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a separate bowl and pour over green beans. Toss to coat and let marinate for 5 minutes.
Place half the green beans in the air fryer basket. Cook 12 minutes, shaking basket halfway through cooking time. Repeat with remaining green beans.
