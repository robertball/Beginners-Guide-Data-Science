Ingredients:
1 cup sugar
1 quart blackberries
1 quart vodka

Directions:
Pour the sugar into a 1 quart jar. Fill the remaining space with berries, but do not pack down. Fill the jar with vodka so that the berries are completely covered. Seal the jar. Let the jar stand for 2 months, shaking the jar every week. The sugar should dissolve, and the vodka will become colored.
Strain the liquid through a metal sieve, and then through a coffee filter to remove the fruit. Pour into pretty bottles. Drink as a cordial, or use it to flavor lemonade or iced tea.

Description: 
This is an easy way to make cordial and it's good for gifts! Other berries such as raspberries, strawberries or blueberries may be used in place of blackberries, and rum or brandy may be used in place of the vodka.
