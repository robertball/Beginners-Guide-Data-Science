Ingredients:
2 cups water
1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle Guinness
4 cloves garlic, minced
4 large carrots, peeled and cut into matchstick pieces
10 baby red potatoes, quartered
1 onion, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces
1/2 head cabbage, coarsely chopped
1 cup brown sugar
1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet

Directions:
Combine water, beer, and garlic in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot(R)).
Place trivet inside.
Rub brown sugar on all sides of brisket.
Place brisket on the trivet and (optional) sprinkle spice packet on top.
Close and lock the lid.
Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 90 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer brisket to a baking sheet,
cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 15 minutes.
Remove the trivet while your brisket is resting and place baby carrots, quartered red potatoes, and cabbage wedges in the bottom of the Instant Pot.
Secure the lid, lock, seal, and select the manual setting.
Set for 5 minutes on high pressure.
Do a quick release.
The rested brisket and vegetables are ready at the same time.
