Ingredients:
One package of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread
4 eggs
1 1/2 cup milk
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 cup sugar
margarine or butter
whipped cream

Directions:
Butter 6 slices of the bread, place butter side down in casserole.  Then, butter 6 more slices, place those butter side down on top of the other slices.  Mix the eggs, milk, salt, vanilla, sugar together and pour over the bread.  Let it sit overnight.  The next morning, put casserole in another pan that is a little bigger, pour water around the edges of pan. Do not get water in the casserole.  Bake at 350 degree oven for approx. 50 minutes.  Knife inserted in middle should come out mostly clean, and it should be pretty well set.  Take it out.  Serve it with Whipped cream and either blackberry or strawberry preserves.
