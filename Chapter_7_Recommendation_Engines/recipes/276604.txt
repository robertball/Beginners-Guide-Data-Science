Ingredients:
1 pound ground beef
1 pound ground pork
2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
1 1/2 cups crushed corn chips
1 cup salsa
1 egg
1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1/4 cup taco sauce, or as needed

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Combine ground beef, ground pork, Cheddar cheese, corn chips, salsa, egg, taco seasoning mix, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix until well combined. Form mixture into 12 equally-sized balls and press into a 12-cup muffin tin. Baste each "muffin" with taco sauce to coat.
Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let cool 5 minutes before serving.
