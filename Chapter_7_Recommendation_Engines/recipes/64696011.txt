Ingredients:
12 corn tortillas
1-2 cups Rudy's Pico De Gallo
1 lb slow-cooked shredded chicken breast
1/4 cup olive oil for chicken
1/4 cup olive oil for tortillas
2 tsp cumin
1-2 tsp salt (to taste)

Directions:
Saute chicken in oil, cumin, and salt to taste until desired tenderness and flavor, set aside.
In separate skillet, Saute corn tortillas until slightly golden.
Let tortillas drip on paper towels before plating.
Place sauteed tortillas  two or three on a plate and add chicken filling as desired.
Top with 1-2 tablespoons of Rudy's Pico de Gallo.
Served open faced.
Service with Rudy's Re-fried Beans and Rudy's Mexican Rice.
Substitute sauteed sliced steak, ground beef, shredded pork butt (carnitas), or any other filling.
The secret to these tacos is the sauteed corn tortillas.
Instead of using Pico de Gallo, use diced onions, diced cilantro, and a lime wedge (the classic Mexican topping).
