1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix
1 (3 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix
3 eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
1 cup caffeinated citrus-flavored soda
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)
1 (3 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix
1 1/2 cups milk
2 cups frozen whipped topping, thawed

Directions:
Preheat oven to 325 F (165 degrees C) and grease the 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish or pan.
In a large bowl, combine the cake mix and pudding mix. Add oil, eggs and lime flavored soda. Blend well, then stir in nuts. Pour into greased pan.
Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes or until tooth pick inserted into center of cake comes out clean.  Allow cake to cool completely  then frost with Green Thumb Frosting.
Green Thumb Frosting: Beat pudding mix and cold milk for 2 minutes.  Stir in whipped topping until blended.  Spread over cake and refrigerate until served. Cake taste improved when refrigerated a few hours before serving. Best if refrigerated overnight!
