Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups mashed bananas
1 cup dried cranberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
Streusel-Nut Topping:
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 16 muffin cups with paper liners.
Combine 2 cups flour, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl.
Combine white sugar, melted butter, and eggs in another bowl; whisk until smooth. Mix in bananas, cranberries, and 1/2 cup walnuts. Fold in flour mixture and mix until a lumpy batter forms.
Spoon batter into lined cups, filling each 3/4 full.
Mix brown sugar and 3 tablespoons flour in a small bowl. Cut in cubed butter with a pastry cutter or two knives until pea-sized crumbles form. Mix in 1/3 cup walnuts.
Sprinkle walnut crumble over batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
