Ingredients:
1/2 lb cooked pinto beans
1 lb. hamburger meat-fried and drained
1 can tomato soup
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Cook pinto beans according to your own recipe. I like mine cooked all day using salt, pepper, minced garlic, and 1 Tblsp. bacon grease, just for the flavor. Then fry and drain hamburger meat. Add to the beans along with regular size can of tomato soup. Let this simmer about 1 hour to allow flavors to marry. I serve this with pan fried potatoes and cornbread.

Description: 
This is a wonderful southern style dish for busy moms as you can cook the beans in the slow cooker while you are at work then just brown the hamburger and add it to the beans with a can of tomato soup. Simple and delicious.
