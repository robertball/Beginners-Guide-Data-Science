Ingredients:
1 cup water
1/2 cup quinoa
1 large carrot, peeled and chopped
1/2 cup broccoli florets
1/4 cup chopped onion
1 (1 inch) piece ginger, peeled, or to taste
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup kale
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup shredded boneless, skinless baked chicken breast
1 cooking spray (optional)
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as SrirachaÂ®), or to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon fresh cilantro, or to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Combine carrot, broccoli, and onion in the bowl of a food processor and chop.
Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add garlic. Stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chopped vegetable mixture from food processor. Cook and stir until onions are translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add kale; cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce and water; cook for 5 minutes more.
Add chicken and 1/4 cup cooked quinoa to the skillet with the vegetable mixture. Cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer stir-fry to a plate.
Spray the skillet with cooking spray and cook eggs to preference, 3 to 5 minutes. Place cooked eggs on top of stir-fry in the plate. Garnish with chile-garlic sauce, cilantro, and sesame seeds.
