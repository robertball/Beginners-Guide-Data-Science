Ingredients:
3 Tbsp cumin seeds
3 Tbsp coriander seeds
3 Tbsp white sesame seeds
1/2 tsp course sea salt
1.5 Tbsp dried thyme
1.5 Tbsp dried oregano
3 Tbsp ground sumac
1 tsp course ground black pepper (not fine ground-it will be too overpowering)
1 tsp red chili flakes (optional)

Directions:
In a cast iron skillet or heavy bottom pan, heat the cumin seeds and coriander seeds over medium heat until fragrant. About 6 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add the salt and toast until dry. About 1-2 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Add sesame seeds until dried. About 4 minutes. Move them around with the back of a metal spoon. If they no longer stick to the back of the spoon, they are ready. Remove from heat.
Once the cumin and coriander seeds are cool to the touch, grind them in a mortar with the cooled salt until they resemble sand. Add the thyme and oregano and crush slightly just enough to help release their flavor and reduce the size of the leaves. Pour into a mixing bowl. Add the cooled sesame seeds, sumac, pepper and chili flakes. Mix well using a wooden spoon. Use immediately or store in a hermetic, glass jar in the cupboard for up to one month.

Description: 
A North African version of this savoury spice blend that is used in cooking meats as well as sprinkled on hummus or labneh. It is also delicious sprinkled in some olive oil for dipping bread or vegetables. I made this version to use for pickling. I have even used it on popcorn for a twist. It is quite versatile and actual ingredients vary not only from region to region, but also from home to home.
