Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
½  yellow onion, chopped
1 stalk celery, sliced
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
2 (32 ounce) cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes, undrained
ground black pepper to taste
1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini
2 cups chopped rotisserie chicken
1 ½ cups fresh spinach, stemmed

Directions:
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute, stirring so that it doesn't stick or burn. Pour in chicken broth and tomatoes. Season with pepper.
Bring soup to a boil. Simmer for 15 minutes. Add tortellini and cook for 5 minutes. Add chicken; simmer until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add spinach; stir until slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
