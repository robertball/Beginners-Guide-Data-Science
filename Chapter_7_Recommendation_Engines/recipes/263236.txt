Description: 
Foil-baked salmon dish with a savory butter, garlic, and lemon sauce that includes dill and capers. 
P.S. I like lots of butter and garlic! For side dishes, we served steamed wild rice and steamed broccolini (with, you guessed it, more butter). Steam the broccolini al dente and then saute in butter till lightly charred. It gives it an awesome light smoky flavor.
