Ingredients:
Topping:
1/4 cup quick-cooking oats
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Muffins:
1 1/2 cups quick-cooking oats
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners.
Stir 1/4 cup oats, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, melted butter, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; set aside.
Whisk together 1 1/2 cups oats, flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
Stir applesauce, milk, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Stir applesauce mixture into flour mixture just until all ingredients are moistened; stir in apple. Spoon apple mixture into prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full; sprinkle oat topping mixture evenly over each muffin.
Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes.
