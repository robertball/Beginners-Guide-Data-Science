Ingredients:
4lbs cut stew meat
2 cans golden mushroom soup
3/4 cup red wine
1 package onion soup mix
1 bunch/8 oz mushrooms, sliced

Directions:
Mix together and put in a large casserole dish--deep enough for bubbling.
Cover with aluminum foil.
Bake at 300 degrees for 4 hours.
Serve over noodles or rice.
Can be made in the slow cooker, but I've found that it isn't quite as tasty

Description: 
This is one of the dishes that my mom made when I was a kid that I absolutely loved.  I had her unearth this recipe a couple of years ago so I could start making it.  It's a perfect cold winter night stew.
