Ingredients:
Cooking spray
1 (8.2 ounce) package Old El Paso速 flour tortillas for soft tacos & fajitas (6 inch)
1 (16 ounce) can Old El Paso速 refried black beans
1/2 cup Old El Paso速 Thick 'n Chunky Salsa
1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely chopped (optional)
1 teaspoon adobo sauce from chipotle peppers (optional)
40 slices turkey pepperoni or pepperoni
1 1/2 cups finely shredded Mexican cheese blend

Directions:
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Spray 2 cookie sheets with cooking spray. Spray both sides of tortillas; place on cookie sheets.  Bake about 3 minutes or until bottoms are slightly crisp; turn tortillas, and rotate pans. Bake 2 to 3 minutes longer or until bottoms are slightly crisp (tortillas will continue to crisp upon cooling). Remove tortillas to cooling rack; let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.
Meanwhile, in medium bowl, mix refried beans, salsa, chipotle chile and sauce.
Spread refried bean mixture (about 3 tablespoons) on each cooled tortilla to within 1/2 inch of edge. Top with pepperoni slices (3 per tortilla) and cheese.
Bake uncovered 6 to 7 minutes or until heated through and cheese is melted. Cut into wedges.
