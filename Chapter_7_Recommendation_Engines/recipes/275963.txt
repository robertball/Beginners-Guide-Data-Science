Ingredients:
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cubed and frozen for 20 minutes
1 pinch kosher salt
4 tablespoons ice water, or more as needed

Directions:
Pulse flour, butter, and salt in a food processor until you have flour-covered pea-sized pieces, about 15 quick pulses. Add water and process until all flour is dampened and dough clumps and almost comes together.
Crisscross 2 long pieces of plastic wrap to form an X and dust with flour. Dump dough into the center and wrap, pressing dough into a 4-inch disk. Smooth wrapped surface with a rolling pin; flip and repeat.
Chill at least 4 hours or preferably overnight, or slip into a zip-top plastic freezer bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in fridge before using.
