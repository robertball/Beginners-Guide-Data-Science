Ingredients:
1 onion, chopped
2 tablespoons margarine
3 potatoes, peeled and cubed
1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce

1 (9 ounce) package frozen green beans
1 (16 ounce) package beef frankfurters, cut into bite size pieces

Directions:
Place the onion and margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Slowly cook and stir until the onion is soft. Mix in the potatoes and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and mix in the tomato sauce, chicken broth, green beans and frankfurters. Simmer 30 minutes, or until potatoes are tender.

Description: 
My mother, Marea Mooney, made this soup for her six children. It is a warm and filling mixture of potatoes, green beans, and frankfurters that's easy to make and perfect for a cold winter day. Adjust ingredients to taste. We all love it; hope you do, too! Serve with salad and warm rolls.
