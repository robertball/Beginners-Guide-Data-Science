Ingredients:
3 lbs. apples (I use Granny Smith,or Cortland)
1 T butter
2 T lemon juice (bottled is fine)
1 c. flour
1 c. oatmeal
1 1/2 c. brown sugar
1-2 sticks of butter-I use 1 stick and it's enough
1 1/2 t. cinnamon
1 t salt

Directions:
Peel and slice apples into a shallow buttered pan or casserole.
Dot with butter and sprinkle with lemon juice.
Cut the rest of the ingredients together as you would a pastry crust dough.  When it is mealy, spread it over the apples.
Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes
