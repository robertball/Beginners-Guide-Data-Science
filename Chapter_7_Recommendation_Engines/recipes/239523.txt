Ingredients:
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
3 tablespoons olive oil
salt and ground black pepper to taste
4 cloves garlic
1/4 cup butter
2 stalks celery
1 leek - split, cleaned, and minced
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
4 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon dried marjoram

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
Put cauliflower florets into a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the cauliflower; season with salt and pepper. Add garlic to the cauliflower and spread onto a baking sheet.
Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes, turn the florets and garlic, and continue roasting until golden brown, about 10 minutes more.
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir celery and leek in hot butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir flour into the celery mixture; cook and stir until flour is heated, 2 to 3 minutes more.
Stream chicken broth into the pot while continually stirring to incorporate. Add cauliflower, garlic, and marjoram to the broth mixture; bring to a simmer and cook until the flavors develop together, about 10 minutes.
Blend soup with an immersion blender to your desired consistency; season again with salt.

Description: 
I absolutely love roasted cauliflower, so I came up with this soup one cold day. You don't even need to add cream to this soup to be completely satisfied with the thick creamy texture the cauliflower adds. Roasting the cauliflower and garlic brings the flavor of it to a whole other level. Double the recipe to assure leftovers, as it tastes almost better the next day for lunch! I serve this soup for lunch or dinner with a good cheesy bread.
 Enjoy!
