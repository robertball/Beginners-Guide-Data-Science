Ingredients:
4 Ripe bananas (mashed)
1 Cups frozen fruit (quartered mango, strawberries, blueberries or raspberries)
1/2 Cup unsweetened applesauce
4 Cups old fashioned rolled oats
1/2 Tablespoon cinnamon
1/4 Teaspoon nutmeg
2 Teaspoons vanilla
1/8 Teaspoon salt

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix all ingredients together in a large mixing bowl until well combined.
Taste to adjust spices and salt.
Spread evenly onto nonstick jelly roll pan or cookie sheet with sides.  If the mixture does not reach across the pan use a thick rolled piece of aluminum foil to close off corners.
Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Cool and cut up into bars.
Store in the refrigerator for up to three days. Additional bars can be stored in the freezer.
