Ingredients:
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced
2 medium green peppers, julienned
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
Hot cooked rice

Directions:
In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch, ginger, soy sauce and vinegar until smooth. Add beef and toss to coat; set aside.
In a large skillet or wok, stir-fry green peppers in oil until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm. Add beef with marinade to pan; stir-fry for 3 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness. Return peppers to pan; heat through. Serve over rice if desired.
