Ingredients:
1 jar-worth of sauce (I prefer to mix half Newman's Own Marinara, and half Classico Italian Sausage)
1 pound cooked and crumbled and drained hamburger
1 teas. garlic powder
1 teas. onion powder
1 teas. oregano
1 to 2 Tablespoons brown sugar

Directions:
*Sauce is best prepared at least a day in advance*
Brown the ground beef and add to a heated saucepan with marinara sauces. Add the rest of the ingredients. Continue to heat the sauce as if you were serving it. Remove the heat and store in the fridge until the meal time to let the flavors soak in.
