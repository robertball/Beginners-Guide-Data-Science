Ingredients:
1 package frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 egg
1/4 cup milk
1 to 2 tablespoons coarse sugar
FILLING:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup milk
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

Directions:
Carefully open each puff pastry sheet. Cut each sheet of pastry at creases, forming 3 strips. Cut each strip widthwise into 7 pieces.
Combine egg and milk; lightly brush egg mixture over pastry. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Place on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 400Â° for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire racks to cool. Split into top and bottom halves.
In a saucepan, combine the flour and milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 1 minute or until thickened. Cool.
Transfer to a bowl; beat in the butter, sugar, vanilla, almond extract and salt until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. Spread or pipe with pastry bag 1 tablespoonful on bottom half of each pastry; replace tops. Store in refrigerator.

Description: 
This recipe is similar to a recipe from my favorite Dutch Bakery in the world. The bakery is Jaarsma bakery in Pella, Iowa... if you ever want to visit Holland but can't afford it, head to Pella, Iowa and definitely visit Jaarsma bakery and Ulrich's meat market.
