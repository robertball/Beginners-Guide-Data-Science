Ingredients:
½ cup honey
⅓ cup soy sauce
¼ cup lime juice
2 cloves garlic, chopped
½ bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed and leaves chopped
4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

Directions:
Whisk honey, soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, and cilantro together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
Grill chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
