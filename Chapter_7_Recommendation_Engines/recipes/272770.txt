Ingredients:
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 bunch scallions, sliced
2 carrots, diced (optional)
1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets
1 (6 ounce) can black olives, drained
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
6 ounces reduced fat feta cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook scallions and carrots until caramelized, about 5 minutes.
Spread out scallions, carrots, cauliflower, and olives on the prepared sheet pan. Season with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix to combine. Crumble feta cheese on top and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoon olive oil.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir vegetables, reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until vegetables are soft and feta cheese has melted, another 5 to 10 minutes.
