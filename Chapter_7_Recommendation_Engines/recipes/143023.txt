Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 onion, chopped
2 large carrots, peeled and chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
4 potatoes, cut in one-inch cubes
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 yellow squash, cut in one-inch cubes
2 cups packed fresh spinach
1/3 cup frozen corn kernels
1 (16 ounce) can pinto beans, drained
1 cup cooked, shredded spaghetti squash (optional)
2 cups vegetable broth
5 cups water
3 (4 ounce) cans chopped green chile peppers

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic, onion, carrots, celery, potatoes, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown, about 10 minutes.
Toss yellow squash, spinach leaves, corn, pinto beans, and spaghetti squash into the pot. Continue to stir until spinach leaves have wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour vegetable broth, water, and green chiles into the mixture. If necessary, add more water to make sure vegetables are covered. Bring stew to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low, cover, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This very filling stew is a delicious way to use up all those leftover veggies in the fridge. Feel free to adjust the amount of green chiles in the stew according to the level of spiciness you prefer.  Serve over cooked rice or with a tortilla.
