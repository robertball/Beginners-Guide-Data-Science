Ingredients:
One jar of Herdez Roasted Pasilla Chile Cooking Sauce
2/3 pound of ground beef
1 small onion, minced
1/3 pound of chorizo
10 corn tortillas, six-inch diameter
Corn or vegetable oil (for cooking tortillas)
2 cups of shredded cheese, Cheddar and Monterrey Jack
Mexican Pouring Cream or Sour Cream
Cilantro to garnish

Directions:
Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees farenheit.
Saute beef until brown and cooked through. Add onion and cook until softened. Set aside.
Crumble chorizo and cook thoroughly. Add two tablespoons of cooking sauce. Mix chorizo mixture with beef and onion mixture. Set aside.
Heat oil in a frying pan. Cook tortillas, one at a time, until slightly blistered and pliable, but not crispy. Drain on paper towells.
While tortillas are warm, fill with meat mixture and a few tablespoons of shredded cheese.
Roll and place in a 10 by 15 inch baking pan, seam-side down.
Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes.
Uncover and sprinkle remaining cheese on top.
Bake until cheese melts.
Warm sauce, and spoon about 1/2 a cup on each plate. Place two to three enchiladas on each plate.
Garnish with chopped cilantro and Mexican pouring cream or sour cream.

Description: 
The spicy meat mixture is complimented by a bold sauce that is spicy, but not hot. Try to find some authentic Mexican pouring cream to balance the flavors.
