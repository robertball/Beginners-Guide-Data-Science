Description: 
The procedure for brittle is very simple, but there are points in the recipe when you have to move fast. Once your sugar mixture has turned a nice caramel color you have to immediately turn off the heat, add baking soda (be careful), add the seeds (be careful), and mix until combined. As the concoction cools it hardens quickly, so transfer into your pan and press as soon as you can (be careful).
