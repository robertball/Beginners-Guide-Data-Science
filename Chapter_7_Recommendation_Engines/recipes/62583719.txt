Ingredients:
1 3.5 oz. bar of dark chocolate
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 cup salted, shelled pistachios

Directions:
Heat about an inch of water in the bottom of a double-boiler.
Break the chocolate bar into pieces and drop into the top of the double-boiler.
Once chocolate is smooth when stirred (about 5 minutes), take it off the heat and stir in the cherries and nuts until evenly mixed.
Drop spoonfuls of the mix onto a baking sheet or plate covered with parchment paper.  Let cool to room temperature, then set in refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to harden.  Enjoy!
