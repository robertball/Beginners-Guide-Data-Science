Ingredients:
1 large chocolate bar, grated, divided
1 (6 ounce) package sliced almonds, chopped, divided
2 cups white sugar
1 pound butter

Directions:
Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Sprinkle 1/2 the chocolate and 1/2 the almonds onto the prepared baking sheet.
Melt sugar and butter together in a stainless steel pan over low heat; increase heat to medium, stirring constantly, until boiling. Heat mixture to 310 degrees F (155 degrees C) or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Pour butter-sugar mixture over chocolate and almonds on baking sheet. Sprinkle remaining chocolate and almonds over butter-sugar mixture. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Break into pieces.
