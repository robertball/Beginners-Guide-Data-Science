Ingredients:
1 Cup Sugar
1/2 Cup Karo Syrup
1 tsp Salt
1 Cup Raw Peanuts, Shelled
1 Tbsp Butter, Unsalted
1 1/2 tsp Baking Soda
1 tsp Vanilla Extract

Directions:
Line baking sheet with wax paper and spray with canola oil spray.
Combine sugar, salt, and Karo in a large (3-4 qt) microwave safe bowl. Stir in the peanuts.
Microwave on high until mixture is a light brown color (8 to 10 minutes) stirring very carefully at least twice during cooking with a clean spoon.
Wearing pit holders, VERY CAREFULLY remove bowl from the microwave and stir in the butter and vanilla, followed by the baking soda (mix will be foamy).
Stir quickly but cautiously to not splatter hot sugar, then pour the mixture onto the wax paper.
Spread thin for brittle candy. Let sit for at least 1 hour or until completely cool.

Description: 
This is one of the few things that I will always make in the microwave instead of on the stove top. Just make sure whatever bowl you use is not only microwave safe, but is large enough to allow your brittle to expand. 

BE CAREFUL when making this! This sugar is hot enough to burn your skin, and will if you aren't completely cautious.
