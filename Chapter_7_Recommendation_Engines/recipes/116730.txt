Ingredients:
2 medium artichokes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 medium lemon, sliced
10 tablespoons butter, melted
2 cloves garlic, minced

Directions:
Rinse artichokes well; trim stems. With scissors, snip 1 in. off the tops. Snip the tip end from each leaf. Brush cut edges with the lemon juice. Spread artichokes leave open. Using a small knife, carefully cut around each center choke. Scoop out and discard the fuzzy centers.
Cut each of the lemon slices into six wedges; place between artichoke leaves. Place artichokes in an 8-in. microwave-safe dish. Combine butter and garlic; pour over artichokes. Cover and microwave on high for 10-12 minutes or until artichokes are tender. Let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with garlic butter from the dish.
