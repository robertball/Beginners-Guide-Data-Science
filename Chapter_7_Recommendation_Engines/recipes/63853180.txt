Ingredients:
1 can (28oz) whole peeled tomatoes, in juice (try to use good quality, perhaps plum tomatoes for sweetness)
1-2 small white or sweet onion, finely diced and minced
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
4 fresh basil leaves, chopped
1.5 tsp dried oregano
Pinch salt
Pinch fresh ground black pepper
Pinch red pepper flakes, optional
Pinch sugar, optional
2 tbsp olive oil (for saut√©)

Directions:
Empty the contents of the tomato can in a mixing bowl and coarsely crush the tomatoes with a fork, potato masher, or your hands, leaving them just a little chunky.
In a heavy bottom 2-quart saucepot, add the olive oil, over a medium high flame and heat a little. Add the onions and saute until slightly translucent. Add the garlic and saute about a minute until golden. Quickly add the crushed tomatoes to the mix. Stir well and bring to a simmer.
Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add the fresh basil and oregano. You can add a touch of sugar or crushed red pepper flakes if desired or if tomatoes are tart. Simmer on a low flame, stirring often for at least 15 minutes. If not using right away, cool down and store in airtight container in the refrigerator, up to 1 week.

Description: 
Very easy recipe for marinara sauce.  Also great on pizza (perhaps use a bit more sugar for pizza).  Very little extra work to double the recipe, so might be a good one to make and freeze for later.  It's even tasty to just dip fresh mozzarella balls into the sauce and eat as-is!
