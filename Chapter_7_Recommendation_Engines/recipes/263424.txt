Ingredients:
1 1/4 pounds cooked pulled pork
1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce
1 (4.5 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers
1/2 cup black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup frozen corn
1/2 medium onion, diced
1/3 cup sliced black olives
1 (15 ounce) package corn bread mix
2/3 cup milk
1 egg
2 tablespoons butter, melted
3 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Combine pulled pork, enchilada sauce, green chile peppers, black beans, corn, onion, and olives in a large bowl.  Spread mixture into a 9x13-inch casserole dish.
Combine corn bread mix, milk, egg, and butter in a separate bowl. Pour over pork mixture. Spread Cheddar cheese on top.
Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and casserole is hot, about 35 minutes.

Description: 
From time to time, I cook a pork shoulder and pull the pork to be used with a few different meals. This is a recipe I came up with that may not be a traditional tamale but the ingredients meet the criteria and it is a filling comfort food. There is no reason why you couldn't substitute shredded chicken or ground beef for the pork.
