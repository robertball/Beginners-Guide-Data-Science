Ingredients:
4 cups shelled edamame (green soybeans)
1 cup chopped napa cabbage
1/2 cup chopped bok choy
1/2 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup sesame oil
1 teaspoon coarse salt
1/2 cup shredded carrots
1 tablespoon black sesame seeds
1/4 cup shredded white daikon radish

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook edamame in the boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and chill in the refrigerator.
Combine napa cabbage, bok choy, vinegar, sesame oil, and salt in a small bowl. Let sit in at room temperature until cabbage is slightly wilted, about 20 minutes.
Stir edamame and carrots into cabbage mixture. Refrigerate until fully chilled, 1 hour.
Top edamame salad with sesame seeds and daikon radish before serving.
