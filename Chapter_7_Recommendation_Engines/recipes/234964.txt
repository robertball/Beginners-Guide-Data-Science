Ingredients:
1 small butternut squash, halved and seeded
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 cup cooked rice
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil
1 egg
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger root
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
salt and ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Directions:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place butternut squash, cut-side up, in a 9x13-inch baking dish; cover with aluminum foil.
Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly. Scoop flesh from butternut squash and transfer to a bowl; mash.
Cook and stir pine nuts in a dry, heavy skillet over medium heat until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir pine nuts, rice, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, egg, ginger root, garlic, salt, and black pepper into mashed butternut squash until evenly combined; shape into patties.
Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat; cook patties, working in batches, until crispy and browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.

I was looking for a way to use left over cooked butternut squash and looked at several recipes for ideas. Put these ingredients together, not sure how it would turn out. It's a keeper!
