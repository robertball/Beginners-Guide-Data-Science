Ingredients:
2 pounds broccoli florets
5 eggs
1 cup whole milk
1 cup creme fraiche
1 cup freshly grated Gruyere cheese
1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup grated Cheddar cheese
salt and pepper to taste
1 cup dry bread crumbs

Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook broccoli until tender but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish with butter.
Meanwhile, combine eggs, milk, creme fraiche, Gruyere cheese, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; whisk together until well combined.
Arrange cooked broccoli in the prepared casserole dish. Cover with egg-cheese mixture and sprinkle with bread crumbs.
Bake in the preheated oven until gratin is brown and cheese is melted, about 45 minutes.

Description: 
This lovely broccoli dish is delicious as a side with grilled meat. You can experiment with different cheeses like Pecorino Romano or feta cheese and the result will be just as good. A nice way to get kids to eat their vegetables, too.
