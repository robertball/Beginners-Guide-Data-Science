Ingredients:
2 cups water
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 cup white sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tsp. rosemary
1/4 tsp. garlic powder (or 2 cloves garlic, minced, if you prefer)
1/3 cup warm water
2 packages (4 1/2 tsp.) active dry yeast
2 eggs
6 cups flour

Directions:
Boil the 2 cups water and pour over the oil, sugar, salt, rosemary, and garlic. Let cool until lukewarm. Dissolve the yeast in the 1/3 cup warm water. Add the dissolved yeast to the cooled water-oil mixture along with the eggs and half the flour.  Stir until smooth.  Then add the rest of the flour and blend until it forms a soft dough.  Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead lightly until dough is less sticky.  Shape dough into 24 equal-sized balls and place onto a greased baking sheet.  It may help to roll dough pieces in flour as you are shaping them into balls, as the dough can be soft and sticky.  Cover rolls with a towel and let rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes.  Bake rolls in a 375 degree oven for 15-20 minutes, until browned and done.  Brush rolls with water twice during baking for a crispy, golden crust.

Description: 
This is an easy variation on simple Italian rolls.  It tastes just as good as the Olive Oil-Rosemary Bread that you can get at the grocery store without all of the expense!  Serve it with Italian dinners for a nice alternative to garlic bread.
