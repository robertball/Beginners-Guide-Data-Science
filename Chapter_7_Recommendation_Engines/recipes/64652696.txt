Ingredients:
2 lbs strawberries (approx. 2 3/4 pints)
1 cup vanilla yogurt
1/2 cup orange juice
1 tbsp. lemon juice
3-4 tbsp. sugar
1/3-1/2 cup coconut cream from can of full fat coconut milk*
1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions:
Add all ingredients to a blender and chop, then liquefy/puree until smooth. For a thicker soup, add more yogurt. For a thinner soup, add more orange juice with another pinch of sugar as needed.
May serve soup immediately but even better chilled for at least 2 hours. Before serving, taste and add additional sugar if desired as the sugar tends to mellow after being chilled.
Garnish as desired with mint, orange zest, and whipped cream.
*1/3-1/2 depending on how much cream is in the can. Refrigerate can of coconut milk for at least 24 hours then it is easy to scoop the cream off the top after it separates. If you want a non-fat soup, eliminate the coconut cream and add extra vanilla yogurt.
