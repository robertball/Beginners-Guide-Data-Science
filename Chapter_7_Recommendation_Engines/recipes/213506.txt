Ingredients:
2 (4 ounce) 1 1/2 inch thick filet mignon steaks
1 tablespoon olive oil
salt to taste
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large shallot, minced
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1/4 cup Chardonnay wine
1/2 pound uncooked shrimp - peeled, deveined, and cut into 3 pieces
1/4 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon butter
salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
Heat a heavy steel or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brush both sides of each filet with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Gently place the filets into the hot skillet, and cook until they start to become firm and are reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Set the filets aside to rest, covered loosely with foil.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet over medium heat until the foam subsides from the butter. Cook and stir the shallot and garlic until tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in the wine, and cook and stir until the wine reduces by half, about 3 minutes.
Stir in the shrimp, cream, 1 tablespoon of butter, and a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and velvety and the shrimp are pink, about 2 minutes.
To serve, place filets on serving plates, and top each with half the shrimp sauce. Sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.

Description: 
I am a big fan of combining steak and seafood. This is a cheaper option than a jumbo lump crabmeat recipe I enjoy as well. Hope you find it tasty.
