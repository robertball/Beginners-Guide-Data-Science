Description: 
I am making an effort to eliminate refined sugar.  This recipe has replaced the packs of overly- sweetened instant oatmeal I ate-thinking that it was healthy.  Now, I make this every Sunday and take it to work for the rest of the week. At less than 100 calories per serving, it feals hearty but keeps me on track.
