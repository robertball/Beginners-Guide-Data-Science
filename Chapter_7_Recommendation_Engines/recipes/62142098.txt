Ingredients:
1 10 ounce package mixed baby greens
2 fresh pears - diced
1/2 cup dried cherries
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/4 red onion - finely chopped
1/3 cup crumbled gorgonzola
Vinaigrette:
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons cherry preserves
salt & pepper to taste

Directions:
Vinaigrette:
Gradually whisk extra virgin olive oil into balsamic vinegar & cherry preserves to emulsify.  Add salt & pepper until preferred taste.
Toss mixed baby greens, pears, dried cherries, pecans, onion, & vinaigrette in a salad bowl.  Top salad with gorgonzola in individual salad bowls in order that cheese does not turn pink from the cherry preserves.
*Note - You can soak chopped red onions in a small amount of water prior to adding to salad to dilute the potency a little.
