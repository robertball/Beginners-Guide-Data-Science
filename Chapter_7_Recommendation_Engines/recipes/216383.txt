Ingredients:
Nonstick cooking spray
1 frozen puff pastry sheet, thawed according to package directions
1/2 cup prepared basil pesto
1 cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese
1 (14.5 ounce) can Hunt’s® Whole Peeled Tomatoes, drained, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
Thinly sliced fresh basil (optional)

Directions:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray; set aside. Unfold puff pastry sheet onto lightly floured surface; roll out to 12-inch square. Crimp edges; place on prepared baking sheet.
Spread pesto evenly over puff pastry. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese; add tomato slices in a single layer. Finish by topping evenly with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
Bake 17 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Garnish with fresh basil, if desired. For small bites, cut into 16 pieces. Serve immediately.
