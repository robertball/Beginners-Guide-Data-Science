Ingredients:
3 pounds beef oxtail
3 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, sliced
1 parsnip, sliced
1 turnip, peeled and diced
2 tablespoons brandy (optional)
6 cups water
1/2 teaspoon dried savory
1 bay leaf
1/2 cup barley
2 ounces dried mushrooms

Directions:
Rehydrate dried mushrooms in hot water for 30 to 45 minutes.  Drain, and slice.
Trim all fat off oxtails.  Spread on a shallow roasting pan.  Roast at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 45 minutes.  Drain off fat, reserving about 2 tablespoons.
Add 1 cup of water to roasting pan in which oxtails were browned.  Heat, stirring constantly, to dissolve browned bit.  Reserve.
In a large stock pot, saute onion, carrots, parsnip, mushrooms and turnip in reserved fat until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add browned oxtails.  Drizzle brandy over the saute.  Ignite.
Pour reserved water and browning over the oxtails and vegetables.  Add remaining 5 cups of water.  Add savory, bay leaf, barley, salt, and pepper.  Bring to boil, and then reduce heat.  Cover, and simmer slowly for 2 hours.  Adjust seasonings.
