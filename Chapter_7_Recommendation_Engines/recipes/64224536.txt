Ingredients:
2 lbs. stew meat, 1 " cubed (I used a London broil)
1/4 C. all purpose flour
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper
2 large carrots, peeled and sliced
1 large celery stalk, sliced
1 med. onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 large russet potato, washed and cut into cubes
2 C. beef broth
1 bay leaf
1 tsp. smoked paprika
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 T. cornstarch

Directions:
Place the cubed stew meat in a bowl and add the flour, salt and pepper to the meat. Using your hands toss the meat to coat with the flour. Place the meat into the bottom of your crock pot. Throw the veggies in the pot along with the broth and seasonings. Put the lid on and cook on high for 6 hours. During the last 30 minutes of cooking time, mix together the cornstarch and some of the liquid (about 1/4 C.) from the pot (whisk well to get all the lumps out)
and stir this into the stew to help thicken it up a little more. Remove the bay leaf before serving.
