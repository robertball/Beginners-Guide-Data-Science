Ingredients:
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
4 boneless pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick
1/3 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1/4 cup sliced red bell pepper
1/4 cup coarsely chopped dry roasted peanuts
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro

Directions:
On a plate, combine the flour, cumin, cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir to distribute the spices. Coat the pork chops with the flour mixture, and shake off any excess.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the pork chops in the hot skillet, and fry for about 4 minutes per side, until cooked through.
While the pork chops cook, stir together the chicken broth, coconut milk, peanut butter, honey, ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Remove the pork chops to a serving platter, and keep warm.
Pour the peanut sauce into the skillet. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes, or until thickened. Pour peanut sauce over the chops, and garnish with green onion, bell pepper, peanuts and cilantro.
