Ingredients:
1 (8 ounce) package BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate
1/2 (8 ounce) container PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened
1 (8 ounce) tub COOL WHIP or COOL WHIP French Vanilla Whipped Topping, thawed
Suggested coatings: powdered sugar, finely chopped PLANTERS Pecans, toasted BAKER'S ANGEL FLAKE Coconut, grated BAKER'S Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, unsweetened cocoa powder, colored sprinkles

Directions:
Microwave chocolate in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 minutes or until chocolate is almost melted. Stir with wire whisk until chocolate is completely melted. Add cream cheese; stir until cream cheese is completely melted and mixture is well blended. Cool to room temperature. Gently stir in whipped topping. Refrigerate 2 hours or until mixture is firm enough to handle.
Scoop chocolate mixture into 1-inch balls with melon baller; place on waxed paper-covered baking sheets. Refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Roll in suggested coatings, working with a few truffles at a time. (Truffles do not need to be perfectly round and smooth--a slightly rough appearance is considered typical.) Store in tightly covered container in refrigerator.
