Ingredients:
1 cup seedless red grapes, halved lengthwise
1 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup sugar
2 Tbl red wine vinegar
1 lb dried strozzapreti pasta (or other small, thin pasta)
3 Tbl olive oil
1.5 pounds Italian sausage (about 4 links, 2 spicy and 2 sweet), casings removed and meat roughly chopped
1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
10 fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped
2 Tbl butter
1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese, plus extra for serving
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 Tbl chopped Italian parsley

Directions:
In a medium bowl, combine the grapes, wine, sugar and vinegar.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap, then refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.
When ready to cook, bring a large saucepan of water to boil and cook pasta, al dente.
Transfer the grape mixture to a medium saucepan over high heat.  Bring to a boil and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
Heat the oilive oil in a large saucepan over medium.  Add the meat and saute until it just starts to brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring and breaking up meat.
Add the onion and continue cooking, stirring well, until the meat and onion have cooked through, about 7 minutes.
Add the sage and stir to combine.
Add the grape mixture and stir well.
Drain pasta but do not rinse.  Add pasta to the pot with the grape and meat mixture.  Place over medium heat for about 1.5 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
Remove pan from heat and add butter, cheese, pepper and parsley.  Sprinkle with more cheese and serve.
