Ingredients:
For the dip:
2 (4 ounce) cans mixed fruit in juice, half drained
1/4 cup canned tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
For the rice balls:
1 (8.25 ounce) can mixed vegetables, no salt added, drained
1 large egg, lightly beaten
1 clove garlic
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups cooked rice (white or brown), warm
1/2 cup shredded cheese
Salt and ground pepper to taste
3/4 cup finely crushed crisp rice cereal
Spray oil for baking*

Directions:
To make the dip:  Puree the mixed fruit, tomato paste and vinegar in a blender or food processor; set aside.
To make the rice balls:  Puree the mixed vegetables, egg, garlic and Worcestershire sauce in a blender or food processor.  Mix with rice, cheese, salt and pepper until completely combined. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F, or heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F.
Scoop tablespoon-size balls of the rice mixture and gently form into balls, rolling them in the crushed rice cereal to coat.
If baking: line a rimmed cookie sheet with foil and spray with oil.  Place balls on the sheet and spray with more oil.  Bake until lightly browned, about 15 minutes.  Cool for 3 minutes.
