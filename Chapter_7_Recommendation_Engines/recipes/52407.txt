Ingredients:
1/2 cup malt vinegar
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 teaspoon mixed spice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom
8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1/2 cup tahini
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper to taste
4 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced
1/2 cup sliced onion
4 cups shredded lettuce
8 pita bread rounds

Directions:
In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt and pepper. Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.
Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.
Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll up, and top with the tahini sauce.
