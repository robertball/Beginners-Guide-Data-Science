Ingredients:
8 ounces spaghetti
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 (12 ounce) package frozen burger-style crumbles
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 cup tomato sauce
1 cup water
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
1 cup kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)

Directions:
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan.  Saute onion until tender.  Mix in burger-style crumbles and garlic; cook until the crumbles have browned.
Stir in tomato sauce, water, chopped tomatoes, vinegar, chili powder, cinnamon, paprika, allspice, light brown sugar, cocoa, and hot sauce.  Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture begins to boil.   Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes until sauce thickens.
While the sauce is thickening, bring a large pot of salted water to boil; place spaghetti in the water and bring it to a boil again. Cook until al dente. Drain well.
Stir beans into the chili and mix lightly.
Spoon cooked spaghetti into bowls and top with chili.  Sprinkle with cheese if desired.
