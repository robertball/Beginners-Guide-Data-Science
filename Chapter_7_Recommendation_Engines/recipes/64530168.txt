Ingredients:
2 Cups AP flour blend (GF)
2 Tsp sugar
1/2 C shortening, cold and cubed
1 egg, beaten
1/2 C ice water

Directions:
Mix the flour and sugar together
Cut in the shortening with pastry blender, it should be crumbly when blended
Mix in the egg, it will still be crumbly
Add water 1 Tbsp at a time until the pastry holds together (you may need to knead with hands to pick up all the crumbs at bottom of mixing bowl)
form into a ball and chill for an hour or until cold and firm
cut ball in half, place one half on sheet of parchment paper and flatten with hand.  cover with a 2nd piece of parchment paper and roll out to 1/8" thickness with rolling pin.  flip pastry over to roll from other side - you may need to lift parchment off of pastry if it starts to stick as this will make rolling easier.
when finished rolling, peel top sheet of parchment off pastry and fold over to place in pie shell (or you can cut out 4" rounds for tart shells - line muffin cups)
once in pie shell, peel off 2nd sheet of parchment and gently fit into pie plate.  Finish as you would any pastry shell.
