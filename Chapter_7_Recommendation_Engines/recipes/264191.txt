Ingredients:
8 reduced-fat vanilla wafers
1 (8 ounce) package 1/3-less-fat cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup white sugar

1 egg
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon lemon extract
1 (16 ounce) can blueberry pie filling, or to taste (optional)

Directions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 8 muffin cups with cupcake liners.
Place 1 wafer in the bottom of each cupcake liner.
Mix cream cheese with 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add egg, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix until batter is smooth.
Fill each wafer-lined muffin cup 1/2- to 2/3-full of batter.
Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 15 minutes. Top each with blueberry pie filling.
