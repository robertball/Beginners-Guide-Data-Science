Ingredients:
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 2 turns of the pan
2 poblano peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
2 pounds ground sirloin
1 medium onion, chopped
3 to 4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tablespoons grill seasoning, a couple of palm fulls
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, eyeball it
2 chipotles in adobo, chopped, plus 1 tablespoon of the sauce
1/2 cup steak sauce (recommended: Peter Luger or A1)
1 cup beer (1/2 a bottle)
1 cup beef stock
1 (28-ounce) can crushed fire roasted tomatoes
1 package corn muffin mix (recommended: Jiffy, made to package directions for corn pancakes, listed on the side of the box)
Softened butter, for greasing a griddle
1 can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 1/2 teaspoons cumin, half a palm full
2 scallions, chopped

Directions:
Heat the extra-virgin olive oil in a medium soup pot over medium high to high heat. When oil smokes, add the sliced poblanos and char them a couple of minutes and scoot them off to the side of the pan and add meat. Break up beef and brown it a couple of minutes then add the onions and garlic. Season the meat with grill seasoning, Worcestershire and chipotles in adobo. Cook until onions are tender, 5 to 6 minutes more, then stir in steak sauce and beer. Cook beer off for 1 minute then add stock and tomatoes and reduce heat to low.
